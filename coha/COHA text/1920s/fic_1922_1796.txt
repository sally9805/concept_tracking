CYTHEREA . JOSEPH HERGESHEIMER For DOROTHY Charming in the present and Secure with the past I It was , probably , Lee Randon realized , the last time he would play golf that year . He concluded this standing on a shorn hill about which the country was spread in sere diminishing tones to the grey horizon . Below , a stream held a cold glimmer in a meadow of brown , frost-killed grass ; and the wind , the bitter flaws where Lee stood , was thinly scattered with soft crystals of snow . He was alone , no one would play with him so late in the season , and there had been no boy present to carry his clubs . Yes , this was the last time he 'd try it until spring : Peyton Morris , who had married Lee 's niece and was at least fourteen years his junior , had been justified in a refusal which , at its expression , had made Lee cross . At worse than forty-five , he had told Morris curtly , he was more active than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Peyton had replied that undoubtedly Lee had more energy than he ; personally he felt as old as  --  as Egypt . Ridiculous , Lee decided , trying to make up his mind whether he might continue playing or return , beaten by November , to the clubhouse . In the end , with numb fingers , he picked up his ball , and walked slowly back over the empty course . The wind , now , was behind him , and increasingly comfortable he grew reflective : The comparison of Peyton Morris 's age with his , recalling the fact , to be precise , of his forty-seven years , created a vague questioning dissatisfaction . Suddenly he saw himself  --  a comfortable body in a comfortable existence , a happy existence , he added sharply  --  objectively ; and the stout figure in knickerbockers , rough stockings , a yellow buckskin jacket and checked cap pulled over a face which , he felt , was brightly red , surprised and a little annoyed him . In the abrupt appearance of this image it seemed that there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had an absurd momentary impression that an act of malicious magic had in a second transformed him into a shape decidedly too heavy for grace . His breathing , where the ground turned upward , was even slightly labored . It was , Lee thought with all the intensity of an original discovery , devilish unpleasant to grow old ; to die progressively on one 's feet , he elaborated the fact . That was what happened to a man  --  his liver thickened , his teeth went , his veins became brittle pipes of lime . Worse than all that , his potency , the spirit and heat of living , met without any renewal its inescapable winter . This might , did , occur while his being was rebellious with vain hope . Today , in spite of the slight clogging of his breath , his body 's loss of flexibility , his imagination was as vigorous , as curious , as ever ... take that nonsense about the doll , which , in a recalled classical allusion , he had privately named Cytherea . Peyton Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of his infrequent trips to New York , had seen it in a confectioner 's window on Fifth Avenue , and instantly it had captivated his attention , brought him to a halt . The doll , beautifully dressed in the belled skirt of the eighteen-forties , wore plum-colored silk with a bodice and wide short sleeves of pale yellow and , crossed on the breast , a strip of black Spanish lace that fell to the hem of the skirt . It was n't , of course , the clothes that attracted him  --  he only grew conscious of them perhaps a month later  --  but the wilful charm , the enigmatic fascination , of the still face . The eyes were long and half closed under finely arched brows , there was a minute patch at the right corner of a pale scarlet , smiling mouth ; a pointed chin marked an elusive oval beneath black hair drawn down upon a long slim neck , hair to which was pinned an odd headdress of old gilt with , at the back , pendent ornamental strands of gold-glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stick with a pig-skin handle hanging from his left arm , he had studied the doll with a deepening interest . Never in life , he told himself , had he seen a woman with such a magnetic and disturbing charm . Fixed in intent regard he became conscious that , strangely , rather than small the figure seemed diminished by a distance which yet left every feature clear . With this he grew satirical at himself ; and , moving resolutely down the Avenue , treated his absorption with ridicule . But the vision of the face , the smile , the narrowed eyes , persisted in his mind ; the truth was that they troubled him ; and within three blocks he had turned . The second view intensified rather than lessened his feeling , and he walked quickly into the shop odorous with burned sugar . The doll was removed from the window  --  it had come from Paris , he learned  --  and , after a single covert glance , he bought it , for , he needlessly informed the girl wrapping it in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction , Helena , who was twelve , had n't been strongly prepossessed ; and the doll  --  though Lee Randon no longer thought of it as merely that  --  left downstairs , had been finally placed on the white over-mantel of the fireplace by the dining-room door . There , when he was alone , he very often stopped to gaze at the figure ; and , during such a moment of speculative abstraction , he had , from the memories of early reading , called her Cytherea . That , Lee remembered vaguely , was the Cytheranian name of the mysterious goddess of love , Venus , of the principle , the passion , of life stirring in plants and men . But in the shape above him it had been strangely modified from an apparently original purpose , made infinitely difficult if not impossible of understanding . His Cytherea bore the traces , the results , of old and lost and polished civilizations ; there was about her even a breath of immemorial China . It mingled with a suggestion of Venice , the eighteenth century Venice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags of discarded reading !  --  and of the rococo Viennese court . This much he grasped ; but the secret of her fascination , of what , at heart , she represented , what in her had happened to love , entirely escaped him . Lee was interested in this , he reassured his normal intelligence , because really it bore upon him , upon the whole of his married life with Fanny . He was n't , merely , the victim of a vagrant obsession , the tyranny of a threatening fixed idea . No , the question advanced without answer by Cytherea was not confined to her , it had very decidedly entered into him , and touched , practically , everyone he knew , everyone , that was , who had a trace of imagination . Existence had been enormously upset , in a manner at once incalculable and clear , by the late war . Why , for example , the present spirit of restlessness should particularly affect the relation of men and women he could n't begin to grasp . Not , he added immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . It had only given him the desire , the safe necessity , to comprehend the powerful emotion that held Fanny and him secure against any accident to their love . To their love ! The repetition , against his contrary intention , took on the accent of a challenge . However , he proceeded mentally , it was n't the unassailable fact that was challenged , but the indefinable word love . Admiration , affection , passion , were clear in their meanings  --  but love ! His brow contracted in a frown spreading in a shadowy doubt over his face when he saw that he had almost reached the clubhouse ; its long steep-pitched bulk lay directly across the path of dusk , approaching from the east ; and a ruddy flicker in the glass doors on the veranda showed that a fire had been lighted . To his left , down over the dead sod and beyond a road , he could see the broad low fa ? ade of his house with its terraced lawn and aged stripped maples . There , too , a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the children 's lessons . * * * * * That cheerful interior he completely visualized : Fanny , in the nicest possible attire , sitting in the curly-maple rocking-chair , her slippered feet  --  she had a premonition of rheumatism  --  elevated on the collapsible stool she carried about with her ; and Helena and Gregory hanging on her knees . Gregory , of course , had tomorrow 's task easily in hand , with another star for a day 's good conduct in school ; but Helena , shining in the gold and flush of her radiant inattention , would know nothing . Helena , Lee Randon acknowledged , spelled atrociously . If it were n't for the clubs and his spiked shoes he 'd turn and go home directly , himself supervise the children 's efforts at education . But Fanny did it much better than he ; Helena and Gregory were closer to her ; while they volunteered endless personal and trivial admissions to her , he had to ask them , detail by detail , what they were doing . After he had changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went up to the main room of the clubhouse , where , on the long divan before the open fire , he found Peyton Morris lounging with Anette Sherwin by a low tea table . The hot water , they informed Lee comfortably , was cold , inviting him by implication to ring for more ; and then they returned to the conversation he had interrupted . Anette said : " I asked her from Friday till Monday , over the dance , you see ; but she wired she could n't be sure . They are going to begin rehearsing at any minute , and then shoot  --  it is shoot , is n't it ?  --  the picture . What did she tell you at the Plaza ? " " The same thing , " Peyton replied moodily . " I only saw her for a scrappy dinner ; she could n't even wait for coffee , but rushed up to a conference with her director . " They were , Lee knew , talking about Mina Raff , a friend of Anette 's earlier summers by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more serious moving pictures . He had met her a number of years ago , in Eastlake , but he retained no clear impression of her ; and , admitting that he had n't gone to see her in a picture , wondered aloud at her sudden fame . Peyton Morris glanced at him , frowning ; he seemed at the point of vigorous speech , then said nothing . " Mina is lovely now , Lee , " Anette spoke in his place ; " you will realize that at once . She 's like a  --  a wistful April moon , or corn silk . " " I like black hair , " Randon asserted . " That 's amusing , when you think Fanny 's is quite brown , " Anette replied . " Whom have you been meeting with black hair ? There 's none I can remember in Eastlake . " " There is n't anybody in particular , " Lee reassured her ; " it is just an idea of mine . " He had a vision of intense black hair swept about an enigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mina Raff must have developed if she gets half the pay advertised . " " She 'll get twice that when this contract expires , " Peyton put in ; " and that will be increased again . No one on the screen can touch her . " He made these declarations in a manner both shadowed and aggressive . Lee observed that he held a cigarette in one hand and a match in the other with no effort at conjunction . " Mina simply tells you everything , " Anette continued . " If she comes you must do your best . It 's perfectly marvelous , with so much else , that she even considers it . I could n't budge her when she was practically free . " " How is Claire ? " Randon abruptly demanded . " She 's all right , " her husband returned ; " a little offhand , but no more than usual . I want her to go to the West Indies and take Ira but she wo n't listen . Why anyone who does n't have to stay through these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log brought out his handsomely proportioned face , the clear grey eyes , the light carefully brushed hair and stubborn chin . Peyton was a striking if slightly sullen appearing youth  --  yet he must be on the mark of thirty  --  and it was undeniable that he was well thought of generally . At his university , Princeton , he had belonged to a most select club ; his family , his prospects , even his present  --  junior partner in a young but successful firm of bond brokers  --  were beyond reproach . Yet Lee Randon was aware that he had never completely liked Peyton . His exterior was too hard , too obviously certain , to allow any penetration of the inevitable human and personal irregularities beneath . It might be possible that he was all of a piece of the conventional stereotyped proprieties ; but Lee could n't imagine Claire marrying or holding to a man so empty , or , rather , so dully solid . Claire he admired without reservation  --  a girl who had become a wife , a mother , with no loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now four years old  --  wholly different from Fanny 's manner with her children  --  was lightly humorous ; publicly she treated her obligations as jokes ; but actually , Lee knew , she was indefatigable . This was a type of high spirits , of highly bred courage , to which he was entirely delivered . Fanny was a perfect mother , a remarkably fine wife , but she bore an evident sense of her responsibilities . She was n't so good-looking as Claire , who at times was almost beautiful ; but Fanny had a very decided kind of attractiveness which Lee Randon wished she would more bring out . She was a little too serious . He did n't actually want her to drink and swear in public , that would n't become her ; but something of that sort , he felt , might help her . At times , when she had had more than her customary cocktail and a half , he saw in her a promise of what he desired . God knew he was n't criticizing Fanny , he hastened to reassure even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all she had brought him  --  the freedom of money and undeviating devotion and their two splendid children ? His house was as absolute in its restrained luxury of taste as was the unfailing attention to his comfort . It was purely for her own happiness that he wanted her to be , well  --  a little gayer . She was already developing a tendency to sit serenely on the veranda of the club through the dances , to encourage others rather than take an active part herself . Expanding in the glow of the fire and hot strong tea he forgot all about his uncomfortable premonitions of age . Now it seemed to him that he had never been younger in the sense of being merely alive ; after the tonic of the cold his nerves were strung like steel , his blood was in a full tide . Lee was aware of a marked sense of pleasure at the closeness to him of Anette ; settling back , she willingly , voluntarily , leaned her firm elastic body against him ; her legs , as evident in woolen stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames . " I 'll meet her , " he heard Peyton say , and realized that they were still talking about Mina Raff . She would n't attract him , Lee Randon , in the least , he was sure of that ... no wistful April moon . What , then , did engage him ? He was unable to say , he did n't know . It was something intangible , a charm without definite form ; and his thoughts returned to Cytherea  --  if he could grasp the secret of her fascination he would be able to settle a great many disturbing feelings and needs . Yes , what she mutely expressed was what , beneath his comprehension , he had come to long for . He had never recognized it as the property of any woman nor satisfied it in himself . Here , certainly , his loyalty , his affection for Fanny , were n't damaged ; he was , he thought , beyond assault there . It was only that , together with his fidelity to his wife , an increasing uneasiness possessed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was searching for something essential , he could n't discover what ; but , dismissing the problem of how he 'd act if he found it , the profound conviction remained that when his hopeful quest was over then indeed he 'd be old , finished , drained . Lee Randon secretly cherished , jealously guarded , that restless , vital reaching for the indefinable perfection of his hidden desire . For a flash it was almost perceptible in Anette , her head half-buried in the darkness of the divan behind the rise and fall of her breasts in a close sweater of Jaeger wool . * * * * * She stirred , smiled at him absently , and , with Peyton 's assistance , rose . The long room , unlighted except for the fire , was lost in obscurity ; the blackness against the window-panes was absolute . Outside , however , Lee found a lingering glint of day ; the snow had stopped , but the wind had increased and was blowing over the open expanse of the course in the high gaunt key of winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful rectangles of orange illumination : he always returned to it with a feeling of relief and pleasant anticipation , but he was very far from sharing Fanny 's passionate attachment to their home . Away  --  on past trips to the Michigan iron ore fields and now on shorter journeys to eastern financial centers  --  he never thought of it , he was absorbed by business . But in that he was n't alone , it was true of the majority of successful men he knew over forty ; they saw their wives , their homes , they thought of their families , only in the intervals of their tyrannical occupations . He , in reality , was rather better there than most , for he occasionally stayed out at Eastlake to play golf ; he was locally interested , active , in the small town of Fanny 's birth . Other men  --  He made a calculation of how much time a practising lawyer saw his wife : certainly he was out of the house before nine  --  Lee knew lawyers who were in their offices at seven-thirty  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours absent daily through the week ; and it was probable that he was in bed by eleven , up at seven  --  seven hours ' sleep ; of the eight hours left in twenty-four half if not two-thirds of the Sundays and some part of the others were devoted to a recreation ; and this took no account of the briefcases brought home , the thought and contributary preoccupations . More than that , his mind , his hopes and planning , were constantly directed toward his legal concerns ; the wife of such a man filled about the position of his golf or billiards . Lee Randon had never analyzed this before , and the result amazed him . With younger men , of course , it was different ; they had more time and interest for their homes , their wives and children . Everything constantly shifted , changed , perished ; all , that was , but the unintelligible spurring need beyond any accomplishment . In him it was almost as though there were  --  or , perhaps , had been  --  two distinct , opposed processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirably illustrated by his private interest in the doll , in Cytherea . Much younger he had been fond of music , of opera and then symphony concerts , and his university years had been devoted to a wide indiscriminate reading : sitting until morning with college men of poetic tendencies , he had discussed the intricacies of conduct in the light of beauty rather than prudence . This followed him shyly into the world , the offices of the Magnolia Iron Works ; where , he had told himself optimistically , he was but finding a temporary competence . What , when he should be free to follow his inclination , he 'd do , Lee never particularized ; it was in the clouds nebulous and bright , and accompanied by music . His dream left him imperceptibly , its vagueness killed partly by the superior reality of pig iron and ore and partly because he never had anyone with whom to talk it over ; he could find no sympathy to keep it alive . That it was n't very robust was evident ; and yet , throughout his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one , in the Magnolia works , knew the difference between the Glucks , Alma and Christopher , nor read anything but the most current of magazines . At intervals Lee had found a woman who responded to the inner side of him , and together they swept into an aesthetic emotional debauch ; but they came inevitably , in the surrounding ugliness of thought and ascribed motives , to humiliating and ugly ends ; and he drifted with increasing rapidity to his present financial and material sanity . What remained of the other was hardly more than a rare accelerated heart-beat at a chord of music like the memory of a lost happiness , or at the sea shimmering with morning . He never spoke of it now , not even to Fanny ; although it was possible that he might be doing her understanding an injustice . Fanny , generally , was a woman in whom the best of sense triumphed ; Fanny was practical . It was she who saw that the furnace pipes were inspected , the chimney flues cleaned before winter ; and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Problems of drainage , of controversies with the neighbors , were instinctively brought to her , and she met and disposed of them with an unfailing vigorous good judgment . A remarkable companion , he told himself ; he had been a fortunate man . She was at once conventional and an individual : Fanny never , for example , wore the underclothes of colored crepe de chines , the elaborate trifles , Lee saw in the shop windows , nightgowns of sheer exposure and candy-like ribbons ; hers were always of fine white cambric , scalloped , perhaps , or with chaste embroidery , but nothing more . Neither did she use perfumes of any sort , there was no array of ornamental bottles on her dressing-table , no sachet among her handkerchiefs , her cambric was not laid in scented flannel . Her dressing , a little severe , perhaps  --  she liked tailored suits with crisp linen waists and blue serge with no more than a touch of color  --  was otherwise faultless in choice and order ; and , it might be that she was wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tall , with square erectly held shoulders . Her face was thin , too , almost bony , and that magnified , emphasized , the open bright blueness of her eyes ; all her spirit , her integrity and beauty , were gathered in them ; her hair was pale and quite scanty . Yes , Fanny 's eyes were her principal attraction , they were forever startling , contrasted with the rest , not only remarkable in shade but , as well , in light ; in her quick unreasoning tempers , the only perceptible flaw of her character , they sparkled with brilliancy . The tempers , Lee decided , descending the narrow stony road from the club- house to his gate , were an unavoidable part of her special qualities : her quick decisiveness , her sharp recognitions of right and her obdurate condemnation of wrong  --  these distinctions were never obscured in Fanny  --  necessitated a finality of judgment open to anger at any contrary position . Aside from that she was as secure , as predictable , as any heavenly orbit ; her love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased ; her usual mood was moulded to his need ; nothing had ever contested the supremacy of his place with her . Lee swung open the white wicket that broke the middle of his border hedge and went up the path over the broad lawn ; the house , an admirable copy of locally colonial dwellings , was a yellow stucco , with a porch on his left and the dining-room at the extreme right . Beyond the porch was the square of the formal garden , indistinguishable at this season , and the garage , the driveway , were hidden at the back . He mounted the broad steps of field stone at the terrace , but , in place of going directly in under the main portico , turned aside to the porch , past the dim bare forms of the old maples . Just as he had anticipated , the glass door showed him Fanny sitting in the maple slatted-back rocking-chair ; Gregory , in blue , was present , but Helena not to be seen . His wife 's hands were lying idly in her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never before noticed , there was a faint troubled doubt on her brow , a questioning expression about her eyes . As he stood momentarily quiet he saw her hands slowly clasp until he felt that they were rigid , and her mouth became pinched ; her face seemed actually hard . Gregory spoke to her , with his fat fingers on her sleeve , but she made no reply , paid no attention to him . Lee could hear Gregory 's demanding voice ; and then , gathering herself , Fanny sighed deeply and smiled at her boy . She was wearing her pearls , her rings sparkled in glittering prisms ; and , as he opened the door , Lee Randon wondered if he had forgotten an engagement to go out for dinner ? * * * * * He asked at once if this were so , but found that they were staying at home . She regarded him still , he realized , a little withdrawn in the abstraction he had surprised . This , because it was so uncommon , disturbed him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . What made you suppose I was bothered ? " Her reply was instinctive ; and then , after a pause , she continued , more insecurely , " I was only thinking about some things .... Lee , " she inquired , " you love me very much , do n't you ? " " Why , of course , " he spoke almost impatiently . " That is all I have , you see , " she admitted ; " and that was what was in my mind . The other women I know are so different ; they seem to have so many more interests than I , and to care less for them than I do for my one . It is exactly as though I belonged before the war and they came afterwards . It is true  --  I am old-fashioned . Well , I do n't care if you do n't ! But , just the same , it 's a problem ; I do n't want to be out of the times or narrow ; and yet I ca n't , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , change . " It would n't be any better if I smoked more cigarettes or drank more gin , that would be silly . " Lee was startled by the similarity of her words to his unformed thought . " No one likes fun better than I do , but the fun now is so different , " her voice had the sound of a wail , " it 's nothing but legs and getting kissed by anybody but your husband . I do n't want other men to kiss me , Lee , only you . And I want you to be glad about that , to care for it more than anything else . You do , do n't you ? " Again she hesitated , and again he assured her , in a species of annoyance , of his feeling . " It 's because I adore you , " Fanny insisted ; " it may be awfully foolish and ark-like to say , but you 're all I want , absolutely . " Her manner grew indignant . " Some women at tea today laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held their husbands ' affections ; actually that , as though it were difficult , necessary ; the details were sickening , and reminded me of that old joke about leaving off your wedding ring . It was all too horrid ! And , underneath , they were bitter and vindictive , yes  --  they were uneasy , afraid of something , of somebody , and treated every good-looking woman as a dangerous enemy . I could n't live like that , I 'd rather die : I told them they did n't trust the men they were married to . " " What did they say to that ? " Lee asked , standing in the door . " Agreed with me . Alice Lucian said I was damned well right she did n't trust hers . She loved him , too , but she did n't propose to take any liberties with the sanctity of her bed . They all thought Claire was a fool to let Peyton see Mina Raff like that in New York  --  the way to avoid trouble was to make sure it could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raff ? She is perfectly stunning , of course , and an actress . " " Not to me , " Lee told her ; then he recalled the prolonged attention to Mina Raff on the divan at the Club . " What if he is crazy about her ? " he observed indifferently ; " it ca n't come to anything . It wo n't hurt Claire if Peyton sits out a few dances with a public idol . " " I should n't think so either , but the others were so positive . I just told them how happy we are together and how devoted you are  --  fifteen marvelous years , Lee . It was plain that they envied us . " She rose and came close to him , her widely-opened candid blue eyes level with his gaze . " Not the slightest atom must ever come between us , " she said ; " I could n't stand it , I 've been spoiled . I wo n't have to , will I , Lee ? Lee , kiss me . " He met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly not , never , " he muttered , extraordinarily stirred . He asserted to himself that he would make no such fatal mistake . The other , the errant fancy , was no more than a vagrant unimportant impulse . " Do n't let these women , who cat around , upset you ; probably they are thinking not so much about their husbands as they are of themselves . I 've seen that Alice Lucian parked out in a limousine during a dance , and she was going right to it . " " It is foolish of me , " Fanny agreed , " and not complimentary to our love . I have kept you so long over nothing that you will be late for dinner . I do n't care ! " Her manner bore a foreign trace of abandon in its radiant happiness ; and , with spread fingers on his back , she propelled him toward the stairs . But , in their room , he failed to change his clothes : he sat lost in a concentration of thought , of summoned determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large windows , both an anomaly and an improvement on the architectural origin , was furnished largely in dull rubbed mahogany , the beds had high slender fluted posts , snowy ruffled canopies and counterpanes stitched in a primitive design . He possessed an inlaid chest of drawers across from the graceful low-boy used by Fanny as a dressing-table ; there was a bed stand with brass-tipped feet , a Duncan Fyfe , she declared ; split hickory chairs painted a dark claret color ; small hooked rugs on the waxed floor ; and , against the mirror on his chest of drawers , a big photograph of Fanny and the two children in the window-seat of the living room . A dinner shirt lay in readiness on the bed , the red morocco boxes that held his moonstone cuff links and studs were evident , but he ignored those provisions for his ease . There was a strange , a different and unaccountable , uneasiness , a marked discomfort , at his heart . The burden of it was that he had a very great deal of which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Fanny , he told himself , as against everything else discoverable , he had the utmost priceless security life could offer . Outside the brightness and warmth and charm of their house the November night was slashed by a black homeless wind . Her sureness , undeniably , was founded on the inalterable strength of her convictions ; against that sustaining power , it occurred to him , the correctness of her beliefs might be relatively unimportant . Could any more be required of a faith than its ability , like a life preserver on water , to hold an individual safe from sinking ? Strangely enough , the one or two greatly powerful men with whom he had come in contact were like Fanny , prejudiced , closed against all opinions contrary to their own , impatient of doubt and self-questioning . Fanny , Lee Randon recognized , was indefatigable in her efforts to form him in her own unassailable mould ; she insisted in the most trivial , and often tiresome , ways , that he should reach and maintain her standards . He had been in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a suspicion of annoyance ; but now , suddenly , it seemed to him that just that , the limitation of Fanny 's determined attitude , was , perhaps , the most desirable thing possible . If it were possible of acquisition ! Such a certainty was n't his naturally  --  those two diverse strains in him again ; but one , he added , had been practically obliterated . The first step in such a course of practical wisdom would be to put Cytherea out of his life , dislodge her finally from his thoughts , and the over-mantel downstairs . This , diplomatically with the doll , he could , of course , do now , whenever he chose . With that , and whatever it represented , accomplished , Lee had a premonition , his life would be secure , placid . The disturbance caused by Fanny 's searching tenderness subsided a little ; and , as it dwindled , the other restlessness , the sense , yes  --  of wasted possibilities and years , once more grew evident . By God , if Fanny insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unreasonable in her not to recognize the same need in him . But Lee was obliged to add the old and familiar and increasingly heavy provision : any individuality of being , of desire , must not be allowed to impair the validity of their common existence , their marriage . Fanny had an advantage over him there , for all her aspirations turned inward to their love , their home and children ; and his ... but if he knew their goal he could have beaten life . * * * * * Footfalls approaching over the hall  --  the maid to tell him dinner was served  --  brought him sharply to his feet , and he hurried down to where Fanny , who liked to do such things , had finished lighting the candles on the table . In reply to the glance of interrogation at his inappropriate clothes he explained that , trivially occupied , he had been unaware of the flight of time . Throughout dinner Fanny and he said little ; their children had a supper at six o'clock , and at seven were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other table . He had an occasional glimpse of his wife , behind a high centerpiece of late chrysanthemums , the color of bright copper pennies and hardly larger ; and he was struck , as he was so often , by Fanny 's youthful appearance ; but that was n't , he decided , so much because of her actual person  --  although since her marriage she had shown practically no change  --  as from a spirit of rigorous purity ; she was , in spite of everything , Lee realized , completely virginal in mind . The way she sat and walked , with her elbows close to her body and her high square shoulders carried forward , gave her an air of eagerness , of youthful hurry . Perhaps she grew more easily tired now than formerly ; her face then seemed thinner than ever , the temples sunken and cheek- bones evident , and her eyes startling in their size and blueness and prominence . She kept , too , the almost shrinking delicacy of a girl 's mind : Fanny never repeated stories not sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity with women who did , he felt , was too extreme . The truth was that she regarded the mechanism of nature with distaste ; Fanny was never lost , never abandoned , in passion  --  Lee Randon had wondered if she regarded that as more than a duty , the discharge of a moral , if not actually a religious , obligation . It was certain that she was clothed in a sense of bodily shame , of instinctive extreme modesty , which no situation or degree of feeling could destroy . He understood , however , that he could not have Fanny as she was , immeasurably fine , without accepting all the implications of her character  --  other qualities , which he might desire , would as well bring their defects . Lee did n't for a second want a wife like Anette . His admiration for Fanny was , fundamentally , enormous . He was glad that there was nothing hidden in his life which could seriously disturb her ; nothing , that was , irrevocable . Which had he been  --  wise or fortunate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate ; and he wondered how she would have met an infidelity of his ? He put his question in the past tense because now , Lee congratulated himself , all the danger was passed : forty-seven , with responsibilities that increased every month in importance , and swiftly growing children ; the hair above his ears was patched with grey . " I do n't like that centerpiece , " Fanny observed , " I ca n't see you . Still , it 's as well , I suppose , since you did n't change . You look so much better in dark clothes , Lee , thinner . " " You should n't make me so comfortable . " " You 'd see to that , anyhow ; men always do . Honestly , Alice Lucian was a scream this afternoon , she said that she hated and distrusted all men ; yet I 'm sure no one could be more considerate or dependable than Warner . Now , if she had a husband like George Willard  --  " " What would you do , " Lee asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ones ? " " I 'd have a doctor see you , " she replied coolly . " What in the world put that in your head ? Have n't you everything here a man could want ? That 's exactly what they were talking about ; it 's so  --  so idiotic . Those younger girls ought to be smacked and put to bed , with their one-piece swimming-suits and shimmying . They give a very misleading impression . " He lost the course of her speech in considering how little of themselves women , old and young , showed each other . If Fanny meant , if she for a moment thought , where the girls they were discussing came in , that there was smoke without fire .... It was all devilish strange , the present day , disturbing . The young men , since the war , had grown sober , and the older men resembled George Willard . The exploding of so much powder , the release of such naked passions , had over-thrown the balance of conduct and pressure . How fortunate , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into the enclosure by the fire-place , where Cytherea was remote in shadow against the chimney , and through the hall to the living room for coffee . His wife placed the portable stool under her feet , and silence enveloped them . At intervals the clear treble of the children 's voices was audible from above , and once Fanny called up for them to be quiet . The room was large , it filled that end of the lower floor , and Lee 's gaze idly rested on the smoke of his cigar , veiling the grand piano in the far corner . There were no overhead lights , the plugs for the lamps were set in the baseboard , and the radiance was pleasantly diffused , warm and subdued : the dull immaculately white paint of the bookshelves on his left , silver frames on a table , harmonious fabrics and spots of color , consciously and sub-consciously spread a restful pattern . In reply to his comment Fanny acknowledged that she had seen the snow ; she hated winter , she proceeded , and thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get away to Cuba and see Daniel . Daniel was Lee 's brother , four years his junior , an administrador of a sugar estancia in the Province of Camag ? ey ; a man who , absorbed in his crops and his adopted Spanish-tropical civilization , rarely returned to the United States . This projected trip to Cuba they had discussed for many Novembers ; every year Fanny and he promised each other that , early in February , they would actually go ; and preparatory letters were exchanged with Daniel Randon ; but it always came to nothing . Either it was impossible for Fanny to leave the children , the house , or the servants , or Lee 's affairs were in need of close supervision . Suddenly it annoyed him to discuss again , uselessly , Camag ? ey ; it had become only a vain pretence , a sustained mirage , of escape from disagreeable days . While it was hot in Cuba , Daniel maintained , the trade wind coming with evening made the nights cool ; it was far more comfortable , summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba , he made it seem , Havana and the colonias of cane , the coast and the interior , was a place with none of the drawbacks of a northern land or society ; there were , certainly , conventions  --  the Spanish were a very punctilious people  --  but they operated in a conveniently definite , Daniel might almost say a sensible masculine , manner . He had not gone into any further detail , but had sunk into his celebrated immobility of expression . Lee , therefore , had drawn his own , natural , conclusions ; he had come to regard Cuba in the same light as that of the early Castilian adventurers  --  an El Dorado , but of freedom rather than gold . A perverse restlessness settled upon him , and he put down his coffee cup abruptly ; the contentment in his surroundings vanished . Lee wanted to be somewhere else , see something different , not so  --  so tranquil , so complacently delivered to the uneventful . Fanny , he told himself resentfully , would be satisfied to sit exactly where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a faint smile . Her face would n't be greatly changed by old age , by death . She was like that , inside and out . Whirling ungracious fancies passed through his brain . He shook his head , and Fanny instantly demanded , " What is it , Lee , what is worrying you ? " Nothing , he replied , but she continued to study him until , giving it up , she turned to the approaching dance ; there would be a dinner at the Club before it , and forty people from out of town had accepted . They must all have a perfect time , she declared . Gregory could be heard laughing , and , with a sense of relief , of escape , he volunteered to go up and see what kept the children roused . He would only make them worse , Fanny observed , he was as fidgety as Helena ; but her tone carried to him her compelling affection . * * * * * The darkened room where Helena and Gregory slept held a cold glimmering whiteness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bareness and two severe iron beds . There was a moment 's stillness as he entered , the scrutiny of two rosy faces framed in blanket and sheet  --  there were no pillows  --  and then there was a delighted vociferous recognition of his presence . " You must sit on my bed , " Helena insisted . " No , mine ! " Gregory cried ; and , as he settled by his daughter , " For every minute you 're there , father , you must sit here . Guess what I have with me . " Lee Randon had no idea , and Gregory produced a willow switch . " That 's for anybody who is n't good . " There was a wriggle down under the blanket , and Lee leaned forward ; " Are those your feet ? " he demanded ; " do you go that far down , are you that tall ? " " Gracious , that 's nothing , " Helena cut in ; " just see where I go . " He discovered that her active toes were almost under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her firm body . In a few years , he thought with a constricted throat , Helena would be grown up , flung into the complex troubles of maturity . However , he knew , life would n't greatly upset her  --  she had a calmness more stolid than Fanny 's together with his own sharpened sensibilities : it was probable that she would marry soon . Gregory was different ; while Helena , in small ways , was unamenable , he was as good as the gold stars he continually got for admirable conduct . He had a deliberate , careful mind and , already , a sense of responsibilities . He spoke slowly , giving the impression that the selection of words was a heavy business ; where Helena 's speech came in careless rushes . Gregory , too , Lee Randon told himself , would not be at a loss later . The two children actually demanded very little from him now beyond the love they took for granted and its obvious return . But , for his part , did he give them much , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deficiency in his sense of parenthood ? He knew men all of whose labor was for their children ; they slaved to have comfortable sums against their children 's futures ; they schemed and talked , often fatuously , for and about their sons and , in lesser degree , daughters . They were , in short , wholly absorbed , no more than parents ; at the advent of a family they lost individuality , ambition , initiative ; nature trapped them , blotted them out ; it used them for its great purpose and then cast them aside , just as corporations used men for a single task and dropped them when their productiveness was over . But he was n't like that , it might well be unfortunately . His personality , his peculiar needs , had survived marriage ; the vague longings of youth had not been entirely killed . They were still potent and still nameless ; they had refused to be gathered into a definition as exact as ambition . Lee had moved to Gregory 's bed , and was holding one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . Perhaps his ambition had vanished when he had left the first plan of his future for the more tangible second : there was n't much in the material industry of iron founding , nor in his present wider activities , to satisfy the imagination . Taking the place of that , he had an uncommon amount of energy , vitality , a force of some kind or other . Whatever he undertook he followed with a full vigorous sweep ; he was successful in convincing a large proportion of the people with whom he dealt that their ends were the same as his ; and here , as well , chance , fate , had been with Lee  --  no one , practically , had lost through a belief in him . His situation today , he wholly and gladly admitted , had resulted from the money Fanny brought him . Until his marriage he had been confined to the Magnolia Iron Works ; of which , it was conceivable , he would in time be manager , maybe , much later , part owner . But , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases , every one of which prospered . He owned or operated or controlled an extraordinary diversity of industries  --  a bottling works for nonalcoholic beverages , a small structural steel plant , the Eastlake daily paper  --  a property that returned forty per cent on his capital  --  a box works , purchased before the war , with an output that had leaped , almost over night , from thousands to millions , a well-known cigarette  --  His energies , forever turning from routine paths and stereotyped preoccupations , took him vividly into countless phases of existence . He had accumulated nearly a million dollars and Fanny 's affairs had benefited greatly ; his administration of her money had been rigid : but  --  for whatever it was worth  --  his wife had , in liberating him from the company of the super-hot cupolas , made it all possible . A fist , now , was softly pounding him ; and Gregory 's voice threatened tears . " What is it ? " Lee Randon asked . " You will have to excuse me , I was thinking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and a half dollar gold-piece finally taken from Gregory by his mother , was broken into by Helena 's irrepressible contempt at his youthfulness . " He thinks the money is gone , " she explained , " because Mother put it in the bank for him . I told him when he got it there would be a lot more , but he just would n't listen to me . No matter what anybody said it was no good . " " Well , " Gregory inquired , " how much more ? " " I do n't know , silly ; but packs . " " Seventy-seven dollars ? " " That depends on how long you leave it in the bank , " Lee instructed him . " If you did n't ask for it for twenty years  --  " " But I want it next Thursday , " Gregory hotly interrupted ; " wo n't it be any bigger then ? " " He does nothing but ask and ask questions , " Helena added . Lee patted Gregory 's cheek : " Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light out your mother will make me go to bed . " There were breathless delighted giggles at the thought of that absurdity . He leaned over his son . " Kiss me ! " Helena cried . " Now kiss me , " Gregory echoed . " Kiss me back again  --  " The light went out with a sharp click , and the room was once more a glimmering darkness , blanched and cold . The ruddy faces of the children , their bright hair , even their voices , were subdued . Fanny , apparently , had n't moved ; the light at her shoulder was reflected in the cut steel buckles of her slippers ; she had slight but graceful ankles . He recognized this , drawing a sheaf of reports from his brief- case ; but , after a perfunctory glance , he dropped them beside him on the floor . " Really , Lee , your condition is getting dreadful , " Fanny observed ; " you are too nervous for words . Go in and look at that doll you brought from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . " A swift concern shadowed her eyes . " Are you doing too much , do you think ? It is n't necessary , you know . We have plenty . I do n't understand why you will go so hard at all those fool concerns of yours . There might be a mortgage on us , from the way you work . " The latter part of her speech he forgot in the calling of his attention to Cytherea . Fanny had said that the doll might tranquilize him . The opposite was more probable  --  Cytherea , what could be more disturbing ? Fanny had n't noticed her smile , the long half-closed eyes , the expression of malicious tenderness , if such a thing were possible , the pale seductiveness of her wrists and hands , the finger nails stained with vermilion . He tried to imagine a woman like that , warm , no  --  burning , with life . It seemed to Lee the doll became animated in a whisper of cool silk , but he could n't invent a place , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly , nor New York ... perhaps Cuba . What a vanity of nonsense his thoughts had led him back into : Cytherea , a thing of wax , was on the over-mantel beyond the hall ; Cuba beyond the sea . The smoke of another cigar , precisely in the manner of the one before , hung between him and the piano . His wife settled contentedly in the curly maple rocker , her rings flashing in the swift drawing of threads from a square of linen . * * * * * Early in the morning Lee Randon drove himself , in a Ford sedan , to a station on the main line of a railway which bore him into the city and his office . It was nine miles from Eastlake to the station , where he left the car for his return ; and , under ordinary circumstances , he accomplished the distance in twenty minutes . The road was good and lay through open rolling country , grazing and farmed land ; he knew its every aspect thoroughly , each hill and turning and old stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flushed petals of the apple blossoms falling on the dark ploughed ground ; yellow with grain ; a sweeping stubble with the corn shocked in which rabbit hunters , brown like the sheaves , called to their dogs . Now it was sombre and , in the morning and evening , wrapped in blue mist ; the air had the thick damp coldness usually precipitated in snow ; the cattle , gathered about the fodder spread in the fields , were huddled against the rising winds . The smoke of a chimney was flattened on a low roof ; and Lee , who had sometimes wished that he were a part of the measured countryside life , had a sudden feeling of revolt from such binding circumstances . He was n't surprised , this morning , that it was difficult to get men to work in the comparative loneliness of the farms , or that farmers ' sons went continually to the cities . When they could n't get there they crowded into their borough towns , into Eastlake , at every opportunity , attracted by the gaiety , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before prohibition they had drunk at the hotel bars , and driven home , with discordant laughter and the urged clatter of hoofs , to the silence of star-lit fields . The buggies had gone ; High Street , on Saturday night , was filled with automobiles ; there was practically no drunkenness ; but there was no lessening in the restless seeking stream of men , the curiosity of the women with folded hands and tightly folded lips . They all wanted a mitigation of a life which , fundamentally , did not fill them ; they had an absorbing labor , love and home and children , the church , yet they were unsatisfied . They were discontented with the primary facts of existence , the serious phases , and wanted , above everything , tinsel and laughter . If a girl passing on the street smiled boldly at such youths they were fired with triumph and happiness ; they nudged each other violently and made brazen declarations which , faced by the girls , escaped in disconcerted laughter . Their language  --  and this , too , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barns . Life , it occurred to Lee Randon , in this connection , was amazingly muddled ; and he wondered what would happen if the restraint , since it was no better than sham , should be swept away , and men acknowledged what they so largely were ? A fresh standard , a new set of values , would have to be established . But before that could be accomplished an underlying motive must be discovered . That he searched for in himself ; suppose he were absolutely free , not tomorrow , that evening , but now  --  Would he go to the office , to the affairs of the Zenith cigarette , and , once there , would he come home again  --  the four thirty-seven train and the Ford in the shed by the station ? Lee could n't answer this finally . A road led over the hills on the right , beyond a horizon of trees . He knew it for only a short distance ; where ultimately it led he had no idea . But it was an enticing way , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never come back any more . Actually he almost cut in , and he had to swing the car sharply to the left . If he had been in trouble or debt , if his life had been a failure , he would have understood his impulse ; but as it was , with Fanny and Helena and Gregory , all his flourishing affairs  --  why , it was insanity ! However , what absorbed him in his present state of mind , of inquiry , was its honesty ; nothing could be served by conventional protests and nice sentiments . Lee had long wanted to escape from life , from the accumulating limiting circumstances . Or was it death he tried to avoid ? What became clearest was that , of all the things which had happened to him , he would not , at the beginning , have deliberately chosen any . One , it seemed , bred by the other , had overtaken him , fastened upon him , while he was asleep . Lee knew a man who , because of his light strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gentlemen 's steeplechases for the great Virginia stables ; a career of racing silk and odds and danger , of highly ornamental women and champagne , of paddocks and formal halls and surreptitious little ante- rooms . That he envied ; and , recalling his safe ignominious usefulness during the war , he envied the young half-drunk aviators sweeping in reckless arcs above the fortified German cities . Or was it , again , only youth that he lamented , conscious of its slipping supinely from his grasp ? Yet , if that were all , why was he rebellious about the present , the future , rather than the past ? Lee Randon was n't looking back in a self-indulgent melancholy . Nor was he an isolated , peculiar being ; yes , all the men he knew had , more or less , his own feeling ; he could think of none , even half intelligent , who was happy . Each had Lee 's aspect of having been forced into a consummation he would not have selected , of something temporary , hurried , apologetic . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had accumulated power beyond measure , millions almost beyond count  --  what extravagantly mad outlets they turned to ! The captains of steel , of finance , were old , spent , before they were fifty , broken by machinery and strain in mid-life , by a responsibility in which they were like pig iron in an open hearth furnace . What man would choose to crumble , to find his brain paralysed , at forty-five or six ? Such labor was a form of desperation , of drowning , forgetting , an affair at best an implied failure . That was the strength , the anodyne , of drink , of cocktails , that they spread a glittering transformation about crass reality ; people danced at stated times , in hot crowded rooms , because life was pedestrian ; they were sick of walking in an ugly meaningless clamor and wanted to move to music , to wear pearl studs and fragile slippers and floating chiffons . " The whole damned business is a mess , " he said aloud . Then , reaching the city , he threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged . Returning over the familiar road , in his small closed car , he was quieter mentally , critical of his useless dissatisfaction ; he was making needless trouble for himself . Small things filled his thoughts , among them the question of how much gin would be consumed by the cocktail party Fanny and he were having before the dinner dance at the Country Club . Peyton and Claire Morris , Anette and , if she came , Mina Raff , with two men , and the Lucians . Perhaps twelve in all ; two quarts . The Country Club dances , principally made up of people who had known each other long and intimately , decidedly needed an impetus ; society was rather dreadful without rum . Anette was an attractive girl ; she had beautiful legs ; but they were hardly better than Fanny 's ; why in the name of God was he captivated by Anette 's casual ankles and indifferent to his wife 's ? Women 's legs  --  they were even no longer hidden  --  were only a reasonable anatomical provision exactly shared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in silk stockings rather than bare , and in black more than bright colors ? Anette 's had never failed to excite his imagination , but Alice Lucian 's , graceful enough , were without interest for him . How stupid was the spectacle of women in tights ! Short bathing skirts left him cold , but the unexpected , the casual , the vagaries of fashion and the wind , were unfailingly potential . Humiliating , he thought , a curiosity that should be left with the fresh experience of youth ; but it was n't  --  comic opera with its choruses and the burlesque stage were principally the extravagances of middle age . * * * * * The orange juice and square bottles of clear gin , the array of glasses and ice-filled pewter pitcher in which Lee mixed his drinks , were standing conveniently on a table in the small reception room . Fanny , in a lavender dress with a very full skirt decorated with erratically placed pale yellow flowers , had everything in readiness . " Mina Raff came , " she announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be quite frank I did n't much care whether she did or did n't . She used to be too stiff , too selfish , I thought ; and I never liked Anette . " " Nothing but prejudice , that , " he replied decidedly . " Anette has a very good head . You have just heard stories from envious women . " He was careful to say nothing about her legs . " I have n't found her the least bit out of the way ; and she thinks a lot of you . " " Bosh , " Fanny said inattentively ; " I know what she thinks of me . I am surprised , Lee , that you do so well , because really you are nothing but an impressionable old fool . " She touched him affectionately on the cheek , " But I can take care of you and Anette too . " He did n't in the slightest wish to be taken care of in the manner she indicated ; yet there was nothing he could answer ; and , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the entrance at the back . It was the Lucians ; and as he greeted them the whole small company swept into the house . Claire , with her narrow dark vivid face , wore diagonals of black and grey , with a long trailing girdle of soft blues and pinks . She came up at once to Lee and kissed him with a warm friendliness . " Have you seen Mina Raff ? " she asked ; " she 's wonderful . " As Claire spoke Lee Randon saw the woman who was becoming such a noted personality . She was slim , neither tall nor short  --  Peyton Morris was removing a voluminous white cloak with dull red stripes and a high collar of fox . He had been wrong in his remembrance of her , for her loveliness was beyond challenge . Yes , a wistful April moon described her very well : Mina Raff was ashen blonde , her face was a very pure oval , and her large eyes , the delicate slightly drooping mouth , held an expression of devastating sweetness . She came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hesitation , and accused him , in a serious low voice , of having forgotten her . That , he returned , was ridiculous , an impossibility . Pictures of her were in all the magazines . Close by her he recognized that the sweetness was far from sugary ; there were indications of a determination that reached stubbornness ; already there were faint lines  --  skilfully covered  --  at the corners of her eyes , and she was palpably , physically , weary . It was that , he decided , which gave her the wistful charm . That and something more . She was considered , he knew , and by the judges best qualified , to have a very sure and perfect talent ; and he had no doubt that that possession stamped and qualified her . He was obliged to attend to the cocktails ; and , at his back , a gay chatter of voices rose . He had fleeting impressions of very different people : a strange man in naval uniform with the insignia of a commander ; Anette in a scanty sheath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a fan ; Alice Lucian sitting on the steps with George Willard : Frank Carver remote and lost in his bitter thoughts ; Elsie Wayland with the gold halo of an income almost a dollar a minute . Mina Raff , with Peyton Morris at her shoulder , smiled at him . " What an adorable house , " she pronounced ; " I wish I could have it near the studio . " She waved Peyton away unceremoniously , " Come , everybody has had enough drinks , and show it to me . " They passed through the hall , and into the quiet of the space beyond , lighted by a single unobtrusive lamp . " What a satisfactory fireplace ! " she exclaimed in her faint key , as though , Lee thought , her silent acting were depriving her of voice . She sank onto the cushioned bench against the partition . " How did they feel , do you suppose  --  the people , the men and women , who belonged to such things ? " As Lee watched her it seemed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long vanished beauty made before his eyes from the shifting firelight and immaterial shadows . Mina Raff lost her reality in an unreal charm that compressed his heart . The atmosphere around her stirred with re-created dead emotions . Then : " Ah ! " she cried softly , unexpectedly , " what a wonderful doll . " She rose , with a graceful gesture of her hands up to where Cytherea rested . " Where did you get her ? But that does n't matter : do you suppose , would it be possible for me , could I buy her ? " " I 'm sorry , " Lee answered promptly ; " we ca n't do without her . She belongs to Helena , " he lied . " But not to a child , " Mina Raff protested , with what , in her , was animation and color ; " it has a wicked , irresistible beauty . " She gazed with a sudden flash of penetration at Lee Randon . " Are you sure it 's your daughter 's ? " she asked , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not yours and you are in love with it ? " He laughed uncomfortably . " You seem to think I 'm insane  --  " " No , " she replied , " but you might , perhaps , be about that . " Her voice was as impersonal as an oracle 's . " You would be better off without her in your house ; she might easily ruin it . No common infidelity could be half as dangerous . How blind women are  --  your wife would keep that about and yet divorce you for kissing a servant . What did you call her ? " " Cytherea . " " I do n't know what that means . " He told her , and she studied him in a brief masked appraisal . " Do you know , " she went on , " that I get four hundred letters a week from men ; they are put everywhere , sometimes in my bed ; and last week a man killed himself because I would n't see him . You 'd think that he had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , with his secretary waiting for him , he .... Why ? " she demanded , questioning him with her subdued magic . " Have you ever cared for any of them ? " he asked indirectly . " I 'm not sure , " she replied , with an evident honesty ; " I am trying to make up my mind now . But I hope not , it will bring so much trouble . I do all I can to avoid that ; I really hate to hurt people . If it happens , though , what can you do ? Which is worse  --  to damage others or yourself ? Of course , underneath I am entirely selfish ; I have to be ; I always was . Art is the most exhausting thing that is . But I do n't know a great deal about it ; other people , who act rather badly , can explain so fully . " From where Lee sat he could see Cytherea ; the unsteady light fell on the gilt headdress , the black hair and the pale disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful walk , waiting , with that wisdom at once satirical and tender , for him . Together , slowly , deliberately , they would move away from the known , the commonplace , the bound , into the unknown  --  dark gardens and white marble and the murmur of an ultramarine sea . He was rudely disturbed by the entrance of Anette and Peyton Morris . " We 're so sorry , " Anette said in an exaggerated air of apology ; " come on away , Peyton . " But the latter told Lee that Fanny was looking for him . " We are ready to go over to the Club ; it 's ten minutes past eight . " Mina Raff gazed up at the doll . " I have an idea the devil made you , " she declared . " You are to go with us , Mina , " Peyton told her ; " if you will get your cloak  --  " The two women left , and Morris demanded : " What was that damned rot about the doll ? " " Miss Raff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lee Randon turned away coldly . " Little girls ca n't have everything they put their eyes on . " Morris muttered , and Lee asked , " What 's that ? " The other failed to reply , but his remark had sounded remarkably like , " She can . " Going , Lee looked back involuntarily : he had n't , after all , imagined Cytherea 's quality , Mina Raff had recognized it , too ; the dance had lost its attraction for him . * * * * * The automobiles started in a concentration of accelerated gasoline explosions , their headlights sweeping across the house and plunging into the farther night . Fanny gathered her wrap closely about her throat . " I 'm cold , " she asserted ; " it was so nice at home , with the children , and plans  --  I intend to take out that yellow rambler and try a climbing American beauty rose there . What a lovely dress of Anette 's ; it must be the one she 's been talking about so much , that Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man 's name who was in the navy , and did you notice his rank ? The officers of the navy are a lot better looking than army men . And Mina Raff , after all did you find her interesting ? " " Quite . She struck me as very intelligent . " He had no wish to repeat the conversation about Cytherea . It was queer , that ; the more he considered it the more significant it appeared to be . " Did it seem to you , " he asked , " that Peyton was very attentive ? " " I did n't have time to notice . Do you think it 's true about her getting all that money ? It looks almost wicked to me , with so many people needing just a little . But anybody could see that she thinks only of herself ; I do n't mean she is n't charitable , but in  --  in other ways . " They were late , and the main floor was being emptied of a small crowd moving into the dining-room . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall to wall ; and , with the scraping of chairs , a confusion of voices , the places were filled . Lee found himself between Bemis Fox , a younger girl familiar enough at the dances but whose presence had only just been recognized , and Mrs. Craddock , in Eastlake for the winter . Anette was across the board , and her lips formed the query , " The first dance ? " Lee Randon nodded ; he was measurably fond of her ; he usually enjoyed a party at which he found Anette . That she liked him was very evident ; not desperately , but enough to dispose of most restraint ; she repeated to Lee what stories , formal and informal , men told her , and she asked his advice about situations always intimate and interesting . The flood of voices , sustained on cocktails , rose and fell , there were challenges down the length of the table and quickly exchanged confidences . Bemis , publicly ingenuous , laid a light eager hand on his arm , and Mrs. Craddock answered a question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wholly characteristic of the club and its members : they had all , practically , known each other for years , since childhood ; meeting casually on the street , in the discharge of a common living , their greetings and conversation were based on mutual long familiarity and recognized facts ; but here , at such dances , they put on , together with the appropriate dress , a totally other aspect . An artificial and exotic air enveloped whatever they did and said  --  hardy perennials , Lee thought , in terms Fanny 's rather than his , they were determined to transform themselves into the delicate and rare flowers of a conservatory . Women to whom giggling was an anomaly giggled persistently ; others , the perfect forms of housewife and virtue , seemed intent on creating the opposite engaging impression ; they were all seriously , desperately , addressed to a necessity of being as different from their actual useful fates as possible . The men , with the exception of the very young and the perpetually young , were , Lee Randon knew , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them who , with opportunity , would not have avoided the dinner as a damned nuisance ; scarcely a man would have put his stamp of approval on that kind of entertainment . It was the women who engineered it , the entire society of America , who had invented all the popular forms of pleasure ; it was their show , for the magnifying of their charms and the spectacle of their gay satins and scented lace ; and the men came , paid , with a good humor , a patience , not without its resemblance to imbecility . Women , Lee continued , constantly complained about living in a world made by men for men ; but the truth of that was very limited : in the details , the details which , enormously multiplied , filled life , women were omnipotent . No man could withstand the steady friction , the inexhaustible wearing , of feminine prejudice ; forever rolled in the resistless stream of women 's ambition , their men became round and smooth and admirable , like pebbles . This , he saw , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had spun him into the center of a silken web  --  " You are not very polite , " Mrs. Craddock said . " Are you a mind-reader , " he replied , " or have n't I heard you ? " " It does n't matter , " she explained , " but you were so far away . " He told her something of what had been in his thoughts , and she rewarded him with a swift speculative interest . " I had n't realized you were so critical about your guinea hen , " she acknowledged . " Well , if what you say is true , what can you do about it ? " " Nothing , " Lee returned non-committally ; " I am comfortable . " This , he instantly decided , sounded unfair to Fanny , and he substituted happy . Mrs. Craddock obviously was not interested in the change . " I get as tired of this as you do , " she asserted abruptly ; " it 's like being on a merry-go-round someone else started and ca n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunes . " " But you must n't forget the chance of catching a gold ring , " he reminded her . " It 's brass , " Mrs. Craddock asserted . The orchestra began in the other room and , though dinner was not over , there were breaks in the table , couples dancing beyond . Anette rose , and Lee Randon , taking her into his arms , swept out from the doorway . " What was she talking about ? " Anette demanded . " You , " he replied experimentally . " I like her ; experience has brought her some wisdom ; and she knows men , too . " " God knows she ought to , " Anette 's face was close to his , and he caught the flash of malice in her eyes . Conscious of the flavor of an acceptable flattery he did n't let this disturb him . " What a marvelous dance , " she proceeded ; " there must be twenty men over . But I like it better when the porch is n't inclosed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that she contrived to make nearly everything she said stir his imagination ? Anette had the art of investing the most trivial comments with a suggestion of license . It was a stimulating quality , but dangerous for her  --  she was past thirty with no sign of marriage on the horizon . He wondered if she really had thrown her slipper over the hedge ? It was n't important , Lee decided , if she had . How ludicrous it was to judge all women , weigh their character , by the single standard of chastity . But this much must be admitted , when that convention of morality was broken it had no more significance than the fragments of a coconut shell . The dance came to an end and they returned to their vanilla mousse , coffee and cigarettes . Some of the men were leaning over the table , drunk and noisy ; a woman 's laugh was shrill , senseless . Senseless ! That , for Lee Randon , described the whole proceeding . He had looked forward to the dance with a happy anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he had come , he was out of key with it . The efforts of the people about him to forget themselves were stiff and unconvincing ; their attitudes were no more than masks held before their faces ; there was n't a genuine daring emotion , the courage of an admitted thrill , to be found . And then , as if to mock his understanding , he saw Peyton Morris with such a desperately white face bent over Mina Raff that he had an impulse to reprove him for his shameless exposure . Instead , he cut in on their dancing and carried her to the other end of the floor . " I do n't know why you did that , " she complained ; " you do n't like me . But you can dance , and with Peyton it 's a little like rushing down a football field . There ! Shall we drop the encore and go outside ? My wrap is on a chair in the corner . " * * * * * " I do n't go to parties , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's account . That was Oscar Hammerstein 's idea  --  he would n't let his actresses even ride in a public car ; he said that mystery was a part of their value , and that people would n't pay to see them if they were always on the streets . Beside , I am tired all the time ; you ca n't possibly know how hard I work ; a hundred times harder than you , for instance . " " I 've been told that about moving pictures . " " The glare of the silver-foil reflectors is unbearable , " she looked up , with a pointed and famous effect . " But you do n't like me ? " " I do ; aside from that , though , I 'm not sure ; probably because you are so remote and cold . " " Thank God ! " she replied . " You have n't stopped to think where I 'd be if I were n't . And yet , no one , in their work , is supposed to be more emotional . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble with me is that I have no life of my own : ever since I was sixteen I 've done what directors told me , for the public ; it is time I had some private feelings . " " It must be a nuisance , " he agreed . Another dance began , but neither of them stirred ; from where Lee sat the long doors were panels of shifting colors and movement . The music beat , fluctuated , in erratic bars . A deep unhappiness possessed him , an appalling loneliness that sometimes descended on him in crowds . Even Fanny , the thought of his children , could not banish it . Above the drum he thought he could hear the sibilant dissatisfaction of the throng striving for an eternity of youth . The glass about the porch , blotted with night , was icy cold , but it was hot within ; the steam pipes were heated to their full capacity , and the women 's painted and powdered faces were streaked  --  their assumption of vitality and color was running from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimace . She had the strange ability of catching his unexpressed thoughts and putting them into words . " Women , " she went on , " spend all their money and half their lives trying to look well , and you 'd suppose they would learn something , but they do n't . " " What do women dress for ? " he demanded ; " is it to make themselves seductive to men or to have other women admire and envy them ? " " Both , " she answered , " but mostly it 's a sort of competition with men for the prize . I 'll tell you something about us if you like  --  we are not made of sugar and spice and other pleasant bits , but only of two : prostitute and mother . Not , of course , separately , or in equal parts ; some of us have more of one , others more of the other . That girl across the table from you is all prostitute , the married woman you were talking to is both , quite evenly divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable eyes . " She stopped his obvious inquiry : " I am an artist , and no one has yet discovered what that is . Do you remember the straw you used to get with a glass of soda water ? You see , often I think I 'm like that , a thing for bright colors to pour through . It 's very discouraging . There is Peyton , and he 'll want to dance . " She rose , slipping out of her cloak . Lee Randon saw Fanny not far away , and he dropped into a chair beside her . " Well , " he asked , " how is it going ? " " It seems all right , " she told him , with one of her engaging smiles . " I was surprised that you talked so long to Mina Raff ; I had the idea you did n't like her . " Women , he reflected , were uncanny . " Three women are just plastered up in the dressing-room , " she continued ; " Sophie Tane ruined her dress completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lee , there are horrid bruises on her arm  --  do you think he is brutal ? " He told her not to bother about the Willards , and then rose to get a chair for Claire Morris . " Peyton is simply fascinated , " Claire asserted lightly . " This Mina ought to have something handsome for giving him such a splendid time . She is a lovely wench , Lee . " " You have it over her like a tent , Claire , " he insisted ; " you 're lovely and human both . " " Thank you , darling ; I 'm human , fast enough , now that the drink is dying . I believe for the first time in my life I am ready to leave a dance before the last flourish of the music . Fanny , we are getting older ; it 's hideous but so . We 're getting on , but our young men are gayer every day . " Fanny Randon 's smile , her expression , were secure . This made Lee restive , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucian . " When this is over , " she informed him , " we 'll get Anette and George , and go out to my car . There is a Thermos bottle of cocktails hidden under the seat . " The girl who had sat at Lee 's right was dancing with a tall fair-haired boy in a corner . Entirely oblivious of the rest of the room , they were advancing two matched steps and then retreating , their eyes tightly shut and cheeks together . A man fell in the middle of the floor , catching his partner 's skirt and tearing it from the waistband . Everywhere the mad effort at escape ! Lee Randon lost his impression of the triviality of the occasion : they all seemed desperately searching for that something he had lost and which was overwhelmingly important to him ; and all the while the music stuttered and mocked and confused a tragic need . Or it was like a momentary release from deadly confinement , a respite that , by its rare intoxication , drove the participants into forms of incredulous cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at light , at color , at the commonplace sounds of a few instruments , as though they were incalculable treasures . Alice , when she danced , held her head back with eyes half closed ; and suddenly , with her mouth a little parted , she , too , had a look of Cytherea , a flash of the withheld beauty which filled him with restlessness . It startled him , and , sub-consciously , his arm tightened about her . She responded immediately , with an accelerated breath , and the resemblance was gone . Greatly to his relief , a man cut in on them , and once more he found himself dancing with Anette . She asked him , in a murmurous warmth , if he liked her , at all . And , with a new and surprising , a distasteful , sense of lying , he replied that he did , tremendously . No , a feeling in him , automatic and strange , responded  --  not Anette ! He wanted to leave her , to leave everyone here , and go . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stay , and go out , drink , in the Lucians ' car . He had a haunting impression , familiar to him in the past weeks , that he was betraying an essential quality of his being . Yet along with this his other consciousness , his interest in Anette , lingered ; it existed in him tangibly , a thing of the flesh , not to be denied . She was all prostitute , Mina Raff had said , using the word in a general sense rather than particularly , without an obvious condemning morality . Indeed , it might easily be converted into a term of praise , for what , necessarily , it described was the incentive that forever drove men out to difficult accomplishment , to anything rather than ease . Good or bad , bad or good  --  which , such magic or maternity , was which ? " What are you thinking about ? " " It would take years to tell you . " " I wish ... you might ; but I did n't mean to say that , to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything , " he broke into her period impatiently . " If we get on together is n't that enough ? It 's really not necessary to hide ourselves behind a lot of pretentious words . And what we feel tonight has n't a thing to do with tomorrow ; probably then we 'll be entirely different ; how can it matter ? " " It does , though , because you might hate me tomorrow for being myself tonight . What you think of me has to be big enough to guard against that . You hurt me , Lee , very much , talking in that way . " * * * * * Alice Lucian , with George Willard , passed them and nodded significantly toward the entrance . " You will need a cloak , " Lee told Anette ; " it 's blowing colder and colder . " She vanished up the stairs , to the dressing-rooms , while Lee stood waiting with Willard . He did n't especially like the latter , a man with an exuberant loud friendliness , a good nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was continually taking hold of feminine arms , bending close over dinner dresses ; and he used  --  with a show of humorous frankness  --  his long knowledge of the girls of Eastlake as a reason for kissing them on every possible occasion . Anette and Alice appeared , with their wraps turned to exhibit the silk linings , bright like their dresses ; and , at a favorable moment , they slipped out into the malice of the wind beating on them from the darkness . Anette was pressed tightly against Lee , Alice and George Willard were vaguely ahead ; and , after a short breathless distance , they were in the protection of the shed . The Lucians ' automobile had an elaborate enclosed body : shutting the doors they were completely comfortable , unobserved and warm . " No , " Alice directed , " do n't put on the light ; I can find it . There ! We 'll have to use the cap for a glass . " The aluminum top of the bottle was filled and refilled ; the frigid gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well- being , irresponsibility . The others had gone to the front seat , where they were squeezed into a remarkably small space . Anette sat leaning forward , her chin propped in her left hand and the right lightly resting on Lee 's knee . A loose board in the shed kept up an exasperating clatter . A match flared and Willard lighted a cigarette . It was curious about Alice  --  only in the last year , and for no reason Lee could discover , had she done things such as this . Perhaps , with no children , and the money Warner had accumulated comparatively lately , she had n't enough to do . Of course , Warner , a splendid individual , could not be called entertaining ; he was totally absorbed in his business , often away at the wood-pulp mill , in the Laurentian Mountains , in which he had a large interest . Warner Lucian had nearly all the principal virtues  --  integrity , generosity , courage , and he was as single in mind as Willard was dubious ; but , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to weary Alice . She was publicly indifferent to him , careless of his wishes ; she had even complained to Lee about her husband 's good conduct , explaining that if he would only have what she termed an affair he would be more human . " I am still very cross at you . " Anette spoke out of a gloom in which her face was barely distinguishable . " You took all the niceness out of our friendship and made it seem horrid ; just as though you had pulled off my clothes ; I  --  I have n't the same feeling about you . " His effort at honesty , at discovering the mystery of profound disturbing needs , had been vain . Gathering Anette in his arms Lee kissed her . She rested there for a moment ; then , with her hands against his chest , pushed him away . " I ca n't , now , " she told him ; " somehow it 's all spoiled . It seemed as though you were studying me disapprovingly . I 'm not just bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are bad at all , " he replied irritably ; " you brought that into it . Why , in the name of heaven , should I ? " " Fanny does n't like me , " she said at a tangent . " Who put that in your head ? " " Fanny . She 's hardly civil . " " If you mean she 's jealous , she is n't . " " You hardly need to add that . Of course , I realize Fanny Randon could n't be jealous of me . Good Lord , no ! Why should she be ? No one would give me a thought . " Anette , wholly irrational , was furious . Damn women , anyway ! It was impossible to get along with them , since they had n't a grain of reason . He was superior to her temper , indifferent to it , because he was indifferent to her . Suddenly the charm she had had for him was gone , the seductiveness dissolved , leaving only Anette , a fairly good-looking girl he had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead ; whatever she had aroused and satisfied , or left in suspense , no longer contented him . The memory of his interest in her , the thought he had expended , was now a cause of surprise , incomprehensible . Lee wanted to return to the club house and Fanny . There was an obscure indication of Alice 's hands raised in the rearrangement of her hair . George Willard half turned , facing the rear of the car . " I ca n't see much , " he said , " but it is evident that you two have been fighting . Why do n't you live in peace and happiness ? The trouble 's all with Lee , too , you do n't have to tell me that , Anette ; he is too cursed cantankerous ; and it would serve him right if you 'd come up here with us . " Anette opened the door and an icy draft swept about their knees . " Not yet , " Willard begged ; " we wo n't be missed . " " You may stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I am going back . " Positively her voice bore a trace of tears . What , what was it all about ? It was Alice who decided that they should return together : " The bottle 's empty , my hair net is fixed for the third time , and we had better . You get out , George , please . No , I told you . " Lee Randon welcomed the solid rushing of the wind ; it swept in full blast across the open of the golf course and made walking precarious . Anette was lost , forgotten . If the chill air could only take the fever , the desire , out of his mind and blood ! He wished that he might be absorbed into the night , the storm , become one with its anonymous force , one with the trees he heard laboring on their trunks . Instead of the safety of being a part of nature he felt that , without directions , he had been arbitrarily set down on earth , left to wander blindly with no knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance measure were audible , and he returned to the pounding music , the heat , the perceptibly chlorinated perfumes and determined activity . He went at once in search of his wife ; she had apparently not moved from the chair in which he had left her . Meeting her slightly frowning , questioning expression he told her simply , without premeditation or reserve , that he had been out in an automobile . Fanny was obviously not prepared for his candor , and she studied him with the question held on her lifted face . Then banishing that she proceeded to scold him : " You know how I hate you to do such things , and it seems precisely as though my wish were nothing . It is n't because I am afraid of how you 'll act , Lee ; but I will not let you make a fool of yourself . And that , exactly , is what happens . I do n't want women like Anette to have anything on you , or to think you 'll come whenever they call you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's so  --  so weak . There simply is n't any other name for it . I do n't doubt you , Lee , " she repeated , in a different , fuller voice , " I know you love me ; and I am just as certain you have never lied to me . I 'm sure you have n't , in spite of what the girls say about men . " He was cut by an unbearably sharp , a knife-like , regret that he had ever , with Fanny , departed from the utmost truth . Lee Randon had a sudden vision , born of that feeling returning from the shed , of the illimitable tranquility , the release from all triviality , of an honesty beyond equivocation or assault . Fanny , in her way , possessed it ; but that , he saw , was made vulnerable , open to disaster , through her love for him . It was necessary , for complete safety , to be entirely insulated from the humanity of emotions . That condition he instinctively put from his thoughts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all his vitality , drew away from a conception , a figure , with the cold immobility of death . After all , he reassured himself , he had never essentially lied to Fanny ; he had merely suppressed some unnecessary details in order to make their existence smoother . The welcome collapse of his small affair with Anette proved the wisdom of avoiding the exaggeration and difficulty of explanations . " Lee , " Fanny said , changing the direction of their thoughts , " I do n't want to bother you , but I am uneasy about Claire and Peyton . He has n't left Mina Raff a minute this evening . And he has such an unhappy expression , not at all as though he were enjoying himself . " " I noticed that , " Lee agreed ; " but it will do him no good with Mina  --  she 's a cold potato , career 's the only thing in her head . " Then he remembered what Mina Raff had told him about her individuality , her personal desire ; and he repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire is entirely wise , " she went on ; " but you ca n't tell her a thing . She listens as sweetly as possible and then says that she wo n't interfere with Peyton . Well , someone else will . Claire has too much reserve , she is too well-bred and quietly superior . You wait and see if I am not right ; life is very vulgar , and it will take advantage of her . " " I wonder if you are ? Well , as you say , we shall see . If Mina Raff fixes her mind on him there will be a lot to watch . " " You must speak to him . " " Now there , " Lee expostulated , " you make me sick . How  --  will you tell me  --  can I speak to Peyton until he first says something ? And when that happens , as easily as not it may be a cable from Peru . You want to interfere too much , Fanny , and insist that everybody follow your idea of right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down on him . Her face was troubled , her lips tightly compressed . " What time is it ? " she asked sharply ; " the ribbon of my watch is worn out . Oh , we can go home with decency . It makes me rather sick here . " He went below , for his hat and coat , and found the room beyond the lockers , built as an informal caf ? before the era of prohibition , occupied by a number of men transferring the balance of fulness from a row of bottles to themselves . He accepted a drink , more for the purpose of considering Peyton Morris , moodily abstracted by the table , than for itself . It seemed to Lee that the young man had actually aged since the cocktail party at his house , earlier in the evening . Peyton 's mouth was hard and sullen ; his brow was corrugated . " We 're going home , " Lee told him ; " and it seemed to me that an hour ago Claire was tired . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and certainly if she 's low we 'll go too . " He rose promptly , and , with his outer garb , accompanied Lee Randon . His step was uncertain , and Lee put a hand under his elbow . " Liquored ? " he asked casually . " Not in my brain , " Peyton Morris returned : " it seems like I could never get drunk again ; but my dam ' feet are all over the place . Thanks for hanging on to me : I have an idea you are going to drop me pretty quickly . " " I do n't want to question you , " Randon said , " or in any way force a confidence , but , Peyton , in addition to the relationship , I am exceptionally fond of Claire ; and , since helping you is practically the same thing as helping her  --  " " I wish to Christ I had been sunk in the North Sea , " Morris broke in bitterly . They were up the stairs and standing on the emptied floor of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about for him . " You 've been an age , " she cried to Lee ; " and , Peyton , Claire is at last looking for you ; although she 'd kill me for saying it . You had better go outside a minute , first , and clear your head . " He came very near to her , slightly swaying . " Fanny , you are a darling , but you are hard ; you are hard as the Commandments . " " That is not very kind , Peyton , " she protested ; " but I have some common sense . " " Have n't you any uncommon sense ? " he begged . " That 's what I want . A little just now might save everything . " " You must try to find out , " she informed him ; " I think I have been successful with Lee ; anyhow he ought to say so . " " I do , " Lee Randon asserted quickly . " Fanny is wonderful . If I 'm of no use go to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered ; " you can have no idea . " " What in the world was he talking about ? " she asked Lee in the automobile . " Peyton is in love with Mina Raff , " he admitted shortly , in a pressure of conflicting emotions . " Lee ! " she exclaimed ; " are you sure ? Did he say so ? That is simply frightful . " " I imagine it 's worse than you realize . " " Do you mean  --  " " Nothing actual yet , " he interrupted her impatiently ; " perhaps nothing you would bother about . But you 'd be wrong . It 's all in his thoughts  --  some damned spoiled ideal , and as dangerous as possible . " " Poor Claire , " she said . " Of course , that 's the thing to say , " he agreed . " The man is always a criminal in such situations . " " You are not trying to defend him ? " she asked quietly . " Maybe I am ; I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peyton was drunk . But , for heaven 's sake , if either of them comes to you do n't just be moral . Try to understand what may have happened . If you lecture them they will leave you like a shot . " Fanny was driving , and she moved one hand from the wheel to his cheek . " It is n't us , anyhow , Lee ; and that is really all I care for . We are closer than others , different . I do n't know what I 'd do if you should die first  --  I could n't move , I could n't go on . " " You would have the children , " he reminded her . " They are nothing compared with you . " It was the only time she had made such an admission , and it moved him profoundly . It at once surcharged him with gratitude and an obscure disturbance . " You must n't pin so much to me , " he protested ; " you ought to think of a hundred other things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is impossible . It is terrible to care for a man the way I do for you ; and that 's why I am so glad you are what you are : silly at times , ridiculously impressionable , but not at all like George Willard , or Peyton Morris . " He had an overwhelming impulse to explain himself in the most searching unsparing detail to Fanny , the strange conviction that in doing it he would anticipate , perhaps escape , grave trouble . Lee Randon realized , however , that he would have to begin with the doll , Cytherea ; and the difficulty , the preposterousness , of trying to make that clear to his wife , discouraged and kept him silent . No woman , and least of any the one to whom he was married , could be trusted to understand his feeling , his dissatisfaction in satisfaction , the restlessness at the heart of his peace . Fanny went up at once , but he lingered , with a cigar , in the living room . A clock struck one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ushers , on a lawn , in the wide flowered hats of summer and identical boutonni ? res , stood on a table against the wall ; and beyond was an early girlish picture of Fanny , in clothes already absurdly out of mode . She had a pure hovering smile ; the aspect of innocence time had been powerless to change was accentuated ; and her hands managed to convey an impression of appeal . He had been , in the phrase now current , crazy about her ; he was still , he told himself strictly . Well , he was ... yet he had kissed Anette ; not for the first time , either ; but , he recognized , for the last . He was free of that ! A space , a phase , of his life was definitely behind him . A pervading regret mingled with the relief of his escape from what he had finally seen as a petty sensuality . The little might , in the sequence , be safer , better , than the great . But he vigorously cast off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness , enveloped Lee and surprised him , startled him really , into sitting forward and attentive . The wind had dropped , vanished into the night and sky : the silence without was as utter as though Lee Randon were at the center of a vacuum . II On Saturday morning Lee telephoned to his office , found nothing that required his immediate attention there and , the brief-case again in evidence , stayed at Eastlake . Fanny , too , with her hair severely plain and an air of practical accomplishment , was occupied with her day book . She kept this faithfully ; but Lee could n't decide whether the obvious labor or her pleasure in the accomplishment were uppermost . She addressed the day book with a frowning concentration , supplementary additions and subtractions on stray fragments of paper , which at times brought him with an offer of assistance to her shoulder . But this she resolutely declined  --  she must , she insisted , maintain her obligation along with his . However , Fanny , like all other women , he thought , was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a symbol : she saw it not as an obligation , or implied power , but as an actuality , pouring from a central inexhaustible place of bright ringing gold and crisp currency . However , Fanny had always been accustomed to the ease of its possession , familiar with it ; and that had stamped her with its superiority of finish . How necessary , he continued , money was to women ; or , rather , to the women who engaged his imagination ; and women were usually the first consideration , the jewelled rewards , of wealth . As he visualized , dwelt on , them , their magnetic grace of feeling and body was uppermost : sturdy utilitarian women in the kitchen , red-faced maids dusting his stairs , heavily breasted nurses , mothers , wives at their petty accounts  --  he ended abruptly a mental period escaping from the bounds of propriety . What he meant , all that he meant , was that beauty should be the main consideration . Lee applied himself to far different values ; and , before he had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the morning about Claire and Peyton , " Fanny told him ; " I do feel that we exaggerated the situation last night ; it all seemed more immediate , bigger , than it will turn out . Heavens , as you said , they ca n't do anything , nothing can happen . " He was still inclined to believe that . " There is a tremendous lot of talk and no result ; yes  --  no one really does a thing . They want to , and that 's all it comes to . " Fanny cast a glance of repressed attention at him across a lower center-piece . " If you could be whatever you wanted , what and where , what would you choose ? " she asked . " Here , with you and the children , " his voice replied without hesitation . The youth of her expression was happily stained by a flush . He meant it , Lee told himself sharply . But about Peyton  --  " Of course , he was drunk last night , and he said nothing conclusive ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed in the war and all the romantic rest . " " It is too much for me , " Fanny decided generally ; " but I am glad that I was young when I was ; being alive was quite simple then . I am comparatively young , Lee , ' way under forty  --  well , two years  --  but you ca n't realize how things have changed in such a short while . The women we knew did n't even smoke then . Was n't it only five or six years ago they were first allowed to in nice caf ? s ? And , not simply that , men did n't , either , when they were with us . We used to go to Cape May ; they called the dances hops ; and do you , oh , do you , remember the bathing suits ? " " I am not so certain about any great change , " he objected . " I seem to recall  --  " " Horrid people will always be horrid ! " she exclaimed . " I knew one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it from now , it was only whispered around and condemned , and it 's shouted out today . I wish I had known you sooner ; I would have done a lot better than your mother . I 'd like to have had you , Lee , as a little boy ; but I suppose you 're enough that yet . " His opposition to Fanny 's maternal manner , directed at him , was stronger than customary ; she seemed to accept in herself every responsibility for him ; as though , whenever his actions were unfortunate , it had been due to her imperfect control . With practically no experience of life , guarded from its threatening aspects , her attitude was that , not without patience , she brought him with relative safety through a maze in which otherwise he 'd be lost . This was evident now in what he felt to be the complacency of her voice and expression ; and a perverse impulse grew in him to combat and shatter her blind satisfaction . Lee subdued this , in the merest decency ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , an outlet for his annoyance in the restlessness of Helena ; and he ordered her from the table . This show of paternal discipline Fanny met with lowered eyes and a silence that endured until Gregory had walked sedately from the room ; then she reminded Lee that he must never , absolutely never , correct his children when he was in an ill temper . " That 's nonsense , " he returned shortly ; " you ought to see that because it 's impossible . Even theoretically I do n't agree with you  --  a child can understand a punishment in which there is some warmth . You are dealing with a little animal and not a reasonable being . " To this Fanny replied that her children were not animals . " Really , Fanny , you do n't know what you are talking about , " he asserted ; " we are all , men and women and children and giraffes , animals . You might look that up in the dictionary . " " I have n't any need to , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If the dictionary says that it is n't a very good one . And if you are trying to tell me that Helena and Gregory are no better than giraffes you 're sillier than usual . " " That is n't in the least what I said , " Lee retorted , with widely separated words . " I was n't speaking of the comparative but of the absolute . It is a fact that we are animals , more responsible and with greater powers than the others , but animals , animals . " " Then what is an animal ? " Fanny demanded . " A mammal . " A marked expression of distaste invaded her . " It has a nasty sound , " she admitted with her instinctive recoiling from life . " I do n't see how we got on this subject anyhow , it 's too much like sex . It seems you are able to discuss nothing else . " " It is only nasty in your mind , " he declared . " That 's exactly like you , you all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must say , but not fair nor true : it was you who got in a wicked temper and sent Helena , who was feeling miserable , away . " " You always say the children are sick when they misbehave . " " I wish I could be as sure of you as I was of that , " she answered quickly ; " for instance , when you go out in automobiles at the dances with women . " " Now , we are beginning , " he told her with emphasis ; " we never had an argument that did n't degenerate into this ; and I 'm sick of it . " " I thought I was the one who was sick of it , " Fanny complained ; " I wonder that I do n't just let you go . " " I wish you would , " he said , rising ; " I give you my word , I 'd rather be damned comfortably than have this endless trouble . " In a position of unassailable quiet behind his papers he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , underneath , he agreed with her opinion about the casual expression of small emotions ; he no longer wanted it any more than she did . Yes , at last they were one there . And yet he felt further from her even than before  --  whatever his marriage had n't satisfied , that he had stilled in minor ways , was now without check . The truth was that it had increased , become more serious , insistent . The tangible facts , the letters and memoranda , before him , retreated and came back to his consciousness . Tobacco worms had been boring through his cigars , and destroyed a third of the box . Helena passed , affecting a grievance out of any proportion to its cause in him . Outside , the country was flooded with a deceptive golden radiance ; and he remembered , suddenly , that Alice Lucian had told him to bring Fanny to the Club and a tea that afternoon , which she was giving for Mina Raff . He repeated this to his wife , in a conciliatory regret at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go she would come over later for him in the car . Lee , standing at a window , thought he would n't ; but , adding that Peyton would be there , he decided that , in view of the possible developments , his presence might be wise . * * * * * The early gloom gathered familiarly in the long main room of the clubhouse ; the fire cast out fanwise and undependable flickering light upon the relaxed figures ; it shone on tea cups , sparkled in rich translucent preserves , and glimmered through a glass sugar bowl . It was all , practically , Lee Randon reflected , as it had been before and would be again . How few things , out of a worldful , the ordinary individual saw , saw  --  that was  --  to comprehend , to experience : a limited number of interiors , certain roads and streets , fields and views . He made his way through life blinded to the customary and unaware of the strange ; summer was hot and winter , usually , cold ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves fell in fall  --  of how much more was he conscious ? It was the same with regard to people ; he , Lee Randon , knew a great many , or rather , he could repeat their names , recognize their superficial features at sight . But to say that he actually knew them  --  that was nonsense ! Why , he was almost totally ignorant of himself . How much could he explain of Fanny 's late state of mind ? She had done all that was possible to make it clear to him ; with little result . Fanny was an extraordinarily honest person ; or , damn it , she seemed to be . He had a reputation for truthfulness ; but how much of what was in his mind would he admit to his wife ? The discrepancy between what he appeared and what he felt himself to be , what he thought and what published , was enormous , astounding . There , as well , was Peyton Morris ; Lee would have sworn that he understood him thoroughly  --  a character as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris seated with Mina Raff on the stairs to the upper floor , beyond the radius of the fire ; and , though they were not ten feet away , he could not hear a word of what they were saying . At intervals there was an indistinct murmur , nothing more . Claire , at Lee Randon 's side , was sitting with her chin high and a gaze concentrated on the twisting flames : talking generally had fallen into a pause . The door from without opened , Fanny entered , and there was a momentary revival of animation . " Is Lee here ? " she demanded ; " but I know he is . The fire is just as attractive at home , yet , even with nothing to do , he 'll hardly wait to give it a poke . Where 's Peyton ? " " On the stairs , " someone answered casually . There was a movement , and Mina Raff approached . " It 's so hot here , " she asserted . " It is warmer out , " Fanny informed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York ? " " I ca n't say , I 'm sure ; but I shall discover tomorrow morning . I have to be back as early as possible . Then  --  work , work , work . " " Mina has been made a star , " Peyton Morris announced . But he stopped awkwardly , apparently conscious of the warmth , the largeness , in his voice . Fanny whispered to Lee that it was quite too outrageous . In return , he asked , " What ? " and , indignant , she drew away from him . The conversation died again . Lee Randon could see Mina Raff 's profile , held darkly against the glow ; her lips and chin were firm . " Where , " Anette asked her , " shall you stay when you get back  --  at Savina Grove 's ? " No , Mina replied , her hours would be too long and uncertain to allow that ; probably she would be at the Plaza . Lee had heard the Groves ' name mentioned before in connection with Mina Raff ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Groves  --  it was the William Loyd Groves  --  were rather important people , financially and socially ; and one of them , yes , that was it , was related to Mina , but which he did n't know . More came back to him : Mina Raff 's parents had died when she was a young girl , and the Groves had rescued her from the undistinguished evils of improvidence ; she had lived with them until , against their intensest objections , she had gone into moving pictures . Probably the Groves ' opposition had lasted until Mina 's success ; or , in other words , their support had been withheld from her through the period when it had been most needed . Yes , the girl had a determined mouth . If he , Lee Randon , had followed his first inclinations  --  were they in the way of literature ?  --  how different his life would have been . Mina Raff had been stronger , more selfish , than her environment : selfishness and success were synonymous . Yet , as a human quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other . Its opposite was held as the perfect , the heavenly , ethics of conduct . To be sacrificed , that was the accepted essence of Christ ; fineness came through relinquishment . He did n't believe it , he told himself fiercely ; something deep , integral , in him revolted absolutely . Mina Raff had been wholly justified ; the very people who had thrown all their weight against her admitted it fully . It was only when such a self-belief was without compensating result , value , that it was wrong . But who could say what any outcome would be ? Some people took the chance and others did n't ; he had not . Then the question came up of whether he had not failed as it was ? No one would agree with him that it might be failure ; he had n't called it that . Suddenly , vehemently , he wished that he could grow old at once , in a second ; anything to quiet the restlessness at his heart . Lee had a conviction that he ought to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that it was of the greatest importance to him ; but for centuries men had considered , without answer , just that . The thing to do was to live , not to think ; for it was possible that those who thought , weighed causes and results , hardly lived at all in the sense he meant . All the people he knew were cautious before they were anything else ; they existed primarily for their stomachs . The widely advertised beauty of self sacrifice was golden only when it adorned like a halo the heads of others . That was natural , inevitable to the struggle for survival ; it did n't answer Lee 's question , which , he felt , was of the spirit rather than the body . " It 's getting late , " Fanny said briskly . There was a general movement , sighs and the settling of skirts . The lights were switched on , and the fire , that had been a source of magic , became nothing more than ugly grey charring logs with a few thin tongues of flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye to Mina Raff ; Fanny 's manner was bright , conventional ; as palpably insincere to the other woman , Lee was certain , as it was to him . He said : " I hope your new picture will go well . " " Thank you , " she responded , her slight hand lingeringly holding his ; " perhaps you will like me better on the screen than in reality . " " Could you tell me which was which ? " She hesitated . " Three months ago , yes , but not now ; I 'm not sure of myself . " " That was positively indecent , " Fanny observed afterward ; " she is as bold as brass . I hope I am not as big a fool as Claire . " " Claire and you are very different , " he told her ; " I have an idea that she is doing whatever is possible . But then we do n't know what we are talking about : it 's fairly evident that Peyton and Mina Raff are interested in each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , what does that mean ? It is n't your feeling for the children or mine for you ; they are both love ; yet what is it ? " " It is God in us , " Fanny said gravely ; " and keeps us all , Helena and Gregory and you and me , safely together . " She seldom spoke to him of religion , but it dwelt closely , vitally , within her , and not as an inherited abstraction or correct social observation , but definitely personal in its intercommunication . Lee Randon had none at all ; and in her rare references to it he could only preserve an awkward silence . That had always been a bar between his family and himself , particularly with the children : he was obliged to maintain an endless hypocrisy about the miracles , the dogmas and affairs , of Sunday school and the church . As a child he had been so filled with a literal Presbyterian imagery that , when a degree of reason discarded figures of speech seen as concrete actualities , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictorial heaven and hell , the loss of eternal white choirs and caldrons of the unrepentant , only earth remained . * * * * * He could recall in gloomy detail his early impression of Paradise : it was a sombre plain floating cloud-like in air , with , doubling through it , an unspeakable sluggish river of blood ; God , bearded and frowning in the severity of chronic judgment , dominated from an architectural throne a throng of the saved in straight garments and sandalled feet ; and , in the foreground , a lamb with a halo and an uplifted cross was intent on the baptism of individuals issuing unaccountably white from the thickly crimson flood . Yet his children , in a modified Episcopalian form , were being taught the same thing : the Mosaic God ; Christ Jesus who took unto Himself the sin of the world ; the rugged disciple , St. Peter and the loving disciple , St. John . The sky , they learned , was the habitation of light- winged angels . The ark was still reported on its memorable voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone , but there was a growing reticence about Jonah . The persistence of such credulity , Lee thought , was depressing ; just as the churches , leaning on the broken support of a charity they were held to dispense , were a commentary on the poverty of the minds and spirits of men . Yes , the necessity of charging Helena and Gregory with such assurances , their rigid bending into mental forms , large and small , in which he had no confidence , put Lee outside the solidity of his family . In the instruction , the influences , widely held paramount in the welding of polite Christian characters , Fanny was indefatigable  --  the piece of silver firmly clasped in the hand for collection , the courtesy when addressed by elders , the convention that nature , birds , were sentimentally beneficent . When Gregory brought out these convictions , lessons , in his indescribably fresh eager tones , Lee listened with a helpless disapproval . Everything , it seemed to Lee Randon , increased the position of self- delusion at the expense of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were real ; with no will , no effort on his part , they invaded his mind ceaselessly . Cytherea 's disturbing charm was real , as definite as Fanny 's quiet actuality . However , he was n't interested in an abstract arraignment of life , but intent only on the truth about himself . Lee wanted to discharge fully his duty to existence  --  in the more inglorious phrase , he did n't want to make a fool of himself  --  and yet it was growing more difficult all the while to distinguish folly from sense . This affair , if it did exist , of Peyton 's with Mina Raff was n't so easily determined as Fanny insisted . Perhaps , like his own , Peyton Morris ' life had been restricted by artificial barriers thrown about the rebellious integrity of his fundamental being . Few children could stand out against the combined forces of the older world ; but it was conceivable that , later , like a chrysalis , they might burst the hard , superimposed skin and emerge triumphant . That damned problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What did children gain who sacrificed their lives for their parents ? It was supposed to bring them nobility ; but , at the same time , did n't it develop in the parents the utmost callous selfishness ; did n't the latter , as their needs were exclusively consulted , grow more exacting , unreasonable ? Was not love itself the most unreasonable and exacting thing imaginable ? Once surrendered to it , the tyranny of a beloved subject was absolute : Lee told himself that the emotion he was considering  --  the most sacred of earthly ties  --  ignominiously resembled the properties of fly paper . He turned abruptly from that graceless thought : it was a great deal warmer , and a mist , curiously tangible in the night , was rising through the bare branches of the maple trees . " I am going to talk to Claire , " Fanny said firmly . " It would do both of you no good , " he informed her ; " besides , you 'll have to take so much for granted . " " Claire will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in their room , preparing for bed ; Fanny , with her hair spread in a thin brown tide over the chaste shoulders of her nightgown , was incredibly like a girl . The mechanical sweep of her hand with a brush kept a brief sleeve falling back from the thinness of her arm . How delicately methodical she was  --  an indispensable quality in the repeated trying contacts , the lost privacy , of marriage . So much depended upon the very elusiveness which the security of possession , habit , destroyed . " This love , " he continued his speculations aloud , " is n't at all understood  --  we are ignorant about it in spite of endless experience and reports and poetry . Take us , " he had one of his dangerous impulses of complete honesty , " before we were married , while we were engaged , we had an impracticable romantic attraction for each other . I know that I thought of you all the time , day and night ; and , just because you existed , the whole world was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were playing continually and I were floating on the finest music . You were like a figure in heaven that drew me up to you . " Well , that lasted quite a while into our marriage ; at first I had an even greater emotion . Then , as Helena and Gregory were born , it changed . " Midway in the brushing of her hair Fanny was motionless and intent . " I do n't say it decreased , Fanny , that it lost any of its importance ; but it did change ; and in you as well as me . It was n't as prismatic , as musical , and there 's no use contradicting me . I can explain it best for myself by saying that my feeling for you became largely tenderness . " " Oh ! " Fanny exclaimed , in a little lifting gasp ; " oh , and that tenderness , " her cheeks were bright with sudden color , " why , it is no more than pity . " " That is n't just , " he replied ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . No , that wo n't do : my affection for you is made of all our experiences , our lives and emotions , together . We are tied by a thousand strings  --  common disappointments and joy and sickness and hope and pain and heaven knows what else . We 're held by habit , too , and convenience and the opinion of society . Certainly it is no smaller than the first , " he argued , but more to himself than to Fanny ; " that was nothing but a state of mind , of spirit ; you ca n't live on music . " " Do n't you think you have said enough for one night ? " she asked , in a calm voice belied by the angry sparkle of her eyes , the faint irrepressible trembling of her lips . " Do you think I want to hear that it is only convention and our neighbors that keep you with me ? You have no right to insist that your horridness is true of me , either . I  --  I could hear music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the little cushioned bench before her dressing table , where her youthfulness took on a piercing aspect of misery . Fanny 's declaration , not far from tears , that she was just as she had always been was admirably upheld by her appealing presence . The tenderness he had admitted , reduced by a perceptive impatience and the sense of having been wholly , wilfully , misunderstood , carried him over to her . He took Fanny , with her face strained away from him , into his arms . " Do n't be an idiot , " he begged softly ; " you ought to be used to my talking by now . Let me go on , it ca n't come to anything  --  " She stiffened in his embrace : " What do you mean by that ? " " Nothing , nothing , " he answered shortly , releasing her ; " where is all that certainty you assured me of ? If you go on like this I shall never be able to tell you my thoughts , discuss problems with you ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has been lately , " she spoke in a metallic voice ; " nothing satisfies you any more ; and I suppose I should have been prepared to have you say things to me , too . But I 'm not ; you might even find that I am not the idiot you suspect . " " I was giving you a chance to prove that , " he pointed out . " Now you have discovered the fatal truth you can save yourself more trouble in the future . " She emphatically switched off a light beside her , leaving him standing in a sole unsparing illumination . Yet in her extreme resentment she was , he recognized , rubbing Vaseline into her finger nails , her final nightly rite . Then there was silence where once he had kissed her with a reluctance to lose her in even the short oblivion of sleep . * * * * * Throughout Monday , at his office , Lee Randon thought at uncomfortable intervals of the late incipient scenes with Fanny . They had quarrels  --  who had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tears that warmly recemented their deep affections . This latter time , however , she had not wept  --  at the point of dissolving into the old surrender she had turned away from him , both in reality and metaphorically , and fallen asleep in an unexpected cold reserve . He was sorry , for it brought into their relationship a definite new quality of difference . He was aware of the thorough inconsistency of his attitude toward their marriage ; again two opposed forces were present in him  --  one , Fanny , as , bound to her , he knew and cherished ; and the other  --  the devil take the other ! He was organizing a new company , and , figuring impatiently , he pressed the button for Mrs. Wald , his secretary . She appeared at once and quietly , her notebook and pencil ready , took a place at his side . " Run this out , please , Mrs. Wald , " and an involved financial transaction followed . What he wanted to ascertain was , with a preferred stock bearing eight per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonus of common , share for share , how much pie would remain to be cut up between a Mr. Hadly , Sanford , and himself ? The woman worked rapidly , in long columns of minute neat figures . " About thirty-four thousand dollars , each , Mr. Randon , " she announced almost directly . " Is that close enough ; or do you want it to the fraction ? " " Good enough ; send Miss Mathews in . " Almost anyone on his staff , Lee reflected , knew more about the processes of his business than he did ; he supplied the energy , the responsibility of the decisions , more than the brains of his organization ; and it perfected the details . The stenographer , Miss Mathews , was very elaborately blonde , very personable ; and , dictating to her , Lee Randon remembered the advice given him by a large wielder of labor and finance . " Lee , " he had said , touching him with the emphasis of a finger , " never play around with an employee or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a man of eccentric humors , and  --  like all individuals who supported heavy mental burdens , inordinately taxed their brains  --  he had his hours , unknown to the investing public , of erratic , but the word was erotic , conduct . On more than one occasion he had peremptorily telegraphed for Lee to join him at some unexpected place , for a party . Once , following a ball at the Grand Opera House , in Paris , they had motored in a taxi-cab , with charming company , to Calais . During that short stay in France John Partins had spent , flung variously away , four hundred thousand dollars . The industrious , the clerks , efficient women like Mrs. Wald , the middle-aged lawyers in his office , were rewarded ... by a pension . It was all very strange , upside down : what rot that was about the infinite capacity for taking pains ! He supposed it would n't do to make this public , the tritest maxims were safer for the majority ; but it was too bad ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathews : " You 're not thinking of getting married , are you ? Because if you do I 'll have your young man deported ; I simply wo n't let go of you . " " I do n't see any signs of it , Mr. Randon , " she replied , half serious and half smiling ; " my mother thinks it 's awful , but I 'm not in any hurry . There are men I know , who might like me ; they show me a very good time ; but somehow I am not anxious . I guess in a way it 's the other married girls I see : either they housework at home , and I could n't be bothered with that ; or they are in an office and , somehow , that seems wrong , too . I want so much , " she admitted ; " and with what clothes cost now it 's terrible . " " Moralists and social investigators would call you a bad girl , " he told her ; " but I agree with you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as you are able . You 're not a bit better in a kitchen than you are here , taking dictation from me ; and I am not sure you would be more valuable at home with a child or two . You are a very unusual stenographer , rapid and accurate , and you have a good mind in addition to your figure . Why should you lose all that at once , give it up , for the accidents of cholera infantum and a man , as likely as not , with a consumptive lung ? " " But what about love , Mr. Randon ? That 's what throws me off . Some say it 's the only thing in life . " " I 'm damned if I know , " he admitted , leaning back from his wide flat- topped desk . " I hear the same thing , and I am rather inclined to believe it . But I have an idea that it is very different from what most people insist ; I do n't think it is very useful around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty hat than with a dishpan . If you fall in love go after the thing itself , then ; do n't hesitate about tomorrow or yesterday ; and , above all else , do n't ask yourself if it will last ; that 's immaterial . " " You make it sound wild enough , " she commented , rising . " The wilder the better , " he insisted ; " if it is not delirious it 's nothing . " The road and countryside over which he returned in the motor sedan , partly frozen , were streaked by rills of muddy surface water ; the sky , which appeared definitely to rest on the surrounding hills , was grey with a faint suffusion of yellow at the western horizon . It was all as dreary , as sodden , as possible . Eastlake , appearing beyond a shoulder of bare woods , showed a monotonous scattering of wet black roofs , raw brick chimneys , at the end of a long paved highway glistening with steel tracks . Lee Randon was weary , depressed : nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recompense for the misfortune of having been born . He left his car at the entrance of his dwelling ; Christopher , the gardener , came sloshing over the sod to take it into the garage ; and , within , he found the dinner-table set for three . " It 's Claire , " his wife informed him ; " she called up not half an hour ago to ask if she could come . Peyton was away over night , she said , and she wanted to see us . " He went on up to his room , inattentive even to Claire 's possible troubles . He dressed slowly , automatically , and descended to the fire-lit space that held Cytherea in her mocking , her becoming , aloofness . In the brightly illuminated room beyond the hall Helena and Gregory were playing parchesi  --  Gregory firmly grasped the cup from which he intently rolled the dice ; Helena shook the fair hair from her eyes and , it immediately developed , moved a pink marker farther than proper . " You only got seven ! " Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that safety . " " What if I did ? " she returned undisturbed . " I guess a girl can make a mistake without having somebody yell at her . Your manners are n't very good . " " Yes , they are , too , " he asserted , aggrieved ; " I have to tell you if you move to a safety where you do n't belong . " He shook the dice from the cup . " Now , see there  --  that just brings me to your man , and I can send him home . " " I do n't care , " Helena informed him ; " it 's a young sort of game , anyhow . Now I 'm wearing waists and buttoned skirts I 'd just as leaves write a letter to Margaret West with no boys in it at all . " She left the parchesi board , and crossed the room to the piano , where she stood turning over sheets of music with a successful appearance of critical interest . Gregory , silently struggling with the injustice of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was going to beat her , " he said , " I was almost home , and she went away . She just got up like nothing was happening . " Helena put in , " Neither there was . " Lee Randon took her place . " You can beat me instead , " he proposed . His interest in the game , he felt , was as false as Helena 's pretended musical preoccupation ; but he rolled the dice and shifted the counters , under Gregory 's undeviating scrutiny , with the conviction that parchesi was not conspicuously different from the other more resounding movements of the world and its affairs . Gregory easily vanquished him , and Lee rose with a curt , unwarranted nod of dismissal . * * * * * Freezing cocktails in the pewter pitcher , in the repetition of minor duties which , Lee Randon thought , now constituted four-fifths of his life , he told himself that Claire Morris had never looked better : she was wearing a dress of a soft negative blue material , high about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her darkly vivid personality . Claire had a slim low-breasted figure , gracefully broad shoulders ; and her face , it might be because of its definite , almost sharp , outline , held the stamp of decided opinions . Claire 's appearance , he recognized , her bearing , gave an impression of arrogance which , however , was only superficially true  --  she could be very disagreeable in situations , with people , that she found inferior , brutally casual and unsympathetic ; but more privately , intimately , she was remarkably simple-hearted , free from reserve . She was related to Lee through her father , a good blood , he told himself ; but her mother had brought her a concentration of what particular vigorous aristocracy  --  an unlimited habit of luxury without the responsibility of acknowledged place  --  the land afforded . The drinks had been consumed , the soup disposed of , when Claire said abruptly , " Peyton is going to leave me . " Although , in a way , Lee had been prepared for such an announcement , the actuality upset him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waitress , leaving the dining-room ; at any conceivable disaster , he reflected , Fanny would consider the proprieties . " When did he tell you ? " Fanny demanded . " He did n't , " Claire replied ; " I told him . It was a great relief to both of us . " " Say what you like outside , " Lee put in vigorously ; " but at least with us be honest . " " I am , quite , " she assured him ; " naturally I do n't want Peyton to go  --  I happen to love him . And there 's Ira . But it was an impossible position ; it could n't go on , Peyton was absolutely wretched , we both were ; and so I ended it . I laid out all his best silk pajamas so that he 'd look smart  --  " " How can you ? " Fanny cried ; " oh , how can you ? It is too wicked , all too horrible , for words . I do n't think you are advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . It 's perfectly amazing to me , after the men you have met , that you do n't know them . You must keep them going in the right direction ; you ca n't let them stop , or look around , once ; I only learned that lately , but it is so . They have n't an idea of what they want , and they try everything . Then if you let a man go he is the first to blame you ; it 's like winking at murder . " " How could I keep him when he did n't want to stay ? " Claire asked wearily ; " I am not too moral , but I could n't quite manage that . Then what you say might do for some men , but not Peyton . You see , he has always been very pure ; all his friends at Princeton were like that ; they were proud of it and very severe on the other . And afterwards , when he went into the city , it was the same ; Peyton would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , but , as he said , he was off women . The stage door , it seems , is very old-fashioned now . " When we were engaged , and he told me that he was really pure , I was simply mad with happiness . I thought it was such a marvelous thing for a girl to find . I still think that ; and yet , I do n't know . If he were different , had had more experience , perhaps this would n't have hit him so hard . He would have kissed his Mina on the porch , outside the dance , and come home . " " As for that Raff woman  --  " Fanny stopped , at a loss for a term to express her disgust . " Why not ? " Claire asked . " She wanted Peyton and went after him : he is n't for her art , I believe , but for herself . I have n't talked to her ; I ca n't make up my mind about that . Probably it would do no good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her anything about draughts and stomach bands . " " Claire , you 're utterly , tragically wrong , " Fanny wailed . " I wish I could shake sense into you . Up to a point this is your fault ; you are behaving in a criminally foolish way . " " What do you think Claire should do ? " Lee asked his wife . She turned to him , a flood of speech on her lips ; but , suddenly , she suppressed it ; the expression , the lines , of concern were banished from her face . " There is so much , " she replied equably ; " they have n't discussed it enough ; why , it ought to take a year , two , before they reached such a decision . Peyton ca n't know his mind , nor Claire hers . And Ira , that darling innocent little child . " " Damn Ira ! " Claire Morris exclaimed . " You must n't , " Fanny asserted ; " you 're not yourself . Mina Raff should be burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice had the hard cold edge of fanatical conviction . " If she had come into my house making trouble .... But that could n't have happened ; I 'd have known at once . " " You are more feminine than I am , " Claire told her . " I see this in a very detached manner , as if it did n't concern me . I suppose I ca n't realize that it has happened to us . It has ! But if you are right , Fanny , and it 's necessary to treat a man like a green hunter , then this was bound to occur . I could n't do anything so  --  so humiliating ; he could bolt sooner or later . I did the best I knew how : I was amusing as possible and always looked well enough . I never bothered Peyton about himself and encouraged him to keep as much of his freedom as possible . " I do n't believe in the other , " she said to Fanny Randon in a sharp accession of rebellion ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I wo n't put up with it . If he wants to go , to be with Mina Raff , how in God 's name can I stop it ? I wo n't have him in my bed with another woman in his heart ; I made that clear to you . And I ca n't have him hot and cold  --  now all Mina and then the sanctity of his home . I 've never had a house of that kind ; it was christened , like a ship , with champagne . " I have never cared for domestic things . I 'd rather wear a dinner-gown than an apron ; I 'd a damn sight rather spin a roulette wheel than rock a cradle . And , perhaps , Peyton wanted a housewife ; though heaven knows he has n't turned to one . It 's her blonde , no bland , charm and destructive air of innocence . I 've admitted and understood too much ; but I could n't help it  --  my mother and grandmother , all that lot , were the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated sham and sentimentality ; they asked , and gave , nothing . " Fanny , it was evident , was growing impatient at what was not without its challenge of her character and expressed convictions . " I do agree with you , Claire , that we are not alike , " she admitted . Her voice bore a perceptible note of complacency , of superior strength and position . " Just last week I was telling Lee that I belonged before the war  --  things were so different then , and , apparently , it 's only in my house they have n't changed . We are frightfully behind the times , and you 'd be surprised at how glad we are . It was your mother 's father , was n't it , who fell in love with the Spanish woman while he was in the Embassy at Seville ? My family were n't people of public connections , although a great-aunt married Senator Carlinton ; but they had the highest principles . " " They were lucky , " Claire Morris replied indifferently ; " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as what happens to it . Anyhow , Peyton is going away with Mina Raff , and I am sorry for him ; he 's so young and so certain ; but this has shaken him . Peyton 's a snob , really , like the rest of his friends , and Mina 's crowd wo n't have that for a moment : he ca n't go through her world judging men by their slang and by whom they knew at college . I envy him , it will be a tremendously interesting experience . " If her eyes were particularly brilliant it was because they were surrounded by an extreme darkness . Her voice , commonly no more than a little rough in its deliberate forthrightness , was high and metallic . She gave Lee the heroic impression that no most mighty tempest would ever see her robbed of her erect defiance . It was at once her weakness and strength that she could be broken but not bent . * * * * * After dinner Claire , who was staying with the Randons until tomorrow , played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet elevated above the possible airs of the floor , continued to draw threads from the handkerchiefs she was making for Christmas . Claire played very well and , at five cents a point , he had to watch the game . On a specially big hand she piqued and repiqued . " That , " she declared , " will pay you for caputting me . " The jargon of their preoccupation , " A point of six ; yes , to the ace ; paid ; and a quatorze , kings , " was the only sound until Fanny rose , decidedly . " I am going to bed . " She hesitated at the door . " I hope you 'll be comfortable , Claire : I had some club soda and rye put in your room , since you like it so well . Do n't be too late , please , Lee ; it makes you tired starting so early in the morning . " " You 'll have to forgive me , " Claire said , when Fanny had gone ; " but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think any more of men , now ? " " Heavens , yes . I wish I could find someone to blame for what has happened , Peyton specially , but I ca n't , not to save my life . It seems so hopelessly inevitable . I do n't want you to suppose I 'm not unhappy , Lee ; or that I care only a little for Peyton . I love him very much ; I needed him , and my love , more than I can explain . As Fanny as good as told me , I am a wild bird ; anything , almost , with what is behind me , may happen . It was just the irony of chance that this affair caught Peyton , the immaculate , instead of me . I was awfully glad that I had an anchor that seemed so strong ; in my own faulty way I adored everything I had ; I wanted to be tranquil , and it had a look of security . " " It is n't over , Claire , " Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " " Please do n't bother him ; and it 's too much to drag out the moralities on my account . " " Moralities ! " he echoed indignantly , " who said a word about them ? I 'm not interested in morals . Lord , Claire , how little you know me . And as for bothering him , he 'll have to put up with that . He has invited a certain amount of it . " They forgot the game and faced each other across the disordered cards . " If I wo n't argue with him , " she insisted , " you ca n't . But we need n't discuss it  --  he wo n't listen to you , Peyton 's all gone . I never saw such a complete wreck . " " He ca n't avoid it , " Lee went on ; " I 'll have to do it if it is only for myself ; I am most infernally curious about the whole works . I want to find out what it 's about . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has n't had enough experience to express it . You might do better with me . " " No , I want it from the man ; a woman 's feeling , even yours , would do me no good . You see , this has always been explored , accounted for , condemned , written about , from the feminine side . Where the man is considered it is always in the most damnable light . If , in the novels , a man leaves his home he is a rascal of the darkest sort , and his end is a remorse no one would care to invite . That may be , but I am not prepared to say . No , dear Claire , I am not considering it in preparation for anything ; I want to know ; that 's all . " " The books are stuff , of course , " she agreed . " The grandfather of mine who was killed in Madrid  --  it was n't Seville  --  must have had a gorgeous time : a love affair with one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was found out and ended ; and his wife and he had been sick of living together . After it was over she was pleased at being connected with such a celebrated scandal ; it made her better looking by reflected loveliness . She was rather second class , I believe , and particularly fancied the duchess part . " " It would n't be like that in the current novels , or even in the better : either your grandparent or the duchess would be a villainous person , and the other a victim . I 'm inclined to think that most of the ideas about life and conduct are lifted from cheap fiction . They have the look of it . But that realization would n't help us , with the world entirely on the other side . " " No , it is n't , " Claire objected ; " and it 's getting less so all around us . Perhaps men have n't changed much , yet ; but you do n't hear the women talk as I do . I do n't like them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; but they are gathering a lot more sense in a short while . " " I do n't agree with you there , " he replied ; " you are getting your own infinitesimal world confused with the real overwhelming majority ; you have n't an idea how it feels and , in particular , of what it thinks of you , smoking and gambling and damning your fate . It may be largely envy  --  personally I am convinced it is  --  but they have you ticketed straight for hell just the same . " " It does n't interest me . " Claire increasingly showed the strain , the unhappiness , through which she was parsing . Nor did it him , he ended lamely , except in the abstract . This at once had the elements of a lie and the unelaborate truth ; he could n't see how his curiosity applied to him , and yet he was intent on its solving . The fixed mobile smile of Cytherea flashed into his thoughts . His perpetual restlessness struck through him . His attitude toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had determined what , exactly , he would say to Peyton . Yet , as a fact , he returned to his former assertion to Fanny ; the boy would make it difficult , if not impossible , to discuss such intimate relationships . And as Claire had pointed out , the very openness of Peyton 's life would make him exceptionally far to reach ; he was particularly youthful in his hardness , his confidence in his acts and friends and beliefs ; yet all that could n't help but be upset now . " Fanny will think I have designs on you , " Claire remarked ; " go up when you like . I am not a bit sleepy . " Lee had no intention of going to bed then , and told her so . It seemed to him that , perhaps , with Claire , he might discover something that would set his questioning at rest . Vain delusion . He asked what her plans were : " I 'll stay in Eastlake for the winter , and , in March , go to Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived a while at Arcetri ; it 's very lovely . " He had a momentary experimental vision of a small yellow villa among the olives of the Florentine hills , of crumbling pink walls with emerald green lizards along the stones , of myrtles and remarkable lilies-of-the-valley . Twenty years ago it would have drawn him irresistibly ; but not now ; he wanted  --  where his wants were articulate  --  a far different thing . It had nothing to do with Italy , or any other country ; his intentness had been withdrawn from the surfaces of life , however charming ; they had plunged into the profounder mysteries of being . Lee had gained nothing if not a certain freedom from exterior circumstance ; his implied revolt against trivialities , if it did no other good , had at least liberated him from the furniture of existence . However , it had begun to appear that this was not an unmixed blessing ; he had the uncomfortable sensation of having put out , on a limitless sea , in a very little boat too late to arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discovering that she was cold , he insisted on her going upstairs . " To my pure sheets , " she said , with a touch of her familiar daring . Left alone , Lee was depressed by the hour ; the room , his house , seemed strange , meaningless , to him . There was a menace in the unnatural stillness ; Fanny 's unfinished handkerchief , her stool , were without the warmth of familiar association . It might have been a place into which he had wandered by accident , where he did n't belong , would n't stay . It was inconceivable that , above him , his wife and children were sleeping ; the ceiling , the supine heavy bodies , seemed to sag until they rested on his shoulders ; he was , like Atlas , holding the whole house up . It was with acute difficulty that he shook off the illusion , the weight . From outside came the thin howling of a dog , and it , too , seemed to hold a remote and desperate interrogation . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches , with the Morrises constantly in his mind ; and what , in the slightest dislocation of reality , was dream and what waking he could n't determine ; at times his vision seemed to hold both  --  a door , the irrevocable door , swung open , the end impended , but he was unable to see the faces of the man and woman ; when he looked anxiously a blind spot intervened . The morning found him unrefreshed , impatient ; and he was glad that his early breakfast was solitary ; Lee did n't want then to see either Claire or Fanny , he was in no mood to discuss Peyton 's seizure . That , it seemed to Lee Randon , was exactly what had happened to the younger man  --  Peyton had gone within the region of a contagious fever that had run through all his blood . Yet , at dinner , to his surprise , Fanny said very little about what had entirely occupied their thoughts ; she was quiet , reserved ; her attitude was marked by a careful dignity . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . " I had a wretched night , too , " she told him ; " my head is like a kite . I 've thought and thought until my brain aches , it is so full . But there are some things I decided ; and if you do n't agree with them I 'm sorry ; because , Lee , I am right , I am indeed . " " Of course you are , " he replied ; " but , possibly , only for yourself . I mean , for instance , that you ca n't be sure you 're right for Claire . " " No , no , that 's just the same as saying there is n't any right or wrong at all , and you know better . Yes , what I am certain about is duty ; you must do that before everything else . Peyton 's duty is to Claire and their child . It is as clear as this soup . Nothing else matters so much , or at all . Why , Lee , the world is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to know , would become of it if they did n't ? You do n't seem to realize it , but there are loads of obligations I get dreadfully tired of , like the Social Service when it is my month to follow the accounts , and visits to Annie Hazard who has a cancer of the stomach and is dying , and thinking every day what to get you and the children and the servants to eat . Suppose , some morning , I did n't stir , but just rested in bed  --  what would happen ? What did happen last winter when I had pleurisy ? Why , the whole house went to pieces , and , when you were n't worrying about me , while I was getting well , you were the most uncomfortable man imaginable . I do n't want you to think I am complaining , or that I do n't love every minute and stick and stone of my home and life ; I do . But you seem to forget about me ... that 's because the house goes along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to live with some other woman for a while . " " I 'm sure every word is so , " he returned ; " no one could have a better wife ; you 've spoiled me outrageously ; I feel like that pig Christopher has in a pen out by the stable . " " You might think of something nicer to say , " she protested . " You 're not easy to live with , either , " Fanny continued ; " you hardly ever agree with what other people think ; and you curse fearfully . I wish you would n't swear like that , Lee . I object to it very much in Claire ; I ca n't help believing that she thinks it is smart or funny . And you encourage her . If Claire had been different  --  no , do n't interrupt me  --  this would never have happened . You may say what you like about her good breeding : she 's been too flippant . I felt that last night . Claire does n't accept her obligations seriously enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the whole thing . " " What is the whole thing ? " he demanded . " I 've told you , but you wo n't listen  --  duty . " " You put that above all the rest ? " Fanny hesitated . " I said my head hurt because I 've thought so much . Love and duty , yes ; I see them as the same . Duty without love would be hard , and there is n't any love without duty . " Fanny evidently grew aware of her threatening incoherence . " It is n't necessary to tell you in so many words , " she said defensively ; " you are only being contrary . " " You have explained yourself beautifully , " he hastened to assure her ; " I am the person who is at sea . " " Why , Lee ! " she exclaimed , surprised ; " I do n't know anyone who is so decided . That 's what makes me raging , you 're so dogmatic . There , that is a splendid word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I can see from here . " She rang . " Varney , " Fanny addressed the maid , " take Mr. Randon 's apple out and see if there is n't another better done , please . I warned you about that ; he ca n't eat them uncooked . " " Let me keep it , " he protested ; " it might have an excellent effect on my disposition . " " Do n't interfere , Lee , " she responded coldly : " yes , Varney . It 's really idiotic of you , " she turned to him ; " you are not a boy any more , you 're not even a young man , and you ca n't take liberties with your digestion . You are quite like Helena with her prayers  --  if she feels very well she 's apt to forget them , but if she 's sick she says them as hard as possible . I wish she were like Gregory . " " Gregory and you are cut out of the same gold cloth , " Lee Randon pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fanny radiated happiness . " No one could say anything prettier to his old wife . " Dinner was over , and , rising , she walked around the table and laid a confident arm on his shoulders . The knife-like tenderness which , principally , he had for her overwhelmed him ; and he held Fanny against him in a silent and straining embrace . For that reason he was annoyed at himself when , sitting through an uneventful evening , his simile of the pig , enormously fat , sleepily contented , in its pen , returned to him . It was n't that he found an actual analogy between the pig and life , individuals , on a higher plane , so much as that he was vaguely disturbed by the impression that there was an ultimate similitude between him , Lee Randon , and a fattened somnolence of existence . After all , were his individual opinions and doubts expressed in a manner forceful enough to diversify him from a porcine apathy ? The pig , secure against the inequalities of fate and weather , wallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the solar course . Christopher was his wife . Now that , Lee told himself , with a vision of the gardener 's moustache , sadly drooping and stained with tobacco , his pale doubtful gaze , was inexcusable . He abruptly directed his thoughts to Peyton and Claire Morris ; how exact Claire had been in the expression of her personality ! What , he grasped , was different in her from other women was precisely that ; together with an astonishing lack of sentimental bias , it operated with the cutting realism of a surgeon 's blade . She had , as well , courage . That was the result of her heritage ; and he wondered if all strong traits were the action of superior blood strayed into expected and unexpected places ? It was probable , but not susceptible of proof . The pig 's blood was that of the best registered Berkshire . God damn the pig ! He asked Fanny if she had heard any further particulars of the proposed rearrangement of the Morrises ' lives ; when they were to separate ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't come here , " she said vigorously : " I should refuse to speak to him or have him at my table . Outrageous ! I ca n't make out why you take it so coolly . Mina Raff 's a rotten immoral woman ; it does n't matter how it 's arranged . Why , " she gasped , " she can be no more than Peyton 's mistress , no better than the women on the street . " " That is so , " he agreed . But his following question of the accepted badness of mistresses and streetwalkers he wisely kept to himself . Were they darker than the shadow cast by the inelastic institution of matrimony ? At one time prostitutes were greatly honored ; but that had passed , he was convinced , forever ; and this , on the whole , he concluded , was fortunate ; for , perhaps , if prostitution were thoroughly discredited , marriage might , in some Elysian future , be swept of most of its rubbish . Houses of prostitution , mistresses , like charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inseparable from the present misconceptions of love and society . The first move , obviously , in stopping war was the suppression of such ameliorating forces as the Red Cross ; and , conversely , with complete unions , infidelity would languish and disappear . * * * * * He thought of this further in the darkened theatre to which , driven by his growing curiosity , he had gone to see Mina Raff in the leading part of a moving picture . It was a new version , in a new medium , of an old and perennial melodrama ; but , too late for the opening scenes , the story for the moment was incomprehensible to him . However , it had to do with the misadventures of a simple country girl in what , obviously , was the conventional idea of a most sophisticated and urbane society . Lee waited , and not vainly , to see the feminine grub transformed , by brilliant clothes , into a butterfly easily surpassing all the select glittering creatures of the city ; and he told himself that , personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was strange  --  seeing her there ; while , in fact , she was in New York with far different things occupying her thoughts . Here she was no more than an illusion , a pattern , without substance , of projected light and shade ; she had neither voice nor warmth nor color ; only the most primitive minds could be carried away , lost , in the convention of her flat mobile effigy ! Yet , after a little , he found that he as well was absorbed in the atmosphere of emotional verity she created . It was clear to him now that not the Mina Raff in New York , but this , was the important reality . In herself she was little compared to what she so miraculously did . Then  --  the final step in a surrender , however much he hated the word , to art  --  he forgot Mina Raff completely . He lost her partly in his own mental processes and partly in the unhappy girl she was portraying : It was an uncomplicated story of betrayal , of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circumstances of wretched loneliness , of an illegitimate baby . The father annoyed Lee excessively ; he was the anciently familiar inaccurate shape of conventionalized lust without an identifying human trait . Not for a second did Lee believe in his grease-pencilled incontinence and perfidy ; but the child he seduced , incidents of the seduction charged with the beauty of pity , thronged Lee 's mind with sensations and ideas . However , it was the world surrounding the central motive , the action , that most engaged him ; hardly a trait of generosity dignified it ; and , exaggeratedly as a universal meanness and self-righteous cruelty was shown , it scarcely departed , he felt , from the truth . Why was it that virtue , continence , corroded the heart ? Why did people who , through predilection , went to churches , regard those who did n't with such an insistent animosity ? Why did the church itself seek to obliterate  --  as though they were a breathing menace  --  all who stood outside its doors ? There was something terribly wrong in the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was applied to life . It began , in the symbolical person of Christ , with , at least , a measure of generosity ; but that had been long lost . Now the bitterness of the religious rather resembled envy . In the picture flickering on the screen the girl who had suffered the agonies of birth sat , with her baby on her young lap , in the forlorn room of a village boarding house . The baby was sick , a doctor had left shortly before , and one minute clenched hand rested on the mother 's bare breast . Lee found himself gazing fixedly at the girl 's face : trouble slowly clouded it , the trouble was invaded by fear , a terrible question . He realized that the hand was growing cold  --  the baby was dead . Waves of suffering passed darkly over the mother , incredulity swiftly followed by a frozen knowledge ; she tried with her lips , her mouth , to breath life into the flesh already meaningless , lost to her . Then the tragedy of existence drew her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked regard as white and inhuman as plaster of Paris . Emotion choked at Lee 's throat ; and , in a sense of shame at having been so shaken , he admitted that Mina Raff had an extraordinary ability : he evaded the impressive reality by a return to the trivial fact . In the gloom there was only a scattering of applause , a failure of approbation caused either by an excess of emotion in the audience , or  --  this he thought more probable  --  a general uneasiness before a great moment of life . The crowded theatre was wholly relieved , itself again , in a succeeding passage of trivial clowning . Hatred pursued the youthful informally maternal figure : that , eventually , she was saved by the love of an individual was small before the opposed mass  --  women surrounded her with vitriolic whispers , women turned her maliciously from house to house , a woman had betrayed her . Finally the tide of Christianity rose , burst , in a biblical father who drove her into a night of snow that was a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention . That she would be rescued , no doubt was permitted ; and Lee took no part in the storm of applause which greeted this act of satisfactory heroics . The other spirit had appalled him : in his state of mental doubt  --  it might equally have been a condition of obscure hope  --  he had been rudely shoved toward pessimism ; the converse of the announced purpose of the picture . The audience , for one thing , was so depressingly wrong in the placing of its merriment : it laughed delightedly at a gaunt feminine vindictiveness hurrying through the snow on an errand of destruction . The fact that the girl 's maternity was transcendent in a generous and confident heart , made lovely by spiritual passion , escaped everyone . The phrase , spiritual passion , had occurred to him without forethought and he wondered if it were permissible , if it meant anything ? It did decidedly to him ; he told himself further that it was the fusion of the body and all the aspirations called spirit in one supreme act of feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the spirit , though it had lingered in other relationships , had deserted the consummation of passion . That had n't grown perfunctory , but it became a thing more and more strictly of the flesh ; with this it was less thrilling . There , he believed , they were not singular ; or , anyhow , he was n't ; he saw what he was convinced was the same failure in the men past youth about him . But in Fanny there was , he recognized , that fierce if narrow singleness of impulse , of purity . His thoughts of other women were not innocent of provocative conjecture  --  Anette 's sinuous body , now as dead to him as Alohabad , recurred to his mind  --  but in this Fanny was utterly loyal . Yes , she had , a thing impossible for any man he had known , a mental singleness of desire . Was it that which had in her an affinity with the oppressors of the picture , which made her , mechanically , the vigorously enlisted enemy of the actual Mina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny  --  for all her marked superiority  --  was definitely arrayed with the righteous mob . She was sorry for those who failed in the discharge of duty to God and man , and she worked untiringly to reinstate them  --  in her good opinion . That was it , and it was no more ! All such attempted salvation resolved itself into the mere effort to drag men up to the complacent plane of the incidental savior . This recognition took a great deal of the vigor from his intended conversation with Peyton Morris : anything in the way of patronage , he reflected , would be as useless as it would be false . But he had no impulse to forego his purpose ; he was engaged to help Claire who was too proud to help herself ; yes , by heaven , and too right for the least humiliation . If Claire suffered , it must be because the world was too inferior for hope of any kind . Lee was not unaware of the incongruity of his position , for he was equally ignoring the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident to him now , since he had seen her in a picture , that she was well worth the greatest consideration . She lay outside the stream of ordinary responsibilities . What held him steady was the belief that she and Peyton were not so important to each other as they thought ; Claire needed him more badly than Mina . There was a possibility  --  no , it was probable  --  that Claire deserted would develop into an individual as empty and as vacantly sounding as a drum . She had said as much . Her heritage , together with its splendors of courage and charm , signally carried that menace . * * * * * So much , joined to what already was thronging his thoughts , brought Lee 's mind to resemble the sheet of an enormous ledger covered with a jumble of figures apparently beyond any reduction to an answer . He was considering Claire and Mina Raff , Mina and Claire , at a hunt breakfast at Willing Spencer 's in Nantbrook Valley , north of Eastlake , when , with a plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , he collided with Peyton Morris , his face pinched and his eyes dull from a lack of rest . The Spencer house was sparely furnished , a square unimpressive dwelling principally adapted to the early summers of its energetic children ; and Peyton and Lee Randon allowed themselves to be crowded into the bare angle formed by a high inner door . " Claire told you , " the younger said . " Yes , " Lee replied briefly . It would n't , after all , be difficult to talk to Peyton ; he was obviously miserable from the necessity of suppressing what absorbed his entire consciousness . " Well , I suppose you think there 's nothing to be said for me , " his voice was defiant ; " and that I ought to be shot . " " Very much to the contrary , " Lee asserted ; " there is so much to say that it 's difficult to know where to begin . With another situation practically the same , I might have agreed with you thoroughly ; but , with Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special one I ca n't . " " It is n't absolutely necessary , " the other pointed out ; " Mina and I will have a lot to ignore . " " The first thing you 'll have to manage , " Lee observed sharply , " is to grow up . You are not in a place to be helped by leather-headed satire and visions of solitary grandeur . My interest comes only from Claire and some personal curiosity ; Mina Raff does n't require anyone 's assistance . Of you all , her position is clearest . I do n't know if you can be brought to see it , but this is only incidental , a momentary indulgence , with her . " " What you do n't seem to get , " Peyton told him , with a brutally cold face , " is that I may smash you ; now , where you are . " " That was possible , " Lee agreed ; " and you are right  --  I had overlooked it . I think that 's passed , though ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , you young fool , you seem to have no conception , none in the world , of what you propose to do . In a week , in your frame of mind , you 'd have a hundred fights ; there would be time for nothing else but knocking out the men who insulted you . You 'll collapse over Sunday if you are not absolutely and totally impervious to everything and everybody . The only way you can throw the world over is to ignore it ; while you appear to have the idea that it should put a rose in your buttonhole . " " You do n't have to tell me it 's going to be stiff , " Peyton Morris asserted gloomily . " I can take care of that . Claire and Ira are the hard part . Lee , if anyone a year ago had said that I was like this , that I was even capable of it , I 'd have ruined him . God , what a thing to happen ! I want you to understand that we , Mina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it  --  it just flatly occurred . I had seen her only three times when it was too late ; and if you think I did n't try to break it , and myself , too  --  " Lee nodded . " Certainly . Why not , since it 's bound to knock you on the head ? You 've been very unfortunate : I ca n't imagine a man to whom this would come worse . " " If I can make Mina happy I do n't care about myself . " " Of course , that is understood , " Lee Randon returned impatiently ; " it is nothing but sentimental rot , all the same . If you are not contented , easy in mind , how can she be happy ? You have got to believe entirely in what you are doing , it must be right to you on every possible side ; and you ca n't make that grade , Peyton ; you are too conventional underneath . " " Sink your spurs in me , " he said doggedly ; " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a little while ago , if I had heard of a man doing this , I would have beaten him up just on general principles : running away from his wife and child , with another woman , an actress , that 's what it is ! I tell myself that , but the words have n't a trace of meaning or importance . Somehow , they do n't seem to apply to me , to us ; they can say what they like , but Mina is n't wicked . She  --  she loves me , Lee ; and , suddenly , that swept everything else out of sight . " But go back to me  --  you realize that I was rather in favor of what I was , what I had . Brandenhouse is a good school and my crowd ran it . We were pretty abrupt with boys who whored about ; and , at Princeton , well , we thought we were it . We were , still , there ; and I got a heavy idea of what I liked and was like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake generally . That was good after I left college , too ; but what 's the use of going into it ; I was in the same old Brandenhouse surrounding . The war split us wide open . Or I thought it did ; but , Lee , by God , I do n't believe it changed a thing . I got my touch of concussion early , Ira was born , and , and  --  " " Disaster , " Lee Randon pronounced shortly . " Call it that if you choose ; there is n't much use in calling it at all : it simply is . " " With someone else , yes ; but with you , no , not finally ; you have n't the character and disposition to get away with it . You do n't , secretly , approve of yourself , Peyton ; and that will be fatal . The truth is that , while you want this now , in a year , or two years , or five , you 'll demand the other . You think it is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're convinced it 's going to stay all in the sky ; but it will be on the solid familiar ground . Understand again  --  it is n't your plan I 'm attacking ; but your ability ; that and your real ignorance of Mina Raff . " If you imagine for an instant that this love will be bigger than her work , if you suppose that , against her acting , it will last , you are an idiot for your pains . If I do n't know the side of her you do , I have become fairly familiar with one you have n't dreamed of . She is a greater actress than people yet recognize , principally because of the general doubt about moving pictures ; but that recognition will come , and , when it does , you will be swept out of sight . " No , you have n't the slightest suspicion of what it is about ; that side of her , and it 's very nearly the whole woman , is a blank . She admitted to me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing is dragging into her genius what it needs . She loves you now , and tomorrow she 'll love a Belgian violinist , a great engineer , a Spanish prince at San Sebastian . How will you take sitting in the salon and hearing them padding around over your head ? It 's no good your getting mad at me ; I am not blaming Mina Raff ; you are . I admire her tremendously . " In the beginning I said she could watch out for herself , and I intimated that I was reasonably indifferent to what happened to you : it is Claire I am concerned about . Unfortunately for her , and without much reason , she loves you too . When Mina is done with you and you stray back , from , perhaps , South America , Claire wo n't be here . I do n't mean that she will have gone away , or be dead in the familiar sense . I have n't any doubt but that she would live with you again  --  she is not small-minded and she 's far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If you or anyone else thinks that I do n't admire Claire  --  " he stopped desperately . " We wo n't get far talking , " Peyton added ; " even if all you have said is a fact . You ca n't hit on much that I 've missed . You might just as well curse me and let me go . " " Nothing of the sort , " Lee Randon returned equably ; " that 's exactly what I have no intention of doing . In the interest of Claire I must try to open your eyes . " The younger man said indignantly : " You talk as though I were a day-old kitten . It 's cursed impertinent : I do n't seem to remember asking for so much advice . " * * * * * Throughout their conversation they were both holding the plates of sausage and scrambled eggs , from which rose a pungent odor , inevitable to the occasion . And , in a silence which fell upon them , Lee realized the absurdity of their position behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he declared , and moved into the eddying throng , the intermingling ceaseless conversations . Almost at once Peyton Morris disappeared , and Lee found Fanny at his shoulder . Neither of them fox-hunted , although they hacked a great deal over the country roads and fields , and they had ridden to the Spencers ' that morning . Fanny wore dark brown and a flattened hunting derby which , with her hair in a short braid tied by a stiff black ribbon , was particularly becoming . She was , he told himself , with her face positively animated , sparkling , from talk , unusually attractive . Fanny was like that  --  at times she was singularly engaging . " What did he say ? " she demanded , nodding in the direction in which Peyton had disappeared . " I have avoided him all morning . " " An uncommon lot for Peyton , " Lee acknowledged . " I almost think he has been jarred out of his self-complacency . But , on the whole , that is not possible . It 's temporary with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of youth  --  he was going to crown me . " " The little beast ! " she exclaimed viciously . " If he had I 'd have made him sorry . I saw Claire a few minutes ago , and she asked me to tell you , if she missed you , that she had something for you to see . Was n't it strange that she said nothing to me about it ? I should think , in her scrape , she 'd rather turn to a woman than to a man . But Claire is n't very feminine : I 've always felt her hardness . " " Then that 's why she did n't speak to you , " Lee assented superficially . " I 'll go over tonight , after dinner . They must be pretty nearly ready to drop the fox , and it 's beginning to drizzle . " There was , soon after that , an exodus from the back of the house to the fields beyond . It was a very fair hunting country , rolling and clear of brush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swales below . The clouds were broken and aqueous , and the grass held a silver veil of fine raindrops . Only an inconsiderable part of those present were following the hounds ; the others , in a restricted variety of sporting garb  --  the men in knickerbockers and gaiters or riding breeches , the women breeched and severely coated or swathed in wide reddish tweed capes  --  stood , with a scattering of umbrellas and upturned collars , in a semi-circle on the soggy turf . There was a baying of hounds from the direction of the stables , and the Master swung up on a bright chestnut horse with a braided tail . A huntsman appeared with a shuttered box , holding the fox , and an old brown and white hound bitch , wise with many years of hunting , to follow and establish and announce the scent . " If you are ready , Brace , " the Master said to his huntsman , " you may drop . " A stable boy held the hound , and , raising the shutter , Brace shook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the commotion about to pursue it  --  was surprisingly small , slim flanked ; proportionately the tail seemed extravagant . " I hope the brush wo n't get wet , " a man behind Lee spoke ; " when it does they ca n't run . " As it was , the fox , obviously , was reluctant to start ; it crouched in the rough grass and glanced fleetly around with incredibly sharp black eyes . The men shouted and flung up their arms ; but the animal was indifferent to their laudable efforts . The hunt , Lee Randon thought , had assumed an aspect of the ridiculous ; the men and women on expensive excited horses , the pack yelping from beyond a road , the expectant on-lookers , were mocked by the immobility of the puzzled subject of the chase . Finally the fox obligingly moved a few steps ; it hesitated again , and then trotted forward , slipping under a fence . Lee could follow it clearly across the next field and into the next ; its progress was unhurried , deliberate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master decided . When the time had gone the leash of the single hound was slipped . She ran around in a circle , whining eagerly , her nose to the sod , and then with a high yelp , set smartly off in a direction absolutely opposite to that taken by the fox . She was brought back and her nose held to the hot scent ; again , with a fresh assurance , the bitch gave tongue , followed the trail to where it went under the fence , and turned , instead of bearing to the right , to the left . There were various exclamations . A kennel man declared , " She knows what she 's about , and the fox will swing into Sibley 's Cover . " Someone else more sceptically asserted that the hound was a fool . Her sustained cry floated back from under the hill ; and , in another minute , the pack , the hunt , was off . The horses rose gracefully in a sleek brown tide over the first fence ; and then there was a division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the riders went to the left after the palpable course of the fox , others pounded direct for Sibley 's Cover , and the remainder reined up over the hounds . Although long association and familiarity had made such scenes a piece with Lee Randon 's subconsciousness , today the hunt seemed nothing more than nonsense . He laughed , and made a remark of disparaging humor ; but he found no support . Willing Spencer , kept out of the field by a broken collar bone , gazed at him with lifted eyebrows . Fanny and Lee turned to their horses , held for them by a groom at a mounting block , and went home . The rain had increased , but , not cold , Lee found it pleasant on his face . They jogged quietly over the roads bordered with gaunt sombre hedges , through the open countryside , into Eastlake . Nothing , he realized , had been accomplished with Peyton Morris ; the other was too numbed , shocked , by the incredible accident that had overtaken him to listen to reason . Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what Claire had to show him . Still , he was n't through with her husband ; he had no intention of resting until every hope was exhausted . What particularly impressed him  --  he must speak of it to Peyton  --  was that no matter where Morris might get he would find life monotonously the same . It was very much like mountain climbing  --  every peak looked different , more iridescent and desirable , from the one occupied ; but , gazing back , that just left appeared as engaging , as rare , as any in the distance . Every experience in the life surrounding him was the same as all the others ; no real change was offered , because the same dull response permeated all living ; no escape such as Peyton planned was possible . Escape , Lee Randon continued , happened within ; it was not , he repeated , a place on earth , or any possession , but a freedom , a state , of mind . Peyton Morris , while it was quite possible for him to be destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive himself on the rocks , on the first reef where he disregarded the clamor of warning bells and carefully charted directions , but he was no Columbus for the discovery of a magical island , a Cuba , of spices and delectable palms . Peyton had looked with a stolid indifference at the dangerously fascinating , the incomprehensible , smile of Cytherea . Yes , if the young donkey could be forced past this tempting patch of grazing , if he could only be driven a short distance farther down the highway of custom , Claire would be safe . But she must be made to think that such a conclusion had been purely the result of Peyton 's reserved strength , and not of a mere negative surrender following doubt . And , above all , there must be no appearance of Mina Raff having , after a short trial , herself discarded him . On such trivialities Claire 's ultimate happiness might hang . Truth was once more wholly restrained , hidden , dissimulated ; the skillful shifting of painted masks , false-faces , continued uninterrupted its progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his confidence , in what he was trying to prevent waned . What did it matter who went and who stayed ? In the end it was the same , unprofitable and stale . All , probably , that his thought had accomplished was to rob his ride of its glow , make flat the taste of the whiskey and charged water he prepared . However , shortly a pervading warmth  --  but it was of the spirits  --  brought back his lately unfamiliar sense of well-being . * * * * * The Morrises lived in a large remodelled brick house , pleasantly pseudo-classic , beyond the opposite boundary of Eastlake ; and , leaving his car in the turn of the drive past the main door , Lee walked into the wide hall which swept from front to back , and found a small dinner party at the stage of coffee and cigarettes . It was composed , he saw at once , of Peyton 's friends ; as he entered three young men rose punctiliously  --  Christian Wager , with hair growing close like a mat on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a round figure and a face with the contours and expression , the fresh color , of a pleasant and apple-like boy ; and Peyton . They had been at their university together ; and , Lee Randon saw , they were making , with a characteristic masculine innocence , an effort to secure their wives in the same bond of affectionate understanding that held them . Claire , who had smiled acknowledgingly with her eyes when Lee approached , returned to a withdrawn concentration upon the section of table-cloth immediately before her ; she answered the remarks directed to her with a temporary measure of animation vanishing at once with the effort . Christian Wager , who was in London with a branch of an American banking firm , had married an English girl strikingly named Evadore . She was large , with black hair cut in a scanty bang ; but beyond these unastonishing facts there was nothing in her appearance to mark or remember . However , a relative of hers , he had been told , distant but authentic , had been a lady-in-waiting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small appealing compound of the essence of the superlatively feminine . Lee Randon , in a chair drawn up for him at the table , studied the women , arbitrarily thrown together , with a secret entertainment . Evadore Wager was frankly  --  to a degree almost Chinese  --  curious about the others . At short regular intervals , in a tone of unvaried timbre and inexhaustible surprise , she half exclaimed , " Fancy . " Claire was metallic , turned in , with an indifference to her position that was actually rude , upon herself . But Mrs. Gilbert Bromhead made up for any silence around her in a seductive , low-pitched continuous talking . A part of this was superficially addressed to Claire and the solidly amazed Evadore ; but all its underlying intention , its musical cadences and breathless suspensions for approval , were flung at the men . The impression she skillfully conveyed to Lee Randon , by an art which never for an instant lost its aspect of the artless , was that he , at least , older in experience than the rest there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even Peyton , temporarily  --  resting confident on a successful bringing of their wives into the masculine simplicity of their common memories and affection , said little . With eyes puckered wisely against the cigarette smoke they made casual remarks about their present occupations and terse references to companions and deeds of the past . Only Peyton had been of any athletic importance ; he had played university foot-ball ; and , in view of this , there was still a tinge of respect in Bromhead 's manner . A long run of Peyton 's , crowned with a glorious and winning score , was recalled . But suddenly it failed to stir him . " How young we were then , " he observed gloomily . Christian Wager protested . " That is n't the right tone . We were young then , true , but Princeton was teaching us what it meant to be men . In that game , Morris , you got something invaluable to you now , hard endurance and fairness  --  " " In my day , " Lee interposed , " the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked a little too good for us . " " There were instructors like that , " Gilbert Bromhead assented ; " and some graduate coaches are pretty cunning ; but they are being discredited . " Wager largely , obliviously , passed over this interruption . " We learned decency , " he proceeded , " in business and ideals and living ; and to give and take evenly . In the war and in civil life we were and are behind the big issues . This new license and socialistic rant , the mental and moral bounders , must be held down , and we are the men to do it . Yes , and I believe in the church , the right church , we 're all for that : I tell you the country depends on the men the best colleges turn out . " " My God , Christian , you must have made a lot of money lately , " Bromhead observed . " You talk exactly like the president of a locomotive works . You have been dining with the best , too ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honestly  --  do you mention the Royal Family in your prayers ? " Evadore laughed . " Do you know , that 's really awfully good . He does put it on a bit , does n't he ? " " If you let Christian go on , " Peyton added , " he 'll talk about the sacred ties of Anglo-Saxon blood and tradition , with the English and American exchange ruling the world . Gilbert , how did your artillery company get along with the Londoners ? " " All right , if we were near a brick yard . " Claire rose abruptly , and they drifted out to a reception room opening , with a wide arch , beyond the hall . Gilbert Bromhead 's wife hesitated ; then , confidentially , she told Lee that she adored to sit on stairs . " Very well , " he assented ; " these of the Morrises ' are splendid . " He was a step below her , and her knees and his shoulder settled together . " I like older men so much , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " patches of grey above the ears are so distinguished . " " Older than what ? " Apparently forgetful that her gesture included Gilbert Bromhead she indicated the rooms that now held the others . " Young men are so head over heels , " she particularized ; " they are always disarranging things . " She laughed , a delectable sound . " I ought n't to have said that , and I would n't  --  to them . I might almost tell you the story about the man in the department store and the drawers . " Their contact was more pronounced . " Is n't that English girl extraordinary ? I did n't believe for a minute that was her own color till I was close to it . Her hair is n't dyed ; but why does she wear that skimpy bang ? " Again she laughed , a pure golden melody . " But you admired it , I know you did ; men are so unaccountable . Could you trust her , do you think ? It was n't very nice to make fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ruffle , she moved to a higher step , and Claire  --  before Lee had any premonition of her appearance  --  stood below them with chocolates . " She is rather attractive , " his companion admitted , when Claire had gone . " She does n't like me , or Mrs. Wager , though ; and I must say she made it plain in her own house . I 've been studying her , and there is something wrong . Is she happy with Peyton Morris ? I thought he was right nice until you came . " She turned for a better view , through the balustrade , of the doors beyond , and then drew her skirt close so that he could move up beside her . " It 's just like a smoke-house in there , " she reported . " I do n't truthfully think cigarettes are nice for a woman ; and I would n't dream of taking whiskey ; in the South we never . You 'd call that out of date . " She bent forward , arranging the ribbon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long kiss . " What made you suppose you could do that ? " she demanded ; " how did you know I would n't be cross with you ? But ... somehow I did n't mind . Although you must n't again , so publicly . I wonder why , with you , it seemed so perfectly nice , and not at all as if I had only met you ? " There was a response to that as recognized , as exact , as the bishop 's move in chess ; indeed , it was expected of him ; she was hesitating , waiting for it ; but he was unable to reassure her with the conventional sentiment . A month ago he would have commanded and developed an enticing situation ; but now , for Lee Randon , it was without possibilities , hardly more than perfunctory . A shade of vexation invaded her bearing , and she moved a significant infinitesimal fraction away from him . Then she discovered a wind blowing down the stairs . " I have to take such good care of myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is because I am so delicate  --  I can get upset at nothing . Here you are all so strong ; you have an advantage over me . Gilbert , dear , " she called from the hall , her voice musical with tender reproach , " I ca n't see how you love me , you stay away so far . " * * * * * " What did the little ass say to you ? " Claire asked . Lee was standing with her by the piano , and the others were around the fireplace in the farther spaciousness . " Nothing much , " he replied . " You mean that she never stopped . I 'll admit she 's skillful ; but she need n't think I 'm a fool . But you will never guess what I want to tell you . My dear Lee , that Mrs. Grove wrote me a letter . I have it here in my dress , for you to read . It 's a scream . " He took the sheet of note paper : it was grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vermilion , and had an indefinable scent . The writing was decisive : " MY DEAR MRS . MORRIS , " It is so difficult for me to express my disturbance at what Mina Raff has just told me , that I am asking to see you here , at my house in New York . Engagements make it difficult for me to leave at present . I hope you will not find this impertinent from an older woman , threatened very much as you in her affections by an impossible calamity  --  " The signature , Savina Grove , had the crispness of a name often attached to opinions and papers of authority . " That 's rather cool , " he agreed . " Cool ! The woman 's demented . No , I suppose she thinks I am an honest wronged woman or something objectionable of the sort . I was going to throw it away when I kept it to amuse you . " " It does , Claire ; and I 'm glad to see it ; impertinent as she admits it may be , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both caught . " " If you think I 'll go see her you are madder still . " " I realize you wo n't ; but worse things could happen . It 's the only possible approach to Mina Raff ; I had a chance to try Peyton , but it did no good . It seems to me this Mina ought to have some understanding . " Claire Morris said : " You can do it . " He reflected . " Well , perhaps ; I 'm your uncle ; there are no brothers , and what other family you have is away . It might be useful . Anyhow , she would hear a thing or two about you from me . " " Seriously , Lee , you 'd only get angry : I can see Mrs. Grove as though she were in the room  --  the utmost New York self-satisfaction . And I wo n't have you discussing my affairs . " " Absurd . A thousand people will be talking about them soon if this is n't managed . I have an idea I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done there . I got along well enough with the girl herself ; and perhaps , though it 's not likely , Mrs. Grove has some influence . " " Of course , I ca n't stop you , " Claire said ; her hand strayed over his , on the piano . " I 'm simply enraged at myself , Lee . Why , I should let him go with cheers  --  except where I was sorry for him  --  but I ca n't . He is such a sweet child ; and , you see , he was all mine . " " I ca n't leave before Thursday . " He considered . " I 'll have a wire sent to the Groves , say something regretful and polite about you  --  measles . " " Do n't bother , " she returned . Peyton came stiffly up to them . " I happened to mention , Claire , that we had some champagne left , and it created the intensest excitement . I told them it would do no good , that you were keeping hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles . " " Get them , Peyton , " she replied unhesitatingly . " I was keeping it , but perhaps for now . This is a very appropriate time for you and me , and the last of the cases left over from our wedding . " An expression of pain tightened his mouth ; he turned away without further speech . " We 'll have it in the dining-room , " Claire announced ; " big glasses filled with ice . " They gathered about the bare table , and Peyton Morris ranged the dark green bottles , capped in white foil , on the sideboard . He worked with a napkin at a cork : there was a restrained sibilant escaping pressure , and the liquid rose in frothing bubbles through the ice . It was , Lee thought , a golden drink , flooded , up to a variable point , with an inimitable gaiety . In comparison whiskey was brutalizing ; sherry was involved with a number of material accompanying pleasures ; port was purely masculine and clarets upset him ; beer was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rhine wines he ignored . Champagne held in solution the rhythm of old Vienna waltzes , of ball rooms with formal greenery , floating with passions as light as the tarleton skirts floating about dancing feet . But it was n't , he insisted , a wine for indiscriminate youth  --  youth that could n't distinguish between the sweet and the dry . It was for men like himself , with memories , unrealized dreams . Ugly women , and women who were old , and certainly prudes , should never be given a sip . Peyton Morris again filled all the glasses ; there was a clatter of talk , the accent of the South , about Lee ; but he grew oblivious of it . Champagne always gave Fanny a headache ; neither was it a drink for contented mothers , housewives . Contrarily , it was the ideal , the only , wine for seductions . It belonged most especially to masked balls , divine features vanishing under a provocative edge of black satin . He thought of little hidden tables and fantastic dresses , fragile emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away before the intentness of Claire 's expression . Peyton was doggedly holding to the rim of the table ; Gilbert Bromhead was very close to Evadore ; the black sheath of her hair had slipped and her eyes were blank ; the blanched delicate hand of the South nearest Christian Wager had disappeared , Christian 's hand on that side could not be seen . Peyton once more filled the glasses : " It must all go , " Claire insisted ; " I wo n't have a drop left . " Wager 's sentimentality overflowed in approved and well-established channels : Princeton was their mother , their sacred alma  --  alma mater . Here , under Peyton 's roof , they had gathered to renew ... friendships unbroken with their wives , their true wives ; oceans could n't separate them , nor time , nor  --  nor silver locks among the gold . They must come to London next December : anniversary of mutual happiness and success . Take the children , the sons of old Princeton , to Christmas pantomine . " Once , " Evadore told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what that is , over here ? I do n't believe I can explain it ; but there are quantities of champagne and men and principally girls ; but they 're not girls at all , if you see what I mean , not by several accidents . It would have been splendid , but I got sick , and it turned into a ghastly mess , mostly in the cab . That was rather thick , was n't it ? " Claire rose , and Lee Randon heard her say , under her breath , " Oh hell " ; but there was another full bottle , and she had to sit again . He had promised Fanny not to stay long , and , if he were coming home , she never went to sleep until he was in the house . Lee was n't drunk , but then , he recognized , neither was he sober . Why should he be the latter ? he demanded seriously of himself . His glass was empty , the champagne was all gone . Mrs. Gilbert Bromhead was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evadore 's face was damply pallid , her mouth slack ; she left the table , the room , hurried and unsteady , evidently about to repeat the thickness of the act that had marred her enjoyment of the night club ; Claire was openly contemptuous of them all . Outside , it had grown much colder , the ruts in the road were frozen , treacherous , but Lee Randon drove his car with a feeling of inattentive mastery . He saw some stars , an arc light , black patches of ice ; and , as he increased his speed , he sang to an emphatic lifted hand of a being in the South Seas who wore leaves , plenty of leaves ... But none of the silly songs now could compare with  --  with the bully that , on the levees , he was going to cut down . However , in his house , he grew quiet . " Lee , " his wife called sleepily from their room , " you are so late , dear . I waited the longest while for some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them to me tomorrow . " Her voice , heavy with sleep and contentment and love , fell upon his hearing like the sound of a pure accusing bell . He was n't fit to have a wife like Fanny , children as good as Helena and Gregory : he , Lee Randon , was a damned ingrate ! That bloody doll  --  he had threatened to put it in the fire before  --  could now go where it belonged . But the hearth was empty , cold . Cytherea , with her disdainful gaze , evaded his wavering reach . III Fanny , where the Groves were concerned , was utterly opposed to the plan which , Lee gathered , Claire had half supported . " It 's really too foolish , " his wife told him ; " what can Mrs. Grove and you have to say to each other ? And you wo n't get anywhere with Mina Raff . Indeed , Lee , I think it is n't quite dignified of you . " " That wo n't bother me , " he replied indulgently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so long  --  if you 'd come with me . This other affair would n't take half a day : you could buy clothes and there are the theatres . " " I 'd love to . " She hesitated . " When did you mean to go ? " But , when he said the following noon , she discovered that that did n't allow her enough time for preparations . " You do n't realize how much there is to do here , getting the servants and the children satisfactorily arranged . You might telephone me after you 're there ; and , if you did n't come back at once , perhaps I could manage it . " Lee telegraphed Mrs. William Loyd Grove of his intention ; and , with a table put up at his seat in the Pullman car for New York , he occupied himself opportunely with the reports of his varied profitable concerns . He had had a reply , sufficiently cordial , to his telegram , arranging for him to go directly to the Groves ' house ; but that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxi-cab the address on East Sixty- sixth Street it was past four and the appropriate hour for afternoon tea . The house , non-committal on the outside  --  except for the perceived elaboration of the window draperies within  --  was , Lee saw at once , a rich undisturbed accumulation of the decorative traditions of the eighteen-eighties . The hall was dark , with a ceiling and elaborate panels of black walnut and a high dull silver paper . The reception room into which he was shown , by a maid , was jungle-like in its hangings and deep-tufted upholstery of maroon and royal blue velvets , its lace and twisted cords with heavy tassels , and hassocks crowded on the sombrely brilliant rugs sacred in mosques . There was a mantle in colored marbles , cabinets of fretted ebony , tables of onyx and floriated ormolu , ivories and ornaments of Benares brass and olivewood . In the close incongruity of this preserved Victorianism Mrs. William Loyd Grove , when she appeared soon after , startled Lee Randon by her complete expression of a severely modern air . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , rigidly simple , with a small black three-cornered hat , a sable skin about her neck , and highly polished English brogues with gaiters . Mrs. Grove was thin  --  no , he corrected that impression , she was slight  --  her face , broad at the temples , narrowed gracefully to her chin ; her eyes were a darker blue than the velvet ; and her skin at once was evenly pale and had a suggestion of transparent warmth . The slender firm hand she extended , her bearing and the glimpse of a round throat , had lost none of the slender flexibility of youth . " The first thing I must do , " she told him in an unsympathetic , almost harsh , voice , " is to say that I agree with you entirely about this house . It 's beyond speech . But William wo n't have it touched . Probably you are not familiar with the stubborn traditions of old New Yorkers . Of course , when Mrs. Simeon Grove was alive , it was hopeless ; but I did think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can see how wrong I was  --  William ca n't be budged . " She was , he silently continued his conclusions , past forty , but by not more than a year , or a year and a half . All that her signature suggested was true : she was more forcible , decisive , than he had expected . Money and place , with an individual authentic strength of personality , gave her voice its accent of finality , her words their abruptness , her manner an unending ease . " Mina said she might be here , " Mrs. Grove went on , from an uncomfortable Jacobean chair , " if something or other happened at the studio . But I see she is not , and I am relieved . " " Mrs. Morris regretted she could n't come , " Lee told her inanely ; and his hostess replied : " I ca n't at all say that I believe you  --  I was so upset I could n't resist the attempt . But I hope she understood that it was absolutely impossible for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade annoyed by the briskness of her attack . " We are immensely concerned about Mina , " Mrs. Grove went on . " You see , with our son killed in the Lafayette Escadrille early in the war , practically she has been our only child . She is a daughter of a cousin of William 's . Mina , I must admit , has become very difficult ; I suppose because of her genius . She is perfectly amenable about everything in the world , until her mind gets set , like concrete , and then she is out of reach . Tell me a little about Mr. and Mrs. Morris . " Lee Randon spoke sharply for a minute or two , and a frown gathered on his hearer 's brow . " Why , " she observed , " it is worse than I had hoped . But I should have guessed from the name  --  Peyton Morris . I am very sorry ; you are fond of her , of Claire , that is evident . " " I should not have come here for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much of a meddler : it is so dangerous for everyone concerned . Then it might be that this was the best for all three of them . " " What a curious , contradictory thing for you to say , " she commented , studying him . " You must n't let William hear that ; he 's far worse than I am . " " I do n't mean we can proceed from that attitude , " Lee explained , " it was a sort of digression . I want to do whatever is possible to break it up ; yes , purely for Claire . " " I hope we may succeed . " Her voice showed doubt . " William is n't always tactful , and I 've told him again and again he 's taking the wrong tone with Mina . What a pity the Morrises have turned out thoroughly nice  --  do n't tell me your Claire did n't curse me , I know these girls  --  it is so much easier to deal with vulgar people . I can see now what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like that type  --  the masculine with an air of fine linen . " The tea-table was rolled up to them . " If you would rather have Scotch or rye it 's here , " she informed him . " But even the tea , you 'll notice , is in a glass with rum ; positively , soon no one will look at soup unless it 's served as a highball . " Lee Randon did prefer Scotch : none better , he discovered , was to be imagined ; the ice was frozen into precisely the right size ; and the cigars before him , a special Corona , the Shepheard 's Hotel cigarettes , carried the luxury of comfort to its last perfection . Mrs. Grove smoked in an abstracted long-accustomed manner . " Well , " she demanded , " what is there we can do ? " " I rather trusted you to find that . " " How can I ? What hold have we on her ? Mina is getting this nonsensical weekly sum ; her contract runs for two years yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell her she is n't worth it . And , now , this tiresome Morris has money , too ; and you say he 's as bad as Mina . Have you talked to her about Mrs. Morris ? Mina is strangely sensitive , and , if you can find it , has a very tender heart . " " I might do that over here , " he suggested . " In Eastlake it was n't possible . You 've discouraged me , though ; I suppose I had the idea that you could lock her up on bread and water . " She laughed . " An army of Minnesota kitchen maids would break into the house ; millions of people have voted Mina their favorite ; when she is out with me the most odious crowds positively stop my car . I wo n't go with her any more where she can be recognized . " Lee rose , and his expression showed his increasing sense of the uselessness of their efforts . " You must n't give up , " she said quickly ; " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner , certainly ; I 'll send the car to your hotel at seven-thirty , and you will bring your bag . We ca n't argue over that , can we ? William will enjoy having you very much . Do you mind my saying he 'll be relieved ? He is such a Knickerbocker . I need n't add , Mr. Randon , that you shall be entirely free : whenever you want to go down town Adamson will take you . " The exact moulding of her body was insolent . " Well , then , for the moment  --  " She gave him no chance at refusal , but , with the curtness of her hand , the apparent vanishing of all knowledge of his presence , dismissed him before he was aware of it to the adroitness of the maid in the hall putting him into his overcoat. * * * * * In a double room at his hotel , repacking the articles of toilet he had spread around the bathroom , Lee thought , but without heat , damn that Grove woman . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would complicate things with Fanny ; and , if William did enjoy him , Lee Randon , would he enjoy William ? It was questionable in the present state of his mind . Dinner , a servant at the Groves ' informed him , would be at eight . His bag was swiftly and skillfully unpacked for him  --  this always annoyed Lee  --  and the water was turned into the tub . His room , richly draped and oppressive as the one downstairs , had a bed with a high carved oak headboard from which a heavy canopy , again of velvet and again crimson , reached to the floor at its foot ; and by the side of the bed ran a long cushion over which he repeatedly stumbled . His immediate necessity was to telephone Fanny ; she was delighted at the sound of his voice ; but , when he told her what had happened , where he was , an increasing irritation crept into her voice . " I ca n't understand it at all , " he heard her say , so clearly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely . " You asked me to come over and shop , and go to the theatre with you ; and now that I have everything arranged , even Christopher pacified , you go to the Groves ' . It seems to me most peculiar . " He could n't help it , he replied , with a slight responsive sharpening of his own speech ; he had driven to the hotel , where he had secured their room , and Mrs. Grove had made it impossible for him to stay there . When he left  --  it would be late tomorrow or early the next day , Lee thought  --  she could meet him and do as they planned . But Fanny refused to agree : it would , now , be a needless expense . No , the other was what she had eagerly looked forward to . Lee , drawing her attention once more to the fact that it was n't possible , was answered by so long a silence that he concluded she had hung up the receiver . " Have a good time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the Raff woman . I suppose Mrs. Grove , who seems to get everything she wants , is fascinating as well . " " Indeed , I do n't know , Fanny ! " he exclaimed , his patience almost exhausted . " It has n't occurred to me to think about her . I 'm sorry you wo n't do what I suggest ; it 's not different from what we first thought of . " " Good-bye , " she answered reluctantly ; " the children are here and send their love . They 'd like to speak to you , but probably you 're in a hurry . " " I may be late for dinner now , " he admitted . The receiver in his house was abruptly , unmistakably , replaced . No one else , and for so little perceptible cause , could make him as mad as Fanny frequently did . He put on his waistcoat , changed his money from the trousers on the bed to those he was wearing , in a formless indignation . This was n't his fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might be doing something wrong . Fanny even managed to convey a doubt of Mrs. Grove , Mrs. William Loyd Grove . But she could n't see how ridiculous that was . William Grove Lee liked negatively ; there was , patently , nothing in him to create an active response . His short heavy body was faultlessly clothed ; his heavy face , with its moustache twisted into points , the clouded purple of his cheeks contradicted by the penetration of a steadily focussed gaze , expressed nothing more than a niceness of balance between self-indulgence , tempered by exercise , games in open air , and a far from negligible administration of the resources he had inherited . " You are a relative of the Morrises ? " he asked Lee , turning from the menu set before him in a miniature silver frame . This Lee Randon admitted , and Grove 's eyebrows mounted . " Ca n't anything be done with the young man ? " " How are you succeeding with the young woman ? " Lee returned . " Oh , women  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't argue with women . Mina wants her Peyton  --  if that 's his name ; God knows I 've heard it enough  --  and there 's no more to that . " " It begins to look as though she 'd get him , " Lee observed ; " I must say we have n't got far with Morris . " " Extraordinary . " It was Mrs. Grove who spoke . She was dressed in grey , a gown cut away from sheer points on her shoulders , with a girdle of small gilt roses , her hair in a binding of grey brocade and amber ornaments ; and above her elbows were bands of dull intricately pierced gold . " I wonder what it 's all about ? " Lee gazed at her with a new interest . " So do I , " he acknowledged ; " I was thinking of that , really , before this happened : what is it all about ? " " I can answer that readily enough , " Grove assured them ; " anyone could with a little consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads into the noose . Trouble always follows . I do n't care who they are , but if you throw two fairly young people of opposite sex together in circumstances any way out of the ordinary , you have a situation to meet . Mina has been spoiled by so much publicity ; her emotions are constantly over-strung ; and she thinks , if she wants it , that she can have the moon . " " You believe that , I know , William , " his wife commented ; " I have often heard you say so . But what is your opinion , Mr. Randon  --  have you reached one and is a conclusion possible ? " " I ca n't answer any of your questions , " he admitted ; " perhaps this is one of the things that must be experienced to be understood ; certainly it has n't a great deal to do with the mind . " He turned to William Grove , " Your view has a lot to recommend it , even if it solves nothing . Suppose you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to go that far , " Grove protested ; " I am not answering the questions of the universe . Savina has an idea there 's a mystery in it , a quality hidden from reason ; and I want to knock that on the head . It 's a law of nature , that 's all ; keep away from it if you want security . I ca n't imagine people of breeding  --  you will have to overlook this , Mr. Randon , on the account of Morris  --  getting so far down the slide . It belongs to another class entirely , one without traditions or practical wisdom . Yet , I suppose it is the general tone of the day : they think they can handle fire with impunity , like children with parlor matches . " " It ca n't , altogether , be accounted for so easily , " Lee decided . " The whole affair has been so lied about , and juggled to suit different climates and people , that hardly any of the original impulse is left on view . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd lose our ideas of what was right and wrong in love ? " " Pandemonium , " Grove replied promptly . " Not if people were more responsible , William , " Savina Grove added ; " not for the superior . But then , all laws and order were made for the good of the mob . I do n't need the policeman I see in the streets ; and , really , I have n't a scrap more use for policeman-like regulations ; I could regulate myself  --  " " And there , " he interrupted , " is where Mina fails ; she ca n't run herself for a damn ; she ought to have a nurse . Your theories contradict each other , as well  --  you say one thing and do quite differently . " She was silent at this , gazing at her hands , the beautifully made pointed fingers bare of rings . On their backs the veins , blue-violet , were visible ; and there was a delicate tracery inside the bend of her arms . But her face , Lee reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color was unvaried by any visible trace of emotion , life . She was , in fact , plain if not actually ugly ; her mouth was too large ; on the street , without the saving distinction of her dress , he would n't have noticed her . But what , above the rest , engaged him was her resemblance to someone he knew but could n't recall . What woman , seen lately , had Mrs. Grove 's still , intent face , her pointed chin and long throat ? She lifted her hand , and the gesture , the suspended grace of the wrist , was familiar to him . Finally Lee Randon , unable to satisfy his curiosity , exasperated at the usual vain stupidity of such comparisons , gave up the effort . William Grove informed Lee that he might accompany him to his club , stay , or go as he willed . Mrs. Grove , it developed , would be at home , where , if he chose , they might pursue the cause of Lee Randon 's presence there . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little that was useful to be said . They repeated what had been gone over before . Mrs. Grove explained again Mina Raff 's unpredictable qualities , and he spoke of Peyton and Claire Morris . Beyond the admission of their surrender , Peyton 's and hers , to each other , Mina had told the Groves nothing ; Savina Grove was ignorant of what they intended . That it would begin at once was evident . " William is always a little annoyed by my contradictory character , " she observed , gazing down at her slippers . They were grey , slight like a glove , on slight arched feet that held his attention . The conversation about the situation before them , expanded to its farthest limits , inevitably dragged ; they said the same things , in hardly varied words , a third and even a fourth time ; and then Lee 's interest in it wholly deserted him  --  he could excite himself about Mina no longer . This left him confronted with himself and Mrs. Grove . A clock on the stairway struck ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wondered if she were fatigued , merely polite in remaining in the room with him ? She need n't inconvenience herself on his account ! It was pleasant enough at the Groves ' ; without doubt  --  in her own world  --  she was a woman of consequence , but he was n't carried away by the privilege of studying her indifferent silences . Then she completely surprised him : " I suppose you have been to all the caf ? s and revues you ever want to see ; but I almost never get to them ; and it occurred to me that , if you did n't too much mind , we might go . What do you think  --  is it utterly foolish ? " On the contrary , he assured her , it would amuse him immensely . Lee Randon said this so convincingly that she rose at once . To be with Mrs. William Loyd Grove at Malmaison  --  that , of all the places possible , presented itself at once  --  would furnish him with an uncommon evening . Consequently , driving smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asphalt strung with fixed moons , in answer to her query , he proposed Malmaison , and the directions were transmitted into the ivory mouth-piece beside her . At the moment when the day was most threatened it had shown a new and most promising development . Over the grey dress Mrs. Grove wore a cloak with a subdued gold shimmer , her hat was hardly more than the spread wing of a bird across the pallor of her face , and the deep folds of the gloves on her wrists emphasized the slender charm of her arms . No young  --  younger woman , he decided , could compete with her in the worldly , the sophisticated , attractiveness she commanded : on the plane of absolute civilization she was supreme . In the semi-gloom of the closed car , sunken in her voluminous wrap of dull gold , with a high-bridged nose visible , a hand in its dead-white covering pressed into the cushion , she satisfied his every aesthetic requirement . Women , he reflected , should be primarily a show on a stage carefully set for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely more women  --  so few were lovely  --  would agree with him there . Argument would confront him with the moral and natural beauty of maternity ; very well , in such instincts , he thought with a resignation quite cheerful , he was lacking . Birth , self-oblivion , was no longer the end of his dream-like existence . Lee Randon wanted to find the justification , preserve the integrity , of his personality , and not lose it . Yes , if nature , as it seemed fully reasonable , had intended the other , something incalculable had upset its plans ; for what now stirred Lee had nothing to do with breeding . Long-continued thought , instead of making his questioning clearer , endlessly complicated it . There was always a possibility , which he was willing to consider , that he was lacking in sheer normality ; and that , therefore , his doubts , no more than neurasthenic , were without any value . He was ready to face this , but unable , finally , to accept it , to dismiss himself so cheaply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too perceptible at the hearts of other men . It was n't new , singular , in him ; nor had he borrowed it from any book or philosophy : it had so happened that he had never read a paragraph , satisfactory to him in the slightest , about the emotional sum of a man and a woman . What he read he could n't believe ; it was a paste of moralistic lies ; either that or the writer had no greater power of explication than he . But , while he might deny a fundamental irregularity , the majority of men , secretly delivered to one thing , would preach virtuously at him the other . He recalled how universal were the traces of dissatisfaction he had noticed ; an uneasiness of the masculine world that resembled a harborful of ships which , lying long and placidly at anchor , began in a rising wind to stir and pull at their hawser chains . Lee did n't mean that this restlessness was confined to men ; simply he was intent on his own problem . The automobile turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass of cars held at Broadway , advanced a few feet , stopped , went on , and , twisting through the traffic , reached Malmaison . He left his outer things at the door , but Mrs. Grove kept her cloak , and they mounted in an elevator to the caf ? floor . The place was crowded with brightly filled tables surrounding the rectangular open dancing space , and Lee signalled for a captain . That experienced individual , with a covert glance at Lee Randon 's companion , a hand folded about a sum of money that would have paid the butcher for a week at Eastlake , found , however , exactly what they wanted ; and Mrs. Grove 's dominating slimness emerged by degrees , like a rare flower from leaves of quiet gold . They sat facing each other . At a table on Lee 's left , on a floor a foot higher , sat a woman , Spanish in color , with a face like a crumpled petunia . The girls of a larger party , beyond Savina Grove , were young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced by black cobwebs of lace . The music began , and they left to dance ; the deserted tables bore their drinks undisturbed while the floor was choked by slowly revolving figures distilling from the rhythm frank gratification . There was an honesty of intention , the admission that life and nights were short , lacking in the fever at the Eastlake dancing ; here , rather than unsettled restraint , was the determination to spend every excited nerve on sensation , to obtain the last drop from glasses the contents and odors of which uniquely resembled the drinks of pre-prohibition . These girls , consciously animating their shapely bodies with the allurement if not the ends of creation , prostitutes of both temperament and fact , were , Lee Randon decided , calmer  --  yes , safer  --  in mind and purpose than were his most admirable friends . Certainly they were better defined , more logically placed than , for example , Mrs. William Loyd Grove  --  her dress , her powdering and perfume , the warm metal clasped about the softness of her arms , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the latter met its announced intention ; it was dissipated  --  normally  --  in satiety . But , where Mrs. Grove was concerned ... Lee speculated . She was evidently highly engaged , not a shade repelled , by what she saw ; in a cool manner she drew his gaze to a specially scarlet and effective dress : " With her figure it 's very successful , " she commented . What struck him immediately was that the proportions she had pointed out and her own were identical ; and Lee had a vision of Mrs. Grove in the dress they were studying . The same thing , it appeared , was in her mind . " Well , " she challenged him , " I could , you know . " This he admitted discreetly , and asked her if she cared to dance . " Why not ? " In his arms she was at once light and perceivable ; everything a part of her was exquisitely finished ; he discovered more and more surely that she was flesh and blood , and not , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dancing floor , she was careless , in the manner everywhere evident , in the disposition of her skirt . Lee had come prepared for the pleasure to be had from on-looking ; but he had become the most oblivious of all the active participants . After a second brief understanding with the captain , another quickly-disposed currency note , there was the familiar smothered uncorking of champagne by his ear . To Lee Randon 's lavishness Mrs. Grove gave no attention , and he was obliged to banish a petty chagrin by the knowledge that he had fully met the obligations of her presence . The propping of her elbows on the table , her casual gazing over the lifted rim of her glass , her silences , all admitted him to her own unremarked , her exclusive and inalienable , privilege . * * * * * She still , however , retained her personal remoteness from him ; what she gave belonged to him , in their situation , conventionally ; it had no greater significance ; and , forming nearly all of the duty of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was n't , certainly , gay in the sense most familiar to him  --  Anette , in the same circumstances , would have radiated a bubbling sensual pleasure , indulged in a surface impropriety ; any girl around them would have given more than Mrs. Grove ; everything , probably . But he preferred the penetrating judgments , the superior mental freedom , of his companion . If she were interested in a prostitute , she did n't , with a laborious self-consciousness , avoid that term ; she was neither obviously aware of those fragile vessels of pleasure nor ignorant of them ; indeed , Lee told himself , she was more a part of their world , however continent she might remain , than she was of Fanny 's . Fanny , here , would have been equally fascinated and shocked ; but , essentially , she 'd be hurt ; and , at the same time , rebellious with the innate resentment of the pure , the contained , for the free . She would never have agreed to the champagne , either ; they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gone back to the hotel . It was now past two o'clock . There was no lessening in the vigor of the dancing , the laughter , or in the stream of laden trays ; no trace of fatigue in Mrs. Grove . She had the determined resilience of a woman approaching , perhaps , the decline , but not yet in it ; of one who had danced into innumerable sun-rises from the night before , destroying many dozens of pairs of satin slippers . When it occurred to her to gather up the petal-like folds of her cloak , get her hands into the gloves rolled back on her wrists , it was nearer three than two . A hollow voice on the street called the number of the Grove automobile , the door closed smoothly on them , and again she was absorbed into the cushions and her wrap . But there was a change in his feeling for her , an indefinable but potent boundary had been crossed : they had looked together , informally , at life , at passion , and the resulting sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee lighted a cigarette , and , without speech , she took it from him , transferred it to her own lips . Eastlake and Fanny , Helena and Gregory , seemed very remote ; a quality of his being suppressed at home here possessed him completely : in a black silk evening waistcoat , with no responsibilities , no thought of time or work , he was , lightly and wholly , an idler in a polite sphere . The orchids in their glass holder , dimly visible before him , were a symbol of his purely decorative engagement with life . Now Lee could n't reconcile himself to the knowledge that this was no more than an interlude  --  with music  --  in his other , married existence . It was as unsubstantial as an evening 's performance , in temporary finery , of a high comedy of manners . Savina Grove said , " It has been surprisingly nice . " " Has n't it , " he agreed ; " and , when you spoke , I was trying to realize that it will be so soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunder , a stupid error in emphasis , from which she drew perceptibly away . She extinguished the cigarette , his cigarette , and that , as well , added to the distance between them . " I should go back to Eastlake tomorrow afternoon , " he observed , in a manner which he made entirely detached . To that she objected that he would not see Mina Raff , nothing would be accomplished . " She might have dinner with you tomorrow night , " she thought ; " Mina gets back to the Plaza a little before seven . But we can call the studio . " In view of what he had already done , Mrs. Grove 's proposal seemed unavoidably reasonable . He would telephone Fanny again in the morning and explain . Fanny , his wife ! Well , he continued , as though he were angrily retorting to a criticism from without , no man ever better realized the splendid qualities of his wife . That was beyond contradiction ; and he sharply added that not Fanny , but the role of a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married , but that did n't keep her from the Malmaison , at what Eastlake disapprovingly called all hours of the night . She had no aspect of a servitude which , while it promised the most unlimited future rewards , took the present grace , the charm , from women . That  --  the consequent loss or gain  --  was open to question ; but the fact remained : for the majority of women marriage was fatal to their persons . Only the rich , the fortunate and the unamenable escaped . " In a very few minutes now , " Mrs. Grove said , " you will be able to sleep . " " I 've never been wider awake , " he protested ; " I was thinking of how marriage submerged most women while you escaped . " She laughed quietly , incomprehensibly . " Well , " he insisted , aggrieved , " have n't you ? " She leaned toward him ; almost , he told himself , there was a flash of animation on her immobile face . " Escape , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does anyone escape  --  will young Morris and Mina ? And you ? " " Oh , not I , " he replied , thrown off his mental balance by the rapid attack of her questioning ; " I am tied in a thousand ways . But you surprise me . " " I could , " she remarked , coldly , returning to her corner . " Your self- satisfaction makes me rage , How do you dare , knowing nothing , to decide what I am and what I can do ? You 're like William , everyone I meet  --  so sure for others . " " No , I 'm not , " he contradicted her with a rude energy ; " and , after all , I did n't accuse you of much that was serious . I only said you were apparently above the circumstances that spoil so many women . " " It is n't necessary to repeat yourself , " she reminded him disagreeably ; " I have a trace of memory . " " And with it , " he answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she agreed , once more calm ; " you seem fated to tell me about myself . I do n't mind , and it gives you such a feeling of wisdom . " The car stopped before the Grove house and , within , her good-night was indifferent even for her . What , he wondered , what the devil , had upset her ? He had never encountered a more incomprehensible display of the arrogantly feminine . In his room , however , re-establishing his sense of comfort , he found , on a low table by the bed , a choice of whiskies , charged water , cigarettes , nectarines , orange-brown mangoes , and black Belgian grapes , Attached to an electric plug was a small coffee percolator ; for the morning , Lee gathered . His pajamas , his dressing gown and slippers , were conveniently laid at his hand . He was , in fact , so comfortable that he had no desire to get into bed ; and he sat smoking , over a tall drink , speculating about his hostess . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mrs. Grove would have been too well-steeled there to show any resentment to a virtual stranger ; no , whatever it was lay within herself . He gave it up , since , he proclaimed aloud , it did n't touch him . The opened windows admitted the vast unsubdued clamor of New York ; the immeasurable force of the city seemed to press in upon the room , upon his thoughts . How different it was from the open countryside , the quiet scene , of his home in Eastlake . There the lowing of a chance cow robbed of her calf , her udder aching , the diminishing barking of dogs and the birds  --  sparrows in winter and robins in the spring  --  were the only sounds that disturbed the dark . In the morning the farmer above Lee rolled the milk down the road , past his window , on a carrier , and the milk cans made a sudden rattle and ringing . Then Christopher washed the porches . Fanny , no matter how late she had been up the night before , was dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase . He hazarded the guess that Mrs. Grove was often in bed until past noon ; here servants renewed the great hot-house roses with long stems , the elaborate flowers on the dining-table . In the morning , as he had foreseen , the percolator was connected , cream and sugar placed beside it ; and before his shaving was over , he had a cup of coffee with a cigarette casting up its fragrant smoke from the saucer . His shoes might have been lacquered from the heighth of the lustre rubbed into them ; a voice the perfection of trained sympathetic concern inquired for the exacted details of the suspended preparation of his eggs . * * * * * His dinner engagement with Mina Raff , arranged through her secretary , was for fifteen minutes past seven ; and , meanwhile , as Mrs. Grove had offered , Adamson drove Lee down-town . The afternoon had nearly gone before he returned to East Sixty-sixth Street ; but the maid at the door told him that there was tea up in the library . This he found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he decided , might be massively Babylonian . A ponderous table for the support of weightless trifles filled the middle of the rug ; there were deep chairs of roan leather , with an immense sofa like the lounge of a club or steamer ; low bookcases with leaded glass ; and windows the upper panes of which were stained in peacock colors and geometrical design . The tea things were on a wagon beside the center table ; there were a number of used cups and crumpled napkins , and whiskey glasses , in evidence , but Mrs. Grove was alone . She had been about to have them removed , she told him , when he rang . " No , I am not in a hurry ; and it 's such a disagreeable day you ought to have a highball . " She was in black , a dress that he found unbecoming , with a collar high about her throat and wide sleeves heavily embroidered in carmine . " You will hate that one , " she said of the chair he selected ; " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable  --  these either swallow you whole or , like a toboggan slide , drop you on the floor . " Lee drew up a tabourette for his glass and ash tray . The banal idea struck him that , although he had met Mrs. Grove only yesterday , he knew her well ; rather he had a sense of ease , of the familiar , with her . The sole evidence she gave of an agreement in his feeling was that she almost totally neglected to talk . She smoked , absorbed in a frowning abstraction . A floor lamp behind them was lighted , and there was an illumination at the mantel , but the depths of the library were wrapped in obscurity : its sombreness had increased , the air was heavy with the dust of leather , a vague funereal oppressiveness . Lee 's sense of familiarity increased , but his ease left him , driven away by the strength of a feeling not exactly of being at home but of returning to an old powerful influence . Mrs. Grove 's head was in shadow . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered . He was , he told Lee civilly , glad that Adamson had been of use . " I walk whenever it 's possible , " he proceeded ; " but that way you would n't have reached Beaver Street yet . Nothing to drink , thanks , Savina , but a cigarette  --  " Lee Randon reached forward with the silver box and , inadvertently , he pressed into Mrs. Grove 's knee . He heard a thin clatter , there was a minute hot splash on his hand , and he realized that she had dropped her spoon . She sat rigidly , half turned toward the light , with a face that shocked him : it was not merely pale , but white , drawn and harsh , and her eyes , losing every vestige of ordinary expression , stared at him in a set black intensity . " I 'm sorry , " Lee Randon said mechanically , and he offered the cigarette box to the other man ; but , internally , he was consumed with anger . The woman positively was a fool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be so super-sensitive and suspicious ; and it damaged his pride that , clearly , she should consider him capable of such a juvenile proceeding . Lee rose and excused himself stiffly , explaining that it was time for him to dress ; and , in his room , telephoning Fanny , he determined to leave New York , the Groves , as early as possible in the morning . Fanny responded from Eastlake in a tone of unending patience ; nothing he could do , her voice intimated , would exhaust her first consideration of him ; she would n't  --  how could she ?  --  question the wisdom of his decisions , even when they seemed , but , of course , only to her faulty understanding , incomprehensible . " You make it sound as though I were over here on an errand of my own , " he protested cheerfully ; " I 'd rather be in Eastlake . " Helena , she told him , had been bad again ; there was a recognized opinion between them that , while Gregory was like his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be too severe , " he said . Someone had to be , the reply came , faint and indistinct . " Is there anything else ? " he asked . Of course , how stupid , she was keeping him ; the sound was now open and colored with self-reproach . She was so sorry . " Damn ! " Lee exclaimed , leaving the telephone with the feeling that Fanny had repelled his affection . Women were beyond him . In this mood he was unprepared for the appearance of Mina Raff , immediately after his name was sent up to her rooms , on the minute arranged . What , next , about her occurred to him was the evidence of her weariness . A short and extremely romantic veil hung from the close brim of her hat  --  with her head bent forward she gazed at him seriously through the ornamental filaments ; her chin raised , the intent regard of her celebrated eyes was unhampered . She did n't care where they went , she replied to his question , except that she preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Regis , he thought , would best answer this requirement ; and he had started toward the taxi-cab stand when she informed him that she had kept her car . It was larger and more elaborately fitted than the Grove limousine ; in its deep upholstery , its silk curtains and velvet carpet and gold mounted vanities , Mina Raff was remarkably child-like , small ; her face , brightening at intervals in the rapidly passing lights outside , was touched by pathos ; she seemed crushed by the size , the swiftness and complexity , of her automobile , and by the gathering imperious weight of her fame . She was still , however , appealingly simple ; no matter what she might do it would be invested with the aspect of innocence which , admirable for her art , never for an instant deserted her personality . Lee Randon , who liked her better with each accumulating minute , wondered why he was completely outside the disturbance of her charm . As a young man , he concluded , he would have been lost in a passionate devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace the ideal , always a silver abstraction , of youth ; the old worn simile of an April moon , distinguished in her case by the qualification , wistful , was the most complete description of her he possessed . Young men  --  Peyton Morris  --  were worshippers of the moon , the unattainable ; and when they happily attained a reality they hid it in iridescent fancy . What now formed Lee 's vision had , together with no less a mystery , a greater warmth and implied reality from him . Cytherea and Mina Raff shared nothing ; somehow the latter lacked the magnetism essential to the stirring of his desire . This , perhaps , was inevitable to his age , to the swift passage of that young idealism : after forty , the nebulous became a need for sensuous reality . Certain phases of Mina , as well , were utterly those of a child  --  she had the eluding sweetness , the flower-like indifference , of Helena , of a temperamental virginity so absolute that it was incapable of understanding or communicating an emotional fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was above , superior to , experience ; it was not , for her , necessary ; she was not changed by it , but changed it into herself , into the validity of whatever she intrinsically was . His thoughts returned to the unfortunate occurrence in the library at the Groves ' ; his indignation at Mrs. Grove was complicated , puzzled , by the whole loss of the detached self-possession which , he had thought , was her most persistent characteristic . Her expression , in memory , specially baffled him ; under other , accountable , circumstances he should have said that it was a look of suffering , of drawn pain . He could n't recall the appearance of a shade of anger ; yet the spoon had fallen as if from a hand numb with  --  with resentment . No other deduction was possible . He wished it were permissible to speak to her again about what  --  but obviously  --  had been no more than an accident ; he objected to leaving such a ridiculous misconception of himself lodged permanently in her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , it mattered very little . Mrs. Grove was welcome to whatever flattering of her seductiveness her pride demanded . When he had dispatched , with Mina Raff , his duty to Claire , succeeded or failed  --  the latter , he added , was of course inevitable  --  he 'd return to Eastlake and the Groves would go out of his life . The curtain of what he had thought of as a play , an interlude , would fall heavily , conclusively , and the music end . * * * * * At the St. Regis he chose the more informal dining-room with panellings and high columns of wood , and medallions in white marble . It was neither full nor empty , and they were conducted to a table set for two . Lee was conscious of heads turning , and of a faint running whisper  --  Mina Raff had been recognized . However , without any exhibited consciousness of this , she addressed herself to him with a pretty exclusion ; and , pausing to explain her indifference to food , she left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had , she admitted , a preference for alligator pears cut into small cubes with a French dressing . That disposed of , he turned to her : " I noticed , at the Plaza , that you are hard at it . " " Indeed , yes , " she replied ; " but we are still only rehearsing ; not a scene has been shot . You see , that makes it all so expensive ; I want to do as well as possible for the men who have money and confidence in me . " This , from her manner , her deceptive look of fragility everywhere drooping with regret , was patent . What she said , thought , felt , was magnificently reflected , given visibility , by her fluid being . " But you have n't come over here to talk to me about that , " she said directly ; " you want me to give up Peyton . " He nodded , relieved that she had made the introduction of his purpose so easy . " I ought to tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I ca n't . Nothing can convince me that we are wrong . We did n't try to have this happen , we did all we could  --  but it was too late  --  to prevent it , " Mina Raff repeated Peyton 's own assurance to him . " Things were taken out of our hands . Why I went to Eastlake I do n't know , it was dreadfully inconvenient , and my director did what he could to keep me working . But , as you know , I persisted . Why ? " She stopped and regarded him imploringly , through the romantic veil . " I have n't the smallest idea , " she continued . " Peyton had seen me again in New York ; I knew then that I meant a lot to him ; but it could n't have happened if I had n't stayed with Anette . " Her voice , her wonderment , he thought , were colored by superstition . Evidently , up to a certain point , she had resisted , and then  --  how charming it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced herself that they were intended for each other . Lee asked , " How well do you know Peyton ? " " Not at all in the way you do , " she admitted candidly ; " I understand him only with my heart . But is n't that everything ? I know that he is very pure , and does n't ordinarily care for women  --  usually I have no feeling about men  --  and that he played football at Princeton and is very strong . You have no idea , Mr. Randon , how different he is from the men I am thrown with ! There are some actors , of course , who are very fine , wonderful to work with ; but the ones not quite so finished .... It 's natural , for many reasons , in a woman to act ; but there is something , well  --  something , about men acting , as a rule ; do n't you agree ? " Lee did , and told her so with a growing pleasure in the rightness of her perceptions . " Peyton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he developed her observation ; " and it is a capital thing he did play football ; for , in the next year or so , until he grows used to your life , he 'll have a collection of men to knock down . I 'd like to tell you whatever I have discovered about him , for your own consideration , and Peyton is a snob . That is n't necessarily a term of contempt ; with him it simply means that he is impatient , doubtful , at what he does n't know . And first under that head come the arts ; they have no existence for him or his friends . A play or a book pleases him or it does n't , he approves of its limiting conventional morals , or violently condemns what he thinks is looseness , and that 's the extent of his interest . " Mina Raff gazed at him blankly , this time from under the scallops of the veil . " That is hard to believe , " she objected ; " he talks to me beautifully about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that I am going to revolutionize moving pictures  --  " " I do n't question that , " he put in ; " but did Peyton show you how it would be done ? " She hesitated , gracefully lowering her potent gaze . " Probably , " Lee Randon added keenly , " it was to happen because you were so excessively beautiful . " There was no reply to this . " I do n't need to tell you , " he admitted , " that I did my best to discourage him ; and I pointed out that the time must come when you would fancy , no , need , someone else . " " Oh , that was cruel ! " she cried softly ; " and it is n't , it wo n't be true . Do you think , just because I happen to be an actress , that I ca n't be faithful ? " " It is all a question of degree , " he instructed her , " of talent or genius . Talent may be faithful to a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal ; but the only fidelity of genius is to itself . " " I had n't thought of that , " she reflected , sadly . " Why should you ? " he demanded ; " you are being natural ; I am the disturbance , the conventional voice sentimentally reading from the call book . But you do n't have those in moving pictures : it would be a sentimentally stupid director . You must believe me : your acting will always be incomprehensible to Peyton : he will approve of the results and raise hell  --  for the comparatively short time he will last  --  with the means . Tell me this : together with his conviction that you 'd carry the stage up into heaven , did n't he speak of your retiring ? " The faint smile about her lips was a sufficient answer . That smile , he recognized , pensive and unlingering , served a wide and practical variety of purposes . " In the end , " he insisted , " Peyton will want to take you to a home in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . " She answered : " And what if I liked that , wanted it ? You must n't think my life is entirely joyful . " " I do n't , " he as promptly assured her ; " but you will never get away from it ; you will never sit contentedly through long afternoons playing bridge ; you 're cursed , if you want to call it that . " " I saw Peyton 's child , " she said at a tangent . " He had hold of the nurse 's apron in such a funny decided fist . I wanted to hug him , but I remembered that it was n't the thing to do . She has that , " a shade of defiance darkened her voice at her reference to Claire . " Babies are no longer overwhelmingly important , " Lee retorted ; " not in the face of emotion itself ; they have become a sort of unavoidable , almost an undesirable by-product . " " They wo n't be with me , " Mina Raff promised . It was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother ; her face had a tender maternal glamour , her eyes were misted with sentiment ; a superb actress . " A baby of my own , " she whispered ; " a baby and a house and Peyton . " " Nothing duller could be imagined . " Momentarily he lost his self- restraint . " You have something inimitable , supremely valuable , and you are dreaming like a rabbit . If you must be a mother , be that one on the screen , for the thrilling of millions of limited minds . " " He seemed to like me . " She had paid no attention to him , back again in the thought of the Morrises ' son . " If he did , " Lee dryly added ; " he will very soon get over it ; Ira wo n't love you conspicuously . " " Why  --  why that never entered my head , " Mina was startled ; " but , yes , how could he ? And I ca n't bear to have anyone , the most insignificant person alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . They will have to understand , be generous ; I 'll explain so it is entirely clear to them . " Her voice bore an actual note of fear , her delicate lips trembled uncontrollably . " You ca n't blame them , Ira and his mother , if they refuse to listen . Eastlake as a town will dispense with you ; and Claire 's family  --  it is really quite notable  --  will have their say wherever they live , in Charleston and London and Spain . When Ira is grown up and , in his turn , has children , they will be very bitter about your memory . However , publicly , I suppose it will do you more good than harm . The public loves such scandal ; but , with that advertisement , the other will continue . It is n't logical , I 'll admit ; except for Claire I should support you . That is where , and only where , I am dragged into your privacy . And , too , for your sake , it would have been better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one without the background of such stubborn traditions . You will have to fight them both in him  --  where they , too , may come to blame you  --  and about you . There is a strain of narrow intolerance through all that blood . " * * * * * Mina Raff 's eyes fluttered like two clear brown butterflies which , preparing to settle , had been rudely disturbed . Then her mouth was compressed , it grew firm and firmer , obdurate ; as though an internal struggle , evident in her tense immobility , had been decided against what was being powerfully urged upon her . A conviction that here , too , finally , he had failed , was in possession of Lee Randon , when he saw the determination drain from her face : it assumed a child 's expression of unreasoning primitive dread . She drew a hand across her forehead . " I shall have to think , " she told him ; " I am very much upset . It makes me cold , what you said . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Oh , I wish Peyton were here ; he 'd answer you ; he is n't a coward like me . " " Since you are so tired , and I 've been so very objectionable , I think perhaps you had better go back to your hotel , " Lee proposed . " It 's after ten . " She rose immediately , but had to remain until the waiter was summoned with their account . In her limousine she seemed smaller , more lost in her fate and money , than before . She resembled a crushed and lovely flower ; and Lee reflected that it was a shame no one was there to revive her . Mina Raff , at the Plaza , insisted , holding his hand in a mingled thoughtfulness and pictorial misery , on sending him to the Groves ' ; and his last glimpse of her , over his shoulder , was of a slight figure hurled into upper expensive mansions by an express elevator . A car not the Groves ' was outside their house ; and , as Lee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found there a Dr. Davencott and his wife , obviously on terms of close intimacy with the house . The physician was a thickly-built man with an abrupt manner continually employed in sallies of a vigorous but not unkindly humor . Lee gathered that his practice was large and select ; and he quickly saw the reason , the explanation , of this : Dr. Davencott had carried the tonic impatience of earlier years among inconsequential people into a sphere where bullying was a novelty with a direct traceable salutary effect . But whatever harshness was visible in him was tempered by his wife , who was New England , Boston itself , at its best . She had a grave charm , a wit , rather than humor , which irradiated her seriousness , and gave even her tentative remarks an air of valuable finality . To this Mrs. Grove contributed little . She practically avoided speaking to Lee Randon ; and he was certain that she was , cheaply and inexcusably , offended at him . Then , in moving , her gaze caught his , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression he had seen on her face that afternoon in the library , drawn and white with staring black eyes , came upon her . It amazed him so much that he , too , sat regarding her in an intentness which took no account of the others . One of Mrs. Grove 's hands , half hidden in green tulle , was clenched . She breathed in an audible sigh and , with what appeared to be a wrenching effort , turned from him to the general conversation . Lee Randon , losing his first impression of her attitude , was totally unable to comprehend the more difficult state that had its place . A possible explanation he dismissed before it had crystallized into thought . At the same time , the restlessness which had left him for the past twenty-four hours returned , more insistent than ever . He felt that it would be impossible to remain seated , calmly talking , for another minute . The conversation of the Davencotts that had so engaged him now only sounded like a senseless clatter of words and unendurable laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them except Savina Grove would vanish ; but why he wanted her to stay , why he wished to be alone with her , and what , in such a circumstance , he would say , were all mysteries . Lee determined to rise and make his bow , to escape ; he was aware of an indefinable oppression , like that he had often experienced during a heavy electric storm ; he had the absurd illusion that a bolt of lightning .... Lee Randon did n't stir : he sat listening with a set smile , automatic small speech , and a heart with an unsteady rising pound . The Doctor 's stories , he thought , went on unsupportably ; his wife was wise , correct , just , to a hair 's breadth . Good God , when would they go ? Now  --  there was a break in the conversation  --  he would rise and say good- night . Probably they wanted to discuss things more personal than his presence allowed and were waiting for just that . He was aware that Mrs. Grove 's gaze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; but , quite desperately , he avoided it ; he gazed up at a chandelier of glittering and coruscating glass and down at a smooth carpet with Chinese ideographs on a light background . He heard the flexible vibration of the pleasure traffic on Fifth Avenue ; and , perhaps because it was so different , it reminded him of the ringing milk cans in the early morning by his house . Lee Randon made a sharp effort to rouse himself from what threatened to be a stupor faintly lurid with conceptions of insanity ; and the result of this mental drawing himself erect was even more startling , more disconcerting , than his previous condition . It came from the realization that what animated Mrs. Grove was passion . This was incredible , but it was true ; he had never before seen , nor imagined , such an instant sultry storm of emotions held precariously in check . Beyond measure it surprised and baffled and agitated him . He understood now that sense of impending lightning ; and , at the same time , he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and that he was deafened by the reverberations . Mrs. Grove 's still pallid face , her contained , almost precise , manner , took on a new meaning  --  he saw them , fantastically , as a volcanic crust that , under observation , had hardened against the fire within . Then he was at a loss to grasp why he , Lee Randon , was permitted to see so much . His thoughts returned to himself  --  the voices of the Davencotts , of William Loyd Grove , echoed from a distance on his hearing  --  and he tried to re-arrange his bearing toward his unsought discovery : this was of enormous importance . He must at once regulate his approach to Mrs. Grove , get himself firmly in hand ; the situation , for him particularly , had far-reaching unpredictable possibilities . For all her exactness , Savina Grove had a very exclusive and definite attractiveness ; and , faced by such a dilemma , Lee had the best of reasons for doubting the ultimate regularity of his response . But he was , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , naturally , disturbing would arise ; but that assurance , the heights of reason , soon faded . There could be no doubt of the cause of Mrs. Grove 's blanched staring : just as there was no evasion of the danger created by no more than his scant recognition . Passion discovered was a thousand diameters increased ; mutually admitted , it swept aside all opposition . Lee Randon , however , had no intention of involving himself there while , ironically , he was engaged in securing for Claire Morris her husband ; he did n't propose to compromise his ease of mind with William Grove 's wife . There was , as well , the chance that she was a little unbalanced ; progressing , he might involve himself in a regrettable , a tragic , fix . He would not progress , that was all there was to that ! Lee felt better , freer already , at this resolution ; he was n't , he protested inwardly , a seducer of women ; the end itself , the consummation , of seduction , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patiently , sensual in that uncomplicated manner . No , his restlessness was more mysterious , situated deeper , than that ; it was n't so readily satisfied , drugged , dismissed . The fact struck him that it had little or no animal urgency ; and in this , it might be , he was less lucky than unlucky . Mrs. Davencott rose and resumed her wrap , retained with her on the back of the chair . Lee met the pleasant decisiveness of her capable hand , the doctor grasped his fingers with a robust witticism ; and he was replying to the Davencotts ' geniality when he had a glimpse of Mrs. Grove 's face turned slightly from him : the curve of her cheek met the pointed chin and the graceful contour of her exposed long throat ; there was the shadow of a tormenting smile on the pale vermilion of her lips , in her half closed eyes ; her hair , in that light , was black . A sensation of coldness , a spiritual shiver , went through Lee Randon ; the resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doll , to Cytherea. * * * * * When Dr. Davencott and his wife had gone Lee sank back into his chair , more disorganized by his culminating discovery than by any of the extraordinary conditions that had preceded it . Its quality of the unexpected , however , was n't enough to account for the profound effect on him ; that was buried in the secret of instinctive recognitions . " Well , the thing for me to do is to go to bed , " he said aloud , but it was no more than an unconvinced mutter , addressed to the indeterminate region of his feet . Savina Grove was standing by the door , in the place , the position , in which she had said good-bye to the Davencotts . Her flamboyant tulle skirt , contrasted with the tightly-fitting upper part of her dress , gave her , now , in the sombre crowded furnishings , the rich draped brocades , of the room , an aspect of mid-Victorian unreality . " It is for me , as well , " she agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection between their remarks was almost lost . However , neither of them made a movement to leave the drawing-room , Savina Grove returned slowly to her chair . " No one , I think , has ever found it out like that . " Her remark was without intelligible preliminary , but he grasped her meaning at once . " How you happened to stir it in me I have no idea  --  " she stopped and looked at him intently . " A terrible accident ! I would have done anything , gone any distance , to avoid it . I am unable , with you , to pretend  --  that 's curious  --  and that in itself gives me a feeling of helplessness . All sorts of impossible things are coming into my head to say to you . I must n't . " Her voice was brittle . " There is no need for you to say what would make you miserable , " he replied . " I am not in a position to question you ; at the same time I ca n't pretend  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , entirely against your will , I 've seen . I am very much , very naturally , disturbed by it ; but you have nothing to worry about . " " You say that because you do n't know , you ca n't possibly think , what goes on here , " she pressed a hand to her breast . " Why , " her words were blurred in a mounting panic , " I have lost my sense of shame with you . It 's gone . " She gazed despairingly around as if she expected to see that restraining quality embodied and recoverable in the propriety of the room . " I 'm frightened , " she gasped . Lee rose instinctively , and moved toward her with a gesture of reassurance , but she cried , " Do n't ! do n't ! do n't ! " three times with an increasing dread . He went back to his chair . " Now I have to  --  I want to  --  tell you about it , " she went on rapidly ; " it has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was hardly more than a child sitting alone ; and I have always been afraid and ashamed . The , nicest thing to call it is feeling ; but in such an insane degree ; at night it comes over me in waves , like a warm sea . I wanted and wanted love . But not in the little amounts that satisfied the others  --  the men and girls together . I could n't do any of the small things they did with safety : this  --  this feeling would sweep up over me and I 'd think I was going to die . " All that I had inherited and been told made me sure that I was horridly immodest ; I would n't , if it could be helped at all , let anyone see inside me ; I could n't have men touch me ; and whenever I began to like one I ran . It was disgusting , I was brought up to believe ; I thought there was something wrong with me , that I was a bad girl ; and I struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hidden . " It was strange , Lee told himself , that marriage , the birth of her son , had n't made her more happily normal ; and , as if she had perceived his thoughts , she added , " Even from William . It would have shocked him , sickened him , really , more than the rest . He had to dominate me , be masculine , and I had to be modest , pursued  --  when I could have killed him . " Her emotion swept her to her feet . " But I was , he thought , proper ; although it tore and beat and pounded me till I was more often ill than not . Young William nearly grew up and , because of him , I was sure I had controlled it ; but he was killed . Still , in five or six years it would be over ; and now you , I  --  " " Nothing has happened , " he heavily reiterated ; " nothing has or can happen . We are neither of us completely young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years all will be over , solved . We are both , it seems , happily married . " She interrupted him to cry , " Is anyone happily married ? Do n't we fool ourselves and does n't life fool us ? " " It 's the best course in a bad affair . " " Bah ! " She was infuriated at him . " You are like the others  --  worms in chestnuts . It is bad because you are contented . I hate life as much as you do , far more ; but I am not satisfied ; how could anyone be ? " He , too , had risen , and stood close before her . " Do n't make a mistake about me , " he warned her ; " there are a great many men whom it would be safer to tell this to . If I have n't had such a sharp struggle as you , I 've been wondering  --  yes , when I should have been happiest  --  about the uselessness of most of living . I 'm not safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe , " she whispered . With an involuntary and brutal movement he took her in his arms and kissed her with a flame-like and intolerable passion . She made no effort to avoid him , but met his embrace with an intensity that rivalled his own . When he released her she wavered and half fell on a chair across the low back of which her arm hung supinely . The lightning , he thought , had struck him . Winding in and through his surging , tempestuous emotion was an objective realization of what was happening to him : this was n't a comfortable , superficially sensual affair such as he had had with Anette . He had seen , in steel mills , great shops with perspectives of tremendous irresistible machines , and now he had the sensation of having been thrown , whirling , among them . Savina 's head went so far back that her throat was strained in a white bow . He kissed her again , with his hands crushing the cool metallic filaments of the artificial flowers on her shoulders . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfamiliar voice . This would not do , he told himself deliberately , with a separate emphasis on each word . William Grove might conceivably come in at any moment ; and there was no hope , no possibility , of his wife quickly regaining her balance ; she was as shattered , as limply weak , as though she were in a faint . " Savina , " he said , using for the first time that name , " you must get yourself together ; I ca n't have you exposed like this to accident . " She smiled wanly , in response , and then sat upright moving her body , her arms , with an air of insuperable weariness . Her expression was dazed ; but , instinctively , she rearranged her slightly disordered hair . " We must find out what has happened to us , " he went on , speaking with difficulty out of the turmoil of his being . " We are not young , " he repeated stupidly ; " and not foolish . We wo n't let ourselves be carried away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , " she assented , with an entire honesty of intention ; but her phrase mocked him ferociously . The tide of his own emotion was gathering around him with the force of a sea like that of which she had already , vividly , spoken . There was damned little of what could be recognized as admissible wisdom in him . Instead of that he was being inundated by a recklessness of desire that reached Savina 's desperate indifference to what , however threatening , might overtake her . He could n't , he had n't the inclination to , do less . Reaching up , she drew her fingers down his sleeves until they rested in his gripping hands . Her palms clung to his , and then she broke away from him : " I want to be outraged ! " Her low ringing cry seemed suppressed , deadened , as though the damask and florid gilt and rosewood , now inexpressibly shocked , had combined to muffle the expression , the agony , of her body . Even Lee Randon was appalled before the nakedness left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She should have said that , he realized , unutterably sad , long ago , to William Grove . But , instead , she had told him ; and , whatever the consequences might be , he must meet them . He had searched for this , for the potency in which lay the meaning of Cytherea , and he had found it . He had looked for trouble , and it was his in the realization alone that he could not , now , go home tomorrow morning . * * * * * In his room the tropical fruits and whiskey and cigarettes were by his bed , the percolator ready for morning ; and , stopping in his preparations for the night , he mixed himself a drink and sat moodily over it . What had happened downstairs seemed , more than anything else , astounding ; Mrs. Grove , Savina , had bewildered him with the power , the bitterness , of her feeling . At the thought of her shaken with passionate emotion his own nerves responded and the racing of his blood was audible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; dwelling on it , the memory was almost as sharply pleasant as the reality ; yet he was n't concerned with the present , but of the future  --  tomorrow . He should , probably , get home late in the afternoon or in the evening ; and what he told himself was that he would n't come back to the Groves , to Savina . The risk , the folly , was too great . Recalling his conclusions about the attachments of men of his age , he had no illusion about the possibly ideal character of an intimacy with William Grove 's wife ; she , as well , had illuminated that beyond any obscurity of motive or ultimate result . Lee 's mind shifted to a speculation about the cause of their  --  their accident . No conscious act , no desire , of his had brought it on them ; and it was evident that no conscious wish of hers had materialized their unrestrainable kisses . Savina 's life , beyond question , must have been largely spent in hiding , combatting , her secret  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , Lee Randon did n't try to tell himself that no other man had shared his discovery ; indeed , Savina , too , had wisely avoided that challenge to his experience and wisdom . Like her he deliberately turned away from the past ; and , in the natural chemistry of that act , the provision for his masculine egotism , it was dissolved into nothingness . He was concentrated on the incident in the library : dancing with her , he had held her in a far greater , a prolonged , intimacy of contact ; something in the moment , a surprising of her defences , a slight weariness in a struggle which must often seem to her unendurable , had betrayed her . Nothing , then , than what had occurred , could have been farther from his mind ; he had never connected Mrs. Grove with such a possibility ; she had n't , the truth was , at first attracted him in that way . Now he thought that he had been blind to have missed her resemblance to Cytherea . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , since , with so much to consider , he badly needed an accounting . It was n't simply , here , that he had kissed a married woman ; there was nothing revolutionary or specially threatening in that ; it was the sensation of danger , of lightning , the recognition of that profoundly disturbing countenance , which filled him with gravity and a determined plan of restraint . He recalled the fact that both Peyton Morris and Mina had insisted that they had not been responsible for what had overtaken them ; at the time he had not credited this , he was certain that some significant preliminaries had been indulged in ; but positively Savina and he had been swept off their feet . A sense of helplessness , of the extreme danger of existence , permeated and weakened his opposing determination  --  he had no choice , no freedom of will ; nothing august , in him or outside , had come to his assistance . In addition to this , he was  --  as in maturity he had always been  --  without a convenient recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savina was a helpless sense of tragedy , that and a hatred for the world , for the tepid society , which had no use for high passion . To have kissed her , under the circumstances , appeared to him not only natural , but inevitable ; and he was suffering from no feeling of guilt ; neither toward William Grove , in whose house he was a guest , nor to Fanny  --  those widely heralded attitudes were largely a part of a public hypocrisy which had no place in the attempted honesty of his thoughts . Lee was merely mapping out a course in the direction of worldly wisdom . Then , inconsistently leaving that promise of security , he reviewed every moment , every thrilling breath , with Savina Grove after the Davencotts had gone : he felt , in exact warm similitude , her body pressed against his , her parted lips ; he heard the little escaping " Ah ! " of her fervor . He put his glass down abruptly and tramped from wall to wall , his unbuttoned silk waistcoat swinging about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savina , but most of all he cursed William Grove , sleeping in complacent ignorance beside his wife . His imagination , aroused and then defrauded , became violent , wilfully obscene , and his profanity emerged from thought to rasping sound . His forehead , he discovered , was wet , and he dropped once more into the chair by the laden tray , took a deep drink from a fresh concoction . " This wo n't do , " he said ; " it 's crazy . " And he resumed the comforting relief that tomorrow would be different : he 'd say good-bye to the Groves together and , in four hours , he 'd be back in Eastlake . The children , if he took a late train , would be in bed , and Fanny , with her feet on the stool , engaged with her fancy work . Then his revolving thoughts took him back to the unanswered mystery of what , actually , had happened to Savina and him . He lost her for Cytherea , he lost Cytherea in her ; the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , merged to confound him . In the consideration of Savina and himself , he discovered that they , too , were alike ; yet , while he had looked for a beauty , a quality , without a name , a substance , Savina wanted a reality every particle of which she had experienced and achingly knew . He , more or less , was troubled by a vision , but her necessity was recognizable in flesh . There , it might be again , she was more fortunate , stronger , superior . It did n't matter . No inclination to sleep drugged the activity of his mind or promised him the release , the medicine , of a temporary oblivion . He had a recurrence of the rebellious spirit , in which he wondered if Grove did sleep in the same room with Savina . And then increasingly he got what he called a hold on himself . All that troubled him seemed to lift , to melt into a state where the hopeless was irradiated with tender memories . His mood changed to a pervasive melancholy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ambitions that , without form or encouragement , had gone down before definite developments . When he spoke of these , tentatively , to Fanny , she always replied serenely that she was thankful for him as he was , she would not have liked him to be anything queer . But if he had met Savina first , and married her , his career would have been something else entirely ; now , probably  --  so fiercely their combined flame would have burned  --  it would be over . However , during its course  --  he drew in a long audible breath . It was no good thinking of that ! He completed his preparations for the night ; but he still lingered , some of the drink remained . Lee was glad that he had grown quieter , reflective , middle-aged ; it was absurd , undignified , for him to imitate the transports of the young . It pleased him , though , to realize that he was n't done , extinguished , yet ; he might play court tennis  --  it was n't as violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lapsed agility ; better still , he 'd ride more , take three days a week , he could well afford to , instead of only Saturday and holidays in the country . It was a mistake to disparage continually the life , the pleasures and friends , he had  --  the friends he had gathered through long arduous years of effort . He must grow more familiar with Helena and Gregory , too ; no one had handsomer or finer children . And there was Fanny  --  for one friend of his she had ten ; she was universally liked and admired . Lee was , at last , in bed ; but sleep continued to evade him . He did n't fall asleep , but sank into a waking dose ; his mind was clear , but not governed by his conscious will ; it seemed to him that there was no Savina Grove , but only Cytherea ; her smile , her fascination , everywhere followed him . A damned funny business , life ! At times its secret , the meaning of love , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by knowledge , his thoughts would break , grow confused , and leave him still baffled . Lee Randon was startled to find the brightness of morning penetrating his eyes ; ready for his bath , with the percolator choking and bubbling in the next room , he rehearsed , reaffirmed , all that he had decided the night before . No one was with him at the breakfast table elaborate with repousse silver and embroidered linen and iced fruit ; but , returning upstairs , he saw Savina in her biscuit-colored suit in the library . " William had to go to Washington , " she told him ; " he left his regrets . " She was , Lee perceived , almost haggard , with restless hands ; but she did n't avoid his gaze . She stood by the table , one hand , gloved , slightly behind her on it . Bending forward he kissed her more intently , more passionately , more wholly , than ever before . * * * * * " I had n't meant to do that , " he said ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had once made it up , it discharged itself , in a condition where it was no longer valid , in spite of him . Savina replied with a silent smile . Her drawn appearance had gone ; she was animated , sparkling , with vitality ; even her body seemed fuller . " We shall have a long unbroken day together , " she told him ; " I have to go out for an hour , and then it will begin , here , I think , with lunch . " " I ought to be back in Eastlake , " he confessed . " Do n't think of that till it comes . Eastlake has had you a long time , compared with a day . But there are days and days . " They kissed each other . " I 'll go now . " She kissed Lee . " Lunch will be at two . " He kissed her . He did n't leave the library until a maid announced that lunch was ready and the fact of her return . At the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luxurious feeling  --  where Savina was concerned  --  of security ; there was no need to hurry ; the day lengthened out into the night and an infinity of happy minutes and opportunities . They discussed , however , what to do with it . " I 'd like to go out to dinner , " she decided ; " and then a theatre , but nothing more serious than a spectacle : any one of the Follies . I am sick of Carnegie Hall and pianists and William 's solemn box at the Opera ; and afterwards we 'll go back to that caf ? and drink champagne and dance . " That , he declared , with a small inner sinking at the thought of Fanny , would be splendid . " And this afternoon  --  ? " " We 'll be together . " They returned to the library  --  more secluded from servants and callers than the rooms on the lower floor  --  where , at one end of the massive lounge , they smoked and Savina talked . " I hardly went to sleep at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you every second . Do you think your wife would like me ? " She asked the vain question which no woman in her situation seemed able to avoid . " Of course , " he lied heroically . " I want her to , although I ca n't , somehow , connect you with her ; I ca n't see you married . No doubt because I do n't want to ; it makes me wretched . " She half turned in his arms , pressed hard against him , and plunged her gaze into his . " It often seems strange to me , " he admitted , caught in the three-fold difficulty of the truth , his feeling for her , and a complete niceness in whatever touched Fanny . He attempted to explain . " Everything about my home is perfect , but , at times , and I ca n't make out why , it does n't seem mine . It might , from the way I feel , belong to another man  --  the house and Fanny and the children . I stand in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though what were around me had lasted somehow from the dream into life . " He repeated to her the process of his thoughts , feelings , at once so familiar and inexplicable . She was n't , he found , deeply interested in his explanation ; she was careless of anything but the immediate present . Savina never mentioned William Grove . Animated by countless tender inventive expressions of her passion , she gave the impression of listening to the inflections of his voice rather than attending , considering , its meanings . She was more fully surrendered to the situation than he . The disorganized fragments of a hundred ideas and hints poured in rapid succession , back of his dominating emotion , through Lee 's brain . He lost himself only in waves  --  the similitude to the sea persisted  --  regular , obliterating , but separate . Savina was far out in a tideless deep that swept the solidity of no land . She was plastically what he willed ; blurred , drunk , with sensation , she sat clasping rigidly the edge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited : the surges of physical desire , rising and inundating , saturating him , broke continually and left him with the partly-formed whirling ideas . He named , to himself , the thing that hung over them ; he considered it and put it away ; he deferred the finality of their emotion . In this he was inferior , he became even slightly ridiculous  --  they could n't continue kissing each other with the same emphasis hour after hour , and the emphasis could not be indefinitely multiplied ; rather than meet the crescendo he drew into his region of cental obscurity . Lee had to do this , he reminded himself , in view of Savina 's utter surrender : he was responsible for whatever happened . Even here his infernal queerness  --  that the possession of the flesh was n't what primarily moved him  --  was pursuing him : a peculiarity , he came to think , dangerously approaching the abnormal . In addition to that , however , he was not ready , prepared , to involve his future ; for that , with Savina Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means absent from his mind , his wife and certain practical realities . And , as he had told himself before , he was not a seducer . What adventures he had accepted had been the minor experiments of his restlessness , and they all ended in the manner that had finished him with Anette , in dissatisfaction and a sense of waste . Savina stirred and sighed . " I must ring for tea , " she said regretfully ; and , while the servant arranged the pots and decanters and pitchers , the napkins and filled dishes , Lee paced up and down , smoking . When they were again alone her fingers stole under his arm : " I adore you for  --  for everything . " She had evaded the purpose of her speech . He wondered , with the exasperation of his over-wrought physical suspense , if she did . His ravishment had suffered a sharp natural decline reflected in a mental gloom . For the moment he desired nothing , valued nothing . And , in this mood , he became talkative ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she listened with a rapt , transported , attention . It stopped as suddenly as it had begun , in a silence coincident with dusk . The room slowly lost its sombre color and the sense of the confining walls ; it became grey and apparently limitless ; as monotonous , Lee Randon thought , as life . He was disturbed by a new feeling : that perversely , trivially , he had spoiled what should have been a priceless afternoon . It would never come back ; what a fool he had been to waste in aimless talk any of the few hours which together they owned . He whispered this to Savina , in his arms ; but she would permit no criticism of him . It was time , she discovered , for them to dress for their party : " I do n't want you to go . Why ca n't you be with me ? But then , the servants ! Lee , I am going to die when you leave . Tell me , how can I live , what am I to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible , he stopped her troubled voice with a kiss . It was remarkable how many they had exchanged . He had the feeling , the hope , that , with nothing irrevocable consummated , their parting would be easier ; but he began to lose that comfortable assurance . Again in his room , in the heavy choking folds of velvet draperies , he was grave ; the mere excitation of the night before had gone . What was this , he asked himself , that he had got into ? What had Cytherea to do with it ? Ungallantly the majority of his thoughts were engaged with the possibility , the absolute necessity , of escape . By God , he must get out of it , or rather , get it out of him ! But it was n't too late ; he could even finish the day , this delight , with safety . Savina would recover  --  she had already thanked him for his self- control . It was fortunate that she was a woman of distinction , of responsibilities , with a delicate habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Eastlake . He recalled a story of George Sand tearing off her bodice before the house of a man she loved . Yet ... why had n't he gone quietly away , early in the morning , before Savina was up ? He was appalled at the depths to which he had fallen , the ignominious appearance that interrogated him from the pier-glass ; Lee saw himself in the light of a coward  --  a cheap , safe sensation- maker . Nothing was more contemptible . Damn it to hell , what was he ? Where was he ? Either he ought to go home or not , and the not carried the fullest possible significance . But he did n't want to do one or the other  --  he wanted Cytherea , or Savina , on some absurd impracticable plane , and Fanny too . Why could n't he go home when home was uppermost in his thoughts and do something else when it was n't ? Did the fact that Fanny might happen to want him annul all his liberty in living ; or , in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one ? * * * * * It was inevitable to the vacillating state of his being that , finding Savina in an exceptionally engaging black dress with floating sleeves of sheer lace and a string of rare pearls , he should forget all his doubts in the pleasure of their intimacy . Even now , in response to his gaze , her face lost its usual composure and became pinched , stricken , with feeling . Lee Randon was possessed by a recklessness that hardened him to everything but the present moment : such times were few in existence , hours of vivid living which alone made the dull weight of years supportable . This belonged to Savina and him ; they were accountable only to each other . It was a sensation like the fortunate and exhilarating effect of exactly the right amount of wine . The emotion that flooded them had freed Lee from responsibility ; sharpening one set of perceptions , it had obliterated the others , creating a spirit of holiday from which nothing prosaic , utilitarian , should detract . They had n't yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside into a small reception room to embrace and consider , they selected the Lafayette , because its Continental air assisted the illusion of their escape from all that was familiar and perfunctory . Their table , by a railing overlooking the sweep of the salle ? manger , was precisely placed for their happiness . It was so narrow that the heels of Savina 's slippers were sharply pressed into his insteps ; when her hand fell forward it rested on his . Lee ordered a great deal , of which very little was eaten ; the hors d'oeuvre appeared and vanished , followed by the soup and an entr ? e ; a casserole spread the savory odor of its contents between them ; the salad was crisply , palely green , and ignored ; and , before it seemed humanly possible , he had his cigar and was stirring the French coffee . " Shall we be late for the theatre ? " he asked indifferently . " I have n't the least interest in it , " Savina assured him ; " I ca n't imagine why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we have each other ? " " Our own private Folly . " He smiled at her . " Not that " she reproved him ; " I ca n't bear to think of it in a small way . Why , it will be all I 'll ever have  --  I shall never think of anyone else like this again ; and you 'll go back , you 'll go away . But I hope you wo n't forget me , not at once  --  you must keep me in your heart for a little . " " I 'll never be able to get you out , " he declared . " You want to , then , and I am  --  " She lost control of herself as though she had passed into a hypnosis , uniquely frozen with passion , incapable of movement , of the accommodation of her sight ; her breathing was slow , almost imperceptible in its shallowness . " I am a part of you , " Savina went on when she had recovered . " It would kill me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her heel cut until he thought he was bleeding . " What ? " he asked , through the thin azure smoke of the cigar . She shook her head contentedly : " I do n't care ; I have  --  now , anyway  --  what I wish , what I 've always wished for  --  you . I did n't know it was you right away , how could I ? Not even when we had tea , and talked about Mina and your young Morris , that first afternoon . It was the next day before I understood . Why was n't it long long ago , when I was a girl , twelve years old ? Yes , quite that early . Is n't it queer , Lee , how I have been troubled by love ? It bothers hardly anyone else , it scarcely touches the rest . There is a lot of talk about it , but , all the while , people detest it . They are always wearing dresses and pretentions they ca n't afford to have mussed . It  --  I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their silly society and morals ... like a strong light thrown on something shabby . " Once more he had the feeling that , before the actuality of Savina 's tragic necessity , his own speculations were merely visionary , immaterial ; yet he tried to put them into words , to explain , so far as he was able , what it was in him that was hers . But he did this omitting , perhaps , the foundation of all that he was trying to say  --  he did n't speak of Cytherea . He avoided putting the doll into words because he could think of none that would make his meaning , his attachment , clear . Lee could n't , very well , across the remnants of dinner , admit to Savina that a doll bought out of a confectioner 's window on Fifth Avenue so deeply influenced him . He had n't lost Cytherea in Savina so much as , vitalized , he had found her . And , while he had surrendered completely to the woman and emotion , at the same time the immaterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define it , persisted . The difference between Savina and himself was this : while she was immersed , obliterated , satisfied , in her passion , a part of him , however small , stayed aside . It did n't control him , but simply went along , like a diminutive and wondering child he had by the hand . Cytherea , at this moment , would be softly illuminated by the shifting glow of the fire and , remote in her magical perspective , would seem at the point of moving , of beckoning for him with her lifted hand . " What were you seeing in the smoke ? " Savina asked ; and he replied with an adequate truth , " You . " " Why not just look at me , then , instead of staring ? " " I see you everywhere . " " Adorable , " she whispered . No such name , no terms of endearment , occurred to him for her ; why , he did n't know ; but they had no place in his present situation . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touched other special women . The words which had always been the indispensable property of such affairs were now distasteful to him . They seemed to have a smoothly false , a brassy , ring ; while he was fully , even gaily , committed , he had a necessity to make his relationship with Savina Grove wholly honest . As he paid the account she asked him if he were rich . " Your husband would n't think so , " he replied ; " yet I am doing well enough ; I can afford dinner and the theatre . " " I wish you had a very great deal of money . " " Why ? " He gazed at her curiously . " It 's so useful , " Savina told him generally ; but that , he felt , was not completely what was in her mind . " What I have , " she went on , " is quite separate from William 's . It is my mother 's estate . " " My brother , Daniel , has done very well in Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never been there ; cooler climates are supposed to suit my heart better ; but I know I should love it  --  the close burning days and intense nights . " " Daniel tells me there 's usually the trade wind at night . " His voice reflected his lack of concern . " I have a feeling , " she persisted , " that I am more of Havana than I am , for example , of Islesboro . Something in the tropics and the people , the Spanish ! Those dancing girls in gorgeous shawls , they have n't any clothes underneath ; and that nakedness , the violence of their passions , the danger and the knives and the windows with iron bars , stir me . It 's all so different from New York . I want to burn up with a red flower in my hair and not cool into stagnation . " They were in her closed automobile , where it was faintly scented by roses yellow and not crimson . She sat upright , withdrawn from him , with her hands clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mina Raff 's ; what a contradiction the two women , equally vital , presented . And Fanny , perhaps no less forceful , was still another individual . Lee Randon was appalled at the power lying in the fragile persons of women . It controlled the changeless and fateful elements of life ; while the strength of men , it occurred to him further , was concerned with such secondary affairs as individual ambitions and a struggle eternally condemned to failure . Savina relaxed , every instinct and nerve turned toward him , but they were at the theatre . The performance had been on , an usher told them , for almost three quarters of an hour . Their seats were in the fifth row , the middle ; and there was an obscured resentful stirring as they took their places . Plunged into darkness , their hands and shoulders and knees met . Savina , scarcely above her breath , said " Ah ! " uncontrollably ; she was so charged with emotion that her body seemed to vibrate , a bewildering warmness stole through him from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionless depths . The brightness of the stage , at first , had no more form nor meaning than the whirling pattern of a kaleidoscope , against which the people around him were unsubstantial silhouettes , blind to the ardor that merged Savina and him into one sentient form alone in a world of shadows . * * * * * The spectacle on the stage , Russian in motive , was set in harmonized barbaric color  --  violent movements under a diffused light : in the background immobile peasant-like figures held tall many-branched candlesticks ; there were profane gold mitres , vivid stripes and morocco leather ; cambric chemises slipping from breasts and the revelation of white thighs . It floated , like a vision of men 's desire realized in beautiful and morbid symbols , above the darkened audience ; it took what , in the throng , was imperfect , fragmentary , and spent , but still strong , brutal , formless , and converted it into a lovely and sterile pantomime . Yet there was no sterility in what had , primarily , animated it ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament , from purpose to a delight with no issue beyond that . Over it there hung , for Lee Randon , the pale radiance of Cytherea . Other visions and spectacles followed , they melted one into the next , sensations roused by the flexible plaited thongs of desire . Lee , stupefied in the heavy air of his own sensuality , saw the pictorial life on the stage as an accompaniment , the visualization , of his obsession . It was over suddenly , with a massing of form and sound ; Lee and Savina Grove were pitilessly drowned in light . Crushed together in the crowded , slowly emptying aisle , her pliable body , under its wrap , followed his every movement . On the street , getting into the automobile , she directed Adamson to drive through the park . " I do n't want to go to the Malmaison , " she told Lee . Her ungloved fingers worked a link from his cuff and her hand crept up his arm . The murmur of her voice was ceaseless , like a low running and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no louder , but changed , unexpected , she said : " Lee , I love you . " It startled him ; its effect was profound  --  now that it had been said he was completely delivered to his gathering sense of the inevitable . It secured , like a noose , all his intentions ; he was neither glad nor sorry ; what was the use ? His own feeling  --  if this were love and what love was  --  eluded him . Above every other recognition , though , was a consciousness of impending event . What happened now , in the car rapidly approaching Central Park , was unimportant , without power to contain him in its moment . They turned in at the Fifty-ninth Street entrance : through the glass there was a shifting panorama of black branches , deserted walks and benches and secretive water . He saw vaguely the Belvedere , the Esplanade fountain , and the formal length of the Mall , together with  --  flung against the sky  --  the multitudinous lighted windows of Central Park West , the high rippling shimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars passed , swift and soundless , he saw their occupants and then they were gone : an aged man whose grey countenance might have been moulded in sand with a frigid trained nurse ; a couple desperately embracing in a taxi-cab ; a knot of chattering women in dinner dresses and open furs ; another alone , painted , at once hard and conciliatory , hurrying to an appointment . The tension , his suspense , increased until he thought it must burst out the windows . Between the shudders and the kissing he kept wondering when .... It was Savina , at the speaking-tube , who commanded their return . They left the Park for Fifth Avenue , Sixty-sixth Street . Lee got out , but she did n't follow . He waited expectantly . The night had grown very much colder . Why , in the name of God , did n't she come ? " In a moment " he heard her say faintly . But when she moved it was with decision ; there was no hesitation in her manner of mounting the stone steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Savina , and then to take Lee 's hat and coat and stick . Savina turned to him , holding out her hand , speaking in a high steady voice : " Thank you very much  --  was n't it nice ?  --  and good-night . " Without another word , giving him no opportunity to speak , to reply , she turned neither hurried nor slow to the stairway . He was dumfounded , and showed it , he was sure , in the stupidity of his fixed gesture of surprise . The emotion choked in his throat was bitter with a sense of ill-treatment . To cover his confusion , he searched obviously through his pockets for a cigarette case which he had left , he knew , in his overcoat . Then , when the servant had retired , he softly cursed . However , the bitterness , his anger , were soon lost in bewilderment ; that , with the appearance of resolving itself into a further mystery , carried him up to his room . With a mixed drink on a dressing-case , he wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one possibility . Piece by piece , at long intervals , he removed his clothes , found his pajamas and dressing-gown , and washed . The drink he discovered later untouched and he consumed it almost at a gulp . Lee poured out another , and a third ; but they had no effect on him . In spite of them he suffered a mild collapse of the nerves ; his hands were without feeling , at once like marble and wet with sweat ; his heart raced . A pervading weariness and discouragement followed this . He was in a hellish mess , he told himself fiercely . The bravado of the words temporarily gave him more spirit ; yet there was nothing he could do but go to bed . Nothing else had been even hinted at ; he turned off the lights and opened the windows . Flares of brightness continued to pass before his eyes , and , disinclined to the possibilities of sleep , he propped himself up with an extra pillow . Then , illogically , he wondered if he had locked the door ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrained himself  --  if , subconsciously , he had , chance and not he had worked ; for or against him , what did it matter ? He looked at the illuminated dial of his watch ; the hands , the numerals , greenly phosphorescent , were sharp ; it was midnight . After apparently an interminable wait he looked again  --  six minutes past twelve . The rumble of an elevated train approached , hung about the room , and receded . Death could be no more dragging than this . Why , then , did n't he fall asleep ? Lee went over and over every inflection of Savina 's final words to him ; in them he tried , but vainly , to find encouragement , promise , any decision or invitation . What , in the short passage from the automobile to the house , could have so wholly changed , frozen , her ? Had she , at that late opportunity , remembering the struggle , the tragic unrelenting need , to keep herself aloof from passion , once more successfully fled ? Was she  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He woke , stirred , convulsively : it was after one o'clock now . The craving for a cigarette finally moved him ; and , in the dark , he felt around for those , the Dimitrinos , on the tray . The cigarette at an end , he sank back on the pillows , deciding that he must take the earliest train possible toward Eastlake . He had missed a directors ' meeting today , and there was another tomorrow that he must attend , at his office . Then he grew quieter ; the rasping of his nerves ceased ; it was as though , suddenly , they had all been loosened , the strung wires unturned . What a remarkable adventure he had been through ; not a detail of it would ever fade from his memory  --  a secret alleviation for advancing old age , impotence . And this , the most romantic occurrence of his life , had happened when he was middle-aged , forty-seven and worse , to be exact . He looked again at his watch , but now only from a lingering uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present peace that settled over him seemed the most valuable thing life had to offer ; it was not like the end of effort , but resembled a welcome truce , a rest with his force unimpaired , from which he would wake to the tonic winter realities of tomorrow . An early train  --  In the act of dropping , half asleep , into the position of slumber , he halted sharply , propped up on an elbow . A sense invaded him of something unusual , portentous , close by . There was n't a sound , a flicker of audible movement , a break in the curtain of dark ; yet he was breathless in a strained oppressive attention . It was impossible to say whether his disturbance came from within or without , whether it was in his pounding blood or in the room around him . Then he heard a soft thick settling rustle , the sound a fur coat might make falling to the floor ; and , simultaneously , a vague slender whiteness appeared on the night . A swift conviction fastened on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , for so long , he had invited . Out of the insubstantiality a whispering voice spoke to him : " Lee , where are you ? It 's so cold . " IV Twice , the following day , Lee telephoned to Fanny , but neither time was she in the house ; and , kept at his office , he was obliged to take an inconvenient train that made a connection for Eastlake . When Lee reached the countryside opening in the familiar hilly vistas he had , in place of the usual calm recognitions through a run of hardly more than an hour , a sense of having come a long way to a scene from which he had been absent for years . It appeared to him remarkably tranquil and self- contained  --  safe was the word which came to him . He was glad to be there , but at indeterminate stations rather than in Eastlake . He dreaded , for no plainly comprehended reason , his return home . The feelings that , historically , he should have owned were all absent . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ; but Lee was forced to admit to himself that he was not invaded by a very lively sense of guilt . He made a conventional effort to see his act in the light of a grave fault  --  whatever was attached to the charge of adultery  --  but it failed before the conviction that the whole thing was sad . His sorrow was for Savina , for the suffering of her past , the ordeal of the present , and the future dreariness . There had been no suggestion of wrong in her surrender , no perceptible consciousness of shame : it was exactly as though , struggling to the limit of endurance against a powerful adverse current , she had turned and swept with it . The fact was that the entire situation was utterly different from the general social and moral conception of it ; and Lee began to wonder which were stronger  --  the individual truth or the imposed dogmatic weight of the world . But the latter , he added , would know nothing of this . Concisely , there was to be no repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Randon had completely and sharply focussed the most adverse possible attitude toward that : he saw it without a redeeming feature and bare of any chance of pleasure . His need for honesty , however special , was outraged on every facet by the thought of an intrigue . Lee reconstructed it in every detail  --  he saw the moments , doubtful and hurried and surreptitious , snatched in William Grove 's house ; the servants , with their penetration of the tone of an establishment , knowing and insufferable ; he lived over the increasing dissatisfaction with quick embraces in the automobile , and the final indignities of lying names and rooms of pandering and filthy debasement . The almost inevitable exposure followed , the furies and hysterical reproaches . That , indeed , would have involved them fatally : in such circumstances the world would be invincible , crushing ; holding solidly its front against such dangerous assault , it would have poured over Savina and him a conviction of sin in which they would unavoidably have perished . As it was , he had told her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery  --  that they were to a marked degree superior : he could find no more remorse at his heart than Savina showed . This , exactly , was his inner conviction  --  that , since he had given something not in Fanny 's possession , he had robbed her of nothing . It was a new idea to him and it required careful thought , a slow justification . It answered , perhaps , once and for all , his question about the essential oneness of marriage . Yes , that was a misconception ; marriage in an ideal state he was n't considering , but only his own individual position . To love but one woman through this life and into a next would be blissful ... if it were possible ; there might be a great deal saved  --  but by someone else  --  in heroically supporting such an Elysian tenet ; Lee Randon definitely had n't the necessary utopianism . Love was n't a sacred fluid held in a single vessel of alabaster ; marriage did n't conveniently create shortsightedness . Lee could n't pretend to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savina . Her attitude , he knew , in that it never touched the abstract , was far simpler than his ; she did n't regard herself as scarlet , but thought of the rest of the world as unendurably drab . The last thing she had said to him was that she was glad , glad , that it had happened . This , too , in Savina , had preserved them from the slightest suggestion of inferiority : the night assumed no resemblance to a disgraceful footnote on the page of righteousness . It was complete  --  and , by God , admirable !  --  within itself . No one , practically , would agree with him , and here , in the fact that no one ever could know , his better wisdom was shown . About love , the thing itself , his perceptions remained dim : he had loved Fanny enormously at the time of their wedding and he loved her now , so many years after ; but his feeling  --  as he had tried so unfortunately to tell her  --  was n't the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an old tempestuous need had returned . Yet , until he had gone to the Groves ' , his restlessness had been trivial , hardly more than academic , a half-smiling interest in a doll ; but now , after he had left the realm of fancy for an overt act , a full realization of his implication was imperative . Without it he would be unable to preserve any satisfactory life with Fanny at all ; his uneasiness must merely increase , become intolerable . Certainly there was a great , it should be an inexhaustible , amount of happiness for him in his wife , his children and his home ; he would grow old and negative with them , and there die . But a lot of mental re-adjustment , understanding , was necessary first . Suddenly the minor adventures and sensations of the past had become , even before the completeness of the affair with Savina , insuperably distasteful to him ; he simply could n't look forward to a procession of them reaching to impotence . No , no , no ! That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impoverish himself by the cheap flinging away of small coin from his ultimate store . He did n't , equally , wish to keep on exasperating Fanny in small ways . That pettiness was wholly to blame for what discomfort he had had . His wife 's claim was still greater on him than any other 's ; and what , now , he could n't give her must be made up in different ways . This conviction invested him with a fresh sense of dignity and an increasing regard for Fanny . What a shame it was that he could not go quietly to her with all this , tell her everything . A lie was rooted , concealed , beyond removal at the base of the honesty he planned . There was , of course , this additional phase of the difficulty  --  what had happened concerned Savina even more than it did his wife and him . He had Savina Grove , so entirely in his hands , to guard . And the innate animosity of women toward women was incalculable . That was n't a new thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As much as he desired it , utter frankness , absolute safety , was impossible . Fanny 's standard of duty , or responsibility , was worlds apart from his . Bitterly and without premeditation he cursed the tyranny of sex ; in countless forms it dominated , dictated , every aspect of life . Men 's conception of women was quite exclusively founded on it in its aspects of chastity or license . In the latter they deprecated the former , and in the first they condemned all trace of the latter . The result of this was that women , the prostitutes and the mothers alike , as well , had no other validity of judgment . The present marriage was hardly more than an exchange of the violation of innocence , or of acted innocence , for an adequate material consideration . If this were not true , why was innocence  --  a silly fact in itself  --  so insisted upon ? Lee was forced to conclude however , that it was the fault of men : they turned , at an advancing age when it was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By that time their emotions were apt to be almost desperately variable . In his case it had been different  --  but life was different , easier , when he had married  --  and his wedding most appropriate to felicity . Yet that , against every apparent reason to the contrary , had vanished , and left him this calm determining of his fate . Through his thoughts a quirk of memory ran like a tongue of flame . He felt Savina 's hand under his cuff ; he felt her sliding , with her arms locked about his neck , out of her furs in the automobile ; a white glimmer , a whisper , she materialized in the coldness of the night . There was a long-drawn wailing blast from the locomotive  --  they were almost entering the train- shed at Eastlake . When Fanny expected him , and it was possible , she met him at the station ; but tonight he would have to depend on one of the rattling local motor hacks . Still , he looked for her and was faintly and unreasonably disappointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house , invaded the preparation of a warm greeting . * * * * * Fanny was seated at dinner , and she interrupted her recognition of his arrival to order his soup brought in . " It 's really awfully hard to have things nice when you come at any time , " she said in the voice of restraint which usually mildly irritated him . He was apt to reply shortly , unsympathetically ; but , firm in the determination to improve the tone of his relations with Fanny , he cheerfully met the evidence of her sense of injury . " Of course , " she added , " we expected you yesterday up to the very last minute . " When he asked her who exactly she meant by we she answered , " The Rodmans and John and Alice Luce . It was all arranged for you . Borden Rodman sent us some ducks ; I remembered how you liked them , and I asked the others and cooked them myself . That 's mixed , but you know what I mean . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprouts ; and I sent to town for the alligator pears and meringue . I suppose it ca n't be helped , and it 's all over now , but you might have let me know . " " I am sorry , Fanny , " he acknowledged ; " at the last so much piled up to do . Mina Raff was very doubtful . I ca n't tell if I accomplished anything with her or not . " Fanny seemed to have lost all interest in Peyton Morris 's affair . " I had dinner with Mina and talked a long while . At bottom she is sensible enough ; and very sensitive . I like sensitive women . " " You mean that you like other women to be sensitive , " she corrected him ; " whenever I am , you get impatient and say I 'm looking for trouble . " There was , he replied , a great deal in what she said ; and it must be remedied . At this she gazed at him for a speculative second . " Where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and what did you do afterward ? " He told her . " She was so tired that she went back to the Plaza before ten . No , I returned to the Groves ' . It 's no good being in New York alone . We 'll have our party together there before Christmas . " " I imagined you 'd see a lot of her . " " Of Mina Raff ? What nonsense ! She is working all day and practically never goes out . People have such wrong ideas about actresses , or else they have changed and the opinions have stood still . They are as business-like now as lawyers ; you make an appointment with their secretaries . Besides that , Mina does n't specially attract me . " " At any rate you call her Mina . " " Why so I do ; I had n't noticed ; but she has n't started to call me Lee ; I must correct her . " " They played bridge afterward , " Fanny said , referring , he gathered , to the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Luces did , and I sat around . People are too selfish for anything ! " Her voice grew sharper . " They stayed until after twelve , just because Borden was nineteen dollars back at one time . And they drank all that was left of your special Mount Vernon . It was last night that you were at the St. Regis ? " " No , " he corrected her , " the night before . Last evening I had dinner with the Groves . " This was so nearly true that he advanced it with satisfaction . " Afterward we went to the Greenwich Follies . " " I do n't see how you had to wait , then , " she observed instantly . " You were in New York on account of Claire , you stayed three nights , and only saw Mina Raff once . " He told her briefly that , unexpectedly , more had turned up . " What did you do the first night ? " she persisted . " I dragged a cash girl into an opium place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be borne , " she returned ; " and it does n't altogether answer my question . " " We went to Malmaison . " " We ? " she mimicked his earlier query . " Oh , the Groves . I like them very much , Fanny  --  " To her interruption that that was evident he paid no attention . " He is an extremely nice man , a little too conscious of his pedestal , but solid and cordial . Mrs. Grove is more unusual ; I should say she was a difficult woman to describe . She dresses beautifully , Paris and the rest of it ; but she is n't a particle good-looking . Not a bit ! It 's her color , I think . She has n't any . Women would fancy her more than men ; no one could call her pleasant . " " You have n't asked about the children . " She had apparently heard nothing of what had gone before . " Of course they are all right or you 'd have told me . " " Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times I think you forget you have a family . We 'll all be dead before you know it . I 'm sorry , but you will have to get into the habit of staying home at least one night a week . I attend to all I can manage about the place , but there are some things you must settle . The trouble is I have n't demanded enough from you . " " That 's silly , " he responded , almost falling into his discarded irritation ; " I practically never go out without you . Unless you are with me I wo n't be in New York again for weeks . " " I should have thought you 'd be back at the Groves 's tomorrow . It 's more amusing there , I do n't doubt ; but , after all , you are married to me . " " Good heavens , Fanny , " he protested , " what is this about ? You 're really cutting with the Groves  --  two excessively nice people who were decent to me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a warmer voice . " Ca n't you see how disappointed I was ? First I had everything laid out on the bed , my best nightgowns and lace stockings , for the trip ; then I could n't go ; and I arranged the party so carefully for you , Gregory had a practice piece ready for you to hear , and  --  and nothing . I wonder if any other man is as selfish as you ? ' " Maybe not , " he returned peaceably . " What happened was unavoidable . It was a social necessity , decided for me . I could n't just run into the house and out again . But there is no need to explain further . " He left the table , for a cigar , and returned . " You have on a new dress ! " " I ought to be complimented , " she admitted , " but I am not ; it 's only the black velvet with the fulness taken out and a new ruffle . Clothes are so expensive that I wanted to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll remember that you said the new length did n't become me . No , you 're not the idiot  --  I am : I must stop considering and trying to please you at every turn . I should have gone in and ordered a new dress ; any other woman you know would have done that ; and , I have no doubt , would have told you it was old when it was n't . I wish I did n't show that I care so much and kept you guessing . You 'd be much more interested if you were n't so sure of me . That seems to me queer  --  loyalty and affection , and racking your brain to make your husband comfortable and happy , do n't bring you anything . They do n't ! You 'll leave at once for a night in New York or a new face with an impudent bang at the dances . I have always tried to do what I thought was right , but I 'm getting discouraged . " " Do n't lose patience with me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to you , Fanny , do n't stop . I do the best I can . Coming out in the train I made up my mind to stop petty quarreling . No , wait  --  if it is my fault that makes it easy , we 're done with it . " " From the way you talk , " she objected , " anyone would think we did nothing but fight . And that is n't true ; we have never had a bit of serious trouble . " She rose , coming around to him : " That was n't a very nice kiss we had when you came in . I was horrid . " Lee Randon kissed her again . The cool familiarity of her lips was blurred in the remembered clinging intensity of Savina 's mouth . " Lee , dear , blow out the candles ; the servants forget , and those blue handmade ones cost twenty-five cents apiece . " They left the dining-room with her arm about him and his hand laid on her shoulder . Lee 's feeling was curious  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all doubt , and yet physically she had now no perceptible influence on him . He was even a little embarrassed , awkward , at her embrace ; and its calmly possessive pressure filled him with a restive wish to move away . He repressed this , forced himself to hold her still , repeated silently all that she had given him ; and she turned a face brilliant with color to his gaze . Fanny made him bring her stool  --  how sharply Savina 's heels had dug into him under the table at the Lafayette  --  and showed him her ankles . " You see , I put them on tonight for you . " Her stockings , he assured her , were enchanting . A difficulty that , incredibly , he had not foreseen weighed upon him : the body , where Fanny was concerned , had given place to the intellect ; the warmth of his feeling had been put aside for the logic of determination ; and he was sick with weariness . In his customary chair , he sank into a heavy brooding lethargy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched . * * * * * On the following morning , Sunday , Lee rode with Claire Morris . Fanny , disinclined to activity , stayed by the open fire , with the illustrated sections of the newspapers and her ornamental sewing . Claire was on , a tall bright bay always a little ahead of Lee , and he was constantly urging his horse forward . " Peyton went to the Green Spring Valley for a hunt party last night , " she told him ; " he said he 'd be back . " Why , then , he almost exclaimed , he , Lee , had been successful with Mina Raff . Instead he said that she would undoubtedly be glad of that . " Oh , yes ! But neither of us is very much excited about it just now ; he is too much like a ball on a rubber string ; and if I were a man I 'd hate to resemble that . I wo n't try to hide from you that I 've lost something ; still , I have him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee ; that was what spoiled it , in the end beat them . It was n't strong enough to carry them away and damn the consequences . There is always something to admire in that , even if you suffer from it . " The night had been warm , and the road , the footing , was treacherous with loosened stones and mud . The horses , mounting a hill , picked their way carefully ; and Lee Randon gazed over his shoulder into the valley below . He saw it through a screen of bare wet maple branches  --  a dripping brown meadow lightly wreathed in blue mist , sedgy undergrowth along water and the further ranges of hills merged in shifting clouds . A shaft of sunlight , pale and without warmth , illuminated with its emphasis an undistinguished and barren spot . On the meadows sloping to the south there were indefinite spaces of green . Claire was heedless of their surroundings . " What does surprise and disturb me , " she continued vigorously , " is that I have n't any sympathy for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that he bitched it . As you may observe , Lee , I am not at all admirable this morning : a figure of inconsistency . And the reason will amaze you  --  I 've rather come to envy what they might have had . I am afraid that if the positions of Mina and me had been reversed I would n't have seen you in New York . I found that out last night when I knew Peyton was n't going . What he said over and over was that everything could be just as it was . " She laughed , riding easily , subconsciously , on the snaffle rein . " Peyton 's simplicity is marvelous . In a year , or maybe less , he will be quite the same as always . I had nothing to do with it ; Peyton and Mina will go on as fresh as daisies ; yet only I 'll be damaged or , anyway , changed . What shall I do about it ? " she demanded of Lee Randon , so sharply that her horse shied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so dulled by your ingratitude that I ca n't gather what you mean . " " Well , here I am  --  a girl with her head turned by a glimpse at a most romantic play , by cakes and champagne cup , and then sent home to bread without jam . Since I 've known of this it has taken most of the color out of everyday things , they are like a tub-full of limp rags with the dye run from them . I want Peyton , yes , I love him ; but what I thought would satisfy me does n't . I want more ! I am very serious about the romantic play  --  it is exactly what I mean . I had read about great emotions , seen them since I was a child at the opera , and there was the Madrid affair ; but that was so far away , and I never thought of the others as real ; I never understood that people really had them , in Eastlake as well as Spain , until I watched Peyton miss his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life could be . " " We are all in the same fix , Claire , " he told her . " But not you , " she replied impatiently ; " your existence with Fanny is the most perfect for miles around . Fanny is marvelous to you , and you are as sensible as you are nice . " " You think , then , that I have n't seen any of this romantic show you are talking about ? " " If you had you would n't let it spoil your comfort . " The pig again ! " Well , what is it here or there ? " she cried . " I 'll feel like this for a little and then die alive . Did you ever notice an old woman , Lee ? She is like a horrid joke . There is something unconquerably vain and foolish about old men that manages to save them from entire ruin . But a woman shrivelled and blasted and twisted out of her purpose  --  they either look as though they had been steeped in vinegar or filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too harrowing , and in their best dresses and flowers , they ought to step into a ball-room of chloroform . But this change in me , Lee , is n't in my own imagination . The people who know me best have complained that what patience I had has gone ; even Ira , I 'm certain , notices it . I have no success in what used to do to get along with ; my rattle of talk , my line , is gone . " " Those relations of Mina Raff 's , the Groves , " he said , shifting the talk to the subject of his thoughts , " are very engaging . Mrs. Grove specially . She has splendid qualities almost never found together in one person . She is , well , I suppose careful is the word , and , at the same time , not at all dull . I wonder if she is altogether well ? Her paleness would spoil most women 's looks and , it seems to me , she mentioned her heart . " " Good Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care for a description of the woman like one of those anatomical zodiacs in the Farmers ' Almanac . " She turned her horse , without warning , through a break in the fence ; and , putting him at a smart run , jumped a stream with a high insecure bank beyond , and went with a pounding rush up a sharp incline . He followed , but more conservatively ; and , at the solid fence she next took , he shouted that she 'd have to continue on that gait alone . " Do n't be so careful , " she answered mockingly , trotting back ; " take a chance ; feel the wind streaming in your face ; you 'll reach Fanny safely . " What , exasperated , he muttered was , " Damn Fanny ! " He had jumped a fence as high and wide as respectability ; and he enormously preferred Savina 's sort of courage to this mad galloping over the country . What Claire and Peyton and Mina Raff talked about , longed for , Savina took . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion of his horse , heard , in the darkness , a soft settling fall , he saw an indefinite trace of whiteness which swelled into an incandescence that consumed him . They had turned toward home and , on an unavoidable reach of concrete road , were walking . The horses ' hoofs made a rhythmic hollow clatter . Claire , with the prospect of losing her love , had hinted at the possibilities of an inherited recklessness ; but here was a new and unexpected cause of disturbance . Lee would never have supposed that such ideas were at the back of Claire 's head . He gazed at her , in spite of the fact that she had ruffled his temper , even with an increased interest . In her direct way she had put into words many of the vague pressures floating , like water under night , through his brain . He would act differently ; Claire was n't practical  --  all that she indicated could n't be followed . It was spun of nothing more substantial than the bright visions of youth ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that . His was the wise course . It took a marked degree of strength ; no weak determination could hope for success in the conduct he had planned for himself ; and that gave him material for satisfaction . He turned to the left , at the road leading past his driveway , and Claire went up the hill into Eastlake alone . She had thought he was describing Savina for her benefit ! The truth was that he had been possessed by a tyrannical necessity to talk about Savina Grove , to hear the sound of her praise if it were only on his own voice . It assisted his memory , created , like the faintly heard echo of a thrilling voice , a similitude not without its power to stir him . The secret realms of thought , of fancy and remembrance , he felt , were his to linger in , to indulge , as he chose . Lee had a doubt of the advisability of this ; but his question was disposed of by the realization that he had nothing to say ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , or , rather , by what means , he should hear from her again ; perhaps  --  although it required no reply  --  in response to the letter he had written to the Groves acknowledging their kindness and thanking them for it . To Lee , William Loyd Grove was more immaterial than a final shred of mist lifting from the sunken road across the golf course ; even his appreciation of the other 's good qualities had vanished , leaving nothing at all . He was confused by the ease with which the real , the solid , became the nebulous and unreal , as though the only standard of values , of weights and measures , lay absurdly in his own inconsequential attitude . * * * * * The Randons had no formal meal on Sunday night ; but there were sandwiches , a bowl of salad , coffee , and what else were referred to generally as drinks ; and a number of people never failed to appear . It was always an occasion of mingled conversations , bursts of popular song at the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . The benches at either side of the fire-place were invariably crowded ; and , from her place on the over-mantel , Cytherea 's gaze rested on the vivacious or subdued current of life . Lee Randon often gazed up at her , and tonight , sunk in a corner with scarcely room to move the hand which held a cigarette , this lifted interrogation was prolonged . Mrs. Craddock , whom he had not seen since the dinner-dance at the club , sat beside him in a vivid green dress with large black beads strung from her left shoulder . She looked very well , he reflected ; that was a becoming dimple in her cheek . He had had the beginning of an interest in her  --  new to Eastlake , and her husband dead , she had taken a house there for the winter  --  but that had vanished now . He was deep in thought when she said : " Did n't I hear that you were infatuated with that doll ? " Who , he demanded , had told her such a strange story ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " or , rather , she raises a great many questions , natural in a person named Cytherea . The pair of castanets on a nail  --  Claire used them in an Andalusian dance  --  might almost be an offering , like the crutches of Lourdes , left before her by a grateful child of the ballet . " " I ca n't see what you do , of course ; but she reminds me of quantities of women  --  fascinating on the outside and nothing within . Men are always being fooled by that : they see a face or hear a voice that starts something or other going in them , and they supply a complete personality just as they prefer it , like the filling of a pat ? case . That is what you have done with this doll  --  imagined a lot of things that do n't exist . " " If they do in me , that 's enough , is n't it ? " he demanded . " You 're partly wrong , at any rate  --  Cytherea is the originator and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are right is that she is only a representation ; and it is what she may represent which holds me . Cytherea , if she would , could answer the most important question of my life . " " How tragic that she ca n't speak . " " Yet that is n't necessary ; she might be a guide , like a pointing finger-post . I met a woman lately , as charming as possible , who resembled her ; and I 'm sure that if I had them together  --  " he left the end of his sentence in air . Then he began again , " But that could not be managed ; not much can , with advantage , in this world . " From beyond the hall , to the accompaniment of the piano , came the words , " She might have been a mother if she had n't looped the loop . " Lee made a disdainful gesture . " That is the tone of the present  --  anything is acceptable if it is trivial ; you may kiss wherever you like if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , say like  --  like sympathy , it 's made impossible for you . " " If you were someone else , " Mrs. Craddock observed , " I 'd think you were in love . You have a great many of the symptoms  --  the wandering eye and wild speech . " " I am , with Fanny , " he declaimed , struggling out of the bench corner . No one should discover the memory he carried everywhere with him . The lights had been switched off in the living-room , but the piano continued , and glowing cigarettes , like red and erratically waving signals , were visible . Returning , going into the dining-room , he saw that the whiskey had been plentifully spilled over the table . In the morning the varnish would be marred by white stains . The stairs were occupied , the angle in the hall behind which a door gave to the cellar steps , was filled ; a sound , not culinary , came from the kitchen pantry . Even Fanny , with her hair in disorder , was dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion created in him , sudden and piercing , a desire for Savina . He wanted her , the touch of her magnetic hands , her clinging body , her passionate abandon , with every sense . It was unbearable that she , too , was n't here , waiting for him in the convenient darkness . He had to have her , he muttered . At the same time he was appalled by the force of his feeling : it shook him like a chill and gripped his heart with an acute pain . His entire being was saturated with a longing that was at once a mental and physical disturbance . Nothing in his life , no throe of passion or gratification , had been like this . Lee hastily poured out a drink and swallowed it . He was burning up , he thought ; it felt as though a furnace were open at his back ; and he went out to the silence , the coldness , of the terrace flagging on the lawn . The lower window shades had been pulled down , but , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the walls the chords of the piano were just audible , and the volume of voices was reduced to a formless humming . It had cleared , the sky was glittering with constellations of stars ; against them Lee could trace the course of his telephone wire . But for that his house , taking an added dignity of mass from the night , might have been the reality of which it was no more than an admirable replica . There was little here , outside , to suggest or recall the passage of a century and over . In the lapse of that time , Lee thought , more had been lost than gained ; the simplicity had vanished , but wisdom had not been the price of its going . Of all the people at present in his dwelling , Fanny was the best in the sense of old solid things ; he could see her , with no change , at the board of an early household . Compared to her the others seemed like figures in a fever ; yet he was , unhappily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fever enough in his brain ! But the winter night was cooling it  --  a minor image of the final office of death ; the choking hunger for Savina was dwindling . He hoped that it would n't be repeated . He could n't answer for himself through many such attacks . Yes , his first love , though just as imperative , had been more ecstatic ; the reaching for an ideal rather than the body of a woman . His allegiance to Cytherea , though , was in part to the former , to youth ; now it seemed to him he had preserved that through all his life . But the latter , at least in its devastating power , was new . Lee recognized it as passion , but passion to a degree beyond all former experience and comprehension . Why had it been quiescent so long to overwhelm him now ? Or what had he done to open himself to such an invasion ? A numbing poison could n't have been very different . Then , contrarily , he was exhilarated by the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazement which resembled pride . The penny kisses here  --  he was letting himself into the house  --  were like the candies Fanny had in a crystal dish on the sideboard , flavors of cinnamon and rose and sugary chocolate . They were hardly more than the fumes of alcohol . But the party showed no signs of ending , the piano continued to be played without a break ; one sentimental song had been repeated , without the omission of a line , a held note , ten times , Lee was sure . Fanny paused breathlessly , with a hand on his arm : " They are all having such a good time ; it is absolutely successful . Is n't Borden sweet to bother teaching me that heel tap . Go in and talk to Mrs. Craddock again ; I thought you liked her . " In the hall the victrola had been started in opposition to the piano beyond , and the result was a pandemonium of mechanical sound and hysterical laughter . Cytherea was unmoved , enigmatic , fascinating ; the gilt of her headdress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights by the mantel . " You always come back to her , " Mrs. Craddock said . When he replied that this time he had returned to her , she shook her head sceptically . " But I suppose you have to say it . " He dropped back into a corner of one of the benches ; they were a jumble of skirts and reclining heads and elevated pumps . The victrola , at the end of a record and unattended , ran on with a shrill scratch . Cytherea had the appearance of floating in the restrained light ; her smile was not now so mocking as it was satirical ; from her detached attention she might have been regarding an extraordinary and unpredictable spectacle which she had indifferently brought about . It was evident that among what virtues she might possess charity was not present . * * * * * After the last automobile leaving  --  shifted through the diminishing clamor of its gears  --  had carried its illumination into the farther obscurity of the road , Fanny , uncomfortable in the presence of disorder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied the widely scattered ash trays into a brass bowl , gathered the tall whiskey glasses and the glasses with fragile stems and brilliantly enamelled belligerent roosters , the empty charged water bottles , on the dresser in the pantry , and returned chairs and flowers to their recognized places , while Lee locked up the decanters of whiskey . Fanny was tired but enthusiastic , and , as she went deftly about , rearranging her house with an unfailing surety of touch , she hummed fragments of the evening 's songs . Lee Randon was weary without any qualification ; the past day , tomorrow  --  but it was already today  --  offered him no more than a burden , so many heavy hours , to be supported . The last particle of interest had silently gone from his existence . His condition was entirely different from the mental disquiet of a month ago ; no philosophical considerations nor abstract ideas absorbed him now  --  it was a weariness not of the mind but of the spirit , a complete sterility of imagination and incentive , as though an announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to have rewarded . There was no reason Lee could think of for keeping up his diverse efforts . He sat laxly in his customary corner of the living room  --  Fanny , he felt , had disposed of him there as she had the other surrounding objects  --  his legs thrust out before him , too negative to smoke . His wife leaned over and kissed him ; she was , she had suddenly discovered , dead with fatigue . The kiss was no more than the contact of her lips on his . The clear realization of this startled him ; now not an emotion , not even tenderness , responded to her gestures of love . His indifference had been absolute ! There had been periods of short duration when , exasperated with Fanny , he had lost the consciousness of his affection for her ; but then he had been filled with other stirred emotions ; and now he was coldly empty of feeling . It was this vacancy that specially disturbed him : it had an appearance , new to all his processes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him that  --  for a long or short period  --  he had ceased to love his wife . There was something so intimately and conventionally discourteous in his realization that he avoided it even in his thoughts . But it would not be ignored ; it was too robust a truth to be suppressed by weakened instincts . He did n't love Fanny and Fanny did love him ... a condition , he felt indignantly , which should be automatically provided against ; none of the ethics of decency or conduct provided for that . It was n't for a second , without the single , the familiar and ancient , cause , allowed . Fanny , least of any imaginable woman , had given him a pretext for complaint . Yet , with everyone acknowledging her to be the perfect wife , and he at the fore of such praise , he had incontestably stopped caring for her . It was a detestable situation . In the whole body of preconceived thought and action there was n't a word , a possible movement , left for him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not innocent of humor , was still strikingly close to what he would generally hear if the state of his mind were known . It was paralyzing , but absolutely no provision had been made for men , decent enough , who had stopped loving decent wives . Lee was not , here , considering the part of his life involved with Savina Grove : Savina had nothing to do with his attitude toward Fanny . This did n't hang on the affection he might have for one at the superficial expense of the other : Savina  --  while it was undeniable that she had done exactly this in the vulgar physical sense  --  had n't essentially taken him away from Fanny . He had gone self-directed , or , rather , in the blind manner of an object obeying the law of gravity . He could n't argue that he had been swept away . It was n't , either , that he overwhelmingly wanted to go to Savina Grove , he overwhelmingly did n't ; and the strangling emotion , the desire , that had possessed him earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that was the vigorous hope that it would n't come back . No , he had , mentally , settled the affair with Savina in the best possible manner ; now he was strictly concerned with the bond between his wife and himself . The most reliable advice , self- administered or obtained from without , he could hope for would demand that he devote the rest of his life , delicately considerate , to Fanny . She must never know the truth . This was the crown of a present conception of necessity and unassailable conduct , of nobility . But , against this , Lee Randon was obliged to admit that he was not a particle noble ; he was n't certain that he wanted to be ; he suspected it . Putting aside , for the moment , the doubtfulness of his being able to maintain successfully , through years , such an imposition , there was something dark , equally dubious , in its performance . He might manage it publicly , even superficially in private , and as a father ; but marriage was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse . Its fundamental condition was the profoundest instinct that controlled living ; there no merely admirable conduct could manage to be more than a false and degrading , a temporary , lie . How could he with a pandering smugness meet Fanny 's purity of feeling ? Yet , it seemed , exactly this was being done by countless other applauded men . But , probably , the difference between them and himself was that they had no objective consciousness of their course ; happily they never stopped to think . It was thought , he began to see , and not feeling that created nearly all his difficulties . In a flash of perception he grasped that formal thought , in its aspect of right conduct , was utterly opposed to feeling . While the former condemned the surrender of Savina and himself to passion , the latter , making it imperative , had brushed aside the barriers of recognized morals . It had been a tragic , it might well be a fatal , error to oppose religion  --  as it affected both this world and the impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist as animals ; he saw that plainly . They had surrendered the natural in favor of an artificial purity . In a land where sea shells were the standard of value , rubies and soft gold were worthless . Lee was opposed to his entire world ; he had nothing but his questioning , his infinitesimal entity , for his assistance . Literally there was n't a man to whom he could turn whose answer and advice were n't as predictable as useless . There was nothing for him but to accept his position and , discharging it where he was able , fail where he must . There was , however , no need for that failure to be absolute ; and the underlying responsibility he had fully considered , subject to its own attained code , would have to do service as best it could . Here he paused to realize that the improved manners he had determined on were no more than the expression of his growing , his grown , indifference . It should be easy to be restrained in a situation that had small meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his connection with Fanny was of far greater moment than that with Helena and Gregory . His responsibility to them was a minor affair compared to the weight increasingly laid upon their elders . Somehow , they did n't seem to need him as sharply as Fanny did . Materially they were all three more than sufficiently provided for , and spiritually , as he had so often reflected , he had little or no part in his children 's well-being . Perhaps this , he had told himself , could be changed ; certainly he was solely to blame if he had stood aside from their education . He would see more of them  --  four days a week were now plenty for the conducting of his successful enterprises in the city  --  and give them what benefits his affection and experience held . In this he must n't contradict the influence of their mother ; that , so late , would only be followed by chaos ; he 'd merely be more with them . Helena was old enough for a small tractable horse and Gregory must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children , would jog out in the spring together . From that mental picture he got a measure of reassurance ; a condition resembling peace of mind again returned . As much as possible , against the elements of danger , was in his favor . He might have had a wife who , on the prevalent tide of gin and orange juice , of inordinate luxuriousness , degraded him with small betrayals . Or he might have been any one of a hundred unfortunate things . He took life too seriously , that was evident ; a larger degree of mental irresponsibility would be followed by a more responsible accomplishment of the realities which bore no more heavily on him than on other men ; and in this the cocktails had their office . * * * * * Lee agreed readily , therefore , when , on Friday afternoon , Fanny asked him to bring Helena and Gregory from dancing-school . This was held in the Armory ; and , past five o'clock , mounting the wide stone steps in the early gloom and going through the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs pushed against the wall in a spirit of interested attention . The Armory , following the general literal interpretation of the sternness of military usage , was gaunt , with a wide yellow floor and walls of unconcealed brick . In a far corner , on a temporary and unpainted platform , the pianist sat with her hands raised , her wrists rigid , preparatory to the next demand upon her strongly accentuated playing . Lee was surprised at the large number of children ranged in an irregular ring about the erect brittle presence and insistent voice of the instructor . What scant hair he possessed , carefully disposed to cover its meagreness , was grey , and its color permeated , suggested , the tone of his thin face . Surrounded by the cruel exuberance of the children , he seemed incalculably worn , permanently weary , although he was surprisingly sharp-eyed and adequate . It was , Lee thought unsympathetically , a curiously negative occupation for a man ; the small graces of the dancing teacher , the bows gravely exchanged with childish bows , the bent dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , further alienated Lee Randon . But the children were a source of entertainment and speculation . He saw Gregory at once , short and sturdy-legged , in a belted jacket and white breeches ; his son was standing peaceably , attentive , clasping the hand of a girl smaller than himself with obstinate bobbed hair . This , the high pointed voice in the center of the floor continued , was an Irish folk dance ; they would try it again ; and the reiterated details were followed by the sounding of a whistle and music . Lee had no idea of the exact number of children engaged , but he was certain that there were just as many totally different executions of the steps before them . Not one had grasped an essential of the carefully illustrated instruction ; he could see nowhere an evidence of grace or rhythm . But , with a few notable exceptions , all boys , there was an entire solemnity of effort ; the swinging of bare short legs , the rapid awkward bobs , were undertaken with a deep sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third time , and then relinquished in favor of a waltz . Miniature couples circled and staggered , the girls again prim , the boys stolid or with working mouths , or as smooth and vacuous as chestnuts , little sailors and apparitions in white , obviously enjoying their employment . During this not a word was exchanged ; except for the shuffling feet , the piano , an occasional phrase of encouragement from the instructor , himself gliding with a dab of fat in exaggerated ribbons , there was n't a sound . To Lee it had the appearance of the negation of pleasure ; it was , in its way , as bad as the determined dancing of adults ; it had the look of a travesty of that . Helena conducted a restive partner , trying vainly to create the impression that he was leading , wherever she considered it advantageous for him to go . The thick flood of her gold hair shimmered about her uncompromising shoulders , her embroidered skirt fluttered over the firmness of her body . She was as personable a little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory 's earnestness in what he attempted , she got on smoothly enough . Seeing Lee , she smiled and waved a hand almost negligently ; but Gregory , at his presence , grew visibly embarrassed ; he almost stopped . Lee Randon nodded for him to go ahead . There were various minor cataclysms  --  Helena flatly refused to dance with a boy who pursued her with an urging hand . At this conspicuous reverse he sat on a chair until the teacher brought him forcibly out and precipitated him into the willing arms of a girl larger and , if possible , more inelastic than the others . The ring was again assembled , and the complicated process of alternating a boy with a girl was accomplished . " Never mind what he does , " the instructor directed sharply ; " always be sure you are right . " A shift was made further around in the line , and the elder wisdom was vindicated . " Now , the chain . " The whistle blew . " Left and right , left and right . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lefts . The assumption of gravity acutely bothered Lee Randon : they had no business , he thought , to be already such social animals . Their training in set forms , mechanical gestures and ideas , was too soon hardening their mobility and instinctive independence . Yes , they were a caricature of what they were to become . He had n't more sympathy with what he had resolved to encourage , applaud , but less . The task of making any headway against that schooling was beyond him . The dancing reached a pause , and , with it , the silence : a confusion of clear undiversified voices rose : the face of an infant with long belled trousers and solidified hair took on a gleam of impish humor ; older and more robust boys scuffled together with half-subdued hails and large pretentions ; groups of girls settled their skirts and brushed , with instinctive pats , their braids into order ; and there was a murmur of exchanged approbation from the supporting , white-gloved mothers . Gregory appeared at Lee 's side ; his cheeks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , do you like it ? " " Yes , " Gregory answered shyly . He lingered while Lee Randon tried to think of something else appropriate to say , and then he ran abruptly off . His children were affectionate enough , but they took him absolutely for granted ; they regarded him very much as they did their cat ; except for the conventional obeisance they made him , not so voluntary as it was trained into them , they were far more involved with Martha , their black nurse . Everywhere , Lee felt , they repelled him . Was he , then , lacking in the qualities , the warmth , of paternity ? Again , as he was helpless where Fanny lately was concerned , he was unable to be other . It was increasingly evident that he had not been absorbed , obliterated , in marriage ; an institution which , from the beginning , had tried  --  like religion  --  to hold within its narrow walls the unconfinable instincts of creation . It had n't , among other things , considered the fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligible as any for all his dissent . But cases like his were growing more prevalent ; however , usually , in women . Men were the last stronghold of sentimentality . His thoughts were interrupted by a dramatic rift in the discipline of the class : a boy , stubbornly seated , swollen , crimson , with wrath and heroically withheld tears , was being vainly argued with by the dancing master . He would n't stir , he would n't dance . The man , grasping a shoulder , shook him in a short violence , and then issued a final uncompromising order . The boy rose and , marching with an increasing rapidity toward the entrance , he struck aside a placid and justifiably injured child , dragged open the door , and slammed it after him with a prodigious and long echoing report . His contempt , holding its proportion in the reduced propriety of the occasion , was like a clap of communistic thunder in an ultra-conservative assembly . For a moment , together with all the others , Lee Randon was outraged ; then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far different conception  --  he saw himself , for no easily established reason , in the person of the rebel who had left behind him the loud announcement of his angry dissent . Helena sought Lee immediately . " That 's his mother , " she said in a penetrating whisper , indicating a woman with a resolutely abstracted expression and constrained hands . The children were gathered finally and formed into a line which , to the drumming piano , moved and halted , divided and subdivided . Led by the instructor it was involved in an apparently issueless tangle and then straightened smoothly out . The dancing class at an end , Helena and Gregory , wedged into the seat with Lee in the car , swept into an eager chatter , a rush of questions , that he was unable to follow . A Sara Lane was announced by Helena to be the object of Gregory 's affection , and Gregory smugly admitted this to be true . He was going to marry her , he declared further . " Perhaps , " Lee suggested , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory has four girls , " Helena instructed him . " Well , " Gregory retorted , " I can marry them all . " But what , under this reflected chatter , was his son like ? What would he be ? And Helena ! They eluded him like bright and featureless bits of glass . His effort to draw closer to them was proving a failure ; what could he give them safer than their attachment to the imponderable body of public opinion and approval ? He had nothing but doubts , unanswerable questions ; and a mental , a moral , isolation . It was easier to remain in the dancing class than to be sent out in an agony of revolt and strangling shame . * * * * * Often , during his conversations with Fanny , she returned to the subject of his late New York trip and stay with the Groves . She asked small interested questions , commented on the lavish running of the Grove house ; she could n't , she explained , get nectarines and Belgian grapes in Eastlake ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some out . " Mina Raff 's limousine sounds luxurious , " she acknowledged . But Fanny was n't curious about Mina ; after the first queries she accepted her placidly ; now that she had withdrawn from the Morrises ' lives , Fanny regarded her in the light of a past episode that cast them all together on a romantic screen . What mostly she asked touched upon Savina Grove . " Did they seem happy ? " she inquired about the Groves . He replied : " Very . William Grove was quite affectionate when he left for Washington . " A momentary and ominous suspense followed a sudden stopping of his voice . " You did n't say anything about that before , " she observed carefully . " When did he go , how long was he away ? " She put aside what she was doing , waiting . " He left unexpectedly ; just when I forget ; but during the last day I was there . " " Lee , why did n't you say that Mr. Grove had gone to Washington ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slipped my mind , " he retorted , striving , in a level tone , to hide his chagrin and an increasing irritation at her persistence . " When did he come back ? " " I do n't know . " Suddenly he gave way to a complete frankness . " He may not be back yet . " " Then you had dinner at the restaurant and went to the theatre alone with her . " " If it 's possible to be alone with anyone , you are correct . What , in the name of heaven , are you getting at ? " " Only this  --  that , for some reason I ca n't gather , you lied to me . I have had the most uncomfortable impression about her all along . Why ? " Her demand had a quality of unsteady emotion . " I have been so close to you , Lee , we have had each other so completely , that I have feelings I ca n't account for . I always know when  --  when you 've been a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never felt like this before . Lee , " she leaned suddenly forward , her hands clasping the sides of her chair , " you must be absolutely truthful with me , it 's the only way I can live . I love you so much ; you 're all I have ; I do n't care for anyone else now . You have taken me away from my family ; you are my family . Ours is n't an ordinary marriage , like the Lucians ' , but worlds deeper . " Yet , he told himself , in spite of her assurances the truth would ruin them ; besides , as he had recognized , it did n't belong exclusively to him ; it was , as well , Savina 's truth . At any cost he had to protect her . Lee replied by saying that it was useless to tell her facts in her present unreasonable humor . " Why did n't you tell me he had gone to Washington ? " she repeated ; her tone had a sharper edge . " Was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he demanded , did she suspect ? Fanny did n't know . " Only I have had this worrying feeling . Did you go straight back from the theatre or take a drive ? " He was amazed at her searching prescient questions ; but his manner was admirable . " New Yorkers are not very apt to drive around their Park at night . They are rather familiar with it . There 's the afternoon for that , and the morning for the bridle paths . I wo n't go on , though , in such a senseless and positively insulting conversation . " " You are not yourself since you returned , " she observed acutely . " Sunday night you were too queer for words . You could n't talk to Mrs. Craddock for more than a minute at a time . Did you call her Savina ? " Mrs. Craddock 's name , he responded in a nicely interrogating manner , he had thought to be Laura . She paid no attention to his avoidance of her demand . " Did you ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe a word you say . " " Hell , do n't ask me then . " " You must not curse where the servants can hear you , and I wo n't listen to such talk , I 'll leave the table . I wish you 'd look in the mirror and see how red and confused you are . It is too bad that I can not depend on you after so long , and with the children . You were sitting close to that woman , and  --  and your arms ; you were kissing . " " I have her garter on my bureau . " " Stop . " Her anger now raised her above petty sallies . " I have stood a great deal from you , but there is more I simply wo n't . Do you understand ? I 've always done my duty and I 'll make you do yours . I never have looked at another man , nor been kissed , except that horrid one last July at the Golf Club . " While she paused , breathless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I see , " she spoke slowly : " you think that would give you an excuse . If I did it I could n't complain about your nasty affairs . How cheap and easy I must seem . You ought to be ashamed to try to trick me . " " If you are going to fly at conclusions you can sit in the tree alone , " he protested . " It 's amazing where you have arrived from nothing . Let me tell you that I wo n't be ragged like this ; if you think so much of our life why do you make it hideous with these degrading quarrels ? You would never learn that way if there was the slightest , the slightest , cause for your bitterness . You have all you want , have n't you ? The house and grounds are planted with your flowers , you are bringing up the children to be like yourself . I do n't specially care for this , " he made a comprehensive gesture ; " building an elaborate place to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable , so necessary , to you , I never think of . You are so full of your life that you do n't consider mine , except where it is tied up with your interests . " " Lee Randon , " she cried , " I 've given you everything , it 's all planned for you , here . Nothing comes on the table that you dislike  --  we have n't had beefsteak for months ; when you are busy with your papers I keep it like a grave ; and if the house seems cold , and I ca n't find Christopher , I do n't bother you , but slip down to the furnace myself . " " Make me uncomfortable , then , " he retorted ; " I think that 's what I 'm sick of  --  your eternal gabbling about comfort and dinner . Let the God damn furnace go out ! Or burn up . " " That 's all I have , Lee , " she said helplessly ; " it is my life . I tried , the last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ; but it only made me miserable ; I kept wondering if Gregory was covered up and if the car would start when you wanted to go home . But I wo n't be sorry for it . " Her head was up , her cheeks blazing . " I know , and so ought you , what being good is . And if you forget it you will have a dreadful misfortune . God is like that : He 'll punish you . " " You do n't need help , " he commented brutally . Detached tears rolled over her cheeks . " I wo n't cry , " she contradicted the visible act ; " I wo n't . You take such a cowardly advantage of me . " The advantage , he reflected , was entirely on her side . Within , he was hard , he had no feeling of sympathy for her ; the division between them was absolute . With an angry movement she brushed the tears from her cheeks . " I hate her , " she said viciously ; " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , " he replied , " Mrs. Grove , if you happen to mean her , is singularly attractive . There is no smallness about her . " " Hell , " she mocked him , " it is really too touching . When shall you see her again ? " " Never . " At once he saw that he had made a second mistake . " How sad  --  never ; I ca n't bear it . You both must have been wretched at that long hopeless parting . And she agreed to let you go  --  back to your wife and children . " Fanny 's voice was a triumph of contempt . " I ought to thank her ; or be magnanimous and send you back . " " This is all built on a ridiculous assumption , " Lee reminded her ; " I even forget how we started . Suppose we talk about something else ; Mrs. Grove , as a topic , is pretty well exhausted . " Fanny , narrow-eyed , relapsed into an intent silence . She faded from his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of a quickening of his blood , the disturbed throb of his heart ; the memory of delirious hours enveloped him in a feverish mist more real than his wife sitting before him with a drawn brow . * * * * * Usually after such scenes Fanny had flowered in a tender remorse for their bitter remarks , the wasted opportunity of happiness ; but again she left him coldly , unmelted . He was glad  --  a show of affection would have been unsupportable . But his marriage was becoming precarious ; Lee seemed to be without power to execute his firm intentions ; a conviction of insecurity settled over him . The sense of a familiar difficulty returned ; there was nothing for him to do but order his life on a common pattern and face an unrelieved futility of years . He remembered , with a grim amusement , the excellent advice he had given Peyton Morris , Peyton at the verge of falling from the approved heights into the unpredictable . If he had come to him now in that quandary , what would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told Peyton he still believed  --  the variety of life lay on the circular moving horizon , there was none at hand . But now he comprehended the unmeasurable longing that had , for the time , banished every other consideration from the younger man . It had upset his heredity , his violent prejudices , and his not negligible religion . Peyton , too , had fallen under the charm of Cytherea ; but chance  --  was it fortunate ?  --  had restrained him . Lee had seen Morris the evening before , at a dinner with Claire , and he had been silent , abstracted . He had scarcely acknowledged Lee Randon 's presence . The Morrises had avoided him . Still , that was inevitable , since , for them , he was charged with unpleasant memories . He collected in thought all the married people who , he knew , were unhappy or dissatisfied : eleven of the eighteen Lee called to mind . " What is the matter with it ? " he demanded savagely , aloud , in his room . He considered marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best possible solving of a number of interrelated needs and instincts ; and , practical and grey , it recommended itself to his reason ; it successfully disposed of the difficulties of property , the birth and education of children , and of society . It was a sane , dignified , way to live with a woman ; and it secured so much . Undoubtedly , on that count , marriage could n't be bettered . As it was , it satisfied the vast majority of men and women : against the bulk of human life Fanny and he , with their friends , were inconsiderable . But the number of men who struggled above the common level was hardly greater ; and he and his opinions were of that preferable minority . The freedom of money , the opportunities of leisure , always led directly away from what were called the indispensable virtues . Men  --  he returned to the Eastlake streets on Saturday night  --  except those lost in the monomania of a dream , did n't want to work , they did n't even wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasure , that self-delusion and forgetfulness of drink . Yes , released from the tyrannies of poverty , they flung themselves into a swift spending . The poor were more securely married than the rich , the dull than the imaginative  --  married , he meant , in the sense of a forged bond , a stockade . This latter condition had been the result of allowing the church to interfere unwarrantedly in what was not its affair . Religion had calmly usurped this , the most potent of the motives of humanity ; or , rather , it had fastened to it the ludicrous train of ritual . That laughable idea that God had a separate scrutinizing eye , like the eye of a parrot , on every human atom ! Lee changed his position , physically and mentally  --  he was lying in bed  --  and regarded religion in itself . It was , in the hunger for a perpetual identity , almost as strong a force as the other passion . But were they conspicuously other ? They had many resemblances . He did n't , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but a segregated and weakened form of worship . It was , for example , against the Christian influence that he was struggling . He meant the sense of profound mystery , the revolt against utter causelessness , which had tormented to no clearness so many generations of minds . He accepted the fact that a formless longing was all that he could ever experience ; for him , uncritically , that seemed enough ; he had willingly relinquished any hope of an eternity like a white frosted cake set with twinkling candles . But viewed as a tangible force operating here and now , identical  --  to return to his main preoccupation  --  with love , it demanded some settled intelligence of comprehension . What he wanted , he was drawn bolt upright as if by an inner shout , was an assurance that could be depended on , that would n't break and break and leave him nothing but a feeling of inscrutable mockery . He wanted to understand himself , and , in that , Fanny and the children ... and Savina . Obviously they were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why had he stopped loving Fanny and had no regret  --  but a sharp gladness  --  in his adultery with Savina ? He discarded the qualifying word as soon as it had occurred to him : there was no adultery , adulteration , in his act with Savina ; it had filled him with an energy , a mental and nervous vigor , long denied to the sanctified bed of marriage . He wanted not even to be justified , but only an explanation of what he was ; and he waited , his hands pressed into the softness of the mattress on either side of him , as if the salvation of some reply might come into his aching brain . Nothing , of course , broke the deep reasonable stillness of the night . He slipped back on his pillow weary and baffled . There , to defraud his misery , he deliberately summoned the memory of Savina , and of delirious hours . She came swiftly , with convulsive shoulders , fingers drawn down over his body ; he heard her little cry , " Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I love you . " It had had no apparent connection with the moment , their actual passion . It had disturbed him with the suggestion of a false , a forced , note . In a situation of the utmost accomplishable reality it had been vague , meaningless . I love you . It was a strange phrase , at once empty and burdened with illimitable possibilities . He had said it times without number to Fanny , but first  --  how seductively virginal she had been  --  on a veranda at night . Then , though not quite for the first time , he had kissed her . And suddenly her reserve , her protecting chastity , had gone out of her forever . When had the other , all that eventually led to Savina , begun ; when had he lost his love ? A long process of turning from precisely the orderly details which , he had decided , should make marriage safe . He was back where he had started  --  the realization of how men deserted utility for visions , at the enigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it heaven , others found hell . His mental searching , surrounded , met , by nullity , he regarded as his supreme effort in the direction of sheer duty . If whoever had it in command chose to run the world blindly , unintelligibly , in a manner that would soon wreck the strongest concern , he was n't going to keep on annoying himself with doubts and the dictates of a senseless conscience . What , as soon as possible , he 'd do was fall asleep . The crowing of a rooster pierced the thinning night , a second answered the first , and they maintained a long self-glorifying , separated duet . The wind which had been flowing in at the north window changed to the south-west . The difficulties of his living with Fanny increased the next morning : it was one of the week-days when he did n't go into town after breakfast . He was dressed for riding , his horse was at the door , when , without previous announcement and unprepared , she decided to go with him . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush  --  and suddenly , with the audible fall of a boot on the floor , there was the unmistakable sound of sobbing . Lee went up , half impatient and half comprehending , and found her seated on a bed , leaning her head in an arm on the foot-board . " Do n't wait for me , " she cried in a smothered voice ; " it makes you so nervous . Just go ; it does n't matter what I do . You 've  --  you 've shown me that . Oh , dear , I am so miserable . Everything was right and so happy , and now it 's all wrong . " " Nonsense , " he replied tonically ; " it will take Christopher a few minutes to get your saddle on . I 'll be outside . " Mounted and waiting for her , his horse stepping contrarily over the grass beyond the drive , he did n't care whether she came or stayed . When she appeared her eyes , prominent now rather than striking , were reddened , and the hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrepressible tears . * * * * * When they had returned , and through lunch and after , a not unfamiliar stubborn silence settled over Fanny . When she spoke it was with an armor-like sarcasm protecting and covering her feelings . He was continually surprised at the correctness of her attitude toward Savina ; his wife could know nothing ; she was even without the legitimate foundation of a suspicion ; but her bearing had a perceptible frostiness of despair . What , he wondered moodily , would next , immediately , develop ? Something , certainly  --  Fanny 's accumulations of emotion were always sharply discharged ; they grew in silence but they were expended in edged words . In a way he was glad that he had made the error of speaking about William Grove 's absence in Washington : it was a step toward a final resolution , a tranquilization , of the pressure at home . He did n't know what would bring it up , possibly a storm surpassing in violence all that had preceded it ; and then ... the open prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence in New York , there must be no mistake about that ; she would act on the supposition that he had been merely indulging in a more or less advanced dallying ; but her patience in that , he judged , was at an end . Well , he could ultimately , in all sincerity , agree with her there . Not too soon , of course , for she was at present deeply suspicious of such protestations ; he would maintain for a short while longer an appearance of annoyance , his old successful indignations at her minor charges , and then let her see that she had nothing left to combat from that quarter . But how , in the other implications of such a scene , would he act ? Until now his part in the inevitable frictions of matrimony had been conditioned by a tenderness toward Fanny and a measurable supporting belief that he was generally to blame . She had reduced him to the compounding of excuses ; after her attack , drawing away , she had managed to make him follow her . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price outheld , but with the repeated assertions of his endless love . Nothing less satisfied her . In this she was superior . But , even if he surrendered his life to the effort , could he keep up that pretence of a passion unimpaired ? And had he , Lee asked himself over and over , the wish , the patience , for that heavy undertaking ? It was still fairly evident that he had n't . All that he could hope for , which they both could summon , was luck and the deadening hands of time . He told himself , here , that it was more than probable that he was exaggerating the proportions of the whole situation  --  Fanny had been angry before ; her resentment faded the sooner for its swift explosive character . But this assurance was unconvincing ; his presentiment , which did n't rest on reason , was not amenable to a reasonable conclusion . Of this he was certain , that Fanny never had harbored the suspicion of what , for her , would be the very worst . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only in the form of an unanalyzed , unidentified , feeling . She was n't a coward . His determination to keep smooth , by mere politeness , the further course of their marriage seemed frivolous . That might do , it was even indispensable , when the present corner was turned ; but for the moment  --  What , in the name of God , had got into her ? He grew increasingly irritated at her arbitrary manner . Lee had kept forgetting that , where Fanny was concerned , it was causeless , or no better than a wild surmise , a chance thrust at random . He made up his mind that he would n't submit to a great deal of her bad humor . And , in this spirit , he ignored a query put to him bitingly : " Where is the paper cutter ? " His gaze remained level on the page before him . " Did n't you hear me , Lee ? I want the paper cutter . If it 's on your night table , get it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I let both the girls go tonight . But I need n't explain . " She sat expectantly upright . Obliterating his cigarette , he returned , without moving , to the magazine . Then he raised his head : " You ca n't hope for much from that tone of voice . " " I 'll always insist on your showing me some courtesy . I ca n't imagine what you think I am . You lie to me as though I were a school-girl and you have n't even common good manners . That trip to New York  --  I 'll hear the truth about it . Anyone could tell it was serious by the effect it had on you . Put down your magazine , you might as well ; you ca n't keep on behind it forever . Why did you try to hide that Mrs. Grove and you were alone ? " " To stop all this ! " He dropped the magazine upon the floor . " To save my nerves and the noise of your eternal questions . I knew , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . " " You ca n't be completely trusted , " she replied . " I have always had to worry and hold you up . If it had n't been for me  --  but there is no use in going into that . You must tell me about the Grove woman . " " At one time it was Mrs. Grove , " he observed ; " now it is ' the Grove woman . ' What will you call her next ? " " You will have to tell me that , " Fanny said . " Lee Randon , what must I call her ? " " Perhaps , if you knew her , you 'd try Savina . " " Not if it was to save me from dying . But I have no doubt of which you preferred . Did you ? " " Did I what ? " He was aware that his speech was growing far louder than necessary . " Call her Savina . " " Yes ! " He sat glaring at her in an anger which he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At his admission she had shivered , as though it had reached her in the form of an actually threatened violence , and then she was rigid . " I knew that , all the while . " Her voice was low , with a pause between the words . " Savina " ; she repeated the name experimentally . " Very pretty . Prettier to say than Fanny ; yes , and newer . And , having called her that , you could n't very well not kiss her , could you ? " However , his caution had again asserted itself over the dangers of a lost temper . " You have made so much of this up that you had better finish it yourself . Put what end you prefer on it ; you do n't need help . " " The end , " she echoed , in a strange and smothered voice . " Is this it ? But not yet . " Lee 's gaze rested on the magazine lying spread half on the Eastern symbolism of a rug and half on the bare polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any in that , " he commented , with a gesture . " It 's a pity you have n't turned your imagination to a better use . " This , he recognized , could not go on indefinitely . Fanny added : " But I was wrong  --  you 'd kiss her before you said Savina . That , I believe , is the way it works . It is really screaming when you think what you went to New York for  --  to protect Claire , to keep Peyton Morris out of Mina Raff 's hands . And , apparently , you succeeded but got in badly yourself . What a pair of hypocrites you were : all the while worse than the others , who were at least excused by their youngness , ever could dream of being . What was the good of your contradicting me at first ? I knew all along . I felt it . " " What was it , exactly , that you felt ? " he asked with an assumption of calmness . " I do n't understand , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was inside me , like lead . But , whatever happened , it will come out ; it always does ; and you 'll be sorry . " Did the truth , he wondered , always appear , and triumph over the false ; was that precept of morality secure for those who depended on it ? And , as Fanny threatened , would he be sorry ? But most assuredly he would , for three reasons  --  Savina , Fanny , and himself ; there might , even , be two more , Helena and Gregory ; yes , and William Loyd Grove . What a stinking mess it was all turning out to be . Why was n't life , why were n't women , reasonable ? But he could not convince himself that anything final  --  a separation  --  threatened them . Fanny could n't force an admission from him , nor speak of this , investigate it , anywhere else . Savina was well able to take care of herself . There was nothing to do but wait . In the process of that he once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ordered your Christmas present . It took all the money I had in the Dime Savings Bank . " He muttered a phrase to the effect that Christmas was a season for children . This recalled his own  --  they would n't be asleep yet  --  and , to escape temporarily from an impossible situation , to secure the paper knife , he went up to see them . * * * * * They greeted him vociferously : before he could turn on the light they were partly out of the covers , and the old argument about whose bed he should sit on in full progress . Helena 's was by the door , so , returning her to the warmth of her blankets , he stopped beside her . The room , with the windows fully open , was cold , but he welcomed the white frozen purity of its barrenness . More than ever he was impressed by the remoteness of the children 's bed-room from the passionate disturbances of living ; but they , in the sense Fanny and he knew , were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught at the gestures , of maturity ; but , even in the grip of beginning instincts , they were hardly more sentient than the figures of a puppet show . Or , perhaps , their world was so far from his that they could n't be said to span from one to the other . Gregory , in mind , was no more like him than a slip was like a tree bearing fruit  --  no matter how bitter . Helena more nearly resembled her mother ; that had never occurred to him before . It was undoubtedly true  --  her posturing recalled the feminine attitude in extreme miniature . In that he felt outside her sympathy , she belonged with her mother ; to Gregory he was far more nearly allied . Gregory , anyhow , had the potentialities of his own dilemma ; he might , in years to come , be drawn out of a present reality by the enigma , the fascination , of Cytherea . Lee Randon hoped not ; he wanted to advise him , at once , resolutely to close his eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have children , be faithful , die , he said ; but , alas , to himself . Gregory , smiling in eager anticipation of what might ensue , was necessarily ignorant of so much . Something again lay back of that , Lee realized  --  his occupation in life . There he , Lee , had made his first , perhaps most serious , mistake . While the majority of men turned , indifferent , from their labor , there were a rare few  --  had n't he phrased this before ?  --  lost in an edifice of the mind , scientific or aesthetic or commercial , who were happily unconscious of the lapsing fretful years . That was the way to cheat the sardonic gathered fates : to be deaf and blind to whatever , falsely , they seemed to offer ; to get into bed heavy with weariness and rise hurried and absorbed . Over men so preoccupied , spent , Cytherea had no power . It was strange how her name had become linked with all his deepest speculations ; she was involved in concerns remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're thinking a lot , " Helena said . " What are you thinking about ? " Gregory added . " A doll , " he replied , turning to his daughter . " For me , " she declared . " No , me , " Gregory insisted . Lee Randon shook his head . " Not you , in the least . " " Of course not , " Helena supported him . " I should think it would make you sick , father , hearing Gregory talk like that . It does me . Why does n't he ask for something that boys play with ? " " I do n't want them , that 's why , " Gregory specified . " Perhaps I 'd like to have a typewriter . " " You 're not very modest . " It was Helena again . " It 's father , is n't it ? It is n't you . " " Listen , " Lee broke in , " I came up here to be with two good children ; but where are they ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely , closed her arms in a sweet warmth about his neck . " I 'm one , too , " Gregory called urgently . " No , " his father pressed him back ; " you must stay in bed . They are both here , I can see . " He wondered if , everything else forgotten , his children could constitute a sufficient engagement ; but the sentimental picture , cast across his thoughts , of himself being led by a child holding each of his hands defeated it . He was turned in another direction . Yet , tonight , they were remarkably engaging .... He had lost a great deal . For what ? He could n't  --  as usual  --  answer ; but the memory of Savina , stronger than Fanny , metaphorically took Helena 's arms away from his neck and blurred the image of Gregory . " Have you said your prayer ? " he asked absent-mindedly making conversation . Oh , yes , he was informed , they did that with Martha . " I 'll say mine again , " Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a halo of innocence , praying at a paternal knee to a fresco of saccharine angels ! " Once is enough , " he answered hurriedly . " I am sure you do it very nicely . " " Well , anyhow , better than Helena , " Gregory admitted . " She hurries so . " Lee instructed him to confine his observations to his own performance . Now was the time for him to deliver a small sermon on prayer to Helena . He recognized this , but he was merely incensed by it . What could he reply if they questioned him about his own devotions ? Should he acknowledge that he thought prayer was no more than a pleasant form of administering to a sense of self-importance ? Or , at most , a variety of self-help ? Luckily they did n't ask . How outraged Fanny would be  --  he would be driven from the community  --  if he confessed the slightest of his doubts to his children . If , say at the table , when they were all together , he should drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrified breathlessness would follow . His children , Lee thought , his wife , the servants in the kitchen , none knew him ; he was a stranger to his own house . If he had still , quite desperately , instinctively , looked to Helena and Gregory for assistance , he had met a final failure . Brushed with sleepiness they were slipping away from him . He was reluctant to have them go , leave him ; the distance between them and himself appeared to widen immeasurably as he stood watching them settle for the night . He wanted to call them back , " Helena and Gregory , Gregory ! " But he remained quiet , his head a little bent , his heart heavy . The tide of sleep , silent , mystical , recompensing ! It was n't that , exactly , he was facing . Switching off the light he went into their playroom , scattered with bright toys , with alphabet blocks and an engine , a train of cars and some lengths of track , and a wooden steamboat on wheels gaily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment , of having been half cast aside . Gregory had wanted a typewriter ; his jacket , at dancing-school , had been belted like his , Lee Randon 's . They each had , in the lower hall , a bicycle on which they rode to and from school and to play . " Will he need me later ? " Lee asked himself ; " or will it be the same till the end ? " But he had already decided that the latter was infinitely better . He lingered on the second floor , putting off from minute to minute the unavoidable taking up of Fanny 's demands . She was , he knew , waiting for his appearance to begin again energetically . In their room it struck him forcibly that he must make some mental diagram of his course , his last unshakable position . Certainly in admitting that he had called Savina Grove by her first name he had justified Fanny 's contention that he had kissed her . Fanny should have asked him how many times that had occurred . " A hundred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By God , he would like to say just that , and have it all over , done with . Instead he must lie cunningly , imperturbably , and in a monumental patience . Why ? He had n't , pointedly , asked that before . Things here , his life , the future , must be held together . After he had descended , he lingered in the hall : in the room where his wife was sitting not a sound was audible , there was n't an indication of her presence . Lee turned away to the mantel-piece dominated by Cytherea . Here , he addressed himself silently to the doll , you 're responsible for this . Get me out of it . I 'll put it all in your hands , that hand you have raised and hold half open and empty . But his , he added , in an embittered lightness , was an affair of matrimony ; it was a moral knot ; and it had nothing to do with Cytherea , with the shape , the sea , the island , of Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair , the exact position , in which he had left her . And when he returned to the place he had deserted , she took no notice of him . Her eyes were fixed in thought , her lips pinched . Was it only now , or had he never noticed it before , that her hands resembled her face , bony with a dry fine skin ? Perhaps , heroically , she was thrusting the whole subject of Savina Grove from her mind ; he could n't tell ; her exterior showed Lee Randon nothing , He waited , undecided if he 'd smoke . Lee did n't , he found , want to . She shook her head , a startled look passed through her eyes , and Fanny sighed deeply . She seemed to come back from a far place . It was , of course , the past , her early aspirations ; herself , young ; but what , out of her remembrance , had she brought with her ? * * * * * Nothing . Her first words instantly dispelled what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is surprising to me that you could go up to the children ; but I suppose we must all be glad to have you pay attention to them at any time . " This minor development he succeeded in avoiding . " I have been thinking hard , " she continued , " and I have made up my mind about you ; it is this  --  you just simply have to be different . I wo n't let you , us , stay like this . It is hideous . " " You are quite right , " he admitted ; " and I have already agreed that the change must principally be in me . If you 'd explain it to me , what you have decided on , we 'll find out , if possible , how to go about it . " " At least you need n't be sarcastic , " she replied ; " I am not as impossible as you make out . You will have to be different at home  --  " " I thought it was outside home you objected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she went on ; " and I wo n't have them , it , a minute longer . Not a minute ! You have got to behave yourself . " " You have n't been very definite yet . " " Mrs. Grove  --  Savina , " she flung back at him . " That is a name and not a fact . " " It 's a fact that you kissed her . " Fanny leaned forward , flushed and tense , knocking over her stool . " And that you put your arms around her , and said  --  oh , I do n't know what you did say . Did she mention me ? " " Only indirectly , " he replied with a gleam of malice ; " neither of us did . " " I am glad of that anyhow . " But her vindictive tone betrayed the words . " Although I can easily guess why you did n't  --  you were ashamed . You did kiss her ; why wo n't you admit it ? " " What 's the good ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so positively that nothing I could say would be of any use . " " Did she call you Lee ? " " Hell , Fanny , what a God-forsaken lot of young nonsense ! " His anger was mounting . " You can understand here as well as later that I am not going to answer any of it ; and I 'll not listen to a great deal more . Sometimes , lately , you have been insulting , but now you are downright pathetic , you are so ridiculous . " " You will stay exactly where you are until I get done . " Her tone was perceptibly shriller . " And do n't you dare call me pathetic ; if you only knew  --  disgracing yourself in New York , with a family at home . It is too common and low and vulgar for words : like a travelling salesman . But I 'll make you behave if I have to lock you up . " Lee Randon laughed at her ; and , at the contempt in his mirth , she rose , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have it ! " Her voice was almost a scream , and she brought her hands down so violently on the table that , as she momentarily broke the circuit of the electric lamp , there was a flash of greenish light . It was exactly as though her fury , a generated incandescence of rage , had burned into a perceptible flare . This , he realized , was worse than he had anticipated ; he saw no safe issue ; it was entirely serious . Lee was aware of a vague sorrow , a wish to protect Fanny , from herself as much as anything ; but he was powerless . At the same time , with the support of no affection , without interest , his patience was rapidly vanishing . He was conscious of Fanny not as his wife , nor as a being lost in infinite suffering , but as a woman with her features strangely , grotesquely , twisted and drawn . His principal recognition was that she meant nothing to him ; she was n't even familiar ; he could n't credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire intimacy . Dissolved by his indifference , the past vanished like a white powder in a glass of water . She might have been a woman overtaken by a mental paroxysm in the cold impersonality of a railway station . " Stop it , " he commanded sharply ; " you are hysterical , all kinds of a fool . " " Only one kind , " she corrected him , in a voice so rasped that it might have come from a rusted throat ; " and I 'm not going to be it much longer . You have cured me , you and that Savina . But what  --  what makes me laugh is how you thought you could explain and lie and bully me . Anything would do to tell me , I 'd swallow it like one of those big grapes . " She was speaking in gusts , between the labored heavings of her breast ; her eyes were staring and dark ; and her hands opened and shut , shut and opened , continuously . Fanny 's cheeks were now mottled , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pallor of her skin . " In a minute more you 'll be sick , " he warned her . " Oh , God , " she whispered , " that 's all he knows , all he feels ! In a minute , a minute , I 'll be sick . Do n't you see , you damned fool , " her voice rose until it seemed impossible that she could hold the pitch , " ca n't you understand I am dying ? " " No . " His terseness was calculated : that , he thought , would best control her wildness . " No one could be more alive . If I were you , though , I 'd go up to bed ; we 've had enough of this , or I have ; I ca n't speak for you . But , however that may be , and as I 've said before , it has got to stop , now , at once . " If it did n't , he continued silently , he would n't be eternally responsible for himself ; never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his endurance was unpredictable . His feeling toward the woman before him was shifting , as well ; the indifference was becoming bitterness ; the bitterness glittered , like mica , with points of hatred . He felt this , like an actual substance , a jelly-like poison , in his blood , affecting his body and mind . It bred in him a refined brutality , an ingenious cruelty . " A mirror would shut you up quicker than anything else , " he informed her ; " you look like a woman of sixty  --  go somewhere and fix your face . " " It does n't surprise me you are insulting , " she replied , " but I did n't expect it quite so soon . I thought you might hide what you really were a little longer ; it seemed to me you might try to keep something . But I guess it 's better to have it all done with at once , and to meet the worst . " " You talk as though there were no one but you in this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . You 'll find that I have a little to say . Here it is : I am tired of your suspicions and questions and insinuations . You have n't any idea of marriage except as a bed-room farce . You 're so pure that you imagine more indecencies in a day than I could get through with in five years . If there were one I had n't thought of , you 'd have me at it in no time . It was pleasant at the Groves ' because there was none of this infernal racket . Mrs. Grove , no  --  Savina , is a wise woman . I was glad to be with her , to get away  --  " " Go back , then ! " Fanny cried . " Do n't bother about me and your home and the children . You brought me here , and made me have them , all the blood and tearing ; but that does n't matter . Not to you ! I wo n't let you touch me again . " " That need n't trouble you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have her ... to touch . " She could scarcely articulate , each word was pronounced as though it had cost a separate and strangling effort . " You vile , rotten coward ! " The flood of her hysteria burst so suddenly that , unprepared , he was overwhelmed with its storm of tears and passionate charges . " You ought to be beaten till you fell down . You would n't say these things to me , treat me like this , if I were n't helpless , if I could do anything . But I ca n't , and you are safe . I am only your wife and not some filthy woman in New York . " As she moved her head the streaming tears swung out from her face . " God damn you . " Her hand went out to the table and , rising , it held the heavy dull yellow paper cutter . Before he could draw back she struck him ; the copper point ripped down his jaw and hit his shoulder a jarring blow . In an instant of passion Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head rolled as though her neck were broken . Even in his transport of rage , with his fingers dug into her flesh , he stopped to see if this were true . It was n't . She swayed uncertainly , dazed and gasping , while her hair , shaken loose from its knot , slowly cascaded over one shoulder . Then stumbling , groping , with a hand on a chair , against the frame of the door , she went out of the room . * * * * * Lee 's jaw bled thickly and persistently ; the blood soaked , filled , his handkerchief ; and , going to the drawer in the dining-room where the linen was kept , he secured and held against a ragged wound a napkin , He was nauseated and faint . His rage , killed , as it were , at its height , left him with a sensation of emptiness and degradation . The silence  --  after the last audible dragging footfall of Fanny slowly mounting the stairs  --  was appalling : it was as though all the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been stopped at once and forever . He removed the sop from the cut , and the bleeding promptly took up its spreading over his throat and under his collar . That blow had killed a great deal : the Lee Randon married to Fanny was already dead ; Fanny , too , had told him that she was dying , killed from within . It was a shame . He was walking when it occurred to him that he had better keep quiet ; if the blood did n't soon stop he should require help ; he was noticeably weak . His feeling with regard to Fanny was confined to curiosity , but mainly his thoughts , his illimitable disgust , were directed at himself . His anger , returning like the night wind from a different direction , cut at himself , at the collapse of his integrity . He was , in reality , frightened at what had been no better than a relapse into a state of mania ; he was shocked at the presence , however temporary , of a frenzy of madness . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ; all his active emotions for her had gone . Then his attention was drawn from his personality to his life , his surroundings ; they were suffocating . Not to be borne ! Nowhere could he discover a detail , an episode , that had the importance of reality . He had a sensation of being wrapped in a feather bed , the need to make a violent gesture  --  sending the white fluff whirling through space  --  and so be free to breathe . This house , the symmetrical copied walls , the harmonious rugs , symbols of public success and good opinion , the standard of a public approbation , exasperated him beyond endurance . He wanted to push the walls out , tear the rugs into rags , and scatter them contemptuously before the scandalized inertness of Eastlake . Lee had what was regarded as an admirable existence , an admirable family  --  the world imposed this judgment on him ; and the desire , the determination , swept over him to smash to irremediable atoms what was so well applauded . The thought fascinated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it go , it was worthless to him , the companies and bonds and the woman and children , the jog-trotting on fenced roads , the vain pretentions of the country club , the petty grasping at the petticoats  --  where they were worn  --  of variety . Lee wished that he could do this in the presence of everyone he knew ; he wanted to see their outraged faces , hear the shocked expressions , as he insulted , demolished , all that they worshipped . The blood , he found , had stopped ; his hurt was relatively unimportant . The fever of rebellion , of destruction , increased in him until it was as violent , as blinding , as his earlier fury ; and he went at once in search of Fanny . She had undressed , and , in a nightgown effectively drawn with blue ribbons , she lay face down across the bottom of her bed . One shoulder , immaculately white except for the leaden bruises of his fingers , was bare , and an arm , from which her jewelled wrist watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her , but , breathing faintly , she made no sign of a consciousness of his presence . " Fanny , " he began , speaking with an effort of calmness out of his laboring being , " this is all over for me . As I told you so many times , I 've had too much of it . It 's yours , anyhow , and the children are yours , and you may do what you like with the whole affair . I 'm done . " Still she did n't move , reply . " I am going , " he said more impatiently , " tonight . I want you to understand that this is final . You were too good a wife ; I could n't keep even with you ; and I ca n't say , now , that I want to . Everyone will tell you that I am no good  --  you see , I have n't the shadow of a cause for leaving  --  and the best thing you can do is believe them . If I had what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if that has any sense ; you may put your own interpretation on it . " She turned and half rose , regarding him from the edge of the bed . Her face , no longer brightly mottled , was sunken , and dull with despair . " I ca n't talk , " she said ; " the words are all hard like stones down in my heart . You 'll have to go ; I ca n't stop you ; I knew you had gone yesterday , or was it last week ? I saw it was a hopeless fight but I tried , I had to ; I thought your memory would help . " " It was n't Savina who did this , " he informed her ; " I want you to realize that fully . Whatever happens , she is not to blame . All , all the fault is mine ; it would take too long to explain , you would n't believe me  --  you could n't  --  and so I am deserting you . That is the word for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a clouding perplexity . " I ca n't think it 's true . " Her voice was dazed . " A thing like this could n't be happening to us , to me . It 's only for a little , we are both cross  --  " He cut her short with the assurance that what he said he meant . Sentimental indulgence , he felt , was dangerously out of place . She slipped back , supine , on the bed ; and , with short sobs , she cried , " Go ! Go ! Go ! " In his room he methodically and thoughtfully assembled the necessities for his bag ; he was arranging mentally the details of his act . Where , primarily , it affected Fanny and the children , his lawyers could handle it best ; it was the present consequences to himself , the step immediately before him , that demanded consideration . But his deliberation was lost in the knowledge that he would go to New York where , inevitably , he should see Savina . No one could predict what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Savina must conclude , as it had begun  --  in obedience to pressures beyond their control . An increasing excitement flowed over him at the thought of being with her , possessing her , again . There was no doubt of that in his mind ; he knew that Savina would come to him . She was far more ruthless in brushing aside artificial barriers , prejudices , than , until now , he . The figure of William Grove occupied him for a little , but he seemed insubstantial , not so much a being as a convention to be smashed in his own house . Lee Randon decided not to speak again , to say good-bye , to Fanny . It would only multiply the difficulties of his leaving ; she might have another attack of rage , or  --  worse  --  of affection . He was amazed at his lack of feeling , a little disturbed : perhaps there was something fatally wrong , lacking , about him , and he was embarked on the first violent stage of physical and mental degradation . It could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , in the hall . Beyond , the stool lay where Fanny had kicked it ; and he bent over to pick up the copper paper cutter from the floor . Putting it on the table , he reflected that Fanny would , in ash holder with a mahogany stand ; and that , as unnecessarily unpleasant , he hid in a pocket . The electric globe in the floor lamp was yellow ; it was nearly burned out and would have to be replaced . This had been his special corner , the most comfortable in the pen . But the pig , he remembered , had been slaughtered last week ; and he wondered if the parallel he had established would hold true to the end . In the main aspect , he concluded , yes . But the pig had died without experiencing what was , undoubtedly , both the fundamental duty and recompense of living . The pig , happily or unhappily , had remained in ignorance of Cytherea and the delights of love ; but , perhaps , if only for the moment , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clearer , more exact , definition . He left the house walking , carrying his bag up the hill into Eastlake : a train left for the city at eleven-fifty-eight . Lee turned , beyond his property , and saw the light burning in what had been his and Fanny 's room ; the rest of the house , except for the glimmer below , was dark . The winter night was encrusted with stars . A piercing regret seized him  --  that he was past the middle of forty and not in the early twenties . To be young and to know Savina ! To be young and free . To be young ... the increasing rapidity with which he went forward had the aspect of an endeavor to waste no more precious time . V The brief level voice of Savina Grove arranging over the telephone an hour , very late in the afternoon , for him to call , gave Lee a comparatively long time in which to examine his feelings , particularly in connection with Savina . His state of mind , his intentions , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her . In general they were ; but the particulars , the details of any probable immediate action , evaded him . He should have to consult her about them . What he most firmly grasped of all was that he could n't  --  what , in reality , he breathed to himself was they  --  remain in New York . The comparatively orderly and delayed legal arrangement projected by the Morrises and Mina Raff seemed to have no application to the impetuosity of the situation before him . However , he was advancing at a speed , to a position , for which there was no warrant . None at all . Perhaps Savina , satisfied by the one occasion which  --  he had been so careful to insist  --  must be the last , would regard him as merely importunate . Strictly held to discretion by the fact of Fanny , Savina might have found him then  --  more available than when free  --  only the acceptable model of an indiscreet man . Yet , he reminded himself , he had n't left Eastlake , broken wide open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he again insisted , would have happened independently of her ; his life in Eastlake had broken up of its own accord ; its elements had been too tenuous for the withstanding any longer of the stress of existence . But , he was forced to add , the collapse had been hastened by his knowledge of Savina . And this brought him to the examination of what , at bottom , she meant to him . What was her significance , her bulk , in his life ? That could be approached only through an understanding of his feeling for her , what it was now and what it might become ; not conspicuously easy of comprehension . Lee tried the old , the long inaccurately used , word , love . He asked himself the question squarely  --  did he love Savina ? Damned if he knew ! He might reply to that , he thought ruefully , if he grasped what love was , what the blasted phrase meant . As it was , it seemed to Lee , a dictionary of synonyms would be helpless to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach  --  did he want to be with Savina more than with anyone else ? At last he had put a question to himself that he could answer : he most assuredly preferred being with Savina to anyone else he knew . But that alone would not have taken him to her . A simple desire on his part , naive like a daisy , could not have overthrown the structure of his being . Yet the connection between the two , the woman and the event , was undeniable , his impulse to go to her now irresistible . That last word , as fully as any , expressed what lately had happened to him . He was considering the occurrences logically while the fact was that logic had n't been touched on , summoned , once . He had moved emotionally and not intellectually ; he had n't known , from hour to hour , in what direction he would proceed . Certainly nothing could be said in his defense on the score of common sense ; that , though , did n't disturb him ; at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , common sense had failed him utterly . He had thrown that over his shoulder . Nor was he searching for an exterior justification of his present anomalous position , for , briefly , an excuse ; excuses were the furthest of all things from his mind . The truth was that he was decidedly exhilarated , as though he had left the hard narrow road for a gallop over the green . He was merely dwelling on , analyzing , the present as it was becoming the newly promising , the opening , future . But he did need to understand  --  for an attitude , a choice of speech , if nothing else  --  his feeling for Savina . It consisted principally in the tyrannical desire to be with her , to sink in the immeasurable depths of her passion , and there lose all consciousness of the trivial mundane world . That , Lee felt , given the rest , the fact that he was here as he was , was sufficient ; but  --  again still  --  he had had no voice in it . The passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a low- water rock . Abruptly , after a certain misleading appearance of hesitation on the part of the waves , he had gone under . Well , it was very pleasant . In his case the celebrated maxims were wrong . He left this , for the moment , and returned to what , actually , lay ahead of him . Would Savina go away with him , leave the correct William , the safety of their New York house in the style of eighteen-eighty ? Lee considered in her two impulses , not alike  --  her overwhelming passion , herself generally ; and her admission , no , cry , that she loved him , or the special part he had in her . It rather looked as though he 'd be successful . It did for a fact . He had not been idle through all the day , but had drawn from the Harriman Bank twenty thousand dollars . So much had not been necessary ; it was very bad business to segregate in idleness such a sum of money now ; but he enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a factor in his affairs . His present personal liberty , more complete than it had ever been before  --  than , he added lightly , it might ever be again  --  was astonishingly soothing . Sitting comfortably in a room in his customary hotel , there was n't a pressure that could be brought to bear on him . It was now twenty minutes past four , he was to go to Savina at a quarter to six , and until then there was nothing , nothing , to force him this way or that : no directors ' meetings , gabbling East-lake figures , responsibility , housewife or children . He had n't realized the extent to which he had been surrounded and confined , the imponderable mass of what he had not only been indifferent to but actually disliked . He could lie down  --  he had been up the entire past night  --  and be called in an hour ; he could sit as he was , in an unbuttoned waistcoat with his legs comfortably spread out ; he could motor or walk on Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being . Or , going back to that moment when he had , so mistakenly , turned aside from visionary promptings to a solid comfortable career , he might  --  what was it ?  --  write . Perhaps his sharp regret at the loss of his youth was premature , youth itself comparatively unimportant . But no , that would involve him in fresh distasteful efforts , imperceptibly it would build up a whole new world of responsibilities : writing would be arduous , editors captious , and articles , stories , books , tie him back again to all that from which he had so miraculously escaped . Savina would be enough . What a beautiful body , so unexpectedly full , she had ; how astounding , intoxicating , was the difference between what she seemed to be and what she was . Lee Randon thought with amused pity of the files of men who must have passed by her , with the most considerate bows , in ignorance of the inner truth . That discovery , while , naturally , it had not been entirely reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept back , like the best of all presents , for the last . He was glad that it was n't too late for him to enjoy it . Here , suddenly , intervening in the midst of a prosaic drudgery , a tepid and meaningless period , was a magnificent relief . By God , would he take advantage of it ! Would he ! There was a knock at the door , and the hotel valet hung a freshly pressed suit in the closet ; the shoes into which he intended to change were in a perfection of readiness ; laid out were a heavy blue silk shirt and a dull yellow tie . Lee got these various carefully selected articles of dress slowly , exactly , on . His pearl pin Fanny had given him ! Well , it was a good pearl , selected personally by a celebrated dealer ; and Lee was obliged to her , nothing more . He lighted a cigarette , collected his hat and gloves , his overcoat and stick , and descended in the elevator in a mood of unrestrained enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a taxi-cab , commenting lightly on the visible accident to his jaw . But , in spite of it , Lee had an appearance , as he phrased it , of good luck . The world , he said , was evidently in favor of Mr. Randon . The latter agreed that it had such a look . He was positively jovial . He dismissed the cab before the familiar entrance on East Sixty-sixth Street , and was admitted immediately : the servant caught his coat , and he went into the drawing- room . There had been , he saw , a tea ; the confusion lingering from a crowd was evident ; the cups , on all the available surfaces , had not been removed ; in a corner were the skeleton-like iron music racks of a small orchestra ; ash trays were overflowing ; and a sealskin muff , with a bunch of violets pinned to it , had been left . Savina had gone upstairs , but she would be down at once . Lee was turned away from the door when she entered ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he heard it called Cuba color ?  --  with a heavy girdle of grotesque intertwined silver figures . With a single glance behind her she swept forward into Lee 's arms , her mouth held up to his . * * * * * Listening closely to all that he had to say , she sat with her hands quietly folded on crossed knees . Perhaps twice she nodded , comprehendingly . " And so , " he ended , " that is what has occurred . We are not to blame ourselves too much , as I 've explained ; the thing happened within itself , died of its own accord . But the past does n't need our attention now . The future is the thing . What is it going to be ? What , " he hesitated , " can we make it ? Maybe everything , or nothing . " " Are you leaving that for me to decide ? " she asked . " To a great extent I have to ; I do n't want to appear to take so much for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to offer . I believe what I have done is considered serious , if not ruinous ; but that I ca n't help thinking is exaggerated . I have n't been struck down yet . I do n't , candidly , now , expect to be . You ought to come to this through your head , and not the heart , which I 'd naturally prefer you to use . What , in fact , I am asking you is to go away with me , to live with me . I shall not , and you could n't , very well , return . It 's quite final , in other words . I must find out , too , if the irregularity upsets you . That need only be temporary . Grove and Fanny , I am sure , would n't persist in being disagreeable . But , if they did , we 'd have to face that as well , the consequences of my  --  my impatience . " No , do n't answer so quickly . Do you know me , are you sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some money , not a great deal for myself now ; I should say fifteen thousand dollars a year . Fanny , very rightfully  --  for herself and the children  --  will get most of what I have . And then , are you wedded , if not to your individual life here , to New York ? We should have to go away to some place rather vague  --  " " Cuba , " she broke in . The irony of that suggestion carried him back to the many vainly projected trips there with Fanny . His brother was in Cuba , it was true ; but that might turn out excellently : Daniel would be able to help them in the difficult readjustments to follow . He was intelligent , unprejudiced and calm and , Lee added , remote from the values , the ponderous authority , of a northern hypocritical society . Then he forgot that in the realization that Savina was going away with him , that she was to be his , not for a solitary stolen night , but for years ... openly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heedless of the open doors . Now she was cooler than Lee , and pushed him away . " William will be in at any minute , " she explained : " When shall we leave ? " " We might take a train tonight for Washington , since we 'll need passports and I have to have an income tax receipt , and we can manage all that best there . Then Key West , Havana , anywhere . We will hope to get off without trouble ; but , if Grove interferes , accept the consequences as they come . " " Very well . " Savina grew still quieter as the march of events became headlong . " I can live without a maid for a while . Tonight I wo n't dress for dinner , this will do very nicely for the train ; and come as soon after as I can pack a bag . There will be literally nothing in it ; my summer things are all out of reach . Washington will be convenient for me , too . Unless you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly , " he acknowledged ; " though I would n't drive around the city to avoid him . Somehow  --  I may be blind  --  I ca n't think that I am doing him an infamous wrong : that he lost you proves that . Why , under the circumstances , should you , anyone , stay ? I do n't feel a particle immoral , or even devilish . It 's all so sensible and balanced and superior . No , no , let William watch out for himself ; his club , he 's so devoted to , wo n't fail him . Fanny and he will have their whole worlds to sympathize with their injury . We do n't need sympathy . " Lee walked back to the hotel , the pig-skin wrapped walking stick swinging from an arm , his bearing confident and relaxed . He stopped at the desk for a conference with the porter  --  a basket of fruit from the restaurant , and , if procurable regularly or irregularly , a drawing-room on the Washington train . Then he went up and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigars afterwards ; he was n't hungry , but the ceremony would kill the intervening two hours and more . The porter found him later and delivered his tickets , including the check for a drawing-room , secured as irregularly as possible from the Pullman conductor . There were , it began to seem , to be no minor annoyances . At a few minutes before ten he was standing , as he had arranged with Savina , with his bag before the hotel ; and , just past the hour , the cab which held her turned in to the sidewalk . She had two bags , but one was very small  --  her toilet things , she explained  --  and she was carrying a jewel case . There was n't a tremor in her voice or bearing , the slightest indication that they were going farther than a theatre in the vicinity of Forty-fourth Street . Internally , Lee was excited , filled with the long strange sense of holiday . " William went to the club , " Savina told him with a smile edged with malice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he gets back it will be changed . I 'm sorry to miss his expression when he reads the letter I wrote ; he wo n't show it to anyone . " " That sounds as though you really disliked him , " Lee observed . Then he remembered the hatred he had felt for Fanny . Matrimony had a brutal hand for superficial relationships and conventions . He had spoken lightly but , watching her , he saw the grimness of her passion strike the animation from her face . The jewel case slid over the softness of her wrap to the floor , her hand crept under his cuff , clinging to his arm . Going immediately to their train , they found the fruit in the drawing- room ; the porter stopped to knock at the door and discover if they were in need of his attendance . They heard dimly the train 's muffled boring under the river and were conscious of the swimming lights of the Jersey plain , the confused illuminated darkness of cities , the tranquility of open country , the ringing echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were , again , reaching Washington , close in a taxi-cab ; Savina 's jewel case again fell unheeded ; and again , after the shortest halt possible , they were whirling south in a drawing-room where night and day were indistinguishable one from the other . On the rear platform of the orange-painted train moving deliberately along the Florida coast Lee was first aware of the still , saturating heat ; that , in itself , was enough to release him from the winter-like grip of Eastlake . He lost all sense of time , of hurry , of the necessity of occupation as opposed to idleness , of idleness contrasted with sleep . The promise of satiation , of inevitability , steeped his being in a pleasant lethargy . It was the same to him if they moved or stopped , whether they arrived at the next destination or remained forever in a sandy monotony of tomato fields or by a slow pass of water cutting the harshness of palmettos . On the viaducts he gazed with half-closed eyes across the sapphire and emerald green and purple water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incuriously into a tide so clear that it seemed no more than a breath ruffling the sand beneath . Savina , who had discarded cloth for dull white linen  --  she wished , she explained , to make the transition as sharply as possible  --  was more alertly interested in their constantly shifting surroundings ; they were significant to her as the milestones of her incredible escape . On the steamer for Havana , marking their effects deposited in a cabin with a double iron bed and unpleasantly ubiquitous basins , she explained to Lee that she never got seasick ; but he might have gathered that , she pointed out , by her willingness to undertake Cuba . Admitting that he had missed this feminine subtlety , he arranged two deck chairs in an advantageous angle , and they sat enveloped in a mildness which , heavy with the odor of water-soaked wood , was untroubled by any wind . When the steamer left its pier Savina put a hand inside one of his . The harbor lights dropped , pair by pair , back into the night ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the placid water astern a rippling phosphorescence was stirred and subsided . A motion , increasing by imperceptible degrees , affected the deck ; there was a rise and fall , regular and sleep-impelling : the uneasiness of the Gulf Stream . Havana floated into their waking vision , a city of white marble set in lustrous green , profound indigo , against the rosy veil of a morning sun . * * * * * The fortunate chance that took them to the Inglaterra Hotel  --  the disdain of its runner was more persuasive than the clamor of all the others who had boarded the steamer  --  found them a room , they soon discovered , in what was at once the most desirable and the most unlikely place . They might have the chamber until Tuesday , Lee was told , in an English inflected with the tonal gravity of Spain . It was hardly past eight in the morning , an awkward hour to arrive newly at a city , he thought , as they were carried up in the elevator . The details of the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone for the height of the ceiling , which was excessive , but because of the palms , the pointed Moorish arches filled with green painted wood lattices ; the totality of an effect different from anything else he had seen . Their room , with the lift of the ceiling emphasized by the confined space , was more engaging still : tall slatted doors opened on an iron railed balcony , the bath-room was like a tunnel on end , and the floor an expanse of polished mosaic in a pattern of yellow and grey . Lee walked out on the balcony ; directly below and across a narrow paved street was a floridly impressive building obviously for the purpose of varied assemblages , and on his left a park was laid in concrete walks , royal palms on towering smooth dull trunks , unfamiliar trees with a graceful dense foliage , and innumerable stacked iron chairs about the marble statue of a man with a pointing hand . These details , however , were slowly gathered from an effect the whole of which was bewilderingly white , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a scene , a city , Lee recognized , more foreign to his own than any he knew in western Europe ; a difference that existed mainly in the tropical heat , visible in languorous waves rising from blanched walls and streets already  --  so early  --  fervent . Savina was filled with delight ; a positive color glowed in place of the customary uniform pallor of her cheeks ; she opened her bags with an irresistible youthful energy . " Think what we have been missing , " she called above the sound of the water running into the tub ; " and what we accepted so long for living . I suppose the wonderful thing is that we escaped . Lee , do you realize that almost no one does ? They never never get away , but go from one grave , from one winter , to another . Is n't it strange , when what we did is so very easy . " I 'd like to tell a hundred people in New York that they could get away too , unfreeze themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went along so quietly in blinders ; they never seemed to learn that one kick would break into splinters the thing dragging on them . People are like that , I was and you were , too  --  in blinders . We 've torn ours off , Lee . Tell me that you are glad . " He was , without reserve . Tranquilly finding his razors , he was aware of a permeating contentment in what they had done . It was exactly as Savina had said  --  the forces which had held them in a rigorous northern servitude had proved , upon assault , to be no more than a defense of painted prejudices , the canvas embrasures of hypocrisy . " It is astonishing , what so many people put up with , " he agreed ; " but then , " Lee added , in a further understanding , " it is n't so much what you knock down as what you carry away , take everywhere , inside you . When an arrangement like ours fails , that , mostly , I suspect , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take the hundred people you spoke of  --  I 'd be willing to bet not five of them could get away from the past , or put out of their minds what they are brought up on . Privately they would think they were wicked , damned , or some such truck ; and , sure enough , that alone would finish them . " " I have n't a speck of that , " Savina admitted serenely ; " I am happy . And I do n't even have to ignore the thought of your wife and children ; they 'll get along just as well , maybe better , without you . William does n't need me ; he has n't for a number of years . But we had to have each other . " Lee Randon considered this in relation to his feeling that he had not left Eastlake , Fanny , because of Savina . He was still convinced that his life had fallen apart of itself ; but he began to see that Savina had been more deeply involved in his act of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would have continued to the end in the negative existence of Eastlake ; yet no amount of mere assurance that that was the only admirable , the only permissible , course was valid with him unless he had a corroborating belief . And all that he might once have possessed had left him at the final blow dealt by the passion of Savina and himself . She had been stronger than the assembled forces of heredity and precept and experience ; her strength was superhuman ; it was incredible that her slender body could hold such an impulse , a fury really , of vitality . Women must have been like that in earlier ages of humanity ; but they were no longer ; their passion had been wasted , spent , or turned aside into exhausting by-paths of sensation . He had finished shaving and , when they were dressed , they went down to breakfast in a dining-room with a marble floor and walls lustrous with bronze tiling . They had tall glasses of iced orange juice ; and , with the last fragrant draught of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like , " he proceeded comfortably , " you may rush around and see as much of the city as possible . There is a big omnibus at the door . Personally , I am going to do nothing of the kind . I intend to sit and smoke , and then  --  smoke and sit . I am done with the proper and expected thing in every one of its forms . I have always hated churches ; and the spots where soldiers fell or martyrs were burned , monuments , just annoy me ; and picture galleries give me colds in the head . Above all else I do n't want to be improved ; if I hear a fact of any sort I am going to bed for the rest of the day . " " I do n't care about those , either , " Savina assented ; " but the stores , yes . I have to have a mantilla and a high comb right away , now ; and  --  I warn you  --  if it 's only in our room I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I 'd bring back a shell jacket covered with green braid and a wide scarlet sash , or whatever an espada wears . " " A guitar and a carnation ought to do , " he responded . " Count on me for nothing until the evening , when , if you care to , we 'll drive along the sea , one way and then the other , and have dinner where we happen to be . I hope you will wear the most extravagant and holiday clothes  --  white , and very ruffled and thin , would be nice , with emeralds . " " It 's a good thing I have a lot of money , " she observed ; " you have some , of course , but it would n't begin to support your ambitions . " " I do n't even care which of us has it , " he admitted ; " so it 's there . A year ago I should have looked pained and insisted that I could n't accept , nor allow you to use , your own money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi-cab fare , though , luckily ; but if you did bring the emeralds I saw you wearing in New York do n't throw them away on my account . " " They are here , " she assured him . " William gave them to me when we were married . " " Splendid , together with Fanny 's pearl , " he replied placidly ; " I was afraid they had been a legacy from your mother . I much prefer them to have been William 's  --  it will give them such a Utopian sparkle . " When Savina had gone , in a long brightly-painted car summoned from the line backed at the plaza 's edge , Lee Randon returned to their room . The heat of the day , approaching noon , the ceaseless noise of Havana rose diffused to the balcony where he sat until the circling sunlight forced him to move inside . What amazing comfort ! A curiously impersonal admiration for Savina grew with the understanding of her exceptionally perceptive being . She was what , above all else , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tempered , in the satin of a faultless aesthetic sense ; the delicacy of her body was resembled by the fineness of her feminine mind ; she was entirely , deliciously , decorative . The black brocade mules by her bed were characteristic of her  --  useless charming objects that had cost twenty , thirty , dollars . Their sliding tap on the glazed floor was an appreciable part of his happiness ; Savina 's bottles on a dressing-table were engraved crystal with gold stoppers : it was all as it should be . * * * * * When she returned she redressed her hair , drawing it back across her ears , put in at a provocative angle a fan-like carved shell comb , and twisted a shawl of flame-colored silk  --  it was a manton , she instructed him  --  about her shoulders . The guise of Andalusia was very becoming to her . For a dinner , Savina wore the filmy white and emeralds ; they went to a restaurant like a pavilion on a roof , their table , by a low masonry wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cloaked in night , was cooled by the trade wind moving softly across the sea ; the water of the harbor was black , like jet shining with the reflections of the lights strung along the shore ; the lighthouse at Morro Castle marked the rocky thrust of the land . The restaurant was crowded : beyond Lee were four officers of the Spanish navy in snowy linen and corded gilt ; in the subdued light the faces of women , under wide flowery hats , were illusive and fascinating ; everywhere the deep crimson of Castilian wines was set against the amber radiance of champagne . Directly below , shadowy trees hid the stone margin of the bay , and an enormous tripod , such as might be used for removing the cargoes of ships , raised its primitive simplicity . " Look , Lee ! " Savina laid a hand on his wrist . A steamer , incredibly large and near , was moving slowly out through the narrow channel to the sea . Rows of golden lights shone on its decks and from the port-holes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , " she went on , " we 'll take a boat like that , and go  --  where ? It does n't matter : to a far strange land . Hills scented with tea flowers . Streets with lacquered houses . Villages with silver bells hung along the eaves . Valleys of primroses under mountains of ice . We 'll see them all from little windows , and then it will be night . But , principally , we will never go back  --  never ! never ! never ! We will be together for years . Let 's go to the hotel now ; Lee . I am rather tired ; it 's the heat , do n't you think ? I am worn , and , because I am so happy , a trifle dizzy . Not much . Nothing to worry about . But I only want you , Lee ; in my heart I do n't care for the valleys and bells and scents . " Yet , before they reached the hotel they stopped , Savina insisted , for cocktails of Bacardi rum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar that remained at the bottoms of the glasses . In the night  --  their beds were separated by the width of the balcony doors  --  she called for him , acute with fright . " What is it ? " she cried . " Hark , Lee , that horrible sound . " The air was filled with a drumming wail , a dislocated savage music , that affected him like a nightmare grown audible . " It 's coming from across the street , from the Opera House , " he told her ; " some kind of a dance , I 'm certain . " Patently it was an orchestra , but the instruments that composed it , the measures woven of frantic screaming notes and dull stale iterations , he had no means of identifying . " Bedlam in the jungle , " he said soothingly . She wished it would stop . Soon he agreed with her ; without pause , without variation , with an insistence which became cruel , and then unbearable , it went on . Lee Randon , after an uneasiness which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactness in his description : it was , undoubtedly , the jungle , Africa , debased into a peculiarly harrowing travesty of later civilized emotions . Finally he lost the impression of a meaninglessness ; it assumed a potency , a naked reality , more profound than anything in his previous knowledge . It was the voice of a crazed and debased passion . To Lee , it seemed to strip him of his whiteness , his continence , his integrity , to flay him of every particle of restraint and decency , and set him , bestial and exposed , in a ball room with glass-hung chandeliers . Incomprehensibly the fluctuating clamor  --  he could distinguish low pitched drums  --  brought him the vision , pale and remote and mysteriously smiling , of Cytherea . He thought of that torrential discord rising around her belled purple skirt , the cool yellow of her waist crossed with fragile lace , beating past her lifted slender hand , the nails stained with vermilion , to the pointed oval of her face against the black hair and streaming gold of the headdress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muffled furious strains escaping in bursts through the opened windows beyond and the still apparition from the tranquility of his Eastlake house . He would have said , unhesitatingly , that the formal melody of the eighteenth century , of Scarlatti and harpsichords , was the music that best accompanied Cytherea . But she dominated , haunted with her grace , the infernal dinning sound of unspeakable defilements . Savina was racked beyond endurance : " I ca n't stand it any longer , " she told Lee hysterically , risen with her palms pressed to her ears . " I can hear it with every nerve . It will never go out of my brain . You must stop it . Ca n't you understand that it is driving me mad ! " Her voice grew so shrill , she trembled so violently , that he had to hold her forcibly in his arms . When , toward dawn , it ceased , Savina was exhausted ; she lay limp and white on her bed ; and , across the room , he could hear the shallowness of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trade wind , the night wind , dropped , and the heat palpably increased . Instantaneously the sun-flooded morning was born , a morning that lost its freshness , its pearly iridescence , immediately . He closed the slats of the balcony doors : Savina at last was sleeping , with her countenance , utterly spent , turned to him . The sharp cries of the newsboys , the street vendors , were drowned in the full sweep of a traffic moving to the blasts of multitudinous horns . When she woke , past ten , drinking the small cup of black coffee which locally accompanied dressing , she was still shaken . " That 's the most cursed racket anyone ever had to endure ! " A growing irritation made harsh his voice . " You could n't torment a worse sound out of a thousand cats . " She smiled wanly . " If we were like that in the past , " he added , " I 'm glad we changed , even if we are worse in other ways . " " I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heated room she had an uncontrollable chill . " Lee , I ca n't bring myself to tell you : something black and dreadful ... had me . There was no one else . It was like a woods . The hands ripping at me  --  " With her face buried in her embroidered pillow , half clothed in web-like garments threaded with black ribbons , she cowered in an abject and pitiful agony . Later , he discovered that , within the scope of his possible knowledge , his conjecture had been right : a danzon , a native Cuban ball  --  not , the director of the Inglaterra gave him to understand , entirely respectable  --  had been held in the Opera House . " But there wo n't be another until after we leave , " Lee reassured Savina ; " they are rather rare except at carnival . " She shuddered . It was evident that the distressing effect on her of the music lingered through the day ; her energy gave way to a passive contentment hardly removed from listlessness . They drove , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curving sea wall from La Punta to the scattered villas of Vedado . The sea and sky were grey ; or was it blue ? At the horizon they met without a perceptible change ; the water became the air , the air water , with a transition as gradual as the edge of dusk . The tropical evening was accomplished rapidly , as dramatically as the uprush of the sun : they were gazing into the distance over a tide like a smooth undulating mist ... and there were lights crowning the Cabanas fortress ; the passing cars made the familiar geometrical patterns with the cold bars of their lamps ; they were wrapped in darkness ; night had come . Savina did n't want to go back to the hotel , their room ; and , after dinner at the Paris , they went to Carmelo , where they alternated northern dances with the stridor of a northern cabaret and drinks . Savina 's spirits revived slowly . To Lee she seemed to have changed in appearance since she left New York  --  here , losing her air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her sharp grace , exposed in the films of summer dress , had an aspect of belonging , rather than to the character she had deserted , to a woman at once conscious of its effect and not unwilling to have it measured by the appraising gaze of the masculine public . In a way , without losing her distinction , she had become evident ; another woman , one less admirably balanced , would have been conspicuous . Havana was like a , stage on which Savina  --  with a considered bravado they had kept the Randon  --  tried with intoxicating success a part she had long and secretly desired . * * * * * What , Lee found , he most enjoyed was the personal liberty he had first experienced in New York , waiting to see Savina after he had definitely left Eastlake . All the aspects of his circumferential existence , island-like in the dividing indigo of a magic sea , pleased him equally . Of course , without Savina Cuba would have been an impossibility ; she was the center , the motive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising how contented he was strolling in the outskirts , in the minor parks and glorietas and paseos , of the world of his passionate adventure . He sat placidly in the Cortina de Valdez , looking across the narrow water to the long pink wall of the Cabanas , while Savina drove and shopped and rested . Carefully avoiding the Americans at the Inglaterra , on the streets , he had no burden of empty mutual assurances , the forced stupidities of conversations , to support . His days all had the look of a period of rest after a strain of long duration . The strain , he realized , unknown to him at the time , had existed negatively through years before he had grown openly rebellious . A quality within him , in spite of him , had risen and swept him , under the eyes of Cytherea , beyond every circumstance of his former life . The resemblance between her and Savina he caught in fleet glances which defied his efforts to summon them ; and , where that similitude was concerned , he was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first , recognizing aspects of Cytherea in Savina , now in Cytherea he merely found certain qualities of the woman . The doll , it seemed , had not been absorbed in Savina ; the distant inanimate object was more real than the actual straining arms about his neck , the insatiable murmur at his ear . Yet his happiness with Savina was absolute , secure ; and still totally different from her attitude toward him . She often repeated , in a voice no longer varying from her other impassioned speech , that she loved him ; and , while this was a phrase , a reassurance , no man in his situation could escape , he returned it in a manner not wholly ringing with conviction . It was the old difficulty  --  he was n't sure , he could n't satisfy himself , about its meaning . He was not , for example , lost beyond knowledge or perception in his feeling for Savina ; carried along in the tempestuous flood of her emotion , he yet had time to linger over and enjoy the occurrences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she regarded it only as an insignificant detail of their unity . All her planning , her dress and ardor and moods , were directed to one never-lost-sight-of end ; but he disposed his attention in a hundred channels . Lee began to be aware of the tremendous single economy of women , the constant bending back of their instincts to a single preeminent purpose . Yet everywhere , now , women had concentrated in a denial of that : the men he knew had n't a monopoly of restlessness . Even Fanny , in the parading of all her rings , had not been oblivious of it . But it was n't so much that women denied their fundamental urgency as it was that they wanted it exercised under other , more rapturous , conditions . Inexplicably , and a great many at once , women had grown aware of the appalling difference between what they might demand and what they had been receiving . In consequence of this the world of masculine complacency was being dealt some rude blows . But Lee Randon could n't hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side of the fence . There were , immediately , the practical developments of his undertaking to be met . He served nothing by putting them off . He must write , but through his lawyers , to William Grove and find out what action he proposed to take , what arrangements for divorce could be facilitated . A letter  --  there could be no saving impersonality here  --  to Fanny was more difficult . From Havana , his approval of Fanny was very complete ; he understood her , made allowances , now better than at any time during their marriage ; given what , together , they were , her conduct had been admirable . A remarkably attractive and faithful woman , he told himself ; it was a pity that , in her estimation , her good qualities had come to so little . The thing for him to do was to see his brother , and move part of the burden of his decisions over to Daniel 's heavy frame . The sugar estate of which he was Administrador was in the Province of Camag ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lee had learned . It was Sunday evening now , and they would have to give up their room at the Inglaterra Tuesday . Obviously there was n't time to write Daniel and have a reply by then . The other desirable hotels were as full as the Inglaterra . He must wire , but the composition of his telegram presented an unexpected difficulty : Lee did n't know how to explain the presence with him of Savina ; he could n't determine how much or how little to say ; and it was probable that Daniel had had a cable from Eastlake . The mere putting down of the necessary words of his message , under the concerned gaze of a clerk , with a limited comprehension of English , was hazardous . The clerk , he had discovered , would read in a loud voice of misplaced linguistic confidence whatever Lee wrote , and there was a small assemblage of Americans at the counter of a steamship company across the office . What , it began to appear , they 'd have to do would be to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite come down on Daniel so unexpectedly ; he lived , Lee recalled , on a batey , the central dominating point of a sugar estate ; and  --  unmarried  --  what accommodations he might offer were problematic . Lee , from the heading of a letter , could not build the proportions of a Casa Vivienda . Well , there would be a hotel at Cobra ! That answered his doubts  --  Savina and he would go to Cobra and there communicate with Daniel . It would be easy to talk privately with him . Lee did n't want his approval , but only his careful opinions and reasonable assistance . He , Lee , would not produce Savina with the triumphant indication that her resistless charm explained everything . He was no such fatuous fool ! But , studying her , he got a solid assurance from the superiority of her person . Daniel would see at once that this was n't the usual flight south of an indulgence headed for paresis . Savina , his entire affair , demanded a dignified reception . They were seated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroic bronze statue of a dancing girl in a manton ; on the table between them was , at that hour , the inevitable small pitcher of Daiquiri cocktails . He told Savina what had been in his thoughts , and she nodded her approval : " I agree that we ought to see your brother , and , through him , communicate with New York . At present things are much too uncertain . If William , or your wife , were different they could have us held on a very unpleasant-sounding charge . I know you detest conventions , but I must say I am glad other people live by them ; it makes it so comfortable for us . Imagine , if William were a vulgar man , the fuss ! But , " she admitted , " at bottom I should n't have cared . You are not half as disreputable as I am , Lee . You have a proper look at this minute . " " Really , " he protested , " there is no reason for you to be insulting , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatter yourself , " Savina replied ; " when it was I all the time : I broke up your home . " " You need n't boast so loudly and pain everyone about us , " he protested cheerfully . She gazed contemptuously at the surrounding tables : " The scheming presidents of concessions and their fat wives . Have you noticed the men hurrying away apologetically in the evening , Lee ? The places on Sol and Gloria Streets ! And , just as you meant , if they knew who , what , we were , they 'd want to have us arrested . You see , I am infringing on the privileges sacred to men . It 's all right for them to do this , to go out to an appointment after ten o'clock and come back at two satisfied  --  " " Savina , " he interrupted her , " I know all that you were going to say , I could repeat it to you in your own words . You were about to assault the double standard . Consider it done . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I hear it again I 'll think I am at Aeolian Hall listening to an English author lecture . I 'll put you in your car on Forty-second Street and send you home . " " You ca n't send me home , " she reminded him ; " you are too proper and have too many scruples . You 'll have to stay with me now for life . I am ruined . " They laughed happily . " You are , " he echoed her . " Is n't it nice ? " " Nothing better could be invented . " She investigated the pitcher . " The last drop . " Lee Randon signalled for the waiter , but she stopped him ; the strained intensity of her face , the shining darkness of her eyes , set his heart pounding . * * * * * They left for Cobra without even the formality of a telegraphed announcement to Daniel Randon . Their compartment , in the middle of the car , with the more casual open accommodations at either end , resolute in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might expect in the interior . The progress of the train through the length of the island was slow and irregular : Lee had a sense of insecure tracks , of an insufficient attention to details of transportation that required an endless , untiring oversight . Naturally they slept badly ; and the morning showed them a wide plain scattered with royal palms which thickened in the distance . Such vast groves , Lee thought , robbed them of the stateliness so impressive in parks and cities . The landscape , tangled with lianas or open about massive and isolated ceiba trees , was without the luxuriance of color he had expected . It was evident that there had been no rain for a long period ; and the crowded growths , grey rather than green , were monotonous , oppressive . Other than Apollinaris and the conventional black coffee of the train , and oranges bought by Lee at a junction , no breakfast was possible ; and they watched uninterruptedly the leisurely passing land . Marks of sugar planting multiplied , the cane , often higher than Lee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and announced by a sickly odor of fermentation , he saw , with a feeling of disappointment , the high corrugated iron sides of a grinding mill . It was without any saving picturesque quality ; and the noise of its machinery , a heavy crushing rumble , was perceptible on the train . However , Savina was attracted by the high carts , on two solid wheels , and drawn by four or six oxen , hauling the cut cane . But the villages they passed , single streets of unrelieved squalor in a dusty waste , they decided were immeasurably depressing . No one who could avoid it walked ; lank men in broad straw hats and coat-like shirts rode meagre horses with the sheaths of long formidable blades slapping their miserable hides . Groups of fantastically saddled horses drooped their heads tied in the vicinity of a hands-breadth of shade by general stores . " I could burst into tears , " Savina declared . But he showed her pastures of rich tufted grass with herds of well-conditioned cattle . " I wish we were there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobra , Savina , hesitating on the step , proposed that they go on into Camag ? ey , hardly more than an hour distant . Their bags , put off , the rapid incomprehensible speech of the guard , left them , with the train moving doubtfully on , at Cobra . It was , on examination , more dismal than , from the detachment of the compartment , they had realized . The usual baked ground , the dusty underbrush , the blank fa ? ades of the low buildings that faced them from either side of the tracks , had  --  in addition to a supreme ugliness  --  an indefinably threatening air . The rawness , the machetes hanging about the booted heels of soiled idlers , the presence everywhere of negroes with an unrestrained curiosity in Lee and his companion , filled him with an instinctive antagonism . " Do you think that can be the hotel ? " he asked , indicating a long plaster building with a shallow upper porch supported on iron-footed wooden columns . Above its closely-shuttered windows , in letters faded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel de Cobra . " " We ca n't stay there , " he continued decidedly ; " I 'll send for Daniel at once . " Without available help he carried their bags to the entrance of the hotel , and went into a darkened room with a cement floor which had the thick dampness of an interior saturated with spilled acid wine . There he found a man , not different from those outside , who , incapable of understanding English , managed to grasp the fact that Lee wished to see Daniel Randon immediately . The proprietor assented , and urged them up a stair . " I wo n't have you wait out here , " Lee told Savina ; " it will be only for an hour or so . " The room into which they were ushered had , at least , the advantage of bareness : there was a wardrobe of mahogany leaning precariously forward , a double bed deeply sagged with a grey- white covering , a wash stand and tin basin and pitcher , and some short sturdy rush-bottomed chairs . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the walls , a blue of a particularly insistent shade which , in the solidity of its expanse , seemed to make all the enclosed space and objects livid . The tall shutters on one side , Lee discovered , opened on the upper porch and a prospect of the tracks beyond . " If I stayed here a night I 'd be raving , " Savina declared . " Lee , such a color ! And the place , the people  --  did you notice that carriageful of black women that went by us along the street ? There were only three , but they were so loosely fat that they filled every inch . Their faces were drenched with powder and you could see their revolting breasts through their muslin dresses ; terrible creatures reeking with unspeakable cologne . They laughed at me , cursed us , I am sure . " " We 'll have to put up with it till Daniel comes , " he observed philosophically ; and , on the low straight chairs , they gazed around so disgustedly that they both laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Savina asked what they would do if he were away . He might be in Santiago . The company had other estates . " Not now , " Lee decided ; " what they call the grinding season has just begun , and every hour is important . The least thing gone wrong might cost thousands of dollars . " The correctness of his assumption was upheld by an announcement unintelligible except for the comforting fact that Daniel was below . " Perhaps I had better see him first , " Lee suggested diplomatically , and Savina assented . Daniel Randon was both tall and fat , a slow impressive bulk in white linen with a smooth impassive face and considering brown eyes . " This , " he said unremarkably , " is a surprise . But I am , of course , glad ; particularly since Venalez reported that Fanny was with you . " " She is n't , " Lee replied tersely ; there had been no cable from Eastlake , he saw , and he must plunge boldly into what he had to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at home . But I 'm here , and not by myself . " A slight expression of annoyance twitched at his brother 's contained mouth . " No , you are making a mistake . I have left Fanny , Daniel . I thought perhaps you would have heard . " " Our telegraph system is undependable , " was all that the other , the younger , Randon answered . " You do n't know , then . A Mrs. Grove is with me ; but she is that only until the divorces can be arranged ; and I counted on you  --  " " Divorces ? " The single word was accompanied by a faint lifting of Daniel 's eyebrows . " She was married , too , " Lee explained . " You will understand better when you talk to Savina . We are not young feather-heads , Daniel ; this is serious , final . Really , we came to Cuba on your account , to see you . When I tried to compose a telegram from Havana , telling you something of the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ! Well , here we are , or here I am , and Savina is upstairs , most anxious to meet you . " " Certainly , " Daniel Randon agreed . He was silent for a moment in the consideration of what he had been told . Then , " I ca n't have you on the batey , " he pronounced . He lifted a silencing hand against an anger forming in instant unmeasured speech . " Not for myself , " he particularized . " You could have seven mistresses , of all colors , if the place were mine . Please remember that it is n't . It 's the company 's . That is quite different . " Daniel was making , Lee realized , what for him was a tremendous conversational effort . " Even if I were alone , except for Cubans , it would be possible ; but there is Mr. Stribling , with his wife and , at present , grown daughter , from Utica ; he is the Assistant Administrador . Then we have George Vincent and Katharine  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , Ohio . They are very particular in Ohio . And others . You must remember that I have a photograph of Fanny with the children : it is much admired , well known . I could n't explain your Mrs.  --  Mrs. Grove . Who could ? We have n't a sister . Altogether I am sorry . " He stopped uncompromisingly ; yet , Lee recognized , in all that Daniel had said there was no word of criticism or gratuitous advice . He had voiced the facts only as they related to him ; to everything else he gave the effect of a massive blankness . * * * * * Argument , Lee saw , was useless . Extended to the heart of a tropical island , the virtuous indignations of a hard propriety still bound their movements . " All that I can suggest , " Daniel went on , " is that you return to Havana tomorrow evening ; the company has offices there , and it will be easier for me to see you . Camag ? ey is nearer , but gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far apart your rooms were . Decidedly not Camag ? ey . " There was no train for Havana , it developed , before tomorrow . " And , in the meanwhile , " Lee inquired , " must we stay here ? Savina will be miserable . " " Why not ? " Daniel gazed about casually . " I lived with Venalez a month . It is good enough if you are not too strict about a travelling beauty or two who may be stopping as well . " His apologies to Savina , in the room above , were faultless . There was , simply , at the Cobra sugar estancia , no satisfactory arrangement for guests ; except for an occasional party of directors , or a special mission , there were no guests . At his , Daniel 's central , in Santa Clara on the sea , he hoped some day to offer them the hospitality of his own house . When he left , Lee made no revelation of what had been said downstairs ; Savina accepted the situation as it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of a night here , " she told him ; " it will be a horror . " She opened the slats of the long window shutters , and glowing bars of white heat fell in a ladder-like order across a blue wall ; the segments of sunlight were as sharp and solid as incandescent metal . In the cobalt shadow Savina was robbed of her vitality ; she seemed unreal ; as she passed through the vivid projected rays of midday it appeared as though they must shine uninterruptedly through her body . Lee considered the advisability of taking her for a walk  --  there were , he had seen from the train , no roads here for driving  --  but , recalling the insolent staring and remarks she had met , he was forced to drop that possibility . Weary from the prolonged wakefulness of the night , Savina made an effort to sleep ; and , waiting until she was measurably quiet , Lee went out . The heat was blinding , it walled him in , pressed upon him with a feeling of suffocation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation , of any air  --  there were miles of it packed around him like grey cotton . To the left of the hotel , the bare plaza , half hidden in scrubby bushes , there was an extended shed with a number of doors and fragments of fence , heaped rusted tins and uncovered garbage ; and , lounging in the openings , the door-frames often empty , the windows without sashes , were women , scantily covered , sounding every note in a scale from black to white . Yet , Lee observed , the whitest were , essentially , black . What amazed , disturbed , him was their indolent blinking indifference , their indecent imperviousness , in the full blaze of day . They were , to Lee , significant , because from them he drew a knowledge of Cobra . He could not , without such assistance , have arrived at the instinctive understanding that interpreted the street into which he turned . It was the street of a delirium , running , perhaps , for half a mile ; an irregular deeply rutted way formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gaudily painted boards and galvanized sheet iron . They were all completely open at the front , with their remarkable contents , pandemoniums of merchandise , exposed upon a precarious sidewalk of uneven parallel boards elevated two or three feet above the road . Mostly caf ? s , restaurants , there was still an incredible number of banks  --  mere shells with flat tarred roofs and high counters built from wall to wall . The receivers , the paying tellers , were many , with the mingled bloods , the heterogeneous characteristics , of China and Colonial Spain and Africa ; and , back of their activity  --  there was a constant rush of deposited money and semi-confidential discussion  --  were safes so ponderous and ancient that they might have contained the treasure of a plate fleet of Peru . Crowding in on them , challenging each other from opposite sides , the restaurants were longer and shallow , with their groups of tables ranged against walls decorated in appallingly primitive and savage designs : palms like crawling spiders of verdigris set on columns of chocolate rose from shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesque caricatures of men , barbarously clad or , swollen headed , in travesties of civilized garb , faced women with exaggerated and obscene anatomies . They , like the banks , were crowded ; companies of negroes sat over dishes of mucous consistency and drank , with thick lips , liquors of vicious dyes . The prodigious women , often paler than the men , drinking with them , gabbled in a loud and corrupt Spanish and , without hats on their sere crinkled masses of hair , were unrestrained in displays of calculated or emotionally demented excitement . A flat wagon passed , holding , on precarious chairs , a band furiously playing an infernal jumbled music which , as it swelled , filled all the occupants of the caf ? s with a twitching hysteria . Subdued masculine shouts were pierced by shameless feminine cries ; lust and rage and nameless intoxications quivered like the perceptible films of hot dust on the air . Negroes , Haitians with the flattened skulls , the oily skin , of the Gold Coast , and Jamaicans glowing with a subcutaneous redness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burned indeterminate superiority of race , riding emaciated horses , added to the steel of their machetes revolvers strapped on their long thighs . What , mainly , occupied Lee Randon was the nakedness of the passion everywhere surcharging the surface of life . There was , in the sense familiar to him , no restraint , no cover beyond the casual screens at the backs of the restaurants ; no accident to which the uncertain material of life was subject was improbable ; murder rasped , like the finger of death on wire strings , at the exasperated sensibilities of organisms exposed , without preparation , to an incomprehensible state of life a million years beyond their grasp . It fascinated and disturbed Lee : it had a definite interest , a meaning , for him . Was it to this that Savina had turned ? Had the world only in the adherence to the duty typified by Fanny left such a morass as he saw about him ? Was he , Lee Randon , instead of advancing , falling back into a past more remote than coherent speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intention and hope . Yet , without doubt , he was surrounded by the denial of order , of disciplined feeling ; and , flatly , it terrified him . Lee insisted , hastily , that what he wanted  --  no , demanded  --  was not this destruction of responsibility , a chaos , mentally and sensually , but the removal of it as a rigid mob imposition on the higher discretion of his individuality . The thing which , with Savina , he had assaulted was , in its way , as unfortunate as the single reeking street of Cobra . Again , the scene around him was n't hypocritical , its intention was as thickly evident as the rice powder on the black sweating faces of the prostitutes . Hypocrisy was peculiarly the vice of civilization . His necessity was an escape from either fate  --  the defilement of a pandering to the flesh and the waste of a negation with neither courage nor rapture . Damn it , could n't he be freed from one without falling into the other ? Lee told himself that it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the high hills ; it was n't necessary to go down into the bottoms , the mire . He regarded himself curiously as , to a large extent , the result of all the ages that had multiplied since the heated tropics held the early fecundity of human life . A Haitian lunged by with out-turned palms hanging at his knees , a loose jaw dropped on a livid gullet flecked with white , and a sultry inner consciousness no more than a germinal superstition visible in fixed blood  --  suffused eyes . He had an odor , Lee fantastically thought , of stale mud . Well  --  there he was and there was Lee Randon , and the difference between them was the sum of almost countless centuries of religions and states and sacrifice and slaughter He had a feeling that the accomplishment was ludicrously out of proportion to all that had gone into it . For the only thing of value , the security of a little knowledge , was still denied him . What , so tragically long ago , Africa begged from the mystery of night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was demanding from a power which had lost even the advantage of visibility . His superiority was negligible . It was confined relatively to unimportant things  --  such as an abstract conception of a universe partly solid and partly composed of ignited gases revolving in an infinity of time and space . He was aware of sensations , flavors , champagnes , more delicate than the brutality of a rape conceived in strangling gulps of sugar cane rum . On the outside he had been bleached , deodorized , made conformable with chairs rather than allowed to retain the proportions , powers , designed for the comfortable holding to branches . But in his heart , in what he thought of as his spirit , what had he gained , where  --  further than being temporarily with Savina in the beastly hotel of Cobra  --  was he ? * * * * * His thoughts had become so inappropriate to his purpose , his presence , here that he banished them and returned to Savina . She was notably more cheerful than when he had left her , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberries , and a bottle of Marquis de Riscal ; most of which , she told him , had been sent , together with other pleasant things , by Daniel Randon . She was unusually seductive in appearance , with , over the sheer embroidered beauty of her underclothes , her graceful silken knees , a floating unsubstantial wrap like crushed handfuls of lilacs . " This room kills anything I might put on , " she replied to the expression of his pleasure . " After all , we shall soon be gone . I got Daniel 's servant to telegraph the Inglaterra we were coming back . They 'll have to watch out for us . After we see your brother there , and make a beginning of our rearrangements , we will go on , I think . Do you mind ? South , Guadeloupe , perhaps , because it 's so difficult to get to , and then Brazil . I have an idea we wo n't stay there long , either , but travel on toward the East . I do like islands , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She put her arms , from which the wide sleeves fell back , around his neck , drew him close to her . " It does n't matter where I am , if it is with you . I love you , Lee , and I am happy because I know we 'll always have each other . We are not so very young , you see , and there is n't a great deal of time left , not enough to grow tired , to change in . " I wake up at night , sometimes , with that tiresome pain at my heart , as though it were too full of you , and , for a little , I 'm confused  --  it is all so strange . I think , for a moment , that I am still with William , and I ca n't imagine what has happened to the room . It frightens me dreadfully , and then I remember : it is n't William and the house on Sixty-sixth Street , but you , Lee , and Cuba . We 're together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , when we are old , we shall sit side by side at Etretat , I am sure , and watch the sea , and the young people in love under the gay marquees , and remember . Then we 'll be married and more respectable than the weather-vanes . I want that on your account ; I do n't care ; but you would worry , I am afraid . You are serious and a conscientious man , Lee . " But , before that , I want to spend all my feeling , I do n't want a thrill left , lost ; I want to empty and exhaust myself . " Her emotion was so strong that it drew her away from him , erect , with her bare arms reaching to their fullest quivering length . In the blue gloom of the room shuttered against the white day , with her wrap , the color of lilacs , lightly clasping her shoulders , she seemed to be a vision in subdued paint . Lee was held motionless , outside , by the fervor of an appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought recurred to him , too slender , fragile , to contain such a passion . Then , in a transition so sudden that it bewildered him , her mouth was against his , her hands straining him to her . She was ugly then , her face was unrecognizable in an expression of paralysed fury . The heat , Lee protested , grew worse with evening ; not a stir of air brought out the dry scraping rustle of the palms , a sound like the friction of thin metal plates . The balcony , if possible , was worse than their room . In his irritation Lee cursed the scruples of his brother ; Savina , prostrate on the bed , said nothing . At intervals her hand moved , waving a paper fan with a printed idyl from Boucher , given her in a caf ? at Havana . She had none of the constrained modesty , the sense of discomfort at her own person , so dominating in Fanny . Lee finally lighted a lamp : the hours , until the precipitant onrush of night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along the dim ceiling . When , later , he was on the bed , it was wet under his sweating body . In a passing sleep Savina gave one of the cries of her waking emotion . In a state of unconsciousness her fingers reached toward him . From the balcony beyond them drifted a woman 's challenging laughter  --  one of the travelling beauties Daniel had mentioned  --  and he could hear the bursts of discordant sound on the street of Cobra , the combined efforts of rival bands hideous singly and together beyond description . What a hell of a night , what a night in hell ! The moths , defrauded in their hunger for light , blundered softly around the walls ; when Lee rose to light a cigarette they would , he felt , gather at the match and beat it out with their desirous wings . Then he heard a shot , and uplifted clamoring voices ; all as unreal , as withdrawn , as a simulated murder on a distant stage . He pictured the flaring restaurants , the banks with corrugated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes brought black and lurid out of the surrounding blackness . Savina , awake , demanded a drink , and he held a clay water monkey awkwardly to her lips . The faint double blast of a steam signal rose at the back of the hotel , beyond the town ; he had heard it before and now connected it with Daniel 's sugar mill . His brother had n't perceptibly changed in fifteen years . During that time Lee had seen him scarcely at all . Suddenly he was sorry for this : Daniel was what was generally known as a strong man . Men deep in the national finances of their country spoke to Lee admiringly of him ; it was conceded that he was a force . Lee was n't interested in that  --  in his brother 's ability , it might be , to grip an industry by the throat . He envied , speculated about , the younger man 's calmness , the Chinese quality of his silence , the revelations of his carefully few words . Daniel , in past years , had been often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his name ; but he appeared to have cast them , the Bacardi and the blandishments , entirely aside . He seemed as superior to the dragging and wearing of life as a figure carved in stone , a Buddha , any Eastern presentment of the aloof contempt of a serene wisdom at the mountain of its own flesh . Lee , beside his brother , resembled a whirlpool of dust temporarily formed by the wind in a road . Daniel had never married , he had been too cunning for that fragrant trap , as well . What were his vices ? But were habits , self-indulgences , held in the background , ruthlessly subordinated to primary activity , vices ? Lee wished now that Daniel had seen Cytherea ; he was certain that the other would have said something valuable about her . Through his long contact with the naked tropics Daniel understood many things hidden from him . He must know , for instance , about the Brujeria , the negro magic brought through Haiti from the depths of Africa . Everyone in Cuba caught rumors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Daniel could never be brought to speak . Lee could even visualize him taking part , in a cold perverse curiosity , in the dances about smothered fires . He thought there was a glimmer of day at the windows , but it was only a flash across his staring eyeballs . From the plaza below came a low sibilant conversation . It went on and on , until Lee , in an irrepressible indignation , went out on the balcony and , in a voice like the clapping of a broken iron bell , cursed the talkers into silence . Christ , it was hot ! Savina was sitting up . " Is n't it tomorrow night , or the one after that ? " she asked . " This room is like a vault that I have been in a thousand thousand years . I ca n't tell you how it affects me ; it seems as though I must stay here forever , that if I tried to get away I 'd be forced back . And I dreamed that everything I owned had been turned blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oranges . You would n't believe how depressing a blue orange could be . We will forget it as soon as possible , Lee . Do you remember how nice the room was at the Inglaterra ? I wish you 'd feel my head : is n't it hotter than usual ? " " Why should n't it be ? " he asked impolitely . " It would n't be possible , would it , Lee , to have the night go on forever , to have something happen to the scheme of things ? Or perhaps I 'm blind . " Her voice was plainly terrified . " Light a match , please . Oh , thank you . What an idiot I am . Hold me closer ; then I can forget , then nothing else matters . I can never get close enough ; I wish I could pour myself into you . " " You 'll be able to , if this keeps up , " he observed , with a note of brutality . " They will find us , in the morning , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no corresponding lightness in his spirit ; periods like this extended into an infinity of torment beyond time . A thinning of the dark expanded through the room . A cerulean unnatural dawn crept about him : there was the muffled clatter of horses ' hoofs in the dust outside ; a locomotive whistled in a far universal key . Savina slowly became visible ; asleep , her personality , her vividness , were gone ; she was as featureless , as pallid , as a nameless marble of remote Greece . There were marks across her feet where the mules chafed her ; the mules themselves were lying on the bare floor . He saw his clothes , the familiar habit of the day , with a sharp surprise . * * * * * It had been a night without rest , without the coolness and assuagement of a release from the fever of the day ; and , Lee thought , he felt as haggard as Savina looked . A wind that was hardly more than an erratic stirring of super-heated dust agitated a loose slat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Savina put as much as possible , so early , into her bags . Standing before a narrow mirror nailed to a wall , with her comb , she turned . " My hair is soaked , " she wailed ; " just putting my arms up is more than I can manage . Have n't you been thinking about all the cold things in the world ? " She slipped into a chair , spent and dejected , with her hair clouding one shoulder . It would , he repeated , be over soon , and he gazed at her with a veiled inspection . Savina was so entirely unprepared for this , the least hardship so new , that he was uncertain about the temper of her resistance . Aware of his gaze , she smiled slowly at him , and , seated , again took up her task with the comb . " I could n't have you see me very often like this , " she proceeded : " it would be fatal . I do n't mean that when I 'm finished I 'm irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want to be a wife , Lee  --  one of those creatures in a dressing sacque with hair pins in her mouth . I ca n't bear the thought of you and a flannel petticoat together . That is where married women make a serious mistake : they let their husbands see them while the maid is doing their hair , or when they 're smeared with creams , or , maybe , with tonsilitis . " She rose . " I wo n't be a wife , " she chanted , " I wo n't be  --  " Her voice broke suddenly . Lee thought she had tripped , he lunged forward , but she fell crumpling on the floor . " It 's this hellish heat , " he asserted , lifting her to the bed . Her lips were open and dry , and her eyes , without vision , stared at the ceiling . Lee wet a handkerchief , dabbling it over her face ; he had never before , he realized , seen a woman faint . It was terrifying but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very often . No wonder , after such a night . She had been gone over a minute now ; there must be someone in the place who would know what to do . He put off moving , however , both because of his reluctance to leave Savina alone and because of the difficulty of any explanation . He took her hand ; it was cold and damp , and her forehead was glistening with minute globes of sweat . All the blood seemed to have been withdrawn from her body . " I 'll have to go for help , " he said aloud , in a commonplace manner which yet struck curiously on his hearing . There was a faint quiver of her features , a scarcely perceptible sigh , and her fingers weakly closed on his grasp . " How foolish , " Savina murmured . She made an effort to raise herself up from the pillow , but he restrained her ; Lee commanded her to be absolutely still . " The spirits of ammonia is in the dressing-case , " she whispered . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it laboriously . " Do n't call anyone , Lee , " she continued ; " I 'll be all right in a little . So much at once ! You see , I have n't been used to happiness . No wonder I was dizzy . But I fainted , Lee , did n't I ? That 's unusual for me . " He sat beside her , at once moved and detached from her weakness , gently holding her supine hand . She must n't worry , he told her at short intervals . " Do n't worry , this is nothing . " " You 'll give me time to dress for the train , " she insisted . " As soon as we get away from here I shall be better . We will , wo n't we ? " " Get away ? What nonsense ! Of course . You will be up by noon , but there is no good in your stirring before you have to . If Daniel comes , you can see him here , in your bed . Or you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel . " Even as she lay , prostrate , on the bed , he could see her collapse ; the strength , animation , interest , drained away from her ; it seemed to Lee that momentarily she was again in a coma . He leaned over and placed a hand on her brow . Savina 's eye-lids fluttered . Under her breast her heart was scarcely discernible . Suddenly he did n't like it ; abruptly an apprehension , from which he was obliged to bar a breath of panic , possessed him . Lee covered her lightly with a sheet , and went out , softly closing the door . Before the hotel he caught the proprietor by a shoulder and pointed up to his room . " Sick , sick , " he repeated the term with increasing emphasis , not successful in banishing his vagueness of dismay . The proprietor smiled uncertainly , edging from under the weight of Lee 's hand . Then , " Get my brother , Mr. Daniel Randon , at once , " he commanded ; " soon . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the mill . This the other again comprehended , and Lee saw a youth swing a bare leg over a convenient horse and vanish behind the Cobra Hotel . He went back to the room : Savina had n't moved while he had been gone . She seemed even weaker  --  a thing he would have declared impossible  --  than before . He bathed her face and throat in water , and there was a murmur of gratitude , of love , so low that , with his ear against her lips , the individual words were lost . His disturbance increased and , when the heavy firm steps of Daniel Randon had approached on the cement of the corridor without , and he had knocked and entered , Lee pointed to the bed with an unconcealed anxiety . Daniel bent over Savina with a comprehensive unmoved regard ; he touched a cheek , with a surprising delicacy , and then turned and faced Lee . The latter said sharply , " She has fainted , but it 's only the heat . She 'll be all right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself than to Daniel , in an effort of private encouragement , what confidence he had dissolved before his brother 's impassive negation . " It is more serious than that , " Daniel Randon told him . " There is no doctor here we can trust , but I 'll send a gas rail car into Camag ? ey for Fancett . It will take three hours or worse . " He left promptly , closing the door soundlessly ; and Lee heard his voice from the plaza , not raised but intolerantly domineering , issuing orders in a Spanish at once fluent and curt . In the long-dragging succeeding period there was no visible change in Savina ; at intervals she spoke faintly , there was the dim trace , the effort , of a smile ; her hand , whenever he released it , slipped away . The heat in the room thickened ; the barred sunlight cut like white knives at the opposite wall ; a pungent odor of cooking peppers came in under the door . Savina 's bags , nearly packed , stood open on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small hat and swathing brown veil , were ready by her low darkly polished tan shoes ; gloves , still in their printed tissue paper , the comb , a small gold bag with an attached chased powder box , a handkerchief with a monogram in mauve , were gathered on the chest of drawers . Lee had heard the rail car leave for Camag ? ey : there had been a series of short explosions , first scattered and then blending in a regular pulsation soon lost over the vanishing tracks . The interminable clip- clip of horses , dreary staccato voices , rose and fell , advanced and retreated , outside . But , through all his attentiveness to Savina , his crowding thoughts , he listened for the return of the car with the doctor . What was his name ? Foster , Faucett  --  no , it was Fancett . An American , evidently . " The doctor is coming , " he told Savina gently . " Daniel felt that he had better see you . From Camag ? ey . A good man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he will give us something . " Waves of rebellion passed over him , an anger at his impotence , at the arbitrary removal of Savina from the sphere of his help . His coat was off , his collar unbuttoned , and he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt , wet with sweat and the bathing of her head . To Lee , Savina appeared sunken ; her cheeks , certainly , were hollower ; there was a shadow , like the dust over the floor , in each one ; she had ceased to open her eyes but they had retreated . A dreadful twenty-four , thirty , hours ; how brutally hard it had been on her . She had n't complained ; he had been more upset , impatient , than Savina . What a splendid companion ! But that , he irritably felt , was a cold word of description for her . What a force ! She was that , magnificently , above everything else . Beside her , other people  --  the rest of life  --  were flat , tepid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing throb ; Lee identified it as the rail car . Perhaps the doctor had been absent . However , Daniel would know what to do . The footfalls approaching the door were multiplied : it was his brother and an elderly wasted man with a vermilion sprig of geranium in the lapel of a white coat . He nodded to Lee , pressed his hand , and went quickly to the bed . In the stillness while Dr. Fancett took Savina 's pulse Lee again caught the shallow rapidity of her breathing . Daniel Randon stood with a broad planter 's hat held with the lightness of touch characteristic of him . The man at the bed turned a speculative gaze upon Lee . " Your wife has an acute dilatation of the heart , " he pronounced . The significance of his unguarded tone shocked Lee immeasurably . * * * * * " But I do n't understand that , " Lee protested ; " she has never had any serious trouble with her heart before . " He was halted by Daniel 's brief peculiar scrutiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be the result of unaccustomed and excessive heat ; an accumulation of the excessive , " he added concisely . " Excesses . " The single word followed after a hesitation in which Fancett was plainly at a loss . His frowning gaze was still bent upon Lee . " I know so little of Mrs. Randon 's history , " he finally said . Daniel naturally had inferred , or perhaps the doctor deduced , that Savina and he were married . They would be , in a very short while , Lee told himself stubbornly . " You have ice on the batey ? Yes , at once , please . And a nurse can come from my office on the Havana train this evening . " Daniel nodded once , in acknowledgment . He moved closer to Lee : " This is serious . You ca n't , of course , think of going on . I will see that she is as comfortable here as she would be with me ; everything shall be done . " Lee answered that he was certain of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the incongruous speculation about the propriety of a cable to William Grove . The absurd idea occurred to him that Savina had two husbands ; each with the right , if he desired , to be at a side of her bed , each holding one of her limp hands . He dismissed the elaborated thought in a rage at the triviality of his mind . Fancett and Daniel had gone temporarily : Lee had heard the former making arrangements to stay over night at the sugar estate . Savina 's fast superficial breathing now dominated the room . He was again seated beside her , leaden-hearted and blank . It was so useless  --  this illness and suffering , now ! The doctor had seemed to insinuate that it might be traced to him , Lee Randon . What the devil did he mean by that ? It was the fault of Daniel , the immobile , as much as anyone . In an airy room , under comfortable conditions , probably it would n't have happened . Savina 's suit , her shoes , the bags , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grasp , and he bent close , but he distinguished only random words . "  --  not sorry . Willing ... with you . Do n't be unhappy . " It required an enormous effort , the sound was at once all but imperceptible and burdened with an agony of labor . As he watched her he saw what , he thought , was an illusion  --  the blueness of the room , of the walls , seemed to settle on her countenance . It increased , her face was in tone with the color that had so disturbed her , a vitreous blue too intense for realization . He was startled : like a sponge , sopping up the atmosphere , she darkened . It was so brutal , so hideous , that he spoke involuntarily : " No one can live blue like that . " Then , with a glance instinct with dread , he saw that he was right  --  Savina had died . A calm of desperation swept over him . He must tell Daniel and the doctor . But they would still need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant ? It must all come out now  --  his presence in Cuba with Savina  --  in a storm of publicity and condemnation . He regretted this , because of Savina , dead . Alive she would have smiled her contempt ; but death was different . Anyone would acknowledge that . The dead should be protected from slurs and scandal and obscene comments . A confusion of small facts poured through him , and broke into trivial fragments any single dignity of emotion ; no generous sorrow saved him from the petty actuality of his situation ; even his sense of loss , he realized dismayed , was dull . Savina was rapidly growing , at last , cold ; her arm was stiffening in the position in which he had left it ; in a necessary forcible gentleness he composed her body . But he did n't hide her  --  not yet  --  with a sheet . That would follow soon enough . The blueness was receding , leaving her pinched , but white . She had always been pale .... By God , he had forgotten to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel , the doctor , and the proprietor of the hotel , Venalez , talking together . As he approached there was a flash of premonition on his brother 's broad unstirring face . Lee said humbly : " She is dead . " Fancett , with Daniel Randon , went up at once , but he lingered , facing the Cuban . Venalez had a long brown countenance , with a disordered moustache . His trousers were thrust into the customary dingy boots , but his shirt was confined at the waist , and he had dispensed with a machete . He grew uneasy under Lee 's stare , and shuffled his feet ; then , behind a soiled thin hand , he coughed . It was clear that he wished intensely to escape , but was held by his conceptions of the obligations of conduct . " The suddenness  --  " Lee said , and then paused with a furrowed brow ; " that 's what surprises me . She was as well as you , and singing , yes  --  singing , that she did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loose silk thing she wore ; and then I was certain that she had fainted from your heat . " He bore heavily on the word your , and then proceeded to curse the atmosphere , in a heavy manner suggesting that it were a property , a condition , under the direction of the hotel proprietor . From that he proceeded to damn Utica and the state of Ohio . " But you ca n't understand me , " he added , illogically angry at that , too . Daniel was again at his side , speaking . " There is nothing for you to do here , and you may as well come to the batey with me . There are some accidents that can not be provided against . This is one of them . She will be attended to ; but you must explain about the cables . " " I had better get her things , " Lee replied . He could n't leave the delicate and beautiful trifles of Savina 's living in the blue vault above . " They were scattered about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , had not been neglected . Her effects were to go over in the wagon with them . Lee , jolting on a springless contrivance over an informal road , kept his hand on the bags beside him . They were in Holland cases which hid the sets of initials ending in G. A revolver was shoved under the leather seat at the driver 's left . There were the negro women , half naked , lounging in their doorways . Telling himself that Savina was dead , he lingered over that term , at once so definite and obscure . There had been a pain in her heart at the Dos Hermanos , while they were having dinner , after the steamer , blazing with lights and with music on the upper deck , had swept out of the harbor . And , since then , at night , she had cried out . That , he had thought , was the expression of her consuming passion . He had n't killed her ; he would correct Fancett there . The doctor 's glance , almost suspicious , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , that she was sorry for nothing ; she had begged him to be happy . He roused himself and asked Daniel if they had far to go , and learned that they had almost reached the batey . Where , Lee added silently , Daniel would n't have us . It might well have saved Savina . The same ideas persisted in his mind . He wondered if , in the hurried packing , her handkerchief had been neglected ? It was one of a number that Savina had bought in Havana . He had stayed outside , in the motor , smoking ; and , when she had rejoined him , after a long wait , she had displayed her purchases . Her voice had been animated with pleasure at their reasonable price . Things small and unimportant ! His brain worked mechanically , like a circling toy that had been tightly wound up and must continue until its spring was expanded . The fundamental calamity was too close for any grasp of its tragic proportions : Savina dead was far more a set of unpredictable consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself ; she had , with her body , shut out the world of reality if not of mental query . Even the fervor of Cuba had seemed to pale before her burning spirit . What , without knowing it , Dr. Fancett had meant  --  a thing Lee himself had foreseen  --  was that Savina had killed herself , she had been consumed by her own flame . But she had n't regretted it . That assurance , bequeathed to him in the very hush of death , was of massive importance . Nothing else mattered  --  she had been happy with him . At last , forgetful of the ending , he had brought her freedom from a life not different from a long dreary servitude . He would need to recall this , to remind himself of it , often in the years that would leadenly follow ; for he must be regarded as a murderer  --  the man who , betraying William Grove , had debauched and killed his wife . That , of course , was false ; but what in the world that would judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories , Savina 's words . A sharper sense of deprivation stabbed at him . Why , she was gone ; Savina was dead . Her arms would never again go around his neck . The marks of the mules across her narrow feet ! He put out a shaking hand , and Daniel Randon met it , enveloped it , in a steady grasp that braced him against the lurching of the wagon . * * * * * On the veranda of Daniel Randon 's house Lee sat pondering over his brother 's emphatic disconnected sentences . " This conventionality , that you have been so severe with , is exceedingly useful . It 's not too much to say indispensable . Under its cover a certain limited freedom is occasionally possible . And where women are concerned  --  " he evidently did n't think it necessary even to find words there . " The conventions , for example , stronger in William Grove than his feelings , saved the reputation of his wife ; they kept Fanny alive and , with her heroic and instinctive pride , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you choose , of course . I ca n't enter into that . But , if you decide to return , you wo n't be supported by noble memories of your affair  --  was it of love or honor ?  --  no , an admirable pretence must assist you . The other , if you will forgive me , is no more than the desire for a cheap publicity , a form of self-glorification . Expensive . The proper clothes , you see  --  invaluable ! The body and the intentions underneath are separate . It is only the thoughtless , the hasty and the possessed who get them confused . " The veranda occupied all four sides of Daniel Randon 's low , wide-roofed dwelling , continuous except for the break where an open passage led to a detached kitchen . Seated in an angle which might be expected to catch the first movement of the trade winds sweeping , together with night , from the sea , practically the whole of the batey was laid out before Lee . The sun was still apparent in a rayless diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opacity only thinning where the buildings began : the objects in the foreground were sharp ; but , as the distance increased , they were blurred as though seen through a swimming of the vision . The great bulk of the sugar mill , at the left , like  --  on the flatness of the land  --  a rectangular mountain shaken by a constant rumbling , was indistinct below , but the mirador lifted against the sky , the man there on look-out , were discernible . The mill , netted in railroad tracks , was further extended by the storage house for bagasse  --  the dry pulpy remnant of the crushed cane  --  and across its front stood a file of empty cars with high skeleton sides . There was a noisy backing and shifting of locomotives among the trains which , filled with sugar cane , reached in a double row out of sight . The cars were severally hauled to the scales shed , weighed , and then shoved upon a section of track that , after they were chained , sharply tilted and discharged the loads into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier wound into the invisible roller crushers . The heavy air was charged with the smooth oiled tumult of machinery , the blast whistles of varied signals , and the harshness of escaping steam . Other houses , smaller than Daniel 's but for the rest resembling it , were strung along the open  --  the dwellings of the Assistant Administrador , the Chief Electrician , a Superintendent , and two or three more that Lee had n't identified . He had been , now , nearly four weeks with Daniel , and the details of La Quinta , the procedure of the sugar , were generally familiar to him . However , he had had very little opportunity to talk to his brother : the difficulties , in Cobra and Havana , of shipping Savina 's body back to New York  --  William Grove , persuaded that it was unnecessary , had n't come to Cuba ; a fire in one of the out-lying colonias of the La Quinta estate , that had destroyed three caballerias of ratoon ; the sheer tyranny of an intricate process which , for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had kept Lee from any satisfactory communication of his feelings or convictions . But , at last , returning hot and fatigued from the clearing , by fire , of a tumba , Daniel had been sitting with him for more than an hour , and he showed no signs of immediate change or activity . " What you say is clear enough , " Lee Randon admitted ; " and yet  --  but I ca n't see where  --  there is a sophistry in it . " Daniel made a gesture both curt and indifferent . " I tell you it would be better , even at the destruction of the entire present world , to establish honesty . Since you have referred to me  --  what we , Savina and I , did was , simply , honest ; but , again as you pointed out , its effect around us , for bad or very possibly good , was brought to nothing by the way it was drawn back into the victorious conspiring of sham . Even I do n't know which , commendable or fatal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; I had n't time . But Savina preferred the two weeks we had together to an infinity of the other . Fancett may call it an acute dilatation of the heart , but it was happiness that killed her . It 's possible for me to say that because , fundamentally , I did n't bring it to her . Savina found it , created it , for herself . Through that time  --  was it long or short ? The two weeks seemed a life  --  she was herself , superior . " " How about you ? " " I was absolutely contented , " Lee replied . " Is n't that a pale word for an act of passion ? " " Perhaps . It may be . " A troubled expression settled over Lee 's eyes . " There is something I should like to explain to you , Daniel , to ask you about , but it would take a great many words ? " He cast this in the tone of a query , and palpably waited for the encouragement to proceed fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intention , he said , of urging Lee to any speech he might later regret and wish unpronounced . " It 's about my attitude toward Savina , " Lee proceeded ; " or it may be about a doll ; I do n't know . No , Savina and the doll were n't as distinct as you 'd suppose ; they were , in the beginning and at the end , one : Savina and Cytherea . That has given me some wretched hours ; because , when it was over , I did n't miss Savina , I could n't even call her individually back to my mind ; and the inhumanity of that , the sheer ingratitude , was contemptible . " I can explain it best by saying that Cytherea had always represented something unknown that I wanted , that always disturbed me and made me dissatisfied . She was more fascinating than any living woman ; and her charm , what she seemed to hint at , to promise , filled me with the need to find it and have it for my own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it came between everything else and me and blinded me to all my life  --  to Fanny and the children and my companies . But , before I saw Cytherea , I was ready for her : " Because of the conventions you uphold as being necessary to  --  to comfort , nothing greater . My life with Fanny had fallen into a succession of small wearing falsehoods , pretences . I had made a mistake in the choice of a career ; and , instead of dropping that blunder , I spent my energy and time in holding it up , supporting it , assuring myself that it was necessary . The most I would acknowledge , even privately , was that , like the majority of men , I hated work . Like so many men I was certain that my home , my wife , were absorbing as possible . Wherever I looked , other lives were built of the same labored and flimsy materials . Mine was no worse ; it was , actually , far better than most . But only better in degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my existence , and the rest was made up of hours , engagements , that were a total waste . " At one time I had enjoyed them , I could n't have thought of more splendid things ; but the spirit of that period was not the same , and it was the spirit which made them desirable . I suppose that could be called my love for Fanny . I was glad to sit and discuss the hem of her skirt with her . It was enough just to be coming home to the house where she was waiting . I tell you , Daniel , my life then was transfigured . How long did it last  --  four years , six , eight ? I ca n't be exact ; but if I speak of its duration you will guess that it went . It went slowly , so slowly that for a long while I was ignorant of what was happening . It left in the vanishing of the little lubrications you insist are as needful for society as for your machinery . They began as lubrications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they ended as grains of sand in the bearings . " First there was Fanny 's convention of modesty  --  it had been put into her before birth  --  which amounted to the secret idea that the reality of love was disgusting . She could endure it only when feeling swept her from her essential being . When that had passed she gathered her decency around her like Susanna surprised . Positively she had the look of a temporary betrayal . So that , you see , was hidden in a cloak of hypocrisy . Then she had the impracticable conviction that I existed solely in her , that she was a prism through which every feeling and thought I had must be deflected . Fanny did n't express this openly , it had too silly a sound , but underneath , savagely , she fought and schemed and lied  --  more conventions  --  for it . And , when the children were born , she was ready for them with such a mountain of pretty gestures and ideas that I gave them up : I could n't fight their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the whole bloody nice world . For one thing I was n't home enough ; when I got in for dinner they were either in bed or starched for their curtesies and kisses . They are superior children , Daniel ; yet what they were taught to say sounds like the infantile sentimentalities of the stage . " * * * * * The capataz of the batey gang , a tall flushed Jamaican negro , passed on a cantering white pony . The American wives , the flowers of Utica and Ohio , went by in light afternoon dresses , one propelling a baby in a cart . The Field Superintendent , lank and sun-dark under a green palmetto hat , wearing a grotesquely large revolver , saluted Daniel from the open . " Trouble at the cantina barracon , " he called cheerfully . " It was then , " Lee specified , " that all my loose ends were gathered up in Cytherea . I have , I think , explained her . She was a doll , but it is more useful , now , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at first : I took her to be an individual , the image of a happy personal fate that , somehow , I had missed , but might still catch up with . " The wildest kind of a dream , " Lee Randon proclaimed . " But when I became aware of Savina , or rather of her passion , I was sure I had been completely justified . She was , I believed , Cytherea . They looked alike . They were the same ! However , I mistook that sameness . I can understand now , very clearly ; it seems incredible that I had been so blind , so fatuous , Daniel . I actually thought that there was a choice , a special graciousness , existing and reserved for me . " He laughed , not bitterly , but in a wonderment that bordered on dismay . " I felt that I had found it in Savina . I did get a lot there  --  more than I should have hoped for  --  but not precisely that . At last I know . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp the weight of what was to follow . " I had made the mistake of thinking that I , as an individual , had any importance . In my insane belief that a heavenly beauty , a celestial chorus girl , was kept for me , I pictured myself as an object of tender universal consideration . " Damned anthropomorfic rot ! " It was a principle all the while , " he cried ; " a principle that would fill the sky , as vast as space ; and ignorant , careless , of me , it was moving to its own end . And that  --  do you see , Daniel ?  --  had grown destructive . It had begun differently , naturally , in the healthy fertility of animals and simple lives ; but the conceit of men , men like me , had opposed and antagonized it . Magnifying our sensibilities , we had come to demand the dignity of separate immortalities . Separate worms ! We thought that the vitality in us was for the warming of our own hearts and the seduction of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , of Fanny and children , for the barrenness of Cytherea . " That 's her secret , what she 's forever smiling at  --  her power , through men 's vanity , to conquer the earth . She 's the reward of all our fineness and visions and pleasure , the idol of our supreme accomplishment : the privilege of escaping from slavery into impotence , the doubtful privilege of repaying the indignities of our birth . " His rigid strained face was drenched with sweat . " We made her out of our longing and discontent , an idol of silk and gilt and perverse fingers , and put her above the other , above everything . She rewarded us , oh , yes  --  with promises of her loveliness . Why should n't she be lovely eternally in the dreams of men ? " Then , finally , Savina and Cytherea were merged again . In Savina her passion , always abnormal , had n't been spent ; there she was younger than the youngest girl I knew ; incomparably more dangerous . She , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the moment of reality came it broke William Grove , Fanny , Helena and Gregory  --  all the threads that precariously held us . She was stronger than I , Savina was the goal and I was only the seeker  --  that was the difference between us  --  and in absorbing me she was content . " " That is very ingenious , " Daniel told him . " Do you notice that the smoke is thicker in the east ? " " Not more in one direction than in another , " Lee answered indirectly ; " in the east and south , the north and west , up above and underneath . It 's a good thing for our comfort that there 's so much of it we ca n't see the fires . If the books of physics are to be credited , the center of the earth is liquid flame ; certainly it is hot enough here to suggest something of the sort . " " It is worse in Oriente , " Daniel informed him . " What I have said , " Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you disagreed with , about the need of an understanding everywhere ! Isolated , in a chance individual like me , it is worse than useless , fatal . It destroys the support of a common cause with a humanity only less resentful than sentimental . And this has brought me to the reason why  --  in spite of her splendid proposal  --  I ca n't go back to Fanny : I have grown too detached to give her effort a possibility of success , of happiness for her . " " If you are so cursed abstract , you may as well be in Eastlake as at La Quinta , " his brother asserted . " Your saying that is curious , " Lee replied , " for it is exactly what I told a man , in circumstances remarkably like my own , not long ago . I explained that life was all monotonously alike ; and that , therefore , it did n't really matter where he changed to . I still think that most of it is inexcusable , perhaps hopeless , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return to a time forever lost . I should n't be able to persuade her that I had n't been in a temporary fever which , if she were sufficiently careful , would go and leave things very much as they were . That is her strength , her necessity , and she must uphold it until farthest old age and death . " Daniel Randon rose and went to the railing of the veranda , gazing intently into the hidden east . " You are right , " he said , crediting Lee with a contention he had n't made ; " that is the refuse on Jag ? es . " " Helena and Gregory do n't need me , " Lee went on and on ; " or , if you prefer  --  I am no longer afraid of words  --  I do n't need them . I believe , in nature , that the length of paternity is measured by the helplessness of the young . An elephant is more devoted than a crow . My obligation was soon ended . " " Bring it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what in the devil are you going to do ? " " I have n't any idea beyond the realization that I ca n't stay here taking up your room and Juan 's time . It seems to me that for a month he has done nothing but concern himself with my comfort . I did , in Havana , while Savina was living , think of writing ; but I have given it up because it would involve me in so much that is disagreeable . The amazing fact is that , since I have acquired a degree of wisdom , there is nothing for me to do , nowhere to go . The truth , I have always heard , will make you free ; but for what , Daniel ? What is it the truth will make you free for except to live in the solitude of public hatred ? When I refuse , as I certainly shall , to return to Fanny the world where I might accomplish something will be closed to me . " I could be a farmer if it were n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night ; my hands are too stiff to learn a trade . I do n't want to learn a trade ! " he exclaimed . " And as for starting more stock companies , rolling greater quantities of refuse into cigarettes or bottling harmless colored water , or controlling a news sheet in the interest of my other interests  --  " he could think of no term sufficiently descriptive of his remoteness from all that . " I shall have to be what a universal Eastlake will prefer to call me . I 'd stay here , at La Quinta , if you could find something for me to do  --  like picking the limes fresh for the Daiquiri cocktails . Do you think your company would carry me on its rolls for that ? I could gather them in the morning and evening , when it was cooler . Thank God , I have n't any material ambition . I like the clothes , the life , of that nigger , the capataz , who rode by , as well as most . I 'd sit up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the veija , for months on end . " The servant , Juan , small and dark in his white house coat , appeared with a tray on which two glasses with stems held a fragrant amber liquid . " That is perfection , " Lee murmured ; " where else could it be found ? Advise me , Daniel , " his voice was both light and serious . " You have never been known to give advice , but certainly my case is unusual enough to warrant extraordinary pains . Shall I make a neat hole at the proper point in my skull ; or , better yet , put half a grain of a drug that will occur to you on my tongue and close my mouth on further indiscretions ? That has its aspects . But not so strongly after one of Juan 's drinks ; they are distilled illusions , vain dreams still of hope . They have all the brave ring of accomplishment without its effort . But I can see the end even of them  --  atrophy . Soon Cytherea will go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats will eat the clothes from her indifferent body . Cytherea on a pearl shell in the Ionic Sea ... I was one of her train , Daniel . " He leaned sharply forward  --  Daniel Randon was asleep .
