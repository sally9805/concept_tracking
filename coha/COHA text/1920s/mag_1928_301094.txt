Three times now George Gershwin has set foot over the line that divides formal and informal music ; three times taken his own jazz notions , compounded them seriously and presented them , not for any singing or dancing they might invoke , but for listening purposes only . First was the Rhapsody in Blue and with it much talk of " classical jazz " gospeled by Paul Whiteman . Then came the Concerto in F , but by that time Gershwin had become a creed with many and the Concerto had its premiere in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall with Walter Damrosch and his New York Symphony . The third came last week . This time the orchestra was the Philharmonic-Symphony , the composition An American in Paris . It was a picture with sound effects . Deems Taylor , Gershwin 's friend , summarized the scenario : <P> An American arrives in Paris-presumably Gershwin himself , since he was there recently on the proceeds from his musical comedy tunes. * He leaves his hotel on a sunny spring morning , starts gaily down the Champs Elysees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their horns amuse him , so four horns came back with him to the U. S. to make their debuts with the Philharmonic . ... On he goes , swinging his cane , past a cafe door where trombones are moaning measures of La Maxixe . On he goes , past a cathedral , or perhaps the Grand Palais , slackens his pace a bit , then passes by on the other side . On he goes over the bridge to the Left Bank and there he stops again , this time for an Anise de Lozo and following effects are appropriately blurred . A solo violin suggestive of charming broken English is first to clear away the haze . There comes a swift transition and Gershwin has the blues , bad blues , until he meets a friend , starts off again jauntily to a final noisy walking theme that foretells an hilarious evening . <P> Philharmonic subscribers were for the most part amused by Gershwin 's pictures . They spied him , sleek and smiling , sitting in a box , and clapped him cordially . Gershwin 's critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extremists on the one hand he is making the most significant music of the day . To others he is out of place and ineffective away from Tin-Pan Alley . Certainly the Concerto , trying to be important , was unoriginal and dull . But with An American in Paris he has done better and dared to be himself in the presence of such betters as Wagner and Cesar Franck . Only Walter Damrosch seemed out of character at the concert last week . His conducting was kittenish , suggestive somehow of an old man out with a chorus girl who would like to make a whirl and does not quite know how . <P> <P> *Recent shows with Gershwin music are Lady Be . Good , Oh Kay , Funny Face , Rosalie.
