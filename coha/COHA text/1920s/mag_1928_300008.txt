Views : <P> " Somewhere there is a Master Mind which sends brain waves or messages to us-the Brain of Mankind , the Brain of the Earth . <P> " There is a Great Spirit . Call it Creative Evolution or World Mind . Call it Collective Intelligence or call it God . It is this Spirit which determines our actions and our thoughts . . . . <P> " I adopted the theory of reincarnation when I was twentysix . I got the idea from a book by Orlando Smith .
