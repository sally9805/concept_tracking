A-B-C <P> Sirs : <P> On account of the frequency with which South American affairs are ignored or involuntarily misrepresented in the North American press , I lave been very pleased to read a kind of " A B C " section devoted to Argentine ; Brazil , and Chile , in your Nov. 19 issue . <P> Among the news referring to Chile , my country , there was a sympathetic reference to our ' protective tariff " for the benefit of Chilean smelting interests . Allow me to thank you for this , especially because I know that you are not fishing , but saying this because you broad-mindedly and openly mean it . <P> May I express my hopes that you will continue paying attention to South America and Chilean affairs which are growing more and more to be of a mutual interest for North and South America . <P> <P> LUIS E.

VAN HORNE <P> Easton , Mo . <P> <P> For an account of a dour defeat let Nebraskans read p. 44. - ED . <P> <P> Lindbergh 's Antelope <P> Sirs : <P> On page 45 of your issue of Nov. 5 appears a statement about a dispatch from Mexico telling " of Lindbergh slaying an antelope from an airplane in Mexico . " This statement appeared widely in the daily press . OUTDOOR LIFE did not believe this statement . Amongst hunters it is not considered sporting to use such advanced mechanical aids in the actual taking of game . Col. Lindbergh certainly stands as the embodiment of American ideals of sportsmanship . Consequently we investigated the report The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , had considered the romance of the fancied of more news value than the actual fact . Apparently Col. Lindbergh did not shoot the antelope from his airplane but located the antelope from the air , and , alighting , stalked his game on foot and bagged it . . . . <P> I have read TIME practically since the first number . The newspapers offering me such an indigestible souffle , I have come to rely upon your excellent magazine for the pertinent news of the day . <P> <P> HARRY McGuiRE <P> Associate Editor
