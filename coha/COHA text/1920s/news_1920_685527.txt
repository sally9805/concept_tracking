txt While the week in the Birmingham aron market has been relatively quiet , one or two sales of considerable tonnage were made . One interest sold 2,000 tons for fourth-quarter delivery to a southern consumer . A considerable amount of 200-ton orders and the like was booked . As a rule , however , large Interests continue to hold off the market . They are fairly well cared for and they have a lot of iron coming to them that is overdue . In the stage of uncertainty of delivery caused by the acute shortage of cars neither consumer nor maker appears anxious to take on much new business . Gulf States Steel blew in its furnace at Gadsden on June 26 after having spent two months in its overhauling . The blast furnaces expect to be hurt by the coal car priority order , but it does not appear so . Concerns like the Woodward Iron , for instance , assemble their own raw material from their own mines and quarries with their own equipment . All the large iron concerns are thus fortified in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car order went by without putting any blast furnace out of commission , but , on the contrary , a new one came in . Pipe works have been handicapped by the coal car priority order , because they get p:g iron and ship pipe in open cars . The four plants of the United States Cast Iron Pipe company at Birmingham , Bessemer , Anniston and Chattanooga closed down on June 26 , and will remain down until after July ' 4 , probably until July ' 7 . Interstate Commerce Commission was appealed to modify the coal car order , but declined to do so . Following execution of this order fireproofing plants , slag pits and scrap dealers were among those that severely felt the car shortage . On July 1 these and other interests collated the exact data bearing on the situation and , joined by Georgia shippers , went to Washington to enter afinal appeal for modification of the order . In spite of the car shortage it develops that the first half year 's production of coal in Alabama has been over 7,600,000 tons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same period of 1919 . However , there was a slump in the demand for coal in the first half of 1919 while the demand has been increasing more and more in 1920 . Alabama miners to the number of around 2,000 are on strike at the small mines producing domestic coal . The strike is for recognition purely . The miners demand a union representative in arbitration of mines disputes and the operators decline . No effort to enforce these conditions at the mines of the larger iron and steel corporations has been made . Owing to the coal car pi iority order Alabama coal production is being materially increased . The coke situation remains acute . Unpicked spot foundry coke has sold at $12 a ton and furnace coke has brought $10 and $11 per ton . Standard foundry handpicked brings $13 and $14 and even more . Birmingham retail merchants did a phenomenal business in May and June . Some made records 50% above those of 1919 and many report from 25% to 50% . It has been the largest turn-over of seasonal goods in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven altogether quite satisfactory .
