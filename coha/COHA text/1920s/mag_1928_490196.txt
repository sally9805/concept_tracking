THE complete gilding of the General Sherman statue at Fifty- ninth Street is a big success from our point of view . The statue is now so bright that the General and the horse and the lady with the palm leaf all merge in one terrific golden blot of victory , and are easily confused with the top of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel  --  which is about where they belong anyway . CROSS the street from Sherman and his golden horse is a good statue  --  the lady in the fountain . It is nut the best statue we have ever seen ( the lady has fat ankles and there are times when the Chickering Removal Sale sign makes something less than a perfect background ) but in the main it is a Bond statue . People sit there , noons , and commune with unhappy pigeons . The sycamore trees drop their brown leaves into dusty beds of ivy . At night , when the street lamps go on , it is a lovely place . This statue , we understand , may have to come down ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do . THERE are too few statistics on poets . We know that Stephen Vincent Ben6t , now famous for a bestselling epic , won the gold medal of the St. Nicholas League when he was twelve years old . It would be interesting to know how many other American poets did , too . Our theory is that all of them must have . There is a time in the life of every poet when hecontinues writing verse only against terrific odds and by dint of holding to tangible conquests . At twelve , he has achieved the gold badge and the approbation of his mother and her immediate circle . He also has aroused the suspicion of the neighborhood . At fifteen , he is too old to be condoned for writing poetry on the ground of childishness , and too conscious of being a sissy to go ahead openly . Poetry then becomes the secret vice ; through the mawkish nether-years he builds his rhymes furtively , fearfully . Possessed of the necessary fire , he pulls through . But we doubt if any poet could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not for the gold badge of St. Nicholas , clutched against his thin and palpitant breast . THE little ad in the Times the other day announcing that the Leviathan was for sale caught our eye . The roads are terribly crowded on Sundays now , and really an automobile is sometimes more of a nuisance than a diversion . For some time we have been thinking that perhaps an able boat and a membership in some good yacht club would be better than a car . Can anyone tell us how many people the Leviathan sleeps comfortably , and whether she 's tight T WE , to our housecat , had been little 1-1 more than a succession of days . There were times when she had found it pleasant to sun herself on the bedroom window ledge ; there were trips to and from the pantry ; there were investigations of the . garbage can to be made ; there were long winter evenings at the hearth , with one 's memories . Once , it is true , there had been a romance , and some talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even  --  one day Like another . Then came Tuesday evening . We returned home to find that the place had been entered by a bat . Long wings and squeaks  --  a real country bat . Our cat , roused from an abysmal lethargy , had risen to the occasion with a sudden magnificence which only a city cat , gone primitive , can display . In rising to the occasion , she had also risen to the tops of doors , the tops of chairs , the higlipeaks of mantels , the dizzy crests of chandeliers , and when we found her she was crouched atop the piano , tantalizing her prey . Things gradually smoothed over , but she is now a changed cat . There is a light in her eye . She spends the days craftily hunting , from room to room . Next winter , again in front of the hearth , she will have memories . Ah , such memories . River Scene THERE was a great shouting and unbattening of hatches at Dobbs ' Ferry the other morning . Tugs veered out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , husbands stood IP SEPTEMDER 1 , 1928 up in motorboats , wives exclaimed . A wild doe and her fawn were swimming the Hudson River . They clambered out on the bank beside the Methodist Book Concern , crossed the New York Central tracks and disappeared . The barge men went below ; husbands sat down ; river life resumed its dreamy flow . Author of the Week WE know a few more things about Mr. Benet , whom we mentioned a few paragraphs back . First off , his Civil War poem is already a best seller , even though it runs to more lines than " Paradise Lost . " He is boyish in appearance , looking somewhat less than his thirty years . In manner he is exceedingly shy . He looked disconsolate when we saw him last week at a tea , seated between a lady and a pile of little sandwiches . His reserve is indicated by a happening of ten years ago , related by a friend of ours who found himself working at the same table with the poet in the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cipher clerks . Asked if he was related to Stephen Vincent Benet and William Rose Benet , the young man replied , " William Rose Benet is my brother " The latter was well known at the time , but even then Stephen had attracted attention as a poet , having published two volumes . Stephen 's admiration for his brother , who is older , is great . He recently said that the latter would have made a better job of " John Brown 's Body " than he did himself . Benet became a cipher clerk during the war because he could not pass the eyesight test for military service . The routine of the work , however , did not suppress his poetic bent . His work was coding and decoding messages . Sometimes , alter enciphering a few words of an official message , he would absentmindedly include in the message Some charming word or phrase that had come into his mind . Ciphers being hard enough to make out anyway , this slowed things np . Once he became bored rs ith an incoming message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about five minutes , he dashed off a ballade concerned with a Fish House punch , which is , or was , a mixed drink served at several places in Washington . He finally resigned and got into the army by crooking the examiners . He learned by heart the eyesight chart and bluffed through the test . The ruse was discovered later and he was put out of the service with an honorable discharge . After that he tried writing advertising for a firm here . He was good at it , but quit . Since then he has devoted himself to straight literature . He has written a number of novels , hooks of poetry , and short stories . Some years ago he also collaborated on two plays , both of which were failures . He comes naturally by his concern with war . The Benets were originally adventuring people from the island of Minorca . One ancestor was a Spanish-Minorcan sea-captain . Benet 's father and grandfather were both West Point graduates , the latter , although a native of Florida , having been a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his brothers who was a lieutenant in the Southern forces . The grandfather , incidentally , wrote a textbook on ordnance and translated a technical book on the Waterloo campaign . The father was a competent literary critic as well as a soldier , and followed with helpful interest , until his death this year , the writings of his two sons and a daughter , who also writes poetry . Park Avenue Again - 1,1 .. ST week we spoke of walking up I Park Avenue without seeing anything much except a man wearing suspenders and carrying a large chair . Someone else has had more luck . On the west side of the Avenue , at Ninety-second Street , he saw a doorman in full-dress uniform playing a hose over the sidewalk in front of his building . A vegetable wagon , drawn by a horse which seemed to have had a hard day , came to a stop at the curb . The driver , an Italian , spoke to the doorman , who hesitated a moment , frowned , shrugged his shoulders , and then accommodated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The animal went on his way quite refreshed . Daniells THE death not long ago of Mr. Daniell , Sr. , the last of the sons of John Daniell &; Sons , is not going to mean that the ancient store in Broadway , opposite Wanamakers , will be modernized . We are told that the present proprietors , the grandsons , Colonel John F. and Major Griswold B. , are going to carry on in the old way . In other words , the salesladies will continue indefinitely to appear wearing 1900 pompadons and rats , the elevator man will wear a derby hat during working hours if he feels like it , and the man who cleans the brass on the front doors will still knock out his pipe and look dubiously at the weather , as he has done for generations . We know of many conservative older people who will take a long breath of relief . Daniells is an amazing place , an interesting and a unique one in this rushing city , when one considers the elaborate changes and innovations of other department stores to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the art department is still called the Picture Gallery , and the art consists of lithographs of girls drawing water at wells , of pretty ladies after Romney and Greuze , of noble stags at evening drinking their fill or snorting defiance to die elements on snowcapped hills To this gallery come people who still want these things and take them away happily . As of yore . Navajo blankets are displayed in the windows , umbrellas for one dollar arc prominently on show , the telephones are the golden-oak kind with the mouthpiece protruding from a box , and the salesladies are occupied in off moments , not with powdering their noses , but with a bit of crochet work . In the dress department the same mirror serves today that served forty years ago . It stands in the middle of the floor . It is Victorian in design and tilts when you push it Let others confuse the issue with window decorations by famous artists , with pipe organs , exhibitions , elegant floor-walkers , fancy displays , and European labels . Daniells remains a haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to buy a pair of cotton stockings . There are many of these to whom the store is dear . Daniells is prosperous . The only change noticeable in recent years is the elimination of the baskets that used to run on wires all around the building , taking your money and returning your change . These are gone , hut old New Yorkers ca n't have everything . There are no plans to alter anything else . The present staff looks forward to another century of triumphant stagnation along present lines . Front Page ATRUSTING , Christian lady who has seen only four or five plays since Maude Adams appeared in " Peter Pan " was persuaded , somehow , to attend a performance of " The Front Page . " The pace of this profane melodrama quite took her breath away , but she sat through it all with the smile of a martyr . On the way out she made but one remark : " Well , it must have given everyone in the theatre a new idea of what goes on these days . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did " What Price Glory . " It is related that a Park Avenue matron of impeccable behavior was so deeply impressed by it that she was thinking of it all the next day . Thus , absently , she boarded a bus . " Riverside Drive ? " she asked the conductor as she was about to take a seat . " No , madame , " he said , " Fifth Avenue . " She hastily descended . " To hell with it , " she said . Hoover 's Book E have talked to a man who used to spend pleasant hours with Herbert Hoover discussing the oc-currence of schorl in copper lodes . To him , Hoover is not a politician , but a mining engineer . This gentleman , whose name " Alonima ? Oh , Momma 's fine  --  Momma 's in the Elps. " is W. R. Ingalls , is still as active in engineering as he was twenty-five years ago when he was one of Hoover 's professional associates . He has an office in a building in lower Broadway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Ingalls is partly responsible for the publication of Hoover 's book on mining twenty years ago . In our recent mention of that hook , we made an error . Mr. Ingalls tells us the manuscript was not sent to college professors for their opinion , as we had heard . It all came about thus : The McGraw-Hill firm , publishers of technical works , received , in 1908 , a telegram from San Francisco signed H. C. Hoover and asking if the firm would be interested in publishing a book on the economics of mining . The head of the hook department was new to technical matters , so he asked Mr. Ingalls , then editor of a mining journal , who Hoover was . Mr. Ingalls told him that , in his opinion , Hoover was the greatest mining engineer in the world . The publishers were satisfied with that , and wired a substantial offer to Hoover for his book . One reason they made the offer an unusually high one was that their chief rivals were a San Francisco firm , and Hoover was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a few months later when he stopped here on his way to London , where he then lived , to sign the contract . It is interesting to note that the first line of the contract read , " H. C. Hoover of London , England . " Incidentally , the publishers were surprised when they saw Hoover . He was then just under thirty-five , but looked no older than twenty-five . The book had a success greater than any other of its kind . Mr. Hoover , as it was explained to us , stripped the complex problems of valuation , organization , and administration of mines to their unchanging essentials . His method of valuation was the first workable one ever expounded in a book , Mr. Ingalls tells us . The work was promptly adopted as a textbook by mining schools throughout the world and is still used in many of them . It has never been found necessary to revise any part of it . Some of the material was a revamping of the text of lectures Mr. Hoover had given at Columbia University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 192,8 in his office of the Hoovers ' famous translation of the ancient Latin hook " Agricola de Re Metallica . " Engineers say it is the most important source and reference book on mining ever written . In case you have n't seen it , it is larger than any volume in your library except the unabridged dictionary . It runs to almost a thousand pages . Mrs. Hoover , who is a fine classical scholar , worked side by side with her husband on this . As she translated from the Latin , Mr. Hoover , walking up and down the room , would , with his wide technical knowledge , study out what the author was driving at and put the thought into suitable English . Thus together they pieced out the only usable translation of the work . It took most of their evenings , Sundays , and huh-days over a period of five years . Special Service IF you forget the num- ber of your private phone , there is hope . A certain wife forgot hers the other afternoon , after having told her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . Information was adamant , but there is apparently a manager who solves these problems . The lady was connected with him and he gallantly consented to call her husband for her . In a short time he returned to the phone . " Your husband will meet you at the Hotel Biltmore at seven o'clock , " said the manager . Guardian Street Angels T " youths and old men who hail the drivers of motor cars in the Forties and Fifties at theatre time , assigning them to parking spaces with solemn assurance , operate nei ther by divine right nor official license , but merely through the indulgence of the corner policeman . Only when they occasionally wax too insistent arc they run off or run in as nuisances . A traffic officer with whom we have long had a nodding acquaintance says that the business is not particularly lucrative , as rackets go , but that the car watchers are of a sort that asks little " 11 's raining out . " " Raining ? " " 1 " eh , raining . " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from beyond Ninth Avenue , schooling themselves in the tradition of subsisting without being irked by bosses . The sprinkling of oldsters are ancient relics looking to their next drink and a place to sleep . What is faintly surprising about the profession is that practically each block along Broadway and Seventh and Eighth Avenues has its own car watcher who works his square night after night and whose domain is seldom invaded by interlopers . Until recently the dean of this clan was an old fellow , said to be a retired letter carrier , who boasted a whistle , two regulation traffic officers ' insignia ( horse 's head and wheel ) , and a conspicuous badge labelled " Official Car Watch er , " the gifts of indulgent caps with a sense of humor . For years , just after dinner time , this man appeared before the Hotel Cumberland at Broadway and Fifty-fourth Street and waited for a certain resident of the hotel who invariably came out to the sidewalk and gave him a quarter . As soon as he received this , he betook himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two sources of income were insufficient for his existence , or he has been forced out of the racket by the competition of younger blood , is not known , but he has not been seen for several months , and the policemen that knew him speculate as to what has become of him . Directions OUR note about the Red Cap who V- , replied , " Supposedly so , " when asked if a certain train stopped at University Heights , has reminded a man of an encounter he had with a native of Boonville , on the edge of the Adirondacks , of whom he asked the way to Old Forge . The fellow 's response was , " Probably you will go on to Alder Creek , and when you get there probably you will turn to the left . " The gentleman did , and everything was all right . Snares WE had often listened , with an indulgent smile , to the assertion that pitfalls await the little country girl ? ? who comes to New York to get a job , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who arrived here from Elmira last July , and she reports that , as far as she 's concerned , they are real and that nobody knows the half of it . Her initial application for a job was with an engineer . The first thing he asked her was her name , and he immediately counted the letters and said : " You do n't vibrate right . That can he changed , " he added . " We will change your name  --  shorten it four letters  --  and then you will vibrate favorably under certain influences . Now let me see your palm , and I will tell you some interesting things . " She told him she was sorry but she just remembered a very interesting date with an old , old mother , who was dying . Her next appointment turned out to he with a woman psychoanalyst who wanted a secretary . After a few words , her prospective employer said : " You are an emotional type , and inhibited ; but that can be changed . " The young lady changed it herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator . Her third application was in the office of an interior decorator . There , of course , she met no pitfalls , but the beautiful interior and the beautiful secretaries frightened her so that she never went back , although her application seemed on the way to being successful . Undaunted , she kept up the search . She is now very happy in the sports department of a Fifth Avenue store , still inhibited , perhaps , but vibrating without fear or favor .
