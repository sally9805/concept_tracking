Steuer , the lawyer , who said that on Feb. 17 last he drew up a contract for the two men . Mr. Steuer in a statement said that while he could not positively identify the police picture of Clements as that of Graves , it bore a strong resemblance to the man . Steuer Notifies the Police . It was Mr. Levine who called the attention of the lawyer to the picture last Thursday , and when the flier insisted that it was that of the missing " Dr. " Clements , Mr. Steuer notified Police Headquarters . Inspector . Coughlin , head of the Detective Division , and Deputy Inspector Carey , commander of the Homicide Squad , who has been in active charge of the local police efforts to aid the New Jersey authorities in a solution of the murder , said yesterday that while they had sent a detective to interview Mr. Steuer , nothing had developed which would justify them in declaring that Graves , or Count Kanitz , the name he first used in introducing himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quest for Clements is based-on the statement of Mrs. Emily Miller , a governess at 1,010 Fifth Avenue , and a friend of the slain Woman , that two months before the murder Miss Brown told her that she was engaged to marry a " Dr. " Clements . Mrs. Miller also told of obtaining a fleeting glimpse of Clements later when Miss Brown pointed the man out in an automobile when they were crossing Fifth Avenue at Central Park . May Question Levine Today . Mr. Levine said yesterday that the published description of Clements given . by Mrs. Miller to the . police , resembled strongly that of Graves , or Dr. Grunette , as the man first identified himself to him . Up to a late hour last evening , however , the police had not sent a detective to question Mr. Levine , but it was thought possible they might do so today . Prosecutor Francis J. Bergen of Somerville , who Is in charge of the hunt for the slayer , refused last night to discuss the Levine identification , saying that he was content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Levine said that when Graves called on him on Feb. 13 it was in connection with an appointment made with him over the telephone three days before . When the man , who said he was 52 years old , appeared to be about 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighed about 220 pounds , entered he told the flier he had just returned from an extended tour of Central and South America in connection with the f .. trmation of a mail , passenger and commercial airline , and had " not yet gotten his land legs . " The man spoke fluently in English and German as he outlined the scheme , which , he said , was being backed by " large interests " with plenty of money to spend . When he told Mr. Levine his age , the latter noticed that his hair appeared to have been dyed a sort of auburn shade . He wore square-rimmed glasses , Mr. Levine continued , and when his host remarked that his smooth face appeared to be drawn , the visitor said that he had just taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about airplanes and a synthetic fuel , a substitute for gasoline , which he said he had invented , but up to this time Mr. Levine had not taken him seriously . When he said that Mr. Steuer was his attorney , and asked about the model of a fifty-passenger airplane on Mr. Levine 's desk , the latter 's interest became aroused . The missing " Dr. " Clements had announced his invention of such a fuel ten years ago . " How much will one of those planes cost ? " Mr. Levine quoted the man as asking , and when Mr. Levine replied , " $750,000 , " the visitor announced : " I 'll take four of them . " Said $3,000,000 Was Ready . Then he went on to explain that he was ready to produce the $3,000,000 for the four airplanes and another million dollars for operating expenses for the air line . He added that his backers wanted Mr. Levine to become President of the corporation , which was to operate the air line on contracts which the visitor already had received from officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport , issued by the Haitian Government , he said , and which bore a picture which undoubtedly was that of the visitor , Mr. Levine said . The upshot of his visit was that both men appeared in Mr. Steuer 's office four days later . The man , it later developed , had previously called on the lawyer , but when he started to explain in the presence of Mr. Levine that he wanted Mr. Steuer to draw up a contract , Levine noticed that the lawyer appeared to treat the man as a stranger . " I became suspicious , " explained Mr. Levine . " I had met Mr. Steuer before , but he never was my attorney . I got the idea . that the stranger was trying to have it appear that I had- suggested the visit to Mr. Steuer and was playing Mr. Steuer between both of us . I excused myself and went out of the room . I wrote a note to Mr. Steuer , which one of the secretaries brought back to Mr. Steuer , in which I said : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your retainer before we go any further . ' Contract Drawn Up and Signed . " When I returned they were finishing a talk about the retainer and the stranger readily agreed to $5,000 . A contract subsequently was drawn up , which the man signed . ( He used the name " Amgaard Karl Graves " on the contract . Then we left Mr. Steuer and the man promised to call me on the telephone the next day , Saturday , by which time he was to have turned over the $5,000 to Mr. Steuer . " I waited for a call from the man up to 1:30 o'clock Saturday afternoon , but no word came from him . The next day , however , he called me at my home and said that he had been unable to get in touch with me the day before because he had been tied up in a conference with his backers . He had said something about keeping the proposed scheme secret , particularly from the newspapers , because he was known to them . He promised to get in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from him since . " I called up Mr. Steuer that day , and he said the man had not appeared in his office from the time I left with him the Friday before , and we agreed that the fellow was a ' nut . ' I forgot all about him until yesterday , when I saw the police picture of ' Dr. ' Clements , and immediately recognized him as the man with whom had called on Mr. Steuer . I told Mr. Steuer this over the telephone , and he notified the police . " Miss Brown was slain on the night of the day the man who bad been negotiating for an airship failed to keep his last appointment with Mr. Levine . The missing " Dr. " Clements was reported variously during the day to have been identified by others as a man with whom they came in contact in the last few months under different names , but Inspector Coughlin let it be known that none of these reports was being taken seriously at Police Headquarters . The police are - still hopeful that Clements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the man that fits Mrs. Miller 's description of the slain woman 's fianc ? . Victim 's Notebook Returned . Deputy Inspector Carey for the first time admitted that about a week ago a notebook belonging to the slain woman had been mailed anonymously te James Park Gillespie , former employer of Miss Brown , at his home , at 1,105 Park Avenue . He said that nothing helpful in the form of a clue had been developed from an examination of the book . He said the book disappeared with other of the governess 's effects at about the time of the murder and was believed to have been mailed by the slayer . It contained the names of eighteen women , he added , but none of a man . Examination of the records of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle License Bureau revealed that no license had been isued to a Dr. Louis Clements , and Deputy Inspector Carey said he was certain that the man never had taken out a driver 's license in this State .
