Actors and esthetes and opera singers return to their stamping grounds in the autumn . As the leaves fall from the trees , to pile in crackling heaps on roadsides , the people of the artistic world gather themselves together , frayed with the merry ardours of the summer , into troublesome bunches , to be lifted and scattered by weird , enthusiastic winds . None should know all this better than Harold Fowler McCormick , the mildly extravagant reaper scion of Chicago . <P> He , in the days when he was relatively unsophisticated , married Edith Rockefeller and entered the bright , ineluctable world of fame and fashion which awaited him with terrible certainty from the day of his birth . Much later , still a little puzzled by celebrities , and somewhat irked by their cost , he married famed Ganna Walska , who astounded the world by frantic attempts to sing grand opera . <P> Now Harold F. McCormick knows what to expect in this most melancholy season of the year . Last fortnight , when he heard that Ganna Walska was coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made heavy by foreboding and cheered only by the vague hope that perhaps , this once , Ganna Walska would be able to come home , like other people , without eccentric fussing or publicity . <P> This vague hope , most notable as an indication of the heroic optimism which has always characterized the friendly Harold McCormick , was of course unjustified . Ganna Walska achieved , not merely the notoriety which generally attaches to her doings ; before she had put foot on the U. S. , she became a cause clbre , a wronged woman , an international affair . In short , she surpassed herself and Harold McCormick 's worst presentiments . Ganna Walska arrived with 15 trunks , containing , she said , $2,500,000 worth of personal effects ; and when customs officials demanded that she pay duty of approximately $1,000,000 upon these , Ganna Walska refused to do so . <P> Her arguments were not entirely illogical . Ganna Walska said that she was a nonresident citizen ; she pointed out that she was the owner of a residence , a beauty shop and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in that capital . Her entity was an individual one , not to be confused with that of her husband who could if he wished stay at home throughout the year . He was a resident but she was not . Since nonresidents do not pay customs duties , she would pay no such . <P> When the customs officials refused to allow this alibi , on the ground that wives , however undomestic , if not legally separated from their husbands , must share the citizenship of their men , Ganna Walska produced a lawyer who last week said he would appeal to Washington because : <P> " The enlightened and progressive conception of feminine rights has worn away every rule of law or custom which placed the wife in a different or less favorable position as a human being than her husband . <P> " The right to own and manage her own property , to retain her earnings and protect and safeguard her rights by the vote and otherwise has now become an accepted fact . <P> " The proposition that a wife is an independent thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband is now almost universally accepted as axiomatic.
