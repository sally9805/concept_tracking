The Man. * " Born as the son of a gardner , John Paul appeared like an obscure speck in the middle of the broad canvas of the 18th Century-a canvas streaked with blood , murder , rebellion , greed , and many winds of doctrine . " In Scotland , John Paul grew up on a rocky soil , dotted with small hard flowers , flanked by the blue and white banner of the sea . The sea , before long , became his native place ; he loved ships and the spin of water under a whirling bow ; he once wrote down : " I will not have anything to do with ships which do not sail fast , for I intend to go in harm 's way . " <P> John Paul cruised in southern seas , beat a mutinous sailor who later died . A murderer by gossip , John Paul finally set his course northward , took Jones for a last name and came to North America . In 1776 he was made a Captain in command of a flagship . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vessel and set out to make the world ring with his name . <P> The exploits that made him the American counterpart of Francis Drake reached their heights in the moonlight encounter between his Bon Homme Richard and the British ship-of-war Serapis ; an encounter which began when the British captain , Pearson , cried : " ' What ship is that ? ' From the Richard came the reply : ' I ca n't hear what you say . ' ' Answer at once , ' shouted Captain Pearson , ' or I shall fire . ' . . . The Richard 's bo'sun leaned out of a port . ' Fire , and be damned to you . ' " For a long time guns flashed in the night and the great dark sails , punched by cannon balls , slipped down from the spars and let an unshadowed silver brighten the noisy , bloodstained decks . Finally Jones took Pearson 's sword and said to him , " ' You have fought heroically . I hope your sovereign will suitably reward you . ' " <P> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze of intrigue and outcry . The Duchess of Chartres had helped him fit his ships , and he was a welcome figure in France , where he became an exquisite and a popinjay . Asked to Russia by Catherine the Great , he went there to gain new kudos in naval warfare and to blunder about , a Scottish bull in the china shop of Russian diplomacy . Then , one day , " a girl in her early teens came to his rooms and asked for garments to mend . When the porter had withdrawn , she ' began some earnest and indecent allurements of person . ' Jones , ' advised her to beware of such a career , gave her a rouble in charity , and dismissed her . ' She refused to go whereupon Jones ' took her gently by the hand and led her to the door . ' There she raised an outcry , tore her clothing , and rushing out on the street to a woman she called her mother , screamed that Jones had assaulted her . . . . Jones at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the . . . ' badger game . ' " A scandal ensued and the sailor left Russia . <P> In Paris , in 1792 , 45 years old , John Paul Jones died . Like many another proud man , wit or adventurer , he read Voltaire , not the Bible , on the night he died . Catherine the Great supplied an epitah : " ' This Paul Jones was a very bad character and well worthy of being praised by a rabble of detestable characters . ' "
