Mediocrity and Individuality NDIVIDUALISM is about the most ambiguous word in the entire list of labels in ordinary use . It means anything from egoistically centred conduct to distinction and uniqueness . It is possible to say that excessive individualism is an outstanding curse of American civilization , and that absence of individualism is our marked deficiency . , When the former remark is made , econ ? omic and legal conditions are in mind ; when the latter , intellectual life is in question . Individuality is a surer word ; it carries with it a connotation of uniqueness of quality , or at least of distinctiveness . It suggests a freedom which is not legal , comparative and external but which is intrinsic and constructive . Our forebears who permitted the growth of legal and economic arrangements at least supposed , however mistakenly , that the institutions they favored would develop personal and moral individuality . It was reserved for our bwn day to combine under the name of individualism , laudation of selfish energy in industrial accomplishment with insistence upon uniformity and conformity in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mediocrity , for submergence of individuality in mass ideals and creeds , it is perhaps not surprising that after boasting for a long time that We had no classes we now boast that we have discovered a scientific way of dividing our population into definite classes . Just as Aristotle rationalized slavery by showing how natural it was for those superior by nature to constitute the ends for others who were only ' tools , so we , while marvelling perhaps at the callousness of the Greek philosopher , rationalize the inequities of our social order by appealing to innate and unalterable psychological strata in the population . Thus Mr. George B. Cutten in his inaugural address as president of Colgate . University recently informed us that it is now " discovered " that ? only fifteen percent of the People have sufficient intelligence to get through college . " From this " discovery " he draws the con-elusion that as we have never had a real democracy , so " the low level of the intelligence of the people Will not permit of our having one . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an aristocracy in industry , commerce , professions and government , but he terms this aristocracy an intellectual aristocracy ! The adjective seems incredible . But President Cutten thinks there is the same scientific warrant for assuming that con%Picuous success under present conditions is a signof innate intellectual superiority as for saying that twenty-five percent of the population are mentally subnormal and that only fifteen percent are capable of higher education . Mr. Cutten begins his presidential career with a startling view of the social stratification which is to be the ultimate outcome of an educational classification based on intellectual classifications by means of mental testing . We are to arrive at a caste system like that of India , " but on a just and rational basis . " For " when the tests for vocational guidance are completed and developed , each boy and girl in school will be assigned to the vocation for which he is fitted . " There will be no difficulty about filling the ranks of unskilled labor and mechanical operators , for Mr. Cutten implicitly believes the yarn that the army tests have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slightly over thirteen years . Considering only the energy and unspoiled curiosity of the average thirteen year old in comparison with the dulled observation and blunted vigor of the average adult one might hope that this statement were true . It would be most encouraging . But it is more to the point to remark , that , as Mr. Lippmann has so clearly shown in these pages , the statement interpreted as Mr. Cutten means it is like saying that perhaps sixty-five percent of the population rank below the lowest fifty percent ; it takes absolutely what is only a comparative statement , thereby rendering it literally senseless . What makes this performance more than a mere individual mistake is that it affords striking evidence of the habit of ignoring speCific individualities , of thinking in terms of fixed classes , intellectual and social . There is no need to re-traverse the ground so admirably covered by Mr. Lippmann . But why has it been so generally assumed among our cultivated leaders that a purely classificatory formula gives information about individual intelligence in its individuality ? ' To say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1922 a mental age of eight or of ten years only means that he belongs , on the basis of his performance of certain exercises , to a class of persons at least over a million in number , who were born in 1912 or 1914 respectively . Why then is it so frequently supposed that the individual mentality of John Jones has been definitely determined ? To say that one belongs in a class which is a million or so large , with respect to which one is accelerated or retarded by a year in comparison with another class of a million , does not , after all , throw much light on the intrinsic capacities of a given individual . The assumption seems to indicate one thing . We are irretrievably accustomed to thinking in standardized averages . Our economic and political environment leads us to think in terms of classes , aggregates ? and submerged membership in them . In spite of all our talk about individuality and individualism we have no habit of thinking in terms of distinctive , much less uniquely individualized , qualities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testings concerns the acquired habits of intellectual spokesmen , rather than the inherent intellectuality of the populace . This fact is indeed significant for the prospects of , democracy . But the reason it is ominous for democracy is radically different from that often assigned . For it reflects not upon the innate mentality of the mass but upon the acquired intelligence of men in high positions . It shows how their education , that given by their surroundings as well as by their schools , has fixed in them the disposition to judge by classification instead of by discrimination , and by classifications which represent the average of ' massed numbers , mediocrities instead of individualities . We may be thought to ignore the interest which many testers have shown in pupils of superior abilities . For some of the testers tell us that one of the chief beneficial consequences of testing is that it enables us to pick out the superior tenth , to rescue the saving remnant from the ruck in which they are now submerged . But the seeming exception proves the rule . The idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still a classificatory word . The size of the class is reduced , say from a million to a hundred thousand . But what kind of superiority marks a par ticular individual is still unrevealed to us . The practical educational use to which testers propose that the results of testing should be put strengthens the proposition that even cultivated minds are dominated by the concept of quantitative classes ? so much so that the quality of individuality escapes them . For many of them are now telling us that the chief use of the results of the tests is to secure a more accurate ranking or grading of pupils . Instead of mixn up together a lot of pupils of different abilities we can divide them into a superior , a middle and an inferior section , so . that each can go its own gait without being kept back or unduly forced by others . An individual is not conceived as an individual with his own distinctive perplexities , methods and rates of oper- ation . The classificatory submergence of individuals in averaged aggregates is perpetuated : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that the net result will be to postpone the day of a reform of education which will get us away from inferior , mean and superior medi ocrities so as to deal with individualized mind and character . The movement is on a par with the movements to make instruction more efficient while retaining that notion of teaching which emphasizes the receptively docile mind instead of an inquiring and pioneering purpose . These remarks are in no sense a hostile criticism of the scientific procedure of mental testing They are an attempt to suggest its proper goal and to indicate the stage which has now been reached in moving toward that goal . The goal is a method of discrimination , of analysis of human beings , of diagnosis of persons , which is intrinsic and absolute , not comparative and common . Before this goal can be reached it is necessary that certain average statistical norms should be determined . But their function is scientific , not practical either for schooling or for the conduct of democracy . They are of value in working out a system of tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not be sure , for example , that you have a good test for mechanical ingenuity in a particular person until you have seen how large numbers react to different exercises . The pity is that a scheme for testing tests which are ultimately to be employed- in diagnosing individuality has been treated as if it already provided means of testing individuals . Life insurance is impossible , for example , with out extensive statistical investigations , establishing quantitative mean norms . Individuals are graded as to their degree of insurable risk on the basis of these norms . But no one supposes that the result determines the fate of any particular person . If to be accepted as a good risk were a guarantee Of long life , clearly no one after being accepted would insure himself . And similarly to a sensible person rejection is not a fatalistic sign of sure death . It is a warning to have a thorough individual examination made , and to undertake individualized remedial measures on the basis of this individual diagnosis . An I.Q. as at present determined is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its practical value lies in the stimulus it gives to more intimate and intensive inquiry into indi " vidualized abilities and disabilities . As a matter of fact , President Cutten 's educational outlook in the concrete is much more intelligent and humane than is indicated by his credulous use of the army tests . He saves himself by losing his logic . He says that education is conservative as compared with theology and philosophy ; he declares that if we are teaching the wrong subjects , the better the teaching the more disastrous the results ; his conviction that we are largely teaching the wrong subjects is perhaps indicated by his statement that our curricula have not changed much in the last millennium . He points out that the whole *system is strong on its receptive side and weak on the creative side ; and that the consequence is the comparative scarcity of creative artists and thinkers among us . Students who merely pass in college and who are conspicuous for breaches of discipline become later in life leaders and executives . Is it possible to admit these facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should devote ourselves to changes in education which are within our control rather than worry about innate differences which are not within our control ? If there Prevailed from the elementary school up the kind of inquiring and creative education which President Cutten desires for the college , perhaps democracy , in spite of native inequalities and inferiorities , Would not be in such a parlous condition . Until We have tried the educational experiment , we simply do not know and shall not know what individual capacities and limits really are . For it is not just the quantity of our education which is confessedly at fault ; it is its quality , its spirit , method and aim . A change from a receptive education to a creative one , to one which as President Cutten well says would result in " ability to meet a unique situation , " obviously implies studying and treating individuals in their distinctive and unique qualities . It involves getting away from that class and averaged education to which the current interpretation of the results of mental testing the more rigidly commits us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a subject matter of a science in which he is a somewhat credulous non-expert to the field of education in which he is a wise expert . From an ad hominem point of view , the difference of attitude in the two fields indicates how much what is termed intelligence is an acquired matter , due to opportunity and experience . No matter how much innate qualities may set limits , they are not active forces . Experience , that is to say education , is still the mother of wisdom . And we shall never have any light upon what are the limits to intelligence set by innate qualities till we have immensely modified our scheme of getting and giving experience , of education . Barring complete imbecility , it is safe to say that the most limited member of the populace has potentialities which do not now reveal themselves and which will not reveal themselves till we convert education by and for mediocrity into an education by and for individuality .                  @ @ @
