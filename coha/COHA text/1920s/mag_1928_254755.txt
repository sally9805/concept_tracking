A clever inventor came to the U.S. last week with the news that he had found a means of clipping the telephone 's claws , of removing one of its most obvious defects . Reporters , with naive excitement heard a description of Inventor J.G. Larsson 's device . Its purpose is to write down the telephone messages when the intended recipient does not answer the telephone . Constructed on the principle of a dictaphone , the device establishes a connection after the signal has sounded , then it sounds a signal to indicate that a device , not a person , is ready to receive any desired message . This done , the message is recorded and punched out upon paper . Then , when the time limit set by its owner has expired , the device breaks the connection . <P> Standing near the inventor , enjoying the delight and bewilderment of newsmongers , was Isaac W. Heyman , rich steel manufacturer , who had offered $250,000 for making copies of J.G. Larsson 's device and then disposing of them . He explained that the inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone companies might use it as standard equipment : he pointed out that in Sweden , whence Inventor Larsson had come and where he lives , Inventor Larsson 's device has been demonstrated and found good by government engineers .
