Many aeronautical experts hold the dirigible the answer to the problem of how to make trans-Atlantic air services both profitable and safe . Two nations , Germany and England , have been rushing airship construction with this purpose in mind , but while a giant German Zeppelin will be ready for flight next month , English efforts to build the R-100 at Howden , Yorkshire , have met with serious delays . Government subsidies , already totaling $1,750,000 , are at an end until test flights may prove successful . No funds are available for the wages of 300 skilled workmen , now sheathing the airship in silver linen , completing the structural ribs behind which the gas bags will be placed , testing the six Rolls-Royce engines . <P> Adroit in arousing public sentiment , Commander Charles Dennistoun Burney , M. P. , builder in charge of the R-100 , last week gave a tea party . Fifty guests , including several M. P. 's , mounted a staircase with mahogany balustrades , inspected a kitchen equipped with electric stoves , visited 39 sleeping cabins , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago debutante , was hostess . <P> Wondering if they had strayed by mistake into the Berkeley or the Savoy , guests followed host &; hostess to the promenade deck , sat down in wicker chairs . Proudly , Commander Burney told them the R-100 is the world 's largest dirigible , with a hull as big as many an ocean liner .
