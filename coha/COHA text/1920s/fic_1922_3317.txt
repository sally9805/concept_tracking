Produced by William Coon The Reckoning A Play in One Act By PERCIVAL WILDE The Reckoning CHARACTERS THE BARBER . THE CUSTOMER . THE RECKONING The scene is a barber shop . At the center is the chair , facing a mirror and washstand at the right . The tiled walls are sprinkled with the usual advertisements . At the rear , a door leads up to the street by a flight of two or three steps . A dock on the left wall indicates three . At the rise of curtain , THE BARBER , a man of fifty , is discovered sharpening a razor , and whistling softly to himself . He finishes with the razor ; seats himself in the chair , takes up a paper , and reads . The door opens , and THE CUSTOMER , a flashily-dressed individual of forty-five , enters the shop . THE BARBER . ( Rising at once ) Good afternoon , sir . THE CUSTOMER . ( Pulling out his watch ) That clock right ? THE BARBER . Yes , sir ; Western Union time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run down . ( He sets it . ) Now , I 've got just five minutes to spare . Can you shave me in that time ? THE BARBER . Five minutes , sir ? Easy ! Easy ! THE CUSTOMER . All right . Go ahead . ( He takes off his hat and coat , and moves towards the chair . ) THE BARBER . Your collar also , sir . THE CUSTOMER . ( Smiling ) Fussy , are n't you ? THE BARBER . Well , sir , I try to do my work well . THE CUSTOMER . ( Takes off tie and collar , putting his expensive scarf-pin in the edge of his vest , which he does not remove ) Satisfied now ? THE BARBER . Yes , sir Thank you , sir . ( He gets out sheet , towels , etc . ) In a hurry , sir ? THE CUSTOMER . Yes . Got to attend a meeting at three-ten . THE BARBER . Oh ! The auction up-stairs ? THE CUSTOMER . Yes . ( He glances at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . THE BARBER . Do n't worry , sir . There 's lots of time .... From the country , sir ? THE CUSTOMER . ( Lighting a cigar ) Yes . Southerner . THE BARBER . ( Fastening the sheet ) I thought so . I 'm from the country myself . THE CUSTOMER . What part ? THE BARBER . Oh , that would be difficult to say . You see , I 've moved around so much that I 'm neither a Southerner nor a Northerner . I 'm just an American . ( He mixes the lather . ) I lived in a little town near Savannah for a year . THE CUSTOMER . Did you ? Why , so did I. THE BARBER . Yes , indeed . I used to see you -- quite frequently --  though you never came into my shop . Then I went to Philadelphia . THE CUSTOMER . What year ? THE BARBER . Let me think . It was April , twelve years ago . THE CUSTOMER . April , twelve years ago ? I went to Philadelphia the same month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . ( He lets down the chair suddenly . ) THE CUSTOMER . ( Startled ) What are you doing ? THE BARBER . I 'm hurrying , sir . THE CUSTOMER . Well , you need n't break my neck about it . THE Barber . No , sir . ( Lathering . ) From Philadelphia I went to Newark . THE CUSTOMER . To Newark ? THE BARBER . And from Newark to Indianapolis . THE CUSTOMER . ( Much surprised ) What ? THE BARBER . And then Muscatine -- for a few months -- and Chicago --  and Louisville . THE CUSTOMER . Why , one would think you had been following me about ! I 've lived in every one of those places . THE BARBER . Have you , sir ? It 's a little world , is n't it ? THE CUSTOMER . You 've been a barber right along ? THE BARBER . I could n't do anything else , sir . It 's my trade . THE CUSTOMER . ( Smiling ) Well , this is the first time you ever shaved me . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the last . THE CUSTOMER . That 's so . I 'm going to leave town right after the auction . THE BARBER . If I may ask , sir , where are you going ? THE CUSTOMER . I do n't know yet . ( Jocularly . ) Are you going to follow me ? THE BARBER . Sooner or later , sir . It 's going to be a long journey , is n't it ? THE CUSTOMER . What makes you think so ? THE BARBER . There 's a long journey we all take -- sooner or later . Eh ? THE CUSTOMER . A long journey ? But you 're wasting time , man ! THE BARBER . Am I , sir ? ( He strolls to the clock ; looks at it ; returns . ) Fine weather we 're having . THE CUSTOMER . ( Impatiently ) Yes . THE BARBER . Though a little more rain would be good for the crops . THE CUSTOMER . Um . THE BARBER . ( Very leisurely ) You know , sir , the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I trimmed his hair this morning --  THE CUSTOMER . ( Interrupting ) I do n't care what he said ! I want to get shaved ! THE BARBER . Yes , sir ! Yes , sir ! And -- and the young lady who runs the news stand up-stairs -- right next to the elevator , sir -- she was saying that she had never --  THE CUSTOMER . ( Interrupting more violently ) I told you once I do n't care what your friends were saying ! I 've got to be at that meeting at three-ten . THE BARBER . Yes , sir . THE CUSTOMER . My time is almost up . You 'll have to hurry . THE BARBER . ( Slapping on more lather ) Do n't worry , sir . I always keep my promises . Why , I remember , sir , back in Savannah , when my poor daughter was alive , I promised --  THE CUSTOMER . ( Interrupting angrily ) I do n't give a damn for your daughter ! THE BARBER . ( Mildly ) No , sir . I did n't think you did . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Beginning to shave ) Oh , no , sir ! It has n't begun . THE CUSTOMER . ( Starting ) What do you mean ? THE BARBER . Do n't do that again , sir ! You do n't know how near you came to cutting yourself ! THE CUSTOMER . You promised to finish with me in five minutes ! THE BARBER . No , sir , if you will allow me to contradict you , I did not . THE CUSTOMER . You said you would shave me in five minutes . THE BARBER . Yes , sir . That is correct . THE CUSTOMER . And it's --  THE BARBER . Easy , sir , easy ! The razor is sharp ! ( Shaving . ) When I promised to shave you in five minutes , I did n't say anything about lathering . That takes several minutes by itself . THE CUSTOMER . What ? THE BARBER . Now you 've done it ! ( He applies styptic to a cut on THE CUSTOMER 's face . ) Smarts , does n't it ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceited galoot ! THE BARBER . ( With sudden and overwhelming rage ) Do n't talk to a gentleman like that ! You cur ! ( With a sudden resumption of his obsequious manner . ) I did it on purpose . THE CUSTOMER . ( Gasping ) Wh-what do you mean ? THE BARBER . ( Respectfully ) You really must n't accuse me of being clumsy , sir . I 'm not clumsy . If I cut you , it was quite intentional -- like this ! ( Cutting him a second time . ) THE CUSTOMER . Damnation ! Are you crazy ? THE BARBER . ( Applying the styptic ) No , sir , I 'm quite sane . ( THE CUSTOMER tries to sit up . ) Oh , do n't do that , sir ! Do n't do that ! My razor is frightfully sharp ! THE CUSTOMER . ( Panic-stricken ) I want to sit up ! THE BARBER . Do n't try it while the razor is at your throat , sir . It is sure to be fatal . THE CUSTOMER . Then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no ! When I am through shaving you -- not before . Now take it easy , sir . Lie back quietly ! Quietly ! That 's it . THE CUSTOMER . ( Controlling himself with an effort , and putting his cigar in his mouth ) What are you going to do with me ? What 's this ? A hold-up ? THE BARBER . What am I --  ( With a sudden access of rage . ) Take that filthy thing out of your mouth ! ( He snatches the cigar , and throws it to the floor ; continues obsequiously . ) idea . Er -- ca n't you suggest something ? THE CUSTOMER . ( Quickly and earnestly ) Listen to me . I must be at that meeting at once ! I ca n't spare another minute . If I am not there before three-fifteen I will be ruined -- do you understand me ?  - -  ruined ! THE BARBER . You need n't raise your voice , sir . My hearing is excellent . ( He lathers again , keeping the razor near THE CUSTOMER 's throat . ) THE CUSTOMER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I THE BARBER . Oh , I believe you . Do n't let that trouble you . In fact , I know all about the meeting . There 's going to be an auction , and unless you bid , it will be all up with you . THE CUSTOMER . Then you 'll let me go there ? THE BARBER . I 'm afraid I wo n't , sir . THE CUSTOMER . But --  THE BARBER . If I may use your own words , sir , I do n't give a damn about your meeting . THE CUSTOMER . ( Angrily ) Who the devil do you think THE BARBER . ( Interrupting him by running the lather brush into his mouth ) Oh , shut up ! ( There is a pause . ) THE CUSTOMER . I'll-I 'll give you ten dollars to let me go . THE BARBER . ( Acting as if he did not hear ) Beg pardon , sir ? THE CUSTOMER . ( Taking the scarf-pin from the edge of his vest . ) This scarf-pin -- it 's worth five hundred dollars -- I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , knocking the pin out of THE CUSTOMER 's hand ) I do n't hear well on this side . Try the other . THE CUSTOMER . A thousand dollars ! I 'll give you a thousand dollars ! THE BARBER . I 'm afraid it wo n't do , sir . You see , the young lady who runs the news stand up-stairs says -- you wo n't interrupt me this time will you ? she says it 's important to keep customers in sight . There 's nothing so bad for trade as an empty shop . THE CUSTOMER . Oh , have you no heart ? It 's almost too late now ! Every second is worth a dollar to me ! THE BARBER . Well , sir , it will console you to know that my time is worth very little . THE CUSTOMER . Please let me up ! If I wait two minutes longer , I might as well shoot myself . THE BARBER . I sha n't object , sir . THE CUSTOMER . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! THE BARBER . So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it . I always thought you 'd regret sooner or later . ( Shaving . ) By the way , sir , have n't you recognized me yet ? THE CUSTOMER . Recognized you ? THE BARBER . Oh , I see . You thought I was just a lunatic . Well , I 'm not . Look at me . Look at me closely . THE CUSTOMER . I do n't know you ! THE BARBER . No ? Well , just say to yourself , " Twelve years ago this man 's hair was not so gray . Twelve years ago this man 's face did n't show so many lines of care . Twelve years ago this man lived -- well , in a little town near Savannah , and --  " THE CUSTOMER . ( Beginning to recognize him ) You-you ca n't be --  THE BARBER . Say it . THE CUSTOMER . Kilburn ! THE BARBER . Yes , Kilburn ! THE CUSTOMER . ( Hoarsely ) And you followed me about ! THE BARBER . For twelve years ! THF CUSTOMER . From town to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week behind you . THE CUSTOMER . ( With unutterable horror ) Good God ! THE BARBER . Yes , God . I used to think of Him a great deal , John . I used to ask Him why He never brought you into my shop . THE CUSTOMER . Oh ! Oh ! THE BARBER . But He brought you here at last , John ! He brought you here at last ! ( He pauses . ) For twelve mortal years I 've been hoping for this day ! Once , in Muscatine , you came in , but there was another man in the chair , and you would n't wait . Once , in Louisville , you crossed my threshold , looked at your watch , and walked out again . But sooner or later , John , I knew you 'd walk into my shop , and sit down in my chair ! That day has come ! ( He looks into his eyes . ) You and I , John , the two of us , have a long account to settle , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ! And this is the reckoning , John ! You 're going to pay me -- pay me in full -- and you 're going to pay me now ! THE CUSTOMER . What are you going to do ? THE BARBER . That 's a hard question , John . I 'd be justified in cutting your throat , would n't I ? THE CUSTOMER . It would be murder ! THE BARBER . Ugly word , is n't it ? THE CUSTOMER . Murder in the first degree ! THE BARBER . Oh , of course ! THE CUSTOMER . They 'd get you as sure as fate ! THE BARBER . I would n't run away . THE CUSTOMER . But , Kilburn , think what you are doing ! THE BARBER . I 've been thinking about it for twelve years , John . THE CUSTOMER . I 'm on my back , helpless ! THE BARBER . You 'd run if I let you up . THE CUSTOMER . But give me a chance ! Kilburn , give me --  THE BARBER . ( Interrupting ) No , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He pauses . ) She was just eighteen when you came to our town . She was only a child , John , only a child . Her mother was dead . I was all she had -- and she was all I had . And I was trying to bring her up right -- to make her the same kind of a woman her mother had been , if you know what that means . THE CUSTOMER . I didn't --  THE BARBER . Do n't tell me what you did and what you did n't ! She loved you -- and -- and I trusted you . You were going to get married . You took her away with you -- and you did n't marry her ! Marriage ? Why , you never thought of it ! You could n't get her any other way you wanted her -- and you got her ! You did n't care about me , and you did n't care about her . She was a toy . She amused you , and when you were through with her , you flung her into the gutter ! It makes me sick to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) She came home six months later . How she got back all the way from where you 'd taken her , I do n't know -- and I do n't like to guess . And then-then --  THE CUSTOMER . I 'll marry her now , Kilburn . THE BARBER . You 'll have to ask her about that . THE CUSTOMER . ( Eagerly ) Well ? THE BARBER . In two minutes you 'll be able to ask her . THE CUSTOMER . What do you mean ? THE BARBER . She 's dead , John -- dead . ( THE CUSTOMER groans . Then , suddenly , he tries to rise . THE BARBER places his hand over his forehead and eyes , and forces him back into the chair . ) THE BARBER . Thirty seconds for your prayers , John ! THE CUSTOMER . Do n't kill me , man ! Do n't kill me ! I 'm not fit to die ! I 'm not ready ! A minute ! Two minutes ! I 'm too young ! Do n't kill --  ( THE BARBER , still with his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet towel and strikes him across the throat with it . THE CUSTOMER faints . THE BARBER looks at him contemptuously ; abruptly raises the chair to a sitting position ; puts away the razor . ) THE BARBER . So your nerve gave way , John ? Your nerve gave way ? ( He spreads the towel over THE CUSTOMER 's face and roughly wipes away the lather . ) THE CUSTOMER . ( Beginning to come to ; faintly ) Where am I ? THE BARBER . You ought to be in hell , but I guess you 're still on God 's good earth . THE CUSTOMER . ( Putting his hand to his throat ) You -- you did n't kill me ? THE BARBER . No . I did n't . THE CUSTOMER . ( Standing up ) And you could have ! THE BARBER . John , when you 're just about to cross the river , when your eyes are beginning to glaze and your heart 's about to stop beating , you wo n't be nearer death than you were a minute ago ! THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARBER . It would n't bring back Jennie , would it ? THE CUSTOMER . ( With a sneer ) Were you afraid ? THE BARBER . After I had been looking forward to it for twelve years ? No . THE CUSTOMER . Then why --  THE BARBER . ( Grimly ) You 'll remember why ! ( He helps him on with his coat . ) John , tell me : are fellows who are so brave with women always so cowardly when they deal with men ? Or , ( breaking off , speaking slowly ) , or , perhaps , was it on account of that meeting ? THE CUSTOMER . That meeting ? Good Lord ! THE BARBER . Yes , the meeting . THE CUSTOMER . ( Looking at the clock ) Twenty-five minutes past ! I 'm ruined ! I 'm ruined ! THE BARBER . ( Half to himself ) I did n't kill you , no ! I left you your life , but I made it worthless ! I broke you ! I broke you ! THE CUSTOMER . ( Has crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Startled at the sudden change in his voice ) Yes ? THE CUSTOMER . ( Hysterically ) Thought I was a fool , did you ? Thought I 'd tell you the real time of the meeting ? THE BARBER . What do you mean ? THE CUSTOMER . ( Shrieking ) You ass ! You idiot ! The meeting does n't begin till three-thirty ! THE BARBER . ( Calmly ) Is that all ? Well , the clock ( pointing to it ) is half an hour slow . CURTAIN
