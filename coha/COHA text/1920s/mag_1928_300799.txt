Week by week the total of brokers ' loans mounted . Federal Reserve banks , led by Chicago , raised the rediscount rate to 5%. * Still the member banks reported that corporations and individuals were withdrawing deposits and putting their funds on the call loan market . Last week , U.S. bankers sat down to a serious campaign to end the wholesale diversion of money for speculative purposes . <P> In Chicago , Federal Reserve directors discussed radical action , a return to the early system of " differential rediscounting , " with low rates for agricultural and industrial loans , high rates for loans destined for speculation . To Manhattan came curly-haired Roy Archibald Young , Governor of the Federal Reserve Board , ostensibly on a tour of inspection . But bankers noted his arrival coincided with the issuance of a serious warning by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . Banks were " overloaned . " The discrepancy between deposits and loans was becoming too great . <P> Most promising , however , was the action of the New York Clearing House Association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money of the corporations out on call in amounts less than $100,000 . Further , they shall increase their service charge on loans made for others from 5% on the interest on the loan , to of 1% of the principal . Banks anticipated protests , prepared to meet them by handing the corporations a partial recompense . Interest rates on commercial accounts were raised from 2 to 2% , on deposits for 30 days or more from 2 to 3% . <P> But a chasm still yawned between interest rates on deposits and on call money . Opinions were divided on the possibility of curbing speculation by refusing to lend money on behalf of corporations . The corporations , for example , might lend their money directly , ignoring the banks . Or they might start a bank of their own . There seemed , last week , a number of ways by which the money market might be taken out of the control of the Federal Reserve and of its member banks . <P> *Last week , Lawyer Frank G. Raichle of Buffalo adopted the extraordinary course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of New York , from raising the rediscount rate . Cried Lawyer Raichle : " Artificial stringency ! Propaganda ! Money despotism ! Paternalism ! " Charged Lawyer Raichle : " The Federal Reserve Bank has been illegally engaged in the arbitrary reduction of business through the fixing of high rediscount rates . " <P> Frank Raichle is the law partner of Col. William J. ( " Wild Bill " ) Donovan , Assistant to the U. S. Attorney General . He suffered bombardment when his innocent pleasure yacht was attacked , last month , by a Coast Guard Cutter ( TIME , July 23 ) .
