txt Corporation Counsel George P. Nicholson , who cooperated with Mayor I tylan in preparing the charges under which Governor Smith Is to bd called upon to oust the three members of the Transit Commission , wrote to the Mayor yesterday informing him that he had retained as an attorney to aid in prosecuting the charges Harry A. Gordon of 347 - Fifth Avenue . Mr. Gordon is the personal counsel of Police Commissioner Richard E. Enright . In his letter to the Mayor Mr. Nicholson wrote : " After a conference with you . and realizing that the written charges preferred by you against the present Transit Commissioners will necessarily and in due course be the subject of a hearing before the Governor , I have secured the services of Harry A. Gordon , Esq. , attorney at law , to aid in the prosecution of these charges . Section 4-A of the Public Service Commission law provides : " ' Tile Governor may remove any Commissioner for inefficiency , neglect of duty or misconduct in office , giving him a copy of the charges against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person or by counsel in his own defense , upon not less than ten days ' notice . If such Commissioner shall be removed the Governor shall ! filo in the office of the Secretary of State a complete statement of charges ' made against such commissioner . and his findings thereon , together with a complete record of the ? proceeding . ' " From now on Mr. Gordon will be in complete charge of this matter and , of course , he will have the cooperation of my department . " Asks About Hiram Johnson . When informed that Mr. Gordon had been retained as special counsel in the matter of the " charges " against the Transit Commission , Commissioner Leroy T. Harkness said : " The pressing of the so-called charges is evidently more difficult than the city ' expected , as it scents to find it necessary to gc outside the Corporation Counsel 's office to get special counsel . But where Is Hiram Johnson who got $2 ; 1,000 as special counsel to get whipped in the courts by the Transit Commission ? The so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's law office some patronage to distribute and thereby to run up the city 's abnormally high law bills . " Mr. Gordon may have better success In collecting his fee than did Mayor Hylan 's counsel in the Mayor 's famous suit for libel against a newspaper . " George . Chairman of the Transit Commission , made a more complete reply to the Mayor 's indictment , referring especially to the use of wooden cars on ' the rapid transit lines , concerning which policy , it appeared , he had been in correspondence with Governor Smith only about three weeks ago . Mr. made public the letters written by him to the Governor at that time . In his supplementary statement Chairman said : " As I indicated yesterday , the Transit Commission proposes to act on the Mayor 's suggestion that the facts in the existing situation be submitted for the judgment of the Governor . It will also , as I indicated , ask the Legislature , immediately upon its assembling in January , to appoint a committee to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature has . It is high time that the people of this city were given a real understanding of the meaning and results of Mr. HyIan 's constant obstruction to transit relief . Up to the present he has opposed or throttled every species of relief that does not proceed either from green buses or yellow taxis . " What the city wants is more subways and more service out of the subways and other facilities than it already has . For three years , however , the Transit Commission , in its effort to secure relief , has been dealing with municipal government run on the lines of yellow journalism , with cheap abuse substituted for honest , constructive cooperation . " Every effort the - Commissioners have made to get forward , backed by the opin- ions of the best possible talent among engineers and experts , has been defeated or delayed by Mr. Hylara and his official associates . New subway routes , the initiation or even the completion of new construction , the building of the yards and repair shops  --  essential to safe and efficient daily operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lack of consideration for public needs that is incomprehensible . " The whole story should be told and told thoroughly  --  not merely in order to properly fix the responsibility for the conditions with which the city is dealing . but to clear the way for some real advance . Undoubtedly the facts and . so far as possible , the truth about Mr. HyIan 's motives , should be brought out before some fair tribunal : and public officials , whoever they may be . who are responsible for the injury that leas been done the city and the people of the city through what amounts to an almost complete tie-up of transit relief , should ? not only be held to account but dealt with according to their deserts . ' " The burden of Mr. Hylan 's so-called ' charges ' of yesterday had to do . in one way or another , with the use of wooden cars upon the elevated railways both in Manhattan and Brooklyn . He has been conducting a campaign , reckless in its possibilities , designed to con , ince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures and cars alike , ' are unsafe . His move in this respect Is a part of that campaign . It so happens , however , that the commission has already taken up with Governor Smith this phase of the matter , and that it has pointed out to the Governor the disastrous results talk of this sort I. apt to bring about if it remains unchecked . " The commission is giving out today . . as a sufficient answer at the moment to Mr. Hylan 's creed , certain letters it addressed to the Governor , under dates of Sept. 27 and Sept. 29. that may now properly be published . " Letters to the Governor . In the first of the letters referred to It appeared that Chairman alcAneny was writing to Governor Smith under date of Sept. 27 , because the Governor had enclosed to him " a communication from one Emil Greenburg , in which certain statements made by others respecting the accident on the Brighton Beach line of the B. M. T. company on Aug 5t are repeated . and upon which you psk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Mr. - qzmcq#Aneny. " submit the following : " The statements or implications re , ( erred to are generally to the effect : " 1 . That the loss of the life of the conductor , and the injuring of various passengers in this Collision were due to the use of wooden car equipment upon ' the elevated lines of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Company . 2 . That , incidentally , there had Lean a failure on the part of the company to properly equip the ears in question with modern safety devices : and " 3 . That unless these conditions are changed , and , particularly , the wooden ( - era retired or replaced , a generally unsafe condition will continue , requiring re-lie:al measures of correction . ' The facts are : " That the collision , which occurred aetween a train of steel cars and a following train of wooden cars , was due either to the failure of the motorman of the following train properly to handle his brake or to a failure of the brake : - rod-  itself . " That the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevated lines of the Brooklyn . Manhattan Company  --  except those operated through the Centre Street subway loop  --  and upon the elevated lines of the Interborough Company in Manhattan , - without exception , had nothing to do with the accident in question . " Continuing Mr gave the findings of operating experts . as to the - relative merits of wooden cars and-10 , e1 ars upon an elevated structure . He then wrote : . " That even though the case for steel car operation upon the elevated line . " . were clear  --  which it is not ? it would cost in the neighborhood of $60,000,000 ! f. to $70.000.000 to replace ' the existing wooden cars . " That even if it were possible to find the money at the present time for such a a vast outlay in new'steel cars  --  which it not  --  upon by far the greater part of the existing elevated structures such : . cars could not be carried .. . The amount - of strengthening they would require to carry steel equipment would Involve practically rebuilding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal operating companies have kept ' as well up to date as they find it possible to keep , and that the Transit Commission . and its predecessor commissions for that matter , have consistently so required . " The Most Important Fact . Chairman then states what he calls " by far the most Important fact in the situation . " He describes how . in June , 1923 , the Board of Estimate and the Transit Commission entered into a joint expert investigation of " the present condition of the car and road equipment now in use on all the elevated railroad lines . " Expert engineers were appointed for the purpose . The Board of Estimate ? " I believe at the instance of the Mayor . " Mr : wrote ? appointed as its representative on this board Dr. George F. Swayne . Professor of Civil Engineering to Harvard University and former Chairman of t : . e lioeton Transit Commission . The Transit Commission named Robert Ridgway. its then Chief Engineer and both the operating companies contributed experts from their engineering staffs . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most thorough investigation of the elevated properties that has been made since their inception . " Under date of Jan. 4. 1924 , it presented an exhaustive report , the conclusions of which were unanimous . " Chairman MeAneny 's letter to the Governor then continues : " With reference to the condition of the structures , the committee said : Although the structures contain defects and are not up to the standard of the present day , the best assurance that they are safe is found in the fact that for many years they have carried loads as great as those now being carried , without a single accident due to a structural failure . A structure which has this record can not be termed unsafe . * ? ? The company is responsible for the safety . of its structure . It is the main sufferer in case of an accident , except for the persons who may be injured , and It has to pay the bills . " Upon the chief point now under discussion  --  that of the fitness for service of the cars now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conclusions as follows : - a considerable number of the cars are old and probably not what would be ordered today ' , they are fit for the service required if properly maintained , and no structural changes or retirements from service are necessary at this time , except with regard to No. 900 series above referred to ( a lot of thirty-five cars ) , which have already been temporarily withdrawn from service . ' Judgment of Mayor 's Expert . " This conclusion , as I have said , rep ' resented the judgment , not only of the State and city engineers designated to check up the entire situation . but of one of the most eminent and the most efficient consultants in the country selected by the Mayor and acting under his complete authority . " It will appear that the Mayor Is now engaged in an effort to discredit the report of his own experts , from which these findings have been quoted . " It has even been represented publicly that he has directed the policemen , firemen and other city employes to solicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your Excellency , declaring the present elevated structures and equipment unsafe , and asking your Intervention . " The damage that may be done through a false campaign of this sort is hardly to be estimated . Certainly , there Is no more effective way to breed a public state of mind that may , upon the slightest occasion , lead to panic and the disasters that panic usually invites . " The elevated lines are as safe as any railroads of the sort in. the world ; and . as the Mayor 's consultant has pointed out , there is no need for any substitution of cars at the present time other than that which the ' companies , under the orders of the Transit Commission and within the funds at their command , are , in the natural course , bringing about . " On Sept. 29 Mr. wrote to the Governor a supplementary letter in which , he said . in part : ' , Since writing you my attention has been called to certain resolutions of the Board of Estmate adopted at a meeting held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing between the ' city and the Brooklyn-Manhattan Company  --  Contract No. 4 ? there was , an agreement to retire from service on Jan. 1 , last various cars of the wooden type , and now in use , upon the company 's elevated ' structures . This assertion is based upon either an innocent or an ignorant masunderstairding of the contract in question which contains no such agreement . "
