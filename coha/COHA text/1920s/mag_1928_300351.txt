Inertia , self-interest and red tape have for years blockaded every effort to reapportion the seats in the House of Representatives , as required by the Constitution , in conformity with the present-day population of the U. S. House seats are still held on the basis of the 1910 Census . When the House met this month , it was announced that a bloc of 100 members would , if necessary , filibuster to put through some Reapportionment bill , presumably the long-shelved measure written by Chairman E. Hart Fenn ( Connecticut ) of the Census Committee to reapportion on the basis of the 1930 census ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) . <P> It looked as though a Fenn bill might actually be reported out of committee before the holidays . But last week a new obstacle was presented . Five members of the Census Committee sent word they had the influenza-Washington 's Johnson , Pennsylvania 's Swick , New York 's Jacobstein , Michigan 's Clancy and White of Kansas . Wisconsin 's Peavey and others were out of town . Without a quorum the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed . <P> If and when the question ever does reach open debate , Representative Homer Hoch of Kansas ( which is threatened with losing a seat ) will make a sharp but probably futile point . He will submit that House seats should be allotted , not on a basis of mass population , but on a basis of the citizens in each State , the voting population . This idea will be hotly fought by California , which stands to gain perhaps six seats in a Reapportionment based on the 1930 census . California 's population , like New York 's , was swelled enormously between the census of 1910 and the restrictive immigration law of 1924 , by immigrants who have not yet ( and in the case of California 's Orientals , never can ) become citizens . <P> Connecticut 's Fenn is a patient , high-minded 72-year-oldster . Homer Hoch of Kansas is an electric , driving " youngster " of 49 . It is not likely that Mr. Fenn will catch the Homer nodding but neither is it likely that the Hoch logic will persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan .
