New Calendar Propgress <P> President George Eastman of the Eastman Kodak Co. last week received replies from the 1,000 businessmen whose opinions he had recently asked on the 13-month calendar he advocates . Practically every one approved the calender . The United States Chamber of Commerce national counselors in conference at West Baden , Ind. , a month ago approved it ; the transportation committee of the League of Nations has approved it . Quite possibly the legislatures of important countries will vote its adoption . Its chief obstacles , apparently , are the customs of various religions . <P> Mr. Eastman 's calender is the device of Moses B. Cotsworth of England . Each month has 28 days , thus : <P> S M T W T F S <P> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <P> 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 <P> 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 <P> 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 <P> Thirteen such months give 364 days . But there are 365.242 days in each year . The 13th month and the extra day and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inserted in the calendar between June and July and called Sol , because during it would come the summer solstice . The full extra day would come at the end of the year and be called International Day , Dec. 29 or Jan. 0 . There remains practically a quarter day , which every four years could be counted an accumulated full day . This would be inserted between June and Sol , as June 29 or Sol 0 . * <P> Putting the Eastman-Cotsworth calendar to use would be best and least confusing in a year when Jan. 1 fell on a Sunday . Such a year will be 1928 , too soon for legislatures to act . However , 1935 also begins on Sunday . <P> <P> *Calendar revisions every few centuries , such as was made in 1582 , will take care of the gradually accumulated thousandths of a solar day .
