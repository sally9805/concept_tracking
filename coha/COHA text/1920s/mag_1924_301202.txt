H. Grindell-Matthews , inventor of a method of controlling motorboats at sea by wireless , for which the British Government awarded him $125,000 , has perfected a principle by which airplane or other engines can be stopped in full operation through an invisible ray . He has demonstrated its efficacy with but a quarter kilowatt of power on engines in the laboratory , and needs only to strengthen its current for operation at a greater distance to bring airplanes in flight to a full stop and send them crashing to earth . No insulation is proof against this weapon , for if the carburetor were sufficiently protected , the ray could be so intensified as to set the wing fabric afire . Said he : " I believe that in the near future machine guns will be found only in museums . " <P> Nikola Tesla , Professor Bergen Davis , Columbia physicist , and other American scientists have been working on similar projects , and believe Grindell-Matthews ' method thoroughly feasible . Practical aviators are inclined to scoff at the idea , but a number of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's invention will be offered to the British Government first , but , if not accepted , then to other nations . The French and German experimenters have not yet reached the efficiency of the Englishman 's machine . It can also be used against infantry , either to kill or disable . <P> Niela Assen , Norwegian inventor in the French service , has developed still another type of war machine , consisting of nests of explosive and gas bombs , operated by radio from a distance . These " mechanical soldiers " could hold a front of several hundred miles against enemy invaders with a small staff of engineers . Mr. Assen expects to present his scheme to the U. S. War Department .
