Late last night , after the departure of wife No. 2 and the broker , policemen were called to the Andrews apartment by tenants in the building who reported a strong odor of ether . Lieutenant Halsey van Horn of the West Montgomery Street Station , accompanied by three detectives . hurried to the apartment . The Lieutenant knocked on the door , and , failing to get a response , the policemen put their shoulders against it , snapping- a chain and smashing a lock . Inside they found the first Mrs. Andrews , pale and frightened and clad in a nightgown . She came out of a front room and demanded to know the meaning of the visit .

Weeping quietly , she said her husband had left Without even a ' ' good-bye , but that , however worried she might be , the thought of suicide " is not in my mind , for I have my two boys to take care of . " Last night Mrs. Maude Augusta Haynes Andrews , forty-two years old , married to Andrews nine years ago in Portland , Me. , and supplanted by Mrs. Esther Marie Tatnall Andrews , twentyfive years old , took action herself . Fortified by instructions of her lawyer , she ousted her husband and the rival wife . Carrying two suit cases . Andrews and the former stenographer from Pittsburgh quit the Hudson Boulevard neighborhood for Newark , leaving the first wife in the apartment with her two sons , John , eight years old , and Harley . six , the latter a cripple .

He added that hb would move for iinmediate extradition . Early yesterday it appeared that the singular chimestie arrangement which had prevailed in the Andrews home since last January would be continued . It was during that month that Andrews had returned home and announced that he had taken a second wife , who was to share the apartment with the first . Take Refuge in Apartment . After he had admitted his double marriage and had promised that he would be able " to explain everything satisfactorily , " Andrews , the two women and the children practically barred themselves in the apartment yesterday . Newspaper men and a throng of curious persons kept watch outside , but Andrews refused to see any one or to answer the telephone . Shortly after 1 o'clock he hurried out of the house and , turning aside questioners , hurried off for Manhattan . " I 'm going to see my attorney , J. J. Lazaroe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if there 's anything to give out he 'll do it at 3:30 o'clock . " While inquiry at Mr. Lazaroe 's office was establishing the fact that the lawyer was " Out of town " and did not expect to discuss the Andrews case in any way , the broker reappeared at his home and went up to his apartment . He hod lost some of his brusqueness , but smilingly refused to talk . Immediately afterward , William Cahill of Michel &; Moore , a real estate operator at 203 Sip Avenue , Jersey City , owner of the apartment house , showed up . He came to tell his tenants that he had decided to ask the Andrewses to " get out . " Cahill went up to the Andrews apartment on the second floor and began to knock . The only response was the strains of a phonograph playing a jazz record , and he finally went away , announcing that dispossess proceedings would be started this morning . Then ensued a period of further inaction  --  the two wives , the husband and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buzzing gossip of the neighborhood . Now and then Andrews , in his shirt sleeves , would approach a windoW and , smoking a cigarette , gaze down on the crowd . Occasionally little John Andrews would put his head out of a window and gaze at the throng . Nobody in the household , said other tenants , appeared to be upset in any way by the revelations . About 3 o'clock a closed automobile arrived in front of the Rensselaer with a broker friend of Andrews at the wheel . John Andrews dashed out of the house , and to the car , holding the door of the auto open . A wait , while the photographers got " set , " then Mrs. Esther Marie Tatnall Andrews came running out . The short , slender , girlish rival wife outLibaneuvered the picture men . She had her ' face completely hidden back of a big shawl and the moment that she got-into the machine she pulled down the curtains and got away . " Just a little ride to get the air , " was the explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews once more was alone with the husband she calls " Daddy , " she did not long remain at home . Directly after the departure of the second wife , another machine appeared and the wife whom Andrews married in Portland was off on a trip of her own . Her trip , it speedily developed , was not for the purpose of getting " the air . " She went to the office of Furst &; Furst , attorneys at 164 Market Street , Newark , and was closeted for almost two hours with George Furst . When she left the lawyer 's office , she had nothing to say , referring all questions to her counsel . " Our firm , " said Mr. Furst , " has been retained by Mrs. Maude Auguste Haynes Andrews . She felt that she was miserable enough without having het troubles aired in the newspapers . MX feels that this is a personal matter and that the public is not Interested in it . " We have been instructed to institute an action for divorce , " he finally admitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . Their will be filed tomorrow . We do not desire to state at this time what further steps we will take to protect the interests of our client . We have advised her to oust Mrs. Esther Marie Tatnall Andrews , which will be done , I do not doubt . " Mr. Furst would not disclose any of the details of the complaint in the action , but it was learned that Mrs. Maude Augusta Haynes Andrews would name her rival ae corespondent and seek $50 a week alimony . During the absence of Wife No. 2 in conference with her attorneys and the motor ride of Wife No . I , a hint came that Prosecutor Pierre P. Garven of Hudson County might take action against Andrews . agains My attention has ' been called to ' the case , ' said Mr. Garven , " and if Andrews has married two - women . he is guilty of bigamy . If he lived with a woman as man and wife without ceremony and has married another , he also is guilty of bigamy .. I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . " If Andrews was married in Connecticut the charge of bigamy is out of our jurisdiction and Andrews can not be prosecuted on such a ' charge . One thing is certain : If evidence is brought to me indicating that he has violated any of the New Jersey laws governing relationships of this sort I will take up the case and prosecute . " The Prosecutor intimated that in the absence of a complaint against the broker he would leave the question of legal proceedings in the hands of the Greenwich authorities , where the second marriage took place . Inquiry at the office of Michel &; Moore established that Andrews had rented . the apartment about eighteen months ago , taking it on a monthly basis , paying $95 rent . According to Mr. Cahill , the broker introduced Mrs. Maude Augusta Haynes Andrews as his wife and submitted references . One of these references , said Mr. Cahill , was from a downtown bank , the name of which he failed to remember , and the other was from a former landlord . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , " the real estate man said , ' and up to the disclosure of this affair we had found them good tenants . There never has been a single complaint from any of the other occupants of the apartment house and we had no reason to believe that anything was wrong . " I remember when this alleged second wife came to live with them . The first I saw of . her was when Mrs. Andrews , that is the first one , came around to pay the month 's rent . She had this blond with her and causally in troduced me to her thus ? " Mr. Cahill , this is my husband 's cousin . I am certain that she referred to her companion as her husband 's counsin . Since that time I have only seen the second woman occasionally . She never appeared to pay the rent and I always regarded her as merely a relative , just as I had been given to understand . " Mr. Cahill 's assertion that no trouble had ever resulted from the Andrews occupancy was borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious of the presence of Mrs. Esther Marie Tatnall Andrews in the home , but all agreed that the household was an exceedhigly quiet one . When the second Mrs. Andrews returned from her ride she left soon after with . Andrews anu it was said they went to ... gewark . According to a tenant , Andrews at one time had been employed by Anderson , Brown &; Co. , brokers , at 39 Broad Street , as an office manager . Investigation established that he had left that firm . shortly after a visit which the first Mrs. Andrews paid to his place of business . Whether , as reported , she told of the existence of another Mrs. Andrews could not be ascertained , but his departure from that office was almost coincident with the visit . Another thing established was the fact that when Andrews married the former Pittsburgh stenographer he was making a success of his own business , largely through the efforts of the first wife . She was represTated as urging him to form H. T. Andrews &; Co. of 20 Broad Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensued before the firm began to prosper . Coupled with Judge Walsh 's statement in Greenwich that he would move to have the Connecticut laws governing bigamy made more strict , was the announcement of members of the Connecticut Legislature that a bill would be introduced within a few days to prevent a recurrence of the Andrews marriage . They pointed out the possibility that the broker might escape prosecution for bigamy , due to the phraseology of the State law , but that he had - apparently committed perjury when he swore before Justice of the Peace O'Neil that he was single . Emphasizing his belief that the Andrews disclosures made imperative a revision of the bigamy statutes , Judge Walsh said that he might take action against several " other persons who have married in Greenwich under similar circumstances . " " I am going to put a stop to such practices , " he said at his home in Greenwich last night , " and I think that Justices of the Peace who marry persons without ascertaining whether they have lived in the State for the stipulated five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
