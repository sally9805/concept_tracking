txt Revolt against President Hareing 's opposition to the bonus , except by a sales tax , has assumed such proportions in Congress as to convince the leaders that a bill Without direct revenue provision will be enacted . The strength of the bonus , forces is so strong , in the opinion of the farm bloc , as to pass a bonus bill which contemplates obtaining the Money from the refunding of the foreign debt , over the President ' . s veto , if necessary . This appears to be the situation to-1 night , following an informal canvass the . farm bloc leaders conducted in favor of the bloc 's bonus program . This program , as announced yesterday in a letter to Chairman Fordney of the Ways and Means Committee , proposes to get the Money for benuseefrom the interest payment by Great Britain on its debt to the United States . The ' first payment , amounting to $125,000,000 , is expected to be made by the middle of net June . Opponents of the bonus are reported to be withdrawing their opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilling to vole for a bonus bill wIpich obtains the revenue from the interest on the foreign debt . They say that if the soldiers are willing to wait until the interest on the foreign debt is received , bonuses then can be paid without increasing the taxes here ' or injuring business . Now the Most Vital Issue . Agitation over bonus legislation , an issue that now uncompromisingly divides the Republican Party and brings the President and the House into sharp conflict , appears as the most vital clues- ' , tion on the political horizon . There is More interest in its solution by the Republican leaders than exists as to tariff legislation . The pressure for the bonus , said a Re-. publican leader , comes chiefly from that great bulk of first turners in the Republican Party who were swept into office by the overwhelming majority ' . in 1920 . They have had no experience in government , he pointed out , and , lacking-any sense of responsibility such as comes from service , are now devoting their entire energy to a bonus bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets . The greatest trouble in the Republican Party today , one of its veteran leaders said to THE : NEW YORK TIMES , comes from the large and irresponsible majority , part of it swayed by selfish interest . Ile said that this majority had attached itself to the farm bloc and had compelled the enactment of legislation without regard to the national interest . Until the majority is reduced and the inexperienced in Congress eliminated , this leader stated , there is no bops of sanity in legislation , so much needed at this time . In the opinion of this analyst , there will be a bonus bill sent to the President which may be vetoed because it will meet with the announced views of ' the President that the only way to raise revenues for bonus ' payments at ' this time is through a sales tax . It is : clow apparent that such a tax will not e accepted by the House . The farm bloc successfully heading its battle now for the payment of bonuses out of the ' refunding of the foreign debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavering policy of the Republican Party , emphasized in the bonus struggle , is typical of conditions existing as to other major measures . The Republican Party is without leadership or team work between the legislative and executive branches . As the result of this , it is pointed out , the special session devoted itself entirely to a program dictated by the farm bloc and enacted a revenue bill that did not fulfill the platform pledges . , . In the first session of the Sixty-seventh Congress the lack of leadership , became more pronounced . - With the death of Senator Penrose the last of the so-called leaders passed , but even Mr. Penrose saw his power passing . He was too sick to resist the onrush or the new movement ? government by groups , dictated by committees and organizations of farmers and other elements in the community . The war produced new conditions . The farmers formed strong national organizations . These organizations helped to elect the new Congress and the new members , instead of submitting to party leaders , accepted the judgment of the organizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vowerful farm bloc , which has swep side party fealty and lessened the innluence of the leaders and even the prestige that Presidents have had over Congress In the last twenty years . The beginning of the Harding Administration , in the opinion of Republicans - seleispg an explanation of the situation1 marked the transition from leaders and party control of legislative policies to control exercised by groups , dictated by outside committees and organizations . Appeals made to party allegiance have failed til times of crises . Congress is no longer controlled by the heads of big committees , responsible to party organization . if . Ezpeet Ship SubsIdy Trouble . Without this control it has been found impossible to enact measures promised in the platform . Failures have fol. 1 , owed efforts to enact party policies . Instead of achievements , this and the special session stand out patently with a record of failures . The Revenue bill is one instance . Another is the delay and uncertainty as to a tariff policy . These are perhaps the two most important measures from a Republican Party point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the already pressing party troubles . Before the party goes to its first national test since November , W20 , in the election next November , there will he another issue to divide the party and heighten its difficulties in the Ship Subsidy bill which President Harding will place before Congress shortly . There seems to be little hope that the situation respecting tariff , bonus and ship subsidy will improve . Present indications point to the passage of a bonus bill without revenue provision , a tariff 1 bill containing a modified American valtiiition plan and defeat of the ship subsidy proposal . There is no leadership in Congress and no hope of its arising in this session . President Harding 's influence , it is dedared , is not much greater than that of the nominal leaders , as evidenced In the present attitude of the House on bonus and in the special session of Congress as to the higher surtax  --  fenture of the revenue bill . One Republican Senator ex.pressed the opinion that all the party can do in the face of the farm blot. , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hoping that this group will be destroyed in the November eidetic% '
