txt Will Rogers Has His Say About Theatre Seat Prices To the Editor of The New York Times . The old year went out tonight through the necks of millions of bottles . It 's a good thing the drys won at the last election . New York could n't a carried any more . There 's not an idle flask in the city tonight . If they would just give the poor the empty bottles and let ' em sell ' em there would be no poverty for a year . Our musical shows are getting $11 a seat tonight . That 's box office prices , and one patron was able to get on at that price at the box office , and dropped dead with amazement before he could get to it . It would take Coolidge , Smith and Hoover playing the Three Musketeers in Yiddish to be worth $11 . Yours , WILL ROGERS . P. S. ? If the Democrats had listened to me and not entered a ticket at all this year , they would have been celebrating too tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
