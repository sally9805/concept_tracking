The Soviet Government has a hard row to hoe . The sum total of the Communist Party is only an infinitesimal part of the Russian population , who , may it be said , give the Bolsheviki more trouble than is generally supposed . The Government has another task hardly less difficult : the efficient governing of Russia . This requires money . One way of getting it is by the sequestration of church property . <P> Thus , the latest horror of the Bolshevik regime is the trial of Archbishop Zepliak and 15 other priests of the Roman Catholic Church . The case for the prosecution is that the priests occasioned the use of violence by resisting Soviet agents in the course of their duty , which was to confiscate church property . The defense is that the church treasures neither belong to the Roman Catholic Church in Russia nor to the Russian people , but to the Church in Rome . <P> In the course of the trial testimony was given that a priest had protected a cupboard containing valuables with his body , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body can you get to the vessels . " It also transpired that the Pope had authorized resistance to the Bolshevik regime , stating that the Soviet regulations were unacceptable . Archbishop Zepliak admitted issuing circulars denying that the Government had authority over the Church ; but he declared that he did not carry on anti-Soviet propaganda .
