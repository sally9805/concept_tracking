Partisans of Candidate Hoover last week publicly began what is to be a national indoor and outdoor sport for the next three months-delegate-counting . Of the 1,089 Republicans who assemble in June at Kansas City , a simple majority of 545 are all that will be required to nominate . But such simple majorities are seldom arrived at without preliminary complications . What with Favorite Sons and Uninstruction and the wishful valor of Candidate Lowden 's friends , the height of Hoover optimism last week was 414 delegates , or 131 shy . And of these 414 , only 45 were on-the-dotted-line , there having been up to last week only seven State conventions and one primary election . <P> The one election-first whisper of vox populi-was in New Hampshire . Only 11 delegates were involved , but all came out instructed for or partial to Candidate Hoover . Senator Moses , a charter subscriber to Hooverism , polled the highest vote . One Everett R. Rutter , the sole would-be-delegate in favor of Calvin Coolidge , was defeated . Only four years ago when Senator Moses refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political defeat of his astute career . <P> Though the New Hampshire result was no more significant than any other accident of geography and the calendar ; and although only 17 States hold primary elections ; leaving popular choice elsewhere in the hands of convention floorwalkers ; and although the next pronouncement of - vox populi , in North Dakota , was scheduled to be unanimously in favor of Candidate Lowden , still the first actual balloting in the 1928 election had gone Hoover . Voters talked about it in other States and told each other what they knew about the Republican party 's man-of-all-work whose friends now think he should be , as they call him at the Department of Commerce , " the Chief . " <P> Life . Most people know that he was born in Iowa , son of a Quaker blacksmith ; that he is chunky , round-faced , about six feet high , with beaverish shoulders and neck and with greying hair , much thinner and less brushed down than it used to be , and with his teeth chewed down to a peculiar slant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This feature repeats his beaverish aspect which is , of course , enhanced most of all by his well-earned reputation for patient industry and again , perhaps , by his familiarity with rivers and dams and husbanding food through lean seasons . Any man of distinctive personality and appearance resembles some animal . Senator Borah is a bear ; Secretary Mellon , an aging horse of fine blood ; Senator Heflin , an astounding whale calf ; Senator Johnson , a caged lion ; Senator Norris , an owl ; Senator Watson , a roguish elephant ; Charles Evans Hughes , a lofty mountain goat ; Will H. Hays , a monkey ; Curtis Dwight Wilbur , a stork . Herbert Clark Hoover is a beaver-man , aged 53 , in his prime .
