T HE Drifter is proud to confess that he has friends in prison . Not long ago he went to see one of them , a victim of the anti-red hysteria . He was ushered in to wait his friend 's coming in the great center room around which the cell blocks rise , tier on tier . The wait was rather long . Seated around the dull gray room , gray-clad prisoners talked in low tones with friends ; hard-featured keepers came and went ; one suaver than the rest escorted a cheerful crowd of sightseers on a personally conducted tour of one of democracy 's famous institutions . The air was the sort found only in prisons  --  lifeless , touched with a smell of disinfectant , fit only to nurture gray and pallid men . Not , surely , the kind of air best suited to cure sick souls . WHEN the prisoner arrived he did not complain , he had not lost hope , his eyes were clear . Though he lives and works under the silence rule except for brief periods of recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events and ideas . He talked of school , of the books he was reading , of his progress in English ; but more eagerly he talked of what the workers were doing . The Drifter asked if he ever read The Nation . " Sometimes , " was the answer , " and I should like to see it regularly . " The Drifter offered to send it to him . " Better ask the Warden first , " his friend advised . So when his visit was over the Drifter sought out the Warden , who looked  --  well , let us say like a warden and let it go at that . The following conversation ensued : THE DRIFTER : What is your rule about admitting magazines to prisoners ? WARDEN : We let them in if they are all right . DRIFTER : I see . May I ask if The Nation is all right ? I should like to send it to my friend . WARDEN : I do n't know . We 'd have to look it over be-fore we decide . DRIFTER : Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't let socialism get in here . Is The Nation socialist ? DRIFTER : My friend the Editor says not . But what do you mean by socialist and what harm can it do ? WARDEN : A lot . We ca n't have anarchy in here . DRIFTER : But I thought you said you were looking for socialism ? WARDEN : DRIFTER : WARDEN : DRIFTER : WARDEN : you 'd better not send The Nation . DRIFTER : But I told you it was not a socialist paper . WARDEN ( changing tone ) : Well , send it along if you want to Maybe it 's here now . We have thirty papers in our library . THE Drifter still regrets that he did not see the thirty papers , but by the time the conversation was over he had reached the office door and was soon outside He consoled himself by thinking that he could get his friend the Editor to try The Nation on the chaplain . Thus thinking he walked out . When he looked up he saw Bunker Hill Monument . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATION : SIR Referring to the enumeration , in Mr. Villard 's article of November 8 , of the several classes of advertising excluded from the Christian Science Monitor , I am inclined to believe that that excellent newspaper 's standard is not quite so severe as he paints it . The Monitor of November 10 contained the following display advertisement : SLIM-LIMB HOSIERY The " Bryn Mawr , " a new type of silk hosiery for women that fills a long-felt need for a stocking that is as slender through the leg as a misses ' stocking , but has the length of a woman 's stocking . Evidently , the Monitor 's scruples are not so inflexible as to block the relief of this particular " long-felt need " of the Boston ladies . Out our way , I gratefully beg to report , the architecture of the feminine extremities is less rectilinear . Berkeley , California , November 18 A. T. PUTNAM " Mr. Lloyd George 's New War " To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In your recent editorial , Mr. Lloyd George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " We discover that even the Allies have never proposed excluding the Turk from Europe . From the beginning they have recognized that Constantinople and Eastern Thrace are in fact Turkish . " Just before our Government declared war , a request went to the Allies to state their war aims . The reply , written by a Frenchman for the Allies , dated January 10 , 1917 , included the following : " The enfranchisement of populations subject to the bloody tyranny of the Turks and the expulsion from Europe of the Ottoman Empire , decidedly alien to Western civilization . " Even at the Peace Conference at Paris Constantinople was not recognized as Turkish and the agreement was to establish an international state of Constantinople . It was not until the Treaty of Sevres was signed in 1920 that the decision was reached to give Constantinople back to the Turks and that decision included not all of Eastern Thrace but only a very small portion of it 2 . It was not British military and naval pressure at Constantinople which forced the Turkish Government at Constantinople to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the signing of that treaty were spoken by a Frenchman , M. Millerand . He said : " It would neither be just nor would it conduce to lasting peace in the Near and Middle East that large masses of non-Turkish nationality should be forced to remain under Turkish rule . " 3 There is no evidence to my knowledge that the British Government subsidized the Greeks to fight the Nationalist Turks , and spokesmen for the British Government have definitely stated that no aid was given by that Government in any way to the Greeks 4 It seems to me that your readers should know that back in the days of the Peace Conference , when Orlando had furiously withdrawn and there was danger that the Italians would seize Smyrna in accordance with a treaty made during the war , Lloyd George , Clemenceau , and President Wilson joined in requesting Venizelos to rush troops into Smyrna , because it had already been agre ed that the Greeks were to have the Smyrna area . After the Italian menace passed , the French saw the Greek menace rising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Rome " might be reestablished at Constantinople , and French jealousy of British success in Constantinople led France to try to establish its influence in Angora
