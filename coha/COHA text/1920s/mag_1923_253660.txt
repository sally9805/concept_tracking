Georges Desvallieres , famous French painter , here to serve on the jury of the Carnegie International Exhibition , does not believe that America has yet found a " master artist . " Says he : " The works of Americans that I have seen . . . in your museums . . . seem to have been done to please the amateur . The soul of America is not yet expressed . " <P> The proportion of expatriates among our great artists would partially explain this . Whistler ( quarrelsome cosmopolite ) , Mary Cassatt ( grande dame in Paris ) , John Sargent ( brilliant and fashionable London portrait painter ) are three of our greatest figures-but hardly expressive of America . <P> Fortunately the situation has been changing . Many critics , here and abroad , point out signs of a genuine " American school . " Hope is placed in the younger painters , particularly Sheeler , Demuth , Marin . John Marin , modernistic interpreter of the sea , is thought by the more radical to be the most considerable force in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Desvallieres is a religious patriot . His finest recent work is a Crucifixion . During the war he served as major with the picked Chasseurs Alpins , though he was 50 years old . He thinks " some great crisis " which evokes religious feeling in its broadest sense will be necessary to call forth in stone or paint the " spirit of your people . " <P> His words are true to this extent : none of our great painters ( even those who stay at home ) have done for America what Rembrandt did for Holland ; Da Vinci , for Italy ; Hiroshige , for Japan ; Drer , for Germany .
