txt Although some steel interests have been asserting that the prospects for fall business are qu-te uncertain , this view is not held in leading trade circles . Leading authorities believe that there will be an excellent demand for variou. , - steel products before the end of the year , because manufacturing activities are expected ta continue on a high scale . Railroads should become large buyers of rails and equipment in the coming months . Already there have been inquiries for rails and same accessories . In some instances , carriers Lave requested that deliveries on the small tonnages of track be made before the end of the year . so- that this buying generally is viewea ns the eecondary rail movement of the current year . Within six to eight weeks there will be active inquiries for rails from the leading roads or their 1930 requirements . The Chesapeake &; ( Thin has Just come into market for 50.000 tons . ft is probable the tonnages taken by the larger systems wil ! be in excess of the 1929 total . Thi.s year . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails on which deliveries now arc being made . In view of the c.:Intinued gains in earnings , replacements of mils next year should be exceptionally large . Equipment Inquiries After a lull in the demand for equipment there has been a resumption of activity on the part of the railroads . An order for 1,250 cars was distributed recently by the Delaware . Lackawanna &; Western , and a later inquiry calls for 2,000 cars for the : Norfolk &; Western . The latter also has asked for offers for steel to repair 1,000 cars at its own shops . Cars and locomotives of the leafing systems were - pushed to such an extent in handling freight traffic during the past year that repairs and replacements should be extensive . With earnings running so satisfactorily , the managements of the carriers are more apt to place orders than if revenues were inclined to decline slrg htly . Should the expected buying of rails , cars and locomotives materialize to the extent now anticipated in steel trade quarters . it would be significant of the confidence of rail authorities regarding the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory , the roads would be slow to place large orders for various materials . Tendency of the railroad managements , therefore , will be watched with great interestMixed conditions are reported from steel trade centres . In Pittsburgh there has been some let-up in specifications against contracts . On the other hand . advices from companies in the Chicago territory are that specifying has been increasing moderately from day to day recently and there is considerable confidence in the Middle West regarding the immediate outlook . Operations also tire irregular , with Chicago reporting great activity , near theoretical capacity , while other sections have been curtailing . ' Of course , this is due to local conditions or to the fact that certain sections supply industries which have not been particularly active in the past month or two . Taken as a whole , however , steel production has been continued at a much higher rate than was anticipated earlier in the year . In the southern territory , mills are operating to fill the day-to-day shipping requests , but there is no active buying in t'at section . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the weakness in southern pig iron in recent months . Structural Demand Large Demand for structural steel has continued on a large scale . and while there may be sonic let-up in the new orders during the mid winter months , there are so ninny projects pending ' that the leading interests are anticipating a good general run of business over the next s .. to eight months at least . Sheet steel has been affected by the lersened demand from the automobile matters . Some sheet interests are now able to give practically prompt shipment on new busines.i , in'ticat'ng they have caught up with the backlog of orders reporfed a few months ago . It is still the opinion in middle western steel circles that there will he steady improvement in buying by the motor car industry before thc end of the .... ear . New models have been well cceived and many of the larger companies are planning to change their models before tbe beginn.ng of 1930 . This , in Itself , would reduce steel demand for a time , but when production is started on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp increase in the consumption of steel . with sheets feeling the improvement to a greater extent than many other products . Of vast interest has been the situation in pig iron . Sales have been large in all the Middle Atlantic and New E ' .. ngland sections , and the influence of the weakness in the South has not been felt to any great extent . Earlier , when the South first reported the unsatisfactory situation , it was feared that the pig iron market in all districts would be affected adversely , but aside from a momentary period of caution , there has been no unsettlement elsewhere . Scrap steel is holding well . Many interests outside the steel industry still consider scrap a barometer on the steel industry . Therefore , any decided weakness in scrap in the past was looked on as forecasting less favorable conditions in finished steel products . The unusually heavy production of steel , which has been maintained for the first eight months of this year , naturally resulted in a good demand for scrap , for old material is needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various districts in recent months have been due to the market position of scrap dealers rather than to any internal market factor .
