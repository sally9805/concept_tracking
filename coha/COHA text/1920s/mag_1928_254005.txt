Strangler Lewis and Joe Stecher , a farmer boy who once made a mule lose consciousness by locking its ribs in a scissors hold , met on a mat in St. Louis and pulled at each other 's heads for one hour while a sleepy newspaper man snored loudly somewhere near them . After a while Lewis put Stecher down , then put him down again , winning the world 's heavyweight wrestling championship .
