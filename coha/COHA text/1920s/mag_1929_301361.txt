When he speculated upon the most common of all human pastimes , Talking , it appeared to Milton ( " Dance Marathon " ) Crandall that the purpose of this sport was to see who could talk the longest . Accordingly he announced a " noun and verb rodeo , the world 's championship gab-fest , " and set up a ticket-taker at the gate of an armory in Manhattan . <P> Inside the armory , last week , were 36 characters , all making noises with their mouths . The contest was to last 81 hours , 45 minutes . To the talker who talked most in that time , Promoter Crandall would give $1,000 . <P> Each contestant was on a low small platform in front of a sleeping-tent . Spectators could stroll among the platforms and , if they chose , interrupt the contestants ' squeaks and moans , their reading aloud , mumbling , gibbering , singing . <P> The competitors were characters widely diverse in aspect : Captain Smoke , a hermit ; Jean Cabell O'Neill , " a very famous pen-woman " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Bible ; an Indian Chief named Hawk , who made dirty drawings ; a charming Mexican girl who sang the sad dance songs of her country , accompanying herself on the piano in the middle of the arena . <P> When the boring competition ended , Betty Wilson , a swimmer , and Howard Williams , a steeplejack and flagpole sitter , were tied for first prize . Promoter Crandall suggested that they talk off the tie . The gab fest cost Promoter Crandall $12,000 and he derived no financial profit from his game .
