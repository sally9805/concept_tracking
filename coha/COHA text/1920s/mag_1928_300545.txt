THE CABINET <P> About 38 years ago , a young man from Vermilion County , Ill. , just graduated from DePauw University , went up to Chicago to practice law . He was a stocky , cheery , vigorous lad and got along very well . Before long he met one of the bright young men who had been associated down East with Thomas Edison in his electric-lighting companies . This young man , a short , brisk little Britisher named Samuel Insull , organized a Chicago Edison Company . The lawyer from Vermilion County , whose name was Roy Owen West , became Mr. Insull 's attorney and put some money into the company . When Mr. Insull later organized a Middle West Utilities Company , Mr. West invested in that too . So did his wife and mother . All prospered . <P> Lawyer West , good mixer that he was , drifted naturally into politics . He became State chairman , then national secretary of the G. O. P. , retaining his good law practice and investments the while . Samuel Insull , astute businessman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midwest . When government regulation of public utilities was found necessary , Mr. Insull also drifted naturally into politics , in the role of large contributor to campaign funds . Illinois is a Republican State so Mr. Insull gave chiefly to Lawyer West 's party , though when he was quizzed two years ago about contributing heavily to help Commerce Commissioner Frank Leslie Smith of Illinois get nominated and elected to the U. S. Senate , he was able to show that he had given also to the Democrats . Nevertheless , when Senator-Suspect Smith was rejected by the Senate last year , Mr. Insull shared his embarrassment . <P> After Secretary of Commerce Hoover was nominated by the G. O. P. and Secretary of the Interior Work resigned to manage the campaign , President Coolidge looked around for a new Secretary of the Interior and chose Lawyer West . <P> Since the Secretary of the Interior is ex-officio a member of the Federal Power Commission , it came to pass that Mr. Insull 's lawyer , long a stockholder in the Middle West Utilities Co. , sat last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply for a licence to exploit the Cumberland Falls on the Cumberland River in Kentucky . And so it was , in view of his Insull connection and of the Insull part in a political deal which the Senate has condemned , that many a Senator was grumbling about Secretary West 's appointment , which President Coolidge last week asked the Senate to confirm . Honest man though Secretary West may be , his past affiliations and investments could not have been more provoking to Senatorial sensibilities . In an atmosphere still surcharged with the Interior Department ( oil ) scandals of the Harding era and lately recharged by outcries against the so-called Power Trust , it looked very much as though Secretary West 's appointment would not be confirmed . <P> The Senate referred the case to its Committee on Public Lands , which straightway asked Secretary West to appear for a questioning .
