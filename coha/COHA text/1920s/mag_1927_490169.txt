WE earnestly hope that Mr. Walker will not be dismayed by the condition in which he finds the city and conclude that he has returned too early . He will naturally be perturbed , for instance , at the fact that it is practically impossible to get around town because most of the important streets are torn up , and a succession of things like that is bound to threaten the freshened enthusiasm of anyone returning from a vacation . It is sufficient to make one irritable and cross . Had the Mayor remained abroad another month or six weeks some of these annoyances might have been removed and the way made clearer for all the new municipal problems the Mayor probably gathered during his studies abroad . We know how we feel getting back to the office full of new ideas and finding a lot of things we had started still unfinished . T has been not quite a year now since one of our brave daily newspapers stood at Armageddon and battled , in a long series of articles , against the fiendish racket made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when this was called to the attention of the police they courteously consented to join in the campaign . Letters of warning were sent out , traffic officers put their fingers to their lips and raised their eyebrows when trucks whistled at them , get-togethers were held with trucking company officials , and a few arrests were made . The result of all this , we gather as we get about town , is that there has been no alarming increase in truck exhaust whistles . There are , as a matter of fact , scarcely more than there were when the campaign of education started . This is heartening . ALL these city noises make scatter-wits of most of us . However tenderly we nurse a thought , before it can take root it has been literally tooted and honked and banged out of our bonnet . There is a piquant company , we note , that manufactures little ear plugs which a person can stuff against his tympana to still the awful clamor of Life . But somehow we are chary of so monastic a measure  --  suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one single vagrant note of pure beauty striking through the roar : the peal of sA 1 ' I 0 a tower bell , the turtle-voice of a ferry in the River , the tinkle of a girl 's laugh in a crowd ! No , we shall use plugs only against the social bore who discusses her Unconscious . WHAT Mr. Coolidge will do if WHA does n't run again is engaging the attention of political commentators . We note the prophecy that he will accept membership in a New York law firm . Our impression of New York law firms is that they are places of Doric simplicity , not at all suited to the whimsical temperament of our President . Realizing , however , that Mr. Coolidge is a force in American life that must not be allowed to peter out , we have been looking around . It seems to us that we have found just the line of endeavor for him . It is the diplomatic service . There are a number of posts in tropical regions usually looked upon with disfavor , a feeling which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would certainly not share . The service needs brave men who will ignore the perils of fever and dullness in the high promise 4 ? of wearing a bone necklace and a silk hat . Art GREENWICH VILLAGE has its substantial , conservative element , too , among which is a delicatessen merchant in Sixth Avenue . He is also a bit of a philosopher . " Dese people , " he has confided , " make me sick . What they eat ? ? marrons in syrup , which should n't keep ' em alive five minutes . Dat last fella , he 's a poet . It 's no trade to speak of , poetry . I have cashed checks for seventy-five cents for dat fella . On de street he would n't notice me . I am not art . What is this art business , anyway ? They tell me dese Village people have brains . Ha , they ai n't got enough to live on . Me , I got a fine house in Tersey and a car . " For the benefit of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while on the subject of Greenwich Village , that a prominent restaurant in Eighth Street which used to serve Sunday breakfast from 10 A.M. to 3 P.m. now advertises that it serves the same repast until 5 P.M. Episode L'VEN among the elders we see .... so little of the old-fashioned fastidiousness nowadays that we were attracted by an incident in East Seventy-fifth Street last week . We saw a white-haired gentleman approach two boys who were playing with a kitten , and join them . Then we saw him extract from his pocket a pair of gloves , return one of them , and pull the other carefully on his right hand . This completed , he employed his gloved hand to pat the kitten and tickle its ribs for a minute or two . He then arose , carefully removed his glove , replaced it in his pocket , bowed to the two boys and strolled on . Self - Served XVACATIONIST from Bat Harbor tells us that on the pies there , while a dozen passengers were waiting for the ferry to take them to the New York express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . Finally someone reported that he was busy in the saloon , arranging the baggage of the E. B. McLeans , of Washington . The rest of the travellerscould only accept this special attention to such eminent personages and carry their own things aboard . A gentleman in a quiet gray suit , accompanied by two boys , waited longer than the others , for he had an unusually large assortment of bags , but eventually he too shouldered his own burdens and struggled aboard with them . When the porter finally appeared , he realized that in his devotion to what he thought would he the most distinguished passengers he had overlooked a likely candidate , John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Wagers HAVING often wondered what goes on in a Wall Street betting commissioner 's office , we looked in on one the afternoon of the fight Last week . Four rooms on the eighth floor of a building in Broad Street were crowded . It proved to be the biggest day since the Harding-Cox presidential campaign , which , we were told , established the highest total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to frequent telephone inquiries , " Even money wanted , thirteen to eleven offered . " A dozen of those present in person held rolls of bills in their hands . Men with hats on the backs of their heads bobbed about . Long-distance calls came in from Chicago , Washington , St. Louis . Telegrams were delivered every few moments . One was from Argentina authorizing a stake an Dempsey . We heard an elderly gentleman inquire about a bet of two thousand dollars on Tunney . He walked out when he was asked to give eight to five . A young chap with a cap over his eye succeeded in placing ten dollars on Dempsey at even money . We were told the firm had handled two hundred thousand dollars during the day . Most of the bets were of two , five and ten thousand dollars . The largest was on Tunney , twenty-four thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars . The commissioners get five per cent of the money put up , the wagers being recorded by a policy form of agreement , in duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeats Dempsey , I agree to pay , etc. " and thus somehow evades the statute against betting . Even money offers on the fight started in Chicago , it seems , largely because of rumors that it was fixed for the challenger . Even money in New York was scarce , however , and during the afternoon the odds in this broker 's office favored Tunney . There are three or four prominent Wall Street betting commissioners . Their odds ( widely at variance on the late fight ) are quoted in the newspapers and thereby establish what is known as " the odds in Wall Street . " Private bets about town are generally based on them . Estimates of experts fixed the total bets on the recent fight at more than two million dollars in this city . THE betting commissioners deal in all sorts of events . Several bets of one to three that Fonck would fly the Atlantic were made last year . His failure caused a temporary lack of interest in aviation and the Lindbergh flight found the sportsmen cold . When he landed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Byrd. attempt . We were interested to hear that many bets are now being offered by early birds at one to three that Hughes will be the Republican nominee for President . One bet , of one to six , is that he will be the next Presidem . English sportsmen supported their polo ream heavily , sending the odds from two to one down to six to five on America . Much money is always hazarded on world 's series , and on football . Little is placed on tennis , and less on golf . Bets have been offered frequently on the outcome of murder trials , notably the Leopold-Loeb , the Snyder and the Hall-Mills cases , but we were advised that commissioners class these as " morbid " and discourage them . One of the most interesting betting houses is that of W. L. Darnell &; Co . It was founded twenty years ago by Bill Darnell , a gentleman from Wyoming who always wore a huge Stetson hat and boasted that he had made and lost more fortunes than any man in the Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on under the old name by three brothers named Silinski . Missing THE latest story of the gentle old ladies who get confused by the swirl of sporting events concerns one who was anxious to see Mr. Tilden play . She had seen him on the stage and thought him a nice boy . So she went to the finals at Forest Hills . When Lacoste won the first set she was greatly put out . This , however , was n't her greatest disappointment at the match . During the second set she turned to her son-in-law and inquired , " Are n't they going to use the horses at all ? " Honored WHEN the French tennis players WHEN incidentally , they left one American richer in experience for their having visited the United States . This is a chap who has long known Lacoste and saw much of him while he was here . He was invited to go to the pier with the Latin players the day that their captain , M. Gillou , and others left for home . The trip was made in several automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American undertook to excuse himself , explaining that he had to hurry to his office . Lacoste suggested that , since there was now a surplus of cars , he use one of them for his return . He accepted , climbed into an HispanoSuiza and gave his address to the chauffeur . His car started first , the others following , the honking four motorcycle men still clearing a path through the traffic At Washington Square the three rear cars turned off to take Lacoste and his companions to their hotel . The American 's car proceeded up Fifth Avenue . To his dismay so did the motorcycle policemen  --  all four of them . In this rather awkward situation the passenger decided it would be more tactful to say nothing about the mistake ; and he was escorted all the way uptown to his office , before which he drew up with a great flourish . Since then , he reports , there has been a new note of respect throughout his organization as well as in his club , for two members were brusquely waved aside by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the window as he passed . Another Estimate A GENTLEMAN who attended A the Dempsey-Tunney fight and had wagered two thousand dollars on ? the champion ( more than he could afford to lose ) told us upon his return last Saturday that reports as to how long Mr. Tunney remained on the floor are all erroneous . Unlike most of the champion 's supporters , however , he did not claim that the time was less than twelve to fourteen seconds . " It seemed to me , " he said , " about two minutes . " Unsung AN expert polo player of whom the public has never heard has been brought to our attention , a somewhat romantic figure in the background of ? high-goal International and American play . He plays frequently with the great , but never before paying galleries , and Hitchcock knows what it means in effort and skill to outmaneuver him . They say that if he were rated he would qualify as a six-goal man . Only eighteen players in the country rate higher than that this year . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rated is that he is a negro . Tredwell , who is known to all the stars as Fred , is a little past thirty . He grew up among ponies and players . His father worked for William Post , the Williston horse dealer . Young Teed-well was born on the place and learned to ride very young . Now he is considered one of the finest horsemen in the East . He is often used by his employer to demonstrate a particularly difficult mount . He began to play polo in practice and pick-up games and , by filling in when an extra man was needed , had soon played with all the great stars . They recognize him as an exceptional player but they do not know his full potentialities because , restrained by consciousness of his race , he has never mixed it as roughly or as openly as the others . Quiet , gentlemanly , soft spoken , he is generally popular . He always plays at back , and his work at this post , which is 11,1i1- burn 's , has attracted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies and polo is religion . He is a deacon in his church . He will be seen exhibiting mounts , incidentally , at the auction of the British string at the close of the Open championship . Alarm ONE of the most pathetic of recent happenings has to do with a gentleman who gave up a charming apartment on East Fiftieth Street on account of its proximity to a fire-house . Several times nightly he was disturbed by the engines clanging back and forth , and finally he determined to escape . After long consideration he moved to a blind alley on the East River . Safe at last , he thought . For the benefit of others who have had this impulse and who may think this step was a solution , we chronicle the fact that the gentleman made a mistake . He discovered , not only that fireboats are noisier than engines , but that all nearby craft start whistling when they pass . He has moved back to Fiftieth Street . Night Life Pr HOSE sprawling blocks of prod- - 1-  uce stores , centring about Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found worth a visit late at night . It is only after midnight , in fact , that Washington Market comes to life . The whole district is known as Washington Market , although technically the market occupies but one building . Motor trucks and horse-drawn wagons begin to trail in about eleven o'clock , both from the city and as far as Kingston and Montauk , from Harlem and Wallahout markets and from shipping concerns in other cities . At midnight the speedy " mushroom express " cars from the mushroom cellars in Westchester roll in , great black trucks loaded with their valuable cargoes . Washington Market supplies New York City , much of New York State , Connecticut and New Jersey , and all of Long Island . Goods are piled , high along the walk before the stores . Wholesalers , jobbers , restaurant men throng the streets examining the one box of each lot open for their inspection . There are no guards , and nothing , they say , is ever stolen This because it has never been the custom to arrest thieves Instead they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no bickering nor bargaining . The commission merchant does not praise his wares . He merely waits until the buyer asks the price . The sale is a simple transaction . All purchases are in cash . Prices , we were interested to note , are quoted as a rule in shillings , meaning twelve and a half cents . No one seems to know where this originated or why it continues . Produce from the West comes on car floats from the Jersey yard to Piers 19 and 21 . Only accredited members of the Produce Exchange are permitted on the piers . No sale there is less than a carload lot , and generally it is of from five to twenty carloads . MANY men , beginning humbly , have made fortunes in Washington Market . Notable among them is Max Leef , the cantaloupe and honeydew melon king . He has made about a million dollars . Coming here from Galicia as a boy , he began with a fruit pushcart on the East Side , next renting a shop for twelve dollars a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his store space . This summer he handled more than a million cases of melons , and three-fourths of the city 's supply passes through his hands . Most of the Colorado and California growers ship direct to him . His yearly turnover is about $5,000 , - 000 . Despite this he is still to be seen about , every night , wearing a soiled coat and an old straw hat , superintending shipments . ' Toward dawn the thrifty housewife may pick up bargains , a crate of a dozen alligator pears for two dollars , for instance , that would cost five or six at retail . There are bargains in fresh figs and nectarines , watermelons , Persian cantaloupes or South African grapes . The market lacks the genial air of Les Halles in Paris and slumming parties are likely to call forth only jibes from rough characters . Also , there are only dingy white-tiled lunch rooms crowded with market helpers . By seven o'clock in the ? morning the market is again a drowsy line of ugly buildings . Armistice N engaging incident is reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of Fourteenth Street and Seventh Avenue late one night when the traffic signals brought to a halt the few taxis that were awheel then . Nothing is funnier , says our observer , than the sight of a handful of cars silently waiting for cross traffic that does n't exist . Just at this solemn lull , a gay and festive gentleman decided he was too unsteady to walk home and hence hailed , from the centre of the street , the line-up of cabs . There was no response . The gentleman pondered the remarkable fact that the world had suddenly come to a dead halt ; then he took off his hat , held it reverently against his shoulder , and observed two minutes of silence with the rest .
