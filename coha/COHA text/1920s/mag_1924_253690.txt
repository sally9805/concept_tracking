THE BOY 'S OWN BOOK OF POLITICS-Wm . G. Shepherd- Macmillan ( $2.00 ) . <P> Has any old fellow got mixed with the boys ( ages 12-15 ) ? If so , it may be worth his while to stay . He may find the proceedings a bit naive and the vocabulary limited but he may pick up some information- information of the rudimentary kind . He can find out , if he needs to , Why Are Political Parties ? , How Men Get into Politics , Who Picks Your Candidate ? , What Is a Political Boss ? ( Chapter headings . ) Much sound primary knowledge is included , combined with exhortation to good citizenship . Probably the easiest way to get the information is to give it to " Junior " and let him stump you with questions .
