Mister Muggsy JOHN McGRAW is baseball . He is the incar- nation of the American national sport . In his personality he reflects everything there is of the game from the street kid , indulging in the pavement pastime of simultaneously dodging trucks and catching flies , on up to the ponderous and precious Babe Ruth ; everything from the sand lot with tin cans for bases on up to the garish magnificence of the Polo Grounds ; everything from the difference of opinion about an umpire 's decision , settled with swinging bats and punching fists , to the dispute decided by the ballyhoo boy of base ball , that white-haired fifty-thousand dollar front , ex-federal Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis . If you can understand baseball you can understand John McGraw . But , of course , if you could understand baseball there would n't be any baseball . Probably , too , if you could understand the pudgy , irascible , loyal , double-crossing , sentimental , stony-hearted , stingy , generous , stupid , brilliant , manager and vice president of the New York Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother your brains in the attempt to annihilate him by making him out . That 's been tried by experts and it ca n't be done . McGraw will fight if you call him Muggsy . If you do n't call him Muggsy he 'll find some other reason for fighting . If no reason for fighting is to be found he 'll fight anyhow . He fights as persistently and unsuccessfully as Bryan pursues political power . Someone , ? Tad , the cartoonist I think it was  --  once said of him : " He 's got bunions on his back from bouncing off bar-room floors . " Pugilistically he 's always ready to go , but he never gets anywhere . He seems to have the heart of a hungry wildcat and the claws of a tame rabbit . Willing but weak ! A helpful hint to a partial analysis of the complex and contrary character elements that make up McGraw is the little man 's fanatical aversion to being called Muggsy . He hates the nickname because it is so perfectly descriptive . Muggsy McGraw ! Repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty fair picture of the tough cocky kid who started playing professional baseball with the Olean , New York , Club in 1890 for $6o a month . He was seventeen then . Before he took to baseball he had been a train butcher , sassily hawking his wares through the rickety rocking old day coaches of his time and territory . As a youngster he was about the size and general disposition of Terrible Terry McGovern , the Go-getter from Gowanus . He was Muggsy McGraw then and he answered to the nickname with an impudent grin . He weighed a hundred and twenty-two pounds in his shower bath clothes and thought the owner of the club was a philanthropist or a sucker to pay him $6o a month just for playing ball . Now he flirts with two hundred pounds , and his drag from baseball must be upward of $100,000 a year . And he 'll fight if you call him Muggsy . A good hater he probably hates that nickname worse than any other one thing in the world . If he were just a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But Muggsy is too true to be borne . McGraw is too perfectly Muggsy to appreciate the affection implied by tin-met friends of bleacher and grandstand who would like to call him that . It represents everything in his person and baseball from which he has been trying to disassociate himself since he forsook the profane squabble and sweaty effort of personal diamond conflict for the lonely eminence of managerial master-minding . Baseball has lost a deal of the hobo , bar-room , rough and tumble color it had when McGraw broke in ; so has McGraw , for McGraw , remember , is baseball . The game makes thousands to-day where it made twenties in 189o . That , too , goes for McGraw . Baseball to-day is fat and rich and yearns most mightily to be impeccably respectable . So McGraw . A natural born Muggsy he would probably rather be a legitimate baseball Babbitt than anything in the world . The pugnacious little man 's climb from the realm of glorious rowdyism to which he was born to the staid and stodgy front parlor of respectability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His Irish feet have slipped on many a rung . The last and most spectacular of his descents  --  if you feel that way about it  --  into his earlier and more natural manner of conduct , occurred at the Lambs ' Club in New York in 1920 when he got into a fist battle with an elderly actor , John C. Slavin by name . When the fight was over Slavin had a fractured skull . For days he stood better than an even chance of passing out and leaving McGraw in an embarrassing relationship with the prosecuting attorney 's office . Shortly after this encounter Wilton Lackaye , also an actor and a Lamb , called on McGraw to remonstrate or commiserate with him , ? or both , ? and found the Giant leader still in his Muggsy , or pre-Babbitt mood . According to Lackaye , McGraw smacked him on the jaw , whereupon the actor slipped and fractured his ankle and his assailant withdrew . It was really a great period in McGraw 's life , for , in a manner of speaking , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record for him . For this offense McGraw was suspended from the Lambs ' club . Immediately after he received notice of his suspension , still being Muggsy minded , he revoked all passes to the Polo Grounds held by members . Then the Babbitt in him achieved dominance once more and he humbly pleaded for re-instatement to the club , proffering promises of reform with all the abject sincerity of a scared schoolboy trying to talk his way out of a sentence for truancy . He had no chance of being taken back , ? but he was . John J. McGraw , gentleman , always gets clear of the unpleasant jams in which Muggsy McGraw , roughneck , is involved . He is as contradictory as the statement that black is white . In the matter of sentiment for example : Pottering around the Polo Grounds doing this and that , safe on the payroll of the club , are Amos Rusie , Dan Brouthers and Henry Fabian , all old time playing cronies of McGraw who have come upon financially lean days in the dusk of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of their tribe . That 's one side . Here 's the other : George Burns , great outfielder , was , apparently , almost as permanent a fixture on the Giants as McGraw himself . He was always in condition , never made any trouble , was loved by the local fans and still had many good years of baseball in him when McGraw discovered that he could trade him to some small advantage . Away went the faithful Burns , sold down river like any common field nigger . It is said that McGraw wept when he told Burns he would have to leave . Then there was old Casey Stengel . In the last series against the Yanks that old-timer won the only two ball games that the Giants took with two timely homeruns and got traded for his pains . " Good thing I did n't win any more ball games for him , " old Casey said gloomily when he heard the news . " If I had he 'd probably had me sent to jail , " Leaving Washington last fall after the Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach where his defeated players were simultaneously going into mourning and out of training . " Hard luck , boys , " he said , grinning . " Do n't you care . What 's one championship more or less . We 've won plenty of ' em and we 'll win plenty more . Do n't fret about it . " He laughed and joked with them for a time , reminded them that the loser 's cut of the gate money was not to be sneezed at , walked up into the next car , sat down beside his wife , laid his head on her shoulder and cried like a hurt child . There is no man in baseball more coldly , cruelly commercial than John J. McGraw , manager and magnate , and no man more selflessly engrossed in the game for the game 's sake than Muggsy McGraw , baseball artist , devotee and missionary . He is the strictest disciplinarian in either big league and he has had more unruly players than any other manager . The Muggsy in him likes ' em wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his personality sees to it that all the tigers bleat like lambs and wear wool over their striped hides as long as they pace in his cage . He loves to take them tough and tame them and if they do n't jump through his hoop their big time baseball finish is quick and sure . Since he took charge of the ailing Giants in 1902 he has won nine league pennants and three world championships . Muggsy McGraw was a great ball player and John J. McGraw has been  --  and is  --  a great manager . He is easy to hate , this short , fat , gray-haired man with a beefy , heavy-jawed face and slitty little cold gray eyes . There are many perfectly good reasons for hating him and many perfectly good people who give themselves fervently to the task . And , too , he is easy to love , and the many who swear by him have as good reasons for their sentiments as have those who swear at him . None who know him , or know of him , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxical little man who once was gladly Muggsy , a rowdy rollicking good ball player and is now somewhat unhappily but obstinately John J. McGraw , manager , magnate and man about town . Always , as Muggsy or John J. , as player or manager , he has been the incarnation of the baseball of his time . In his career and personality he has reflected nearly the best and almost the worst of the game that made him and to the making of which he has in turn so considerably contributed . As McGraw changed so has baseball and as baseball has changed so has McGraw . Those who worship at the shrine of wealth , efficiency and respectability can applaud the development of both . Some who thrill to raw color in personality and pastime have cause for the shedding of one more tear of regret at the passing of what probably should never have been , but was wild fine fun while it lasted . There was a spicier flavor to the man and the game in the had old days when McGraw grinned at the shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of something better than pink pop in his upraised hand .
