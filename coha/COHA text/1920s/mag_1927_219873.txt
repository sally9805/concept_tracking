Over No. 15 Dupont Circle , late one afternoon last week , the Presidential flag dipped in the fresh breeze , rose for the first time to the top of the flagstaff there . Before the door of the white marble mansion , President Coolidge stood with his white collie , Rob Roy , posed for photographers , followed the dog over the threshold into his new home . Through the huge foyer he walked , past the costly Gobelin tapestry at his left , up the marble stairway lined with heads of mountain goats , lions , elk and caribou . Into the large room next to the library that is to be his workshop he stepped , paused , smiled at friendly objects : his desk , his favorite chair , many of his books , all brought carefully from the White House . Here he may work when he wishes to stay at home ; on most days he will continue to use the executive offices in the right wing of the White House . <P> Earlier in the day Mrs. Coolidge had arrived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , the corps of White House servants deployed . In her third-story bedroom clothes were hung in wide closets , her dressing table put in homelike shape . <P> In the evening the President and Mrs. Coolidge sat down in Adam* chairs to an Adam table in the five-windowed dining-room decorated in rose tapestry paper , ate their first meal in the temporary White House . Fifty-eight guests could easily have dined there with them . For a more festive night they left the pink and white Louis XIV ballroom across the hall , with its balcony , fireplace and paintings by many masters . <P> The President ordered the Mayflower from her dock for the first time since last fall , sailed down the Potomac with Mrs. Coolidge for a week-end cruise . Secretary of Labor James J. Davis and Mrs. Davis , Assistant Secretary of War F. Trubee Davison and Mrs. Davison were among the guests . <P> On the next to the last day of the last session of the 69th Congress , from 8:30 a. m. until late at night , President Coolidge scanned new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he toiled he waited for word from Capitol Hill where weary Senators carried a filibuster far into its second night . At last , impatient , he sent word to Senator Curtis , Republican floor-leader : It was imperative that the Deficiency Bill be passed before Congress adjourned . From the Senate no word , no more bills came for the Presidential signature . But 165 measures had been signed , many of them of wide importance . Among them were : <P> A bill for the erection of a monument at Kitty Hawk , N. C. , commemorating the first successful flight in a power-driven plane by pioneer airman Orville Wright . <P> A bill creating a division of foreign commerce in the Department of Commerce to supply information on foreign markets to U. S. manufacturers . <P> A bill fixing the qualifications for voters in Alaska .
