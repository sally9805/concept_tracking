txt Our Moscow correspondent reports the development of a policy of which the broad lines were determined at the congress of the Russian Cornmunist Party last Winter . The downfall of ZINOVIEFF and KAMENEFF and the entrenchment in power of STALIN signalized a victory of country over town , of the claims of the peasant as against the city " proletariat . " The crisis was essentially not new . It was only another stage in a process of which the first outstanding event was the introduction of the New Economic Policy by LENIN in 1921 . This made a concession to " capitalism " by re-establishing freedom of private trade within Russia and private initiative in small industry . It was a surrender forced by the peasants , who were the victims of the collapse of industry under Communist management . LENIN stated openly that if the Soviet regime did not make peace with the peasants , it would he destroyed by them . The problem still awaits a solution . It Is admitted now at Moscow that the peasant has been bearing the cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufactured goods to three or four times the pre-war level , while the peasant has been receiving for his grain not much more than the prewar prices . Last year J. M. KEYNES described the city workers as a " pampered " class In the Soviet social system . He estimated the income of the city worker to be somewhere near the pre-war wage , whereas the peasant 's income has been cut down by one-half . The villages bear the burden of a heavy direct tax . More than that , they are the victims of discrimination operating through the Government monopoly in foreign trade . The State agencies buy grain and sell goods to the peasant at prices fixed by . themselves . But quite aside from prices , Government industry has been utterly unable to supply even the meager requirements of the village in the way of manufactured goods . To alleviate this state of affairs the Government ? has now set itself to increase Individual productivity in the factories and cut down overhead by drastic reductions in the industrial bureaucracy . For some time to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a certain degree of hardship for the urban workers . Though " pampered " by comparison with the peasantry , the status of the city workers is not a cheerful one today . The  --  real wage level is probably about four-fifths of what it was before the war . The short working day has In most of the industries been virtually abandoned . Factory discipline has in cases been enforced by the use of troops . Housing conditions have been described as catastrophic . Recently the Soviet Government was reported to be inviting foreign capital to engage in housing construction under special concessions . The Bolshevist leaders have shown resourcefulness through eight Years of recurrent crises . They now face the difficult problem of reconciling the just , and in the long run irresistible , demands of the peasants , who make up 85 per cent . of the population , with the demands of the city workers , upon whose militant support the survival of the Soviet regime depends .                   @ @
