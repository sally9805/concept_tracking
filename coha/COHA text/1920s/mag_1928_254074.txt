The Italian army outnumbers the Jugoslav three to one . The Jugoslav navy of 12 destroyers and torpedo boats and one , pre-War German cruiser would be a puny opponent for the modern , potent Battle Fleet of Italy . Yet last week in a score of Jugoslav cities and towns student hotheads , marched , demonstrated , rioted , skirmished with the police , and shouted : " Down with Mussolini ! " " Long live King Alexander of Jugoslavia ! " " Death to Fascismo ! " ; and " Down with the Treaty of Nettuno ! " <P> Seemingly the rash students were bent upon egging Prime Minister Velja Vukitchevitch of Jugoslavia into a suicidal war with Italy ; but circumstances were not lacking to extenuate their folly . <P> The Italo-Jugoslav Treaties of Nettuno were virtually dictated by Signor Mussolini in 1925 and provide that Italians may colonize and thus peacefully penetrate the Dalmatian coast of Jugoslavia , which lies directly across the Adriatic Sea from Italy . For three years the Jugoslav Parliament has delayed to ratify the Treaty of Nettuno . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to yield to Italian pressure and press for ratification . Mounted ominously the hereditary hatred of rival peoples who face each other across a narrow sea . Suddenly came an insult to fire the charge of hatred . Jugoslav correspondents reported from the Italian port of Zara that a convention of Italian war veterans had met , sung songs in which Jugoslavs were referred to as pigs , and adopted a resolution to the effect that Italy should seize Dalmatia . <P> Restaurant Battle . Students at Belgrade , Jugoslav Capital , were stirred to such fury by the possibly erroneous reports from Zara that they stormed the Restaurant of the Russian Tsar at Belgrade , where several members of the Cabinet were known to be dining . " TRAITORS ! COWARDS ! " roared the students , and soon began to hurl bricks through the windows of the restaurant , to emphasize their contention that the Cabinet ought not to submit the Treaties of Nettuno for ratifications by the Skupshtina ( Parliament ) . <P> Amid panic the statesmen-diners fled to the restaurant cellars . The students , tramping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , chairs and chandeliers-flung all into the street for a barricade against the police . <P> Came constables . They sought to break down the barricade by backing against it a ponderous auto-street sweeper . But wine bottles and water carafes hurtled from the restaurant , knocked out four policemen . <P> Firemen tried a hose , could not swamp student ardor . Reluctantly , at last , the police opened fire upon the mob , killing , wounding , restoring order . <P> Other mobs had meanwhile stormed the Italian consulates in Zagreb , Spalato , Ragusa and other Jugoslavian cities . Repeatedly portraits of Benito Mussolini were publicly burned , and Italian tricolors were torn to tatters , spat upon , befouled . <P> Skupshtina Battle . In the Skupshtina , Deputies of the Opposition irretrievably transgressed decorum by tearing the tops off their desks and flailing them to matchwood , while they screamed at Government leaders " Resign ! Resign ! COWARDS , Traitors , MURDERERS ! "                    @
