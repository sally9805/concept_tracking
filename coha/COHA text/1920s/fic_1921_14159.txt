Mrs. Otcott , that great actress in the tradition of the Siddons , the Oldfield , Bracegirdle , O'Neill , is spending a quiet month in Wales . We do not see the cottage , we do not even see the mountains , but there is a stretch of lawn on whose gentle slope there stands an ancient round tower overgrown with ivy . In the shadow of this Arthurian monument , Mrs. Otcott has placed a table whereon she is sorting old engravings , playbills , letters , contracts , ribbons  --  in short , her past . She is still the handsome , humorous , Irish soul from whom every item out of the old trunks exacts its exclamation , its gesture , its renewed indignation or pleasure . She is attended by a blackamoor boy in livery , half asleep against a flowerpot . MRS . OTCOTT Sampson ! Tay ! SAMPSON ( Springing up : ) Yes , ma'am . Wid or widout a streak o ' cream ? MRS . OTCOTT Widout . And Sampson , tell Pence I am not at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to the good black beard . And if they seem to know that I am at home , tell them that I have gone up the tower , or that I have the vapors . SAMPSON You wants tea widout , and tell Mrs. Pence you do n't want to see none of de gentlemen from de village inn  --  dat you has de vapors. p. 3 MRS . OTCOTT There ! Do you see that , Sampson ? I wore that the night the king dined with me on the stage . SAMPSON ( His eyes as big as soup plates : ) King James ! MRS . OTCOTT ( Shuddering : ) No , stupid  --  Charles .  --  Go away ! This afternoon I shall devote to another woman , to another and a different woman , and yet to myself , to myself , to myself . SAMPSON I 'll tell Mrs. Pence . ( He goes out . Mrs. Otcott picks up a packet of letters . One look , tosses them away , then rises muttering ; goes and stamps on them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads the heading with glistening eyes : " Fanny Otcott as Faizella in the Princess of Cathay . First time . " She strides about lost in thought . She almost walks into a gentleman who has entered through the hedge . He is wearing a black hat and cape , and has a serious worn face . ) ATCHESON Your servant , Mrs. Otcott . MRS . OTCOTT ( Thunderstruck : ) Why , no ! Yes ! By the garter , it is George Atcheson . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! ATCHESON I do not disturb you , Mrs. Otcott ? I I came to discuss a thing that is very serious to me. p. 4 MRS . OTCOTT ( Suddenly very pleased : ) Everything is  --  sit down , my friend . You always were very serious . That 's why you made such a bad Hamlet . Delay your serious talk , George , and tell me about the women you have loved since you loved me , and confess that I finally made them all unendurable to you . ATCHESON You misunderstand me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ATCHESON Ah Fanny ? MRS . OTCOTT All you need is a little coaxing . Well , George , a woman drove you on to the stage when you were preparing for the church , and a woman drove you off , and it was my greatest service to the stage . Look , George , you remember me as Faizella in the Princess of Cathay . I never did better than that . Great Rufus , you played opposite me in it . Look ! ATCHESON Perhaps you remember I lost consciousness MRS . OTCOTT Ah yes ! The pale divinity student fainted . Oh ! George , you were the first of my lovers . No , it was n't love , perhaps , but it was beautiful . It was like hawthorn buds and meadowlarks and Mr. Handel 's Water Music . And since , I have never ceased searching for love . Perhaps love strikes the first time or never at all . Then I was too much in love with my work . And , oh , George , how young we were ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm sorry to see you 're growing stout , for it 's one more reminder that I shall probably live and die without having known the lightning of love . ( She sits down with a great flow of silken draperies and shakes her head at him ruefully. ) p. 5 ATCHESON I have come to discuss our our association MRS . OTCOTT Thunder and hell ! Do n't you call that an association ! ATCHESON but my view of it is very different . ( Her shoe commences to mark time nervously on the turf . ) After my retirement from the stage I resumed my theological studies , and I am now Bishop of Westholmstead . ( The shoe is now motionless . ) None of my friends know of that that experience in my life , but it has always remained as a bitter as a distressing spot in my conscience . MRS . OTCOTT ( After a pause , very rapidly : ) I see , you want to make a clean breast of the perilous stuff . You want to make a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . OTCOTT You have several sons probably ? ATCHESON Yes . MRS . OTCOTT And you lie awake nights , saying : " Hypocrisy , hypocrisy . " ( Pause ) Well , make your confession . But why consult me ? ATCHESON I have followed your course , madam , and seen the growing admiration your art commands in court  --  I might almost say in the church . p. 6 MRS . OTCOTT You do not suppose that that revelation would cast any deeper shadow on the good name of Fanny Otcott , such as it is . Remember , George , the months you call sinful . It was n't love , perhaps , but it was grace and poetry . The heavens rained odors on us . It was as childlike and harmless as paintings on fans . I was a girl tragedienne reciting verses endlessly before a mirror and you were a young student who for the first time had seen a young girl braid her hair and sing at her work . Since then you have learned long names from books and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have borrowed your ideas from those who have never begun to live and who dare not . ATCHESON ( His head in his hands and his elbows on his knees : ) I do not know what to think . Your reasoning is full of perils . MRS . OTCOTT Go away and tell your congregations what you please . I feel as though you were communicating to my mind some of those pitiable remorses that have weakened you . I have sinned , but I have not that year on my conscience . It is that year and my playing of Faizella that will bring troops of angels to welcome me to Paradise . Go away and tell your congregations what you please . ATCHESON You give me no help in the matter , Mrs. Otcott . MRS . OTCOTT Go away . In the name of Heaven , go ! ( Crooked with doubt and hesitation , the Bishop of Westholmstead goes out through the hedge . For a few moments Mrs. Otcott sits on the table , swinging one foot and muttering savagely in an imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen waited on you from de village inn , but Mrs. Pence sent dem away . She said you was up de tower , ma'am . MRS . OTCOTT ( Showily : )
