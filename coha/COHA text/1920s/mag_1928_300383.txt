( See front cover ) <P> Some 5,000 Canadian and U. S. scientists closed their classes and laboratories last week , and hastened to Manhattan for the regular Christmas convocation of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . Some 2,000 had papers to read on their 15 specialties. * Reading those papers , the mosaic of 1928 developments in pure and applied science , would place the workers on little eminences among their colleagues . Better , it would put them near the Olympians of their profession who attended sessions with them , men like : <P> Geologist Bailey Willis , 71 , of Stanford , who was to talk through his swaggering mustache and beard on " Continental Genesis . " He knows seismology , has predicted bad earthquakes in Southern California . But his reputation rests more securely on his explanation of the stratigraphy , structural geology and physiography of North America , Europe and Asia as the record of continental developments . <P> Physicist Arthur Holly Compton , 36 , of Chicago , who has the dapper alertness of a business executive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Charles Thomson Rees Wilson , 59 , of Cambridge University ) . Professor Compton 's reward was for measuring electro-magnetic waves . <P> Zoologist William Morton Wheeler , 63 , of Harvard , who studied cockroaches , fleas , ants and other insects with more ardor , patience and intelligence than a woman studies another woman 's clothes . <P> Astronomer Herbert Hall Turner , 67 , of Oxford . Professor Turner , swart &; burly , resembles a typical , prosperous British factory manager . He has never been in business .

This autumn he created his popular fame by repeatedly giving talks on stellar organizations . As the complement to the Association 's initial lecture ( Professor Bailey 's " Continental Genesis " ) President Henry Fairfield Osborn of the Association appointed Professor Shapley to give the final lecture . Professor Shapley entitled his paper " Galaxies of Galaxies-a new study of the super-organization of the Milky Way . " <P> Photographer Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prime example of an industrial laboratory director . <P> Editor-Psychologist James McKeen Cattell , 68 , the 1924 president of the Association . His dour look belies his loving-kindness towards scientists . He it is who records their work , as editor of Science weekly , Scientific Monthly , School and Society , American Naturalist , American Men of Science . <P> Editor-Chemist Edwin Emery Slosson , 63 , a man discreetly sought after because his Science Service at Washington rewrites scientific reports in popular language and despatches them to the country 's newspapers . <P> Chemist Arthur Amos Noyes , 62 , of California Tech , retiring president of the Association . His direction of the Gates Chemical Laboratory at Pasadena is a prototype for the successful management of an educational institution .
