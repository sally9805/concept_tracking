txt Any one who thinks a telephone operator 's life is an easy one should bear in mind what a telephone girl in a big hotel has to sit and look at a good part of each day . Right here we offer you a sample row of telephone faces . From left to right we have with us , first , the representative of the firm , on to talk over an A number one proposition with a prospective client . Just now he is waiting to get in touch with the New Willard in Washington , D. C. Next in line is the forgetful lady from the suburbs , who has come away without the cleaner 's check for the white gloves . They were to be ready today , She is calling up the house to find out the number of the check . Ten to one , Inger , the maid , wo n't be able to understand and will keep repeating , " Yah , I un'eratan ' , this number , Bronxville 881 . " The third member of the quintet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operator 's eyes while asking for Schuyler 7782 , and wonders out loud if a certain little lady likes candy and tiowers . Alongside the old bean is the conversational lady , who is ' about to call up a dear , dear friend . She is going to tell her just what the specialist said about her general condition , and all about the tendency to uric acid . And last we have the young man in a great hurry , who wants his number right away . No telling what might happen if he does n't get it quickly .
