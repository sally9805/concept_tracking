SCENEA small room in a large city , in which Pierrot and Columbine make their home . The room is neither kitchen , bedroom , nor living-room ; but it serves as all three ; it is , in fact , a room of a character which is denied to the rich . There is a bed-couch , left front ; door leading to the bathroom , left rear ; window , left center wall , bed-couch against center wall ; kitchen sink and gas stove , right center wall ; cupboard with dishes and chest of drawers against right wall rear ; and door leading to staircase to street , right front . In the center are a small table and a few chairs . AT RISEPierrot is in bed ; his head lies near the window . Columbine is bustling around , setting the table on which she has already placed some of the breakfast dishes . COLUMBINE ( to Pierrot ) Breakfast is nearly ready , Pierrot ! Do wake up . ( Pierrot takes no notice . Columbine goes over to sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pierrot grunts . ) I 'm making a lovely breakfast for you , Pierrot . PIERROT ( sleepily ) All right , dear ! I 'm getting up . ( She waits expectantly ; he rolls over and goes back to sleep . ) COLUMBINE I 'm going to stay here and bother you until you get up ! See ! I 'm a mosquito ! I 'm buzzing around you ! Buzz , buzz , buzz ! ! ! ( She kisses him . ) I 'm going to bite you ! ( She attempts to bite him. ) p. 3 PIERROT Do go away , dear ! Ca n't you see I 'm making up my mind to get up ? It takes time . ( He turns over so that his head is covered up , and all , one can see of him is his hunched-up back . ) COLUMBINE You 'll never make up your mind ! You know you 've lots of things to do today . Please get up , Pierrot ! Please do ! ( She begins to pull the bedclothes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting up . ( He winds the covers around him . ) COLUMBINE But breakfast ! PIERROT I do n't want any breakfast . ( He settles down in the bed in a determined manner . ) COLUMBINE ( hurt ) Very well ! ( She goes over to the gas stove and pours hot water into the coffee-pot . She looks over as Pierrot to see whether her new attitude will make any difference . It does not . She pull : up the blinds . She puts the coffee-pot on the table with a thud and sits down , moving her chair noisily . She pours herself a cup of coffee . Pierrot raises his head . ) PIERROT ( cheerfully ) Hello ! ( Columbine drinks her coffee with great intensity. ) p. 4 PIERROT ( shouting ) Did n't you hear what I said ? COLUMBINE ( coldly ) What did you say ? PIERROT I said , " Hello ! " COLUMBINE I 've heard you say that before . Do you know what time it is ? PIERROT No ! COLUMBINE It 's nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that ? I 've slept only  --  let me see  --  six hours . You 're very irritating ! COLUMBINE I meant to be . PIERROT Very well . I shall go back to sleep . ( He lies back on the bed . ) COLUMBINE I do n't care . Your company is n't so charming , after all . PIERROT I have a lovely idea for a song . If I could write it , I might be able to sell it for a hundred dollars . COLUMBINE If only you could ! PIERROT What could n't we do with a hundred dollars ! I know ! We could go to a hotel and have breakfast , lunch , and dinner served in our room so we could stay in bed all day . I wish I could remembers that song . Confound you , Columbine , why did you you bother me ! I was half dreaming of it  --  and now you 've made me forget it . ( He sits up . ) It was a song to the dawn  --  " Matinata " ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PIERROT There is a great mystery about the dawn . It is seen only by people with very good habits , or by people with very bad habits . COLUMBINE It is n't difficult to see where you belong ! PIERROT Is n't it ? Well , I 've never seen the dawn  --  that is , not for years ! COLUMBINE You were out all night last Monday . Did n't you see it then ? PIERROT No , I was playing poker . I think I shall get up . COLUMBINE I 've finished my breakfast . PIERROT ( gaily jumping out of bed ) Is n't that fine ! Just in time to get me mine ! COLUMBINE I shall do nothing of the sort . PIERROT ( pleading ) But , Columbine , dear ! I 'm so hungry . I 've had nothing to eat since two o'clock  --  and now it 's eleven . COLUMBINE You should have gotten up when I called you ! PIERROT My Columbine angry with me ? Do n't be angry , sweetheart . Your mouth is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry it gets thin , like a long , red worm . p. 6 COLUMBINE Ugh ! How can you say my mouth 's like a worm ! PIERROT ( struck with the thought ) A worm may hide in the reddest rose ! COLUMBINE I 'm angry with you ! PIERROT I did n't say your mouth was like that . ( Gaily ) I meant I wanted you to smile  --  to be happy . It 's morning , the sun is up ! COLUMBINE It 's been up for hours . PIERROT ( jumping out of bed ) And so am I ! Here is your penitent Pierrot ! If you 'll only forgive me , I 'll go to bed early , sleep all night , get up with the dawn , and bring you your breakfast in bed ! Wo n't you like that ? ( He takes off his pyjama jacket , disclosing his costume underneath . ) COLUMBINE It would be lovely  --  but it 'll never happen ! Goodness me , you 've slept in your clothes ! PIERROT Yes , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ? COLUMBINE The coat 's creased terribly . I shall have to put the iron on . You ca n't go out looking like that ! ( She goes over to the stove and puts on an iron. ) p. 7 PIERROT ( pulling on his stockings ) Columbine , you are a dear ! I do n't deserve you . I know I do n't . ( He looks around helplessly . ) Where are my shoes ? COLUMBINE I do n't know . I did n't take them off . Look where you least expect to find them . ( Pierrot looks in his bed , under his pillow , and finally under the bed , where he finds them . ) PIERROT What are you going to give me for breakfast ? COLUMBINE Would you like boiled eggs ? PIERROT ( with disgust ) Eggs ! Oh , Columbine , how could you suggest eggs ? I want something dainty , something with a French name that will just waft its way gently into my insides . COLUMBINE I suppose you 've been drinking ! PIERROT Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an omelette . PIERROT The French name ! And it must be a frothy one  --  clusters of air bubbles coated with egg ! COLUMBINE ( sighing ) I shall have to dirty three extra dishes . p. 8 PIERROT That makes me think of something . I know ! I have n't washed ! COLUMBINE ( breaking the eggs into a dish ) Hurry , please ! You 'll begin to dress yourself just when I have everything ready for you . PIERROT Do n't hurry me , Columbine . There should be something dignified about the way a man prepares himself for the day . If he hurries and skurries , it makes him fretful and nervous . A great opportunity may come to me today , if I preserve a calm in my soul . Would you have me miss it , just so as not to keep breakfast waiting for a few moments ? COLUMBINE But you said you were hungry ! PIERROT I am hungry . ( Rises . ) But I have a dignified hunger . I shall enter the bathroom with a stately air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I end it . ( Exit Pierrot , bathroom door . ) ( Columbine sighs , takes the egg-beater , mixes the omelette and pours it into pan . She puts the coffee-pot back on the stove . Enter Pierrot , mopping his face with a towel . He dries it , then stands up and exercises listlessly for a few moments , using knife and fork as dumb-bells . He then tries rising up and down , hands on hips , body stiff ; gets down but fails to rise ; he staggers up . He repeats this twice , and finally falls into a chair at the table. ) p. 9 PIERROT Well ! Where 's the omelette ? COLUMBINE It is n't ready yet . PIERROT I 'm hungry . COLUMBINE Eat some bread . PIERROT Where is it ? COLUMBINE Over here . PIERROT Well , why do n't you bring it to me ? COLUMBINE Ca n't you get it yourself ? PIERROT Do n't you see I 'm sitting down to my breakfast ? You 've been hurrying me the whole morning , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is ready . See , the omelette is done . ( She puts it on his plate . ) PIERROT Where 's the salt ? COLUMBINE Here you are ! PIERROT And the bread . Do bring the bread ! ( She hands him bread . ) COLUMBINE You are bad tempered this morning . PIERROT I 'm not . ( He eats the omelette ravenously . ) COLUMBINE ( sitting at the table ) Do you like the omelette ? p. 10 PIERROT It 's all right . I nearly had that song . Listen :  --  " Rose-colored Dawn , My heart 's forlorn  --  Do you like that ? COLUMBINE I do n't . First of all , a dawn 's not rose-colored ; and , secondly , the idea 's absolutely unoriginal ! PIERROT You do tell the truth terribly ! COLUMBINE You need someone to tell you the truth . PIERROT Those were n't the words I was thinking of in bed . If you do n't like them , it 's your own fault for waking me up . What I said just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid , Pierrot . If I waked you up , it was because I had to . I 've worked all the week and now it 's your turn . There is n't a thing in the place to eat . PIERROT Would n't it be wonderful if we could school ourselves to live without food ; one could do it gradually . After all , material functions are merely matters of habit . COLUMBINE I wish you 'd get the habit of working ! PIERROT ( hopelessly ) Oh dear ! ( He stretches . ) COLUMBINE You kicked me  --  right on the leg ! p. 11 PIERROT ( indifferently ) Did I ? COLUMBINE Yes . You might say you 're sorry . PIERROT ( sharply ) I suppose I am sorry . Is it necessary to say so ? COLUMBINE ( indignantly ) It certainly is ! PIERROT ( equally indignant ) I might say equally , why did you have your leg in my way ? My desire to stretch was frustrated  --  and by your leg ! COLUMBINE Do you mean you 're not sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there , I would n't have kicked it . COLUMBINE ( angrily ) Where should I put my leg ? PIERROT ( more angrily still ) Somewhere where it would n't be in my way ! COLUMBINE ( rising ) Look here , Pierrot , I 've just about had enough of you . You do n't care what you do , or what you say ! PIERROT ( angrily ) I suppose I do n't ! Well , I 'm going . ( He puts on his hat. ) p. 12 COLUMBINE ( alarmed ) Where are you going ? PIERROT ( bitterly ) To work . To sell my immortality for a mess of pottage . COLUMBINE But I have n't ironed your coat  --  it is all creased.You look disreputable . PIERROT I do n't care how I look . COLUMBINE And you have n't finished your breakfast . PIERROT I 'm not going to finish it . ( He goes out , slamming the door . Columbine sits at the table and weeps . After a pause , enter Harlequin . He stands at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLUMBINE ( through her tears ) Hello , Harlequin ! HARLEQUIN Is that all you say to me , just " Hello " ? Are n't you glad to see me ? COLUMBINE ( tearfully ) Yes , Harlequin ! ( Harlequin approaches her . ) HARLEQUIN What 's the matter ? You 're crying . COLUMBINE ( tearfully ) Yes , Harlequin . p. 13 HARLEQUIN Why are you crying ? It 's not over me , is it ? COLUMBINE No , Harlequin . HARLEQUIN ( disappointed ) No ? Oh ! I thought it was ! COLUMBINE Why , Harlequin ? HARLEQUIN Well , I know I have n't been very nice to you lately . But it 's all over now , Columbine . Tell me what you 've been crying about . COLUMBINE I do n't know . ( Harlequin takes her hand . ) HARLEQUIN ( sympathetically ) Wo n't you tell Harlequin ? Perhaps he can help you . COLUMBINE Oh , Harlequin , it 's  --  it 's Pierrot ! ( She weeps again . ) HARLEQUIN It 's too bad , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may thank your stars that wherever there 's a Pierrot you 'll always find a Harlequin for consolation ! COLUMBINE I 'd like you to console me , Harlequin , but I do n't think it would be right . HARLEQUIN Oh , yes it would . Harlequins are quite necessary to the world . The Pierrots would be quite unbearable without them . And now tell me , what has Pierrot been doing ? p. 14 COLUMBINE ( tearfully ) It 's what he has n't been doing . HARLEQUIN Oh ! Neglecting you ! COLUMBINE Neglecting himself . Wasting his time . Going to parties , staying up late , working only when he has to . He 's so  --  so inefficient with himself . HARLEQUIN Not with himself , Columbine , but with you . Columbine dear , if you were my wife , how I would devote myself to you ! It would be the greatest pleasure for me to do little things for you , to make your life easier , instead of complicating it as Pierrot does . You make yourself a slave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . He went away just now and left everything for me to do . The dishes are n't washed , the beds are n't made . He did n't get up ' til eleven o'clock ! HARLEQUIN Eleven o'clock ! ( With immense satisfaction . ) I 've been up since five . What a way to treat you ! Well , dear , I shall help you . Nobody can call Me inefficient ! COLUMBINE How I wish Pierrot had some of your qualities ! HARLEQUIN ( with still more satisfaction ) He never will have . ( Jumps up . ) Shall we begin ? p. 15 COLUMBINE Begin what ? HARLEQUIN Tidying up . I hate to sit in a room that 's disorderly . COLUMBINE ( coaxing ) Oh , let 's talk for a while . I do n't feel like tidying up yet . HARLEQUIN Do n't you move ! You stay right there . I 'll do it . You 've worked enough this morning . COLUMBINE ( catches his arm ) You are a dear to want to help me . HARLEQUIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Columbine . ( He bends his head down to her and kisses her . ) COLUMBINE ( with a little cry of pleasure ) Oh , Harlequin ! HARLEQUIN ( taking her hand ) Columbine , dear , I love you . It 's breaking my heart to see you so unhappy , to see your dear hands so hardened and stained by working and scrubbing for Pierrot , who does n't appreciate you in the very least little bit . COLUMBINE ( weeps ) It 's true . He does n't . HARLEQUIN He stays out night after night , drinking and gambling , and when he 's so tired that he can do nothing else , he comes back to you and offers you the dregs of himself . Columbine , you are too wonderful to be wasted on such a man . p. 16 COLUMBINE ( weepingly ) I am ! I know I am ! HARLEQUIN Then leave him ! COLUMBINE ( amazed ) Leave him ? HARLEQUIN Yes , come with me . COLUMBINE ( enthusiastically ) Oh  --  an elopement ! HARLEQUIN This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the form of a legal separation . COLUMBINE ( disappointed ) But an elopement ! I 've always wanted an elopement ! HARLEQUIN I know , dear , but you must really leave this to me . An elopement is very romantic and all that , but a legal separation is really the most sensible way of doing it . COLUMBINE ( pouting ) Very well , if you say so . I 'm not sure I 'm very keen about a legal separation . It sounds so  --  so  --  HARLEQUIN ( interrupting ) Practical . And that 's just what it is . COLUMBINE ( admiringly ) You are practical , Harlequin . What do I have to do ? p. 17 HARLEQUIN Sit right down and leave everything to me . I shall attend to every detail . COLUMBINE You are a dear , Harlequin . ( She sits down on a chair by the table . ) Kiss me , sweetheart . ( Harlequin bends over and kisses her . ) HARLEQUIN ( still bending over her ) This is n't very comfortable . COLUMBINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your lap . ( Harlequin sits down , and she sits on his knee . ) Tell me , Harlequin , how was it you came to fall in love with me ? HARLEQUIN ( starting ) Oh , dear , I ve put my sleeve in the omelette I 'm covered with egg . Do you mind if I clear off the table ? ( Columbine jumps off his knee and Harlequin rises . ) COLUMBINE anxiouslyLet me help you . HARLEQUIN ( wiping his sleeve ) No , I can manage , dear . COLUMBINE But Harlequin ! HARLEQUIN But Columbine ! COLUMBINE Oh , very well . ( She sits down. ) p. 18 HARLEQUIN I 'll clear them all off in a second . ( He piles all the dishes on one arm , and in a few seconds has them all carried off , like an expert waiter . ) COLUMBINE ( admiringly ) How clever you are , Harlequin ! HARLEQUIN While I 'm up , I think I 'll fix the beds . COLUMBINE But , Harlequin , what about the elopement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , when shall we get started ? HARLEQUIN When will Pierrot return ? COLUMBINE I do n't know . HARLEQUIN Did n't you ask him , dear ? COLUMBINE No ! HARLEQUIN That was rather thoughtless of you . COLUMBINE But , Harlequin , I did n't know we were going to elope when he left th s morning . HARLEQUIN Of course you did n't , but on general principles , if you 're living with a person constantly , Columbine , you ought to know just about what his habits are , and how long he may be expected to be away . p. 19 COLUMBINE But Pierrot has no habits . HARLEQUIN That 's true . I suppose you 'd better get packed , so we can leave before he returns . Where is your suitcase , dear ? COLUMBINE ( pointing ) Under the bed . HARLEQUIN ( pulls out the suitcase ) Lord , what a state it 's in ! Have you a duster ? COLUMBINE Let me do it . HARLEQUIN Please , Columbine . Tell me where you keep the duster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbine , did n't you say you 'd leave everything to me ? COLUMBINE But I want to do it ! HARLEQUIN Very well , I know what we 'll do . You pack the suitcase and I 'll tidy the room . ( Columbine takes the suitcase and dusts it with her handkerchief . ) Using your handkerchief , dear ? COLUMBINE I have no duster . HARLEQUIN No duster ? COLUMBINE No ! HARLEQUIN ( expansively ) When you are living with me , dear , we shall have large piles of dusters ! We shall have small , striped ones , large tea cloths , dishcloths , towels , and washrags , and every kind of brush , broom , and cleaning appliance ! p. 20 COLUMBINE How wonderful ! HARLEQUIN ( begins making Pierrot 's bed ) Does Pierrot sleep in this bed ? COLUMBINE Yes . HARLEQUIN I thought so . Nobody but Pierrot could stand such sheets . COLUMBINE ( alarmed ) They 're clean , are n't they ? HARLEQUIN Yes , but cotton and such cotton ! When you live with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? ( He takes out a photograph of Columbine in a silver frame from under pillow . ) COLUMBINE ( taking the picture ) Where did you find it ? HARLEQUIN Under his pillow . COLUMBINE Silly Pierrot ! HARLEQUIN Silly 's too mild a name for a lazy sentimentalist like Pierrot . Sleeps with his wife 's photograph ! COLUMBINE Had n't we better hurry ? HARLEQUIN We ca n't go away and leave the place untidy  --  though I suppose Pierrot would never notice it . COLUMBINE No  --  I do n't think he would . ( Columbine begins to bundle her underwear and clothes into the suitcase . Harlequin continues making up the bed. ) p. 21 HARLEQUIN ( making the bed ) Do you tuck the quilt under the mattress on both sides , or only on the left-hand side ? COLUMBINE ( carelessly ) Oh , any old way . HARLEQUIN ( dogmatically ) The correct way is to tuck it under on the left-hand side only . ( Columbine attempts to close the suitcase . Harlequin sees her . ) Do n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me do it . ( Harlequin begins to struggle with the suitcase but fails to close it . ) You have too much in it . Do you mind if I open it ? COLUMBINE But , Harlequin , we must hurry . Pierrot may come back any moment . HARLEQUIN We ca n't go away with all your things trailing out of the suitcase , dear ! ( He opens it and turns to Columbine reproachfully . ) Columbine ! COLUMBINE Yes , it is untidy , is n't it ? I was so excited I just pushed everything in . HARLEQUIN No wonder I could n't close it . Columbine , dear , just leave this packing to me , will you ? Look , here 's a magazine . ( He gives it to her and guides her to chair . ) You sit down there and read it for a few minutes , and I 'll have your suitcase packed like lightning . p. 22 COLUMBINE But I feel so useless ! HARLEQUIN ( reproachfully ) Columbine ! COLUMBINE I do . HARLEQUIN But you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ? COLUMBINE ( dubiously ) I suppose I do . HARLEQUIN You suppose ? Do n't you know , Columbine , darling ? COLUMBINE Yes , of course I know . HARLEQUIN Very well . Leave everything to me and there wo n't be any hitch . ( He begins packing up her clothes , which he has dumped out of the suitcase onto the floor . He is an expert packer ; everything is folded up into the tiniest space . Columbine watches him apprehensively over the top of the magazine . Harlequin begins to fold up a very frilly nightgown . ) COLUMBINE Please do n't look at that , Harlequin ! HARLEQUIN Why not ? COLUMBINE It embarrasses me . HARLEQUIN I 've seen loads of them . COLUMBINE Harlequin ! p. 23 HARLEQUIN In shop windows . But is n't this rather a stupid one ? COLUMBINE Pierrot does n't think so . HARLEQUIN It is rather stupid , though . Look at all that frilly lace on the shoulders ! It means that the gown lasts half as long . You are always liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always more difficult and consequently more expensive , and it often scratches your skin when they put too much starch in it . ( His voice full of promise . ) I 'll buy you some simple , practical ones , without any frills and fripperies . COLUMBINE But I like that one . ( Harlequin has another frilly garment in his hand . She jumps up and takes it away from him . ) HARLEQUIN ( amazed ) Columbine , you do n't mean to tell me you wear those ! COLUMBINE ( puzzled ) Yes , I do ; why not ? HARLEQUIN Goodness me , they 're mid-Victorian . You take me back to the days of my grandmother . COLUMBINE What 's the matter with them ? HARLEQUIN I shall have to buy you an entirely new trousseau ! p. 24 COLUMBINE I do n't know that I want a new trousseau ! HARLEQUIN Indeed you do . You need a new dress badly , too . When you live with me , I shall work hard and buy you loads of wonderful clothes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and say what a faultlessly dressed woman you are ! There ! Everything 's in , and there 's room for a whole lot more . Are you sure you have everything ? COLUMBINE ( putting on coat and hat ) Quite sure . Come along . HARLEQUIN Did you remember to put in your rubbers ? COLUMBINE ( puzzled ) Rubbers  --  on an elopement ? HARLEQUIN Yes , why not ? It might rain . COLUMBINE Well , I wo n't put in rubbers ! HARLEQUIN If it rains , you 'd take cold without them . COLUMBINE I will not take rubbers . HARLEQUIN Columbine , I insist on rubbers . COLUMBINE ( sarcastically ) Very well , I have no rubbers . But I have an umbrella  --  perhaps you 'd like me to take that ! p. 25 HARLEQUIN That would be an excellent idea ! COLUMBINE ( getting angry ) And how about a small medicine chest with mustard plasters , hot water bottles , and all the necessary equipment for treating small wounds , sprains , bruises , burns , and chapped hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . COLUMBINE Angry with you ? No , Harlequin , I 'm not angry with you . I 'm angry with myself . Imagine eloping with a man who insists on packing rubbers and an umbrella . Oh , Lord ! HARLEQUIN My dear , I 'm simply trying to be practical ! COLUMBINE ( scornfully ) Practical ! Why have n't you brought a lawyer with you ? Why have n't we signed the necessary legal documents ? Why have n't you brought a doctor in case we have an accident , and a trained nurse , and a hospital , and an ambulance ? Why have n't you been really practical ? HARLEQUIN Columbine , you 're making fun of me ! COLUMBINE No , I 'm not ! If I elope , it must be with a practical man , not an amateur . I want him to bring along railroad trains and seaside hotels and ocean liners ! HARLEQUIN You are making fun of me ! Columbine , I shall not go away with you . p. 26 COLUMBINE ( points to sink ) How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed ? ( A noise is heard outside . ) Hist ! It 's Pierrot ! HARLEQUIN What shall I do ? COLUMBINE Something practical ! HARLEQUIN I 'll hide in the bathroom . ( Exit Harlequin , bathroom door . Columbine takes off her hat and coat and passes Harlequin 's hat and walkingstick into the bathroom.Enter Pierrot . He carries a small straggling bunch of flowers . ) PIERROT ( penitently ) Columbine , dear , these are for you ! COLUMBINE Pierrot , dear ! ( They embrace . ) PIERROT Forgive me , darling ! COLUMBINE There 's nothing to forgive , dearest . PIERROT I was rude to you ! COLUMBINE It was my fault , Pierrot . I had my leg in your way ! PIERROT No , dearest , I was wrong in kicking my foot against you ! I know I was . So I went out into the fields and picked these flowers for you . Then I sat on the grass and looked at them , and do you know , Columbine , dear , that the song came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke me up this morning  --  " Matinata , " I called it  --  so I wrote it down on a piece of paper and took it to the song publishers and would you believe it  --  they paid me ninety dollars and forty-seven cents for it ! p. 27 COLUMBINE ( amazed ) And forty-seven cents ! PIERROT Three dollars and seven cents a line ! Look , here 's the money ! ( He pulls out the roll of bills and shows them to her . ) Do you know what I 'm going to do with it ? I 'm going to buy half a dozen of the laciest of lace nighties for you ! The ones you have are nearly worn out . COLUMBINE But , darling , they are so impractical ! PIERROT They 're beautiful ! And then I 'm going to bring you half a dozen pairs of  --  COLUMBINE ( glancing apprehensively at the bathroom door ) Never mind , Pierrot ! PIERROT And with the rest of the money we 'll go on a little trip together ! You 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is packed ! PIERROT How did you come to do that ? COLUMBINE ( hesitating , then lying heroically ) Woman 's intuition ! The moment you said those few lines at the breakfast table , I just knew the publisher would buy the song ! PIERROT Have you any room for my things ? p. 28 COLUMBINE ( opens suitcase ) Lots ! PIERROT ( admiringly ) How neatly you packed it ! Here , drop these in . ( He throws in some clothes and shuts the suitcase , stamps on it and goes to the door , right . Columbine puts on her hat and picks up the suitcase . ) PIERROT Columbine , you look charming in those old clothes people will think we 're eloping ! ( They kiss . Exit Pierrot . The bathroom door opens and Harlequin peeps through . ) COLUMBINE ( calls dowstairs , looking at Harlequin ) Pierrot , dear , shall I bring rubbers ? ( Exit Columbine . Enter Harlequin .
