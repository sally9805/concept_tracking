txt THE NURSING PROBLEM . Solutions by Reducing and by Raising Standards of Training . To the Editor of The New York Times : Every few months articles appear in the different papers relating to the grave shortage of-nurses , and doctors do not seem to understand why girls are not taking up the profession . I wonder if the pupil nurses wart , treated more like human beings than machines while they were in training it there would be such a shortage . I have been intimately acquainted with a number of girls who have been in training in different hospitals and they all tell the same story of how hard they have to work and of how uheerteln their hours are . For instance , a girl who lives up in the country naturally gets very homesick and longs to see hoe family once in a while , but instead of having a day and a : half at one time she gets only one afternoon a week , which is not sufficient time for her to make the trip to her home and back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are to have their ' afternoon . Then it requires one with the strength of a Samson to take the strenuous training for three years and come out alive . My sister enterea the hospital in perfect health , but after training for two and a half years she gave up and has never been as strong since . Another girl was required to go on duty when she was physically unable and contracted a disease which resulted in her death . There are cases too numerous to mention where girls have broken down , Then in some hospitals they do not even Pay the girls while they are training , and unless they can get help from home they are out of luck . In closing let me add that in some training schools they are not even given palatable food . It seems to me that were I on duty all night I would want something else for a midnight supper besides a cold potato and a cup of tea . A READER . Staten . Island , March 28 , 1922 . To the Editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with a story published in THE New Yona TIMES of a suit for damages of $100,000 at present pending against the Long Island College Hospital , in which a mother is suing the hospital because her child contracted a local disease while a patient in that hospital , that the legal ground for complaint in this case la based on efactor at present causing great commotion in the nursing world , that factor involving the question whether we shall educate and create a class of attendants who shall do a nurse 's work for less money and who shall have a short and superficial training . Dr. William Mayo , the noted surgeon of Rochester , Minn : , has come out in advocacy of such a class of attendants entering the nursing world . In the present instance the suit for damages against the Long Island College Hosrdtal is based on the contention that an attendant who did not have full nurse 's training transmitted an infection from one child to another . question very deeply Dr. Mayo 's position that we can train attendants who can properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any less education than we are giving now . I also question that we ' can find for any less money intelligence and other qualities that are needed in a nurse . It seems to me that a half-trained person in the nursing profession is a menace to health and may at times , as in the present instance , prove exceedingly expensive . Dr. MARY HALTON . New York , March 17 , 1022 . To the Editor of The New York TinICS : The statement made by Dr. Copeland in this morning 's edition of Tun TImES stirs me to indignation . I expected a clearer , keener conception of the situation to come from Dr. Copeland . Is it tot a proof that women of today are not so dazzled by money as to let salaries be the only consideration when they choose a profession ? When our hospitals make living conditions bearable , food palatable and hours nearly reasonable there will be many a woman happy to enter the field . Is it to be imagined that a person of any mentality wants to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of an inmate in a reform ' institute , and also during those three years work ten hours every day and many days fourteen , and at the same time , perhaps , be supervised by a crabbed personality who graduated in 1888 and can see no eason  --  for making nursing conditions better than they were then ? I am not the manager of a training school , but I employ a certain number of nurses and have so little difficulty in meeting my demands that I am thoroughly convinced that training schools neea not suffer if a little revolutionizing were practiced . HARRIET A. FULDA . New York . March 28 , 1922 . The Building Deadlock . To the Editor of The New-York Times : In your interesting editorial , " The Building Deadlock , " published in Tile Thies today , you say that the employers ' association denounce the plan to develop and maintain efficiency in the . building trades as protweed by Mr. Untermyer and that many disinterested persons , also workmen , agree with the employers in ? believing the plan impracticable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fact that time and again the unions have been charged with encouraging inefficiency . . What then can be more practicable and reasonable than the establishing of an impartial tribunal vested with the power to penalize inefficiency providing inefficiency is proved ? It does not argue for the sincerity of those who have been charging inefficiency when they refuse to accept the only rain which will give them an opportunity ta substantiate their complaints and remedy the evil of which ' they complain . In spite of criticism f tom some quarters , the Building Trades Council has taken a stand in ithis matter which merits the ' approval of the public . The responsibility for the deadlock does not lie with the council . MEMBER BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE . Brooklyn , March 30 , 1922 . Correction and Suggestion . To the Editor of The New York Times : Mentioning the arrival of the Oxford and Cambridge lacrosse team , you talk about the tour of " the two English colleges . " THS TIMES should employ a less ignorant stiff . There are at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge University . Both universities have been heard about for several years . E. V. SPENCER .
