<P> Gloom , distress and shame descended , last week , upon the sleek , waxen faced , bandolined and faintly perfumed gigolos of Paris . <P> These young men have been accustomed to consider themselves superior to their female counterparts . But Prefect of Police Jean Chiappe has now sternly ruled that each gigolo must obtain a license and carry an identity card exactly similar to those issued to common prostitutes . <P> Though the precise origin of the noun gigolo ( zhi-go-lo ) is obscure , it probably derives from the verb gigotter " to kick about , " the adjective gigott " strong sinewed ' ' and the noun gigots " legs , " or " shanks . " <P> Particularly gigott and appetizing was a gigolo who recently invited a bejeweled Manhattan matron , one Mrs. Josephine Neumann , 55 , to ride with him in the forest of St. Germain-en-Laye . The gigolo said he had sold an automobile to Mr. Neumann . Perhaps Mrs. Neumann also would like to purchase an automobile . Together they drove to St. Germain . Then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . But he made no romantic overtures . Instead , he brusquely demanded all her jewels and money . Mrs. Neumann refused . The gigolo grasped her throat , snatched her rings and pocketbook , tore her clothes , beat her , threw her out of the automobile . As Mrs. Neumann started to walk back to Paris she distinctly heard a laugh as the gigolo 's automobile disappeared in the shade of the St. Germain woods . <P> Not only a gigolo but also a thief , is a handsome one-eyed Serb , Djoritch Milan , who admitted to Paris police that he had stolen jewels from the Paris residence of Mrs. William Kissam Vanderbilt . From Mrs. Vanderbilt 's home Milan took an emerald worth $40,000 , several other jewels of lesser value , one imitation pearl necklace , thirteen miniatures , three raw eggs . Milan insulted the Paris gendarmes who captured him , boasted that he was leader of a gang of Serbian thieves .
