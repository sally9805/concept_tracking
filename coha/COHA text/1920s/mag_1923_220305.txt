The following estimates of books most in the public eye were made after careful consideration of the trend of critical opinion : <P> THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD-Philip Gibbs-Doran ( $2.00 ) . If you want to learn about the present state of public affairs in Europe , quite without inconvenience , read The Middle of the Road . If you do n't care about Europe , but would like to read the interesting tale of the estrangement of a young war veteran from his aristocratic modern young wife , here still is the book for you , although Sir Philip is not a great literary artist . <P> THE ENCHANTED APRIL-the author of Elizabeth and Her German Garden-Doubleday ( $1.90 ) . Four London women , leaving their husbands behind them , spend an enchanted April in an Italian castle . The tiny rapier of the author 's wit , her penetration and her sympathy , give the characters reality and the setting charm . <P> GOING-TO-THE SUN-Vachel Lindsay-Appleton ( $1.75 ) . Mr. Lindsay is not crazy . But in the very excited intensity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts and capers in a boisterous exuberance of imagination . He flings images at you-talking flowers , magic roosters " that no storm can tame , " amiable mountain cats , comets . The longest and most flaming of all these poems is called So Much the Worse for Boston . <P> THE GENTLEMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO-I . A. Bunin-Seltzer ( $1.50 ) . These are four Russian short stories worthy to be spoken of in the same breath with those of Tchekov ; two of them-the title story and Gentle Breathing - are almost perfect . Bunin 's plots are unimportant . He has the power to make bald facts live flamingly . <P> SKEETERS KIRBY-Edgar Lee Masters-Macmillan ( $2.00 ) . Skeeters starts in as a boy ; continues through a period of heavy drinking , sexual misbehavior , hard thinking , unsuccessful marrying , and a distasteful attempt at the law : finally finds himself as a poet . The book aims high . Whether it is uniformly successful is open to question . It is , at all events , vivid , powerful-and outspoken . <P> SALOME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish Jewess , from New York 's ghetto , marries a highly refined settlement worker . After a stormy interval she finds him insufficiently passionate and turns to one of her own race . The world as she sees it is the theme of the book . The author knows her subject at first hand and makes it surpassingly vivid .
