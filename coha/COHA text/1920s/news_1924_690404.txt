txt With a demonstration unparalleled in the history of the city , Albany gave Governor Smith today a welcome home from the Democratic National Convention which would have done honor to a " conquering hero " rather than an unsuccessful candidate for the nomination for President . Before thousands of citizens , Mayor Hackett formerly declared that the citizens of the State were not goin  --  to allow Governor Smith to retire Jan. 1 , 1925 , but would see that he stayed in Albany two years more . Protesting that he felt he should , now . retire as a " high private in the ranks , " the Governor expressed his heartfelt appreciation of a demonstration which was beyond all expectation . Albany 's welcome to " Al " Smith , as placards in store windows and on automobiles all over the city proclaimed him , began soon after noon , when the Empire State Express arrived from New York with the Governor , his family and some of his official suite . The station platform was crowded , the waiting room was thronged , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Mayor Hackett , several city and State officials and a band met the Governor and escorted him from the train . " A victor could not have had a finer reception , " the Governor declared , when he reacifed the Executive Mansion . " The people in this section think more of you now than if you had the nomination , " Mayor Hackett declared , adding , with a bang of his fist , " but it 's coming . " Great Parade at Nicht . The real celebration and reception was tonight , however . Mayor Hackett had issued a call to all the citizens , regardless of party , to assemble to meet a great citizen of the State . Bands were placed in eight sections of the city , and there the residents gathered to unite in one big parade to the Executive Mansion . Police of Albany declared the demonstration was unprecedented . A crowd estimated at 15,000 to 20,000 persons Jammed every street leading to the mansion and fell in behind the bands to march past the improvised reviewing stand where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . Colored fire and continually bursting bombs kept the streets light as day as the marchers went by , men and women waving hats , flags and placards , and the Governor stood with his family , smiling , bowing and waving acknowledgment . Citizens from every walk of life joined in the demonstration . Some of Albany 's most prominent business and professional men rubbed elbows with those whose hands still bore the grime of the day 's work in shop or factory . Placards had been improvised with such slogans as : " Al  --  Enough Said , " ** ' 20 , ' 22 , The Jam became so great that it was impossible for the paraders to move , is spite of every effort of the police . An automobile which had been in the Parade was caught and moved several feet in the crush . Mayor Hackett raised- his hand for quiet about the reviewing stand , and said : " Governor Smith , behold the citizens of Albany who bid yoki welcome . You are a real Albanian . We love you , respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I may say that if the citizens of this great country knew you as we know you , you would be a candidate . for President of the United States now . But we may hear this in mind , there is yet time for Governor Smith to be elected to the Presidency on the Democratic ticket . " In the meantime , the-de people here know that you are not going to leave this Bxecutive Mansion on Jan . I , 1925 , you are going to be with us two years more . " " So say we all of us " played the band , and then the Governor responded : " Mr. MayOr , friends and neighbors of Albany , " he said , " if this is a tribute paid to the vanquished , I wo.er what a returning hero would receirlf . I would be a little bit afraid of it . " have been away just a month , and I have had a wonderful experience . I met more dIffdrent kinds of people than I ever thought were in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office mean nothing if they have to be achieved at. - the slightest sacrifice of a principle . " I think we accomplished something for humanity at Madison Square Garden  --  something for the United States . We compelled respect , reverence and devotion to that fundamental principle of American democracy that all men are created equal . " I am satisfied that our country Is so right and is founded on such strong principles that it must survive even against those that , in a moment of passion , would threaten its very foundation . " Now , as to what the Mayor said , of course I like Albany . I have been here during the Winter months for many years and feel like a real Albanian . I ' have spent four years in the city as Governor of the State . And I want to say that it is a hard and trying position . Any one who gives ' four years of his life to the Governorship has given vary generously of himself to the State . And . besides . this house is not my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the crowd yelled , creating a big laugh . " There must come a time , " the Governor continued . " when I must settle down to the serious business of laying aside something for a rainy day. , When I came to Albany this last time , I was getting so much as a truckman that I had to use my Governor 's salary to pay my income tax , and this year I did n't Pay any income tax because I did n't have any income . " I think that you will allow me to take my place as kind of a high private , and I may be able to dcr more even when I have more time . You will have no trouble in finding a worthy successor . -I am very grateful to you all and appreciate this more than I can say . I hope the time will never come when I will be lacking in appreciation of such a demonstration . "                   @ @
