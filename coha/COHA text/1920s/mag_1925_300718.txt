At No. 117 Gramercy Park , Manhattan , an old house was torn down a few months ago and builders began to put up an apartment . Last week a company of notable people in high hats and frock coats gathered to unveil a tablet in memory of the man who used to live in the vanished brownstone edifice - Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll , " the famous infidel . " Onetime Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby , Actress Julia Marlowe , Poet Edgar Lee Masters , made speeches , and those who read the proud colophon upon the tablet and listened to the eloquence of Col. Ingersoll 's admirers , reflected how , 40 years ago , the State of Delaware had offered him an entertainment on its whipping block , and how the bitter attacks of his many enemies filled the newspapers . <P> Robert Green Ingersoll was born in Dresden , N. Y. , in 1833 . To awaken faith in God , his father , a Congregational minister , taught him to reason , with the unhappy result that Ingersoll became an agnostic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no faith . He studied law , was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1857 . In the Civil War he raised a regiment of cavalry , used in his recruiting speeches a natural eloquence unsurpassed in his generation . But it was not until his speech in the Republican Convention of 1876 that he came to national fame as an orator . <P> Robert G. Ingersoll was straight and tall ; he had a rolling voice and the gestures of a king ; words , cadences , images , poured from him like an endless golden cable unwinding from his mouth ; when he addressed a jury he could make the twelve spellbound dolts do whatever he told them , and he often used his genius for the weak , the defenseless , the depraved . After his Convention speech , he could have held political office ; men in the Administration asked him politely would he like to be Minister to Germany ? Attorney General ? Would he , sometime , care to run for President ? Said he : " I do not believe in your God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rancor of religious discussion into politics . . . . " He gave lectures which brought him a vast fortune ; he gave his money away . A famous man called his speech on " The Gods " at Cooper Union , N.Y. , " the boldest , strongest , most vivid utterance of a century . " But thousands of others were displeased with him . He died in 1899.
