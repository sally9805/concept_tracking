Seattle THERE she sits , " Queen of the West ! " Like that ancient , imperial Queen of the West before the West was East , Seattle sprawls over her Seven Hills , pets her pride , and makes her boasts in the shadow of lordly moun ? tains . Lake Washington , eighty miles around , is a shining mirror for her regal beauty ; Lake Union is a gleaming jewel for her girdle ; and Elliott Bay , her green crescent door-mat , leads outward to the spacious waters of the Sound . The jagged Olympics are her westward outposts , looking across the blue Pacific toward the Orient , that rich Hispania of the twentieth century waiting to be gutted by trade as Old Spain was rifled by Roman legions . To the east , die martial Cascade peaks , clad in royal forest-purple and helmeted with snow , keep perpetual watch and ward over their proud mistress . Mt . Rainier ( named for a fat English admiral who never saw the mountain ) holds himself aloof from human eyes most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts through the haze and mist . The Indians called him Tak-ho-mah The Mountain that was God ) and the citizens of Tacoma have spent many years and dollars trying to get the Indian name on the maps . Seattle , however , has blocked every move to change the name . The English admiral and the Queen City still hold the peak , although the view of it is clearer , closer , and more frequent from Tacoma . When God set Paul Bunyan to work making the Puget Sound country , He doubtless had the new Queen City of the West in mind . The site of the city is admirably fitted to make the most of lakes , mountains , and Sound . Almost every house on every hill has " A View . " The islands , bays , and lakeshores provide endless places for beautiful summer homes and resorts , where fishing , boating , bathing , and tramping are possible all the year . Fresh and salt-water dockage and harborage are unlimited . Through the canal connecting the two lakes with the Sound , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-foulage while loading and unloading in the very heart of the city . The climate , too ? note well l ? leaves little to be desired . It is seldom hot and never cold . In spite of the forty-or-so inches of rain per year , the hu ? midity is low and the summer months are little cursed with rain . Snow seldom falls ; there are no electric storms , no tornadoes , no earthquakes ? as yet ? no floods , blizzards , drouths , or other mete ? orological damnation . Gentle breezes , stately coni ? fern , lush leafy trees , beautiful flowers ; all kinds of hunting and fishing within a couple of hours ' drive ; great natural resources of scenery , timber , coal , iron , and rich , though limited , agricultural land . So much for the raw material upon which real ? toric fauna thrive . Seattle is their Promised Land . Next to Los Angeles there is probably no city in the West where the professional and lay " realtors " so nearly merit the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bull . Enterprise has stalked abroad ; the hills have been washed down to make them habitable ; the mud-flats have been filled up by this washing down , and by dredging up the bottom of the Sound . These thousands of acres of re ? claimed industrial sites are pointed to with pride , even though they are still largely devoid of fac ? tories . Signs bid you " Welcome to the Charmed Land " and tell you to come again ; signs say " A Half-Million in 1930 " ( they said " A Half-Million in 1924 , " and also " in 1928 " ) ; newspapers gloat over the rise in bank clearings and building permits , especially when they show excess over the corre ? sponding figures for Portland , gains on Los An ? geles , and improvements over " A Year Ago . " The proud citizen boasts of the climate ? it explains the lower-than-the-U. - S. - average death rate and the very low rate of infant mortality . The " effete East " is explained in terms of climate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , in fact , the very vestibule to Hades in the opinion of the true Seattleite . Tacoma is a " suburb " of Seattle , and Portland is cursed with rain ( sic ! ) , has no harbor , and hence no future ? is , in reality , a mere puff of air , rose-scented . But unkind men have hinted that there are some things lacking in Seattle , that gall and wormwood are mixed with the nectar in the charmed land , and even that Someone Blundered in making the Puget Sound country , to wit : 1 . For nine months , the rain it raineth every day , and the fog it foggeth also . 2 . The Emerald Hills , they slide eternally , so that a man 's front yard may be found in his neigh- bor 's back yard ever and anon , and vice versa. 3 . Grading and regrading are ever-present bur ? dens on the defenseless taxpayer . At the present time the city is nearly insolvent , what with master ? ing the natural environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of in ? creasing automotive transportation , buying power sites for a " City of a Million in the Near Future , " preparing the harbor for all the trans-Pacific trade , and seeking to actualize other dreams . But bonds are harsh taskmasters and interest must be paid . 4 . The Finest Harbor in the World has no hin ? terland . Three-fourths of the area of Washing ? ton is naturally tributary to Portland . The same is true of the whole Inland Empire , including all of Idaho , part of Nevada , Utah , and Canada ? in short , all of the Columbia basin . Jim Hill , the god ? father of Seattle , once said that the freight outlet for the Columbia basin eventually must be through the Port of Astoria . He backed his judgment with many millions , built the North Bank road into Portland and erected a great terminal at the mouth of the Columbia . He believed that the greatest population concentration in the Northwest would ultimately be somewhere on the lower Columbia . For a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship freight over the High Cascades into Seattle than it was to follow the water grade to Portland . But those halcyon days are no more . The Great Northern is attempting to meet the situation by boring a twelve-mile tunnel under the mountains . The foresighted Seattle busi ? ness men are trying to promote a highway tunnel under the Cascades to drain eastern Washington and northern Idaho into Seattle . These look like gestures of desperation , but with the ictus of pres ? tige and the punch of promotion it may work . The result is on the laps of the traffic gods , but it seems unlikely that tunnels can permanently counteract the pull of gravity down the Columbia . The differ ? ential grade may win now that the differential rates are gone . " All roads lead to Rome , " but they lead over exceeding high mountains . The natural roads lead to Portland down the Columbia . Tunnels that can not reach the water-grade do not make good Appian Ways . So there she sits ? Queen City of the West , rul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbors with a ( comparatively ) dwindling trans-Pacific fleet . Van ? couver , Prince Rupert , Portland-Astoria , San Fran ? cisco , and even Los Angeles , are disputing her aspiration for hegemony in the oriental trade . Hemmed in by mountains , she must increasingly seek her destiny in fish , forest , and tourist , rather than in transcontinental and trans-Pacific com ? merce . She will probably reach her million in time ? but not in 1940 . If a city may be said to have a personality , one might say that Seattle is characterized by vast egoism and vaunting ambition in the face of great obstacles and many disappointments . In 1851 , John N. Low and Lee Terry came up from Port ? land and laid out a town-site at Alki Point on Elliott Bay . A hint of the " Seattle spirit " is sug ? gested in the name they gave to the new town --  New York . But it did not flourish as they antici ? pated , so they changed the name to " New York Alki , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long until the town was moved across the bay to the present site of Seattle and named Seattle in honor of Chief Sealth , a noble red man who wasconsistently friendly to the whites up to his death in 1889 . Every year an impressive memorial ser ? vice is held over his grave . One of the first blows of misfortune fell upon the city in 1 8 8 9 , when it was completely destroyed by fire . But the citizens immediately held a mass-meeting and planned to build a " Bigger and Better Seattle , " and soon came magic days . In ' 98 the Arctic Golconda began to pour its treasures into the lap of the hill-throned queen . In 1900 , the popula ? tion was over 80,000 . By 1910 , Seattle had passed through one of the greatest booms in the history of any city . A second blow soon fell , however . Perhaps it was the natural reaction from the Exposition boom , or the belated effects of the panic of 1908 , or the decline of the Alaska excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years after 1909 there was a decided slump , until the War made increased demands for timber products and the Finest Harbor came into its own . Shipbuild ? ing , aeroplane spruce , and naval training then all played their part . It is true the Wobblies were still in evidence , giving Carleton Parker a chance to make a bid for fame . There was a marked depres ? sion shortly after the War , characterized by some unpleasantness such as the Great General Strike , when Ole Hanson " saved the city from the Reds , " water-front strikes , Centralia " massacres " and lynching , Bellingham Wobbly riots , much unem ? employment , large-scale bootlegging , street-railway purchases , purchase of power sites that can not be used , et al . These menaces have all been safely overcome . Some things of interest emerged from the above catalogue of horrors . In the first place , Ole Hanson , having " saved the city from the Reds , " reaped his just reward on lecture tour and by being mentioned for Vice-President in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting the city to pay $16,000,000 for a street railway , without enough electric power to run it , worth about half that sum . The city had to build its own light and power plants to run the street-railway system . In spite of the bad buy , the street-car service is good and at least as cheap as in most cities that have pri ? vate systems . The light and power rates are much lower . In the second place , as an aftermath . of the water-front strikes , the ' Waterfront Employers As ? sociation learned some lessons . They put their em ? employment in the hands of a Mr. Foisie , a trained social worker with vision and organizing genius . The result is an almost complete decasualization of longshore work . A large percentage of the workers own their own homes and are contented , progres ? sive citizens . Mr. Foisie 's methods are being widely adopted . Thirdly , the great bootlegging ring organized by an ex-police lieutenant , Roy Olmstead , was recently rounded up by federal agents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged to have in ? volved from four to ten million dollars . Largely as a result of the notoriety from the Olmstead case , Bertha K. Landes , wife of the Dean of the College of Science at the State University , was elected Mayor on a clean-up platform , ably backed by the Women 's City Club and the Municipal League . Both the organizations named , and particularly the latter , have furnished a hopeful political leaven in the affairs of the city ? not always thoroughly ap ? preciated , however , as is attested by the twice-re ? peated defeat of the League 's city-manager plan and the summary dismissal of Frank J. Laube , now secretary of the League , from his position on the faculty of the University because he allowed his name to appear upon the city 's primary ballot . Mrs. Landes ' administration , while not com ? pletely successful in its clean-up program , acquitted itself on the whole very creditably ; the police de ? partment , under suspicion in the Olmstead case , was reorganized and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the " clean-up " was very thorough or permanent , but prostitution , gambling , and bootlegging were at least driven under cover . In March of this year Mrs. Landes was land ? slided out of office to the tune of 20,000 votes out of about 90,000 cast . Her opponent spent ( or at least reported ) about $28,000 , while Mrs. Landes spent nearly $13,000 as against her salary of $15 ? 000 for her two years as mayor . It is difficult to explain her defeat . All the leading papers , the Municipal League , women 's clubs , and all the forces of respectability supported her . The con ? sensus of opinion seems to be that she was defeated because of a deep-seated prejudice against women in politics . Seattle and its woman mayor had be ? come a stock Pullman-smoker joke . So the first wo ? man mayor of a major American city makes her exit . Seattle 's tenderloin district is called the " Skid-road , " or more commonly , " Below the Line . " Here fruit-pickers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gobs , " casuals of every sort , are gathered in great numbers . Seattle is winter quarters for most of the casual workers and unemployed of the whole Northwest . Yesler Way , named for the man who built the first saw-mill in Seattle , runs through the heart of the district . The forty-two-story Smith Building , still the pride of Seattle 's magnificent sky ? line , towers above a motley array of cheap shows , dance-halls , card rooms , pool-rooms , " slave mar ? kets , " cheap rooming houses , blind-pigs , missions , pawnshops , second-hand stores , shooting galleries run by scantily clad , highly painted ladies , quack medicine joints , houses of ill-fame , and other in ? dices of disorganization . This used to be the center of the city , but due to the northward movement , it has become a sink-hole for the down-and-outers ? Seattle 's Hobohemia . It is adjacent to Jap-town , China-town , Negro-town , the railroad yards , the County-City Building and the city jail . // On any Saturday night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cockney Communist orator , haranguing his cohorts of discontent . The Wobbly Spielers and the " Jesus Jazzers , " as he calls them , are his particular enemies . They all try to drown his profane words of wisdom with holy words , sal ? vation songs and blatant brass ; he merely moves to another corner and takes most of the crowd with him . Likewise , the " Long-Haired Preachers " are often in evidence . They are a group of religious devotees , shoeless , unshaven and unshorn , who make a specialty of preaching to bare stone walls the doctrine that " Many now living will never see death . " Their Prophet is one Daniel Sawlt , a patriarchal dissenter from the House of David . In contrast to the above conditions , there are numerous Forces of Righteousness . The Catholics have orphanages , old peoples ' homes , cathedrals and other institutions on the tops of most of the many hills . In a noble edifice on the brow of Capi ? tol Hill , the Reverend Mark A. Matthews , a stately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest Presbyterian congre ? gation in the world spell-bound with the gospel of Fundamentalism . He , like Aimee McPherson , has his own broadcasting station . Below the citadel of the Ancient Gospel , the Reverend Mr. Hawkins preaches extreme Modernism in the Pilgrim Con ? gregational Church . At one time , he had on his staff Dr. J. J. B. Morgan , an eminent psychiatrist , who played the part of a Modernist father confessor in adjusting disturbed personalities and applying psychiatric balm to wounded souls . Out in the uni ? versity district , the Methodists arc building a mil ? lion-dollar " Temple and Plant " on the very edge of the campus . Their pastor is a real liberal who began life as a child laborer in the coal mines of Corn ? wall . The University Y. M. C. A. was also a rather liberal place until recently . It gave forum privileges to Scott Nearing , Albert Weisborg , Kenneth Lindsay , et al . Soon after , the ambitious secretary lost his official head . The Queen City has not neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commercial power . Her libraries and schools are first-class . The latter , however , are carefully pro ? tected from the pernicious influence of married women-teachers , none of whom may be employed . The University of Washington has about 10,000 students , a first-rate football team , a monster stadium , and a sometimes Champion Crew . The city boasts of a Civic Opera , a fair symphony or ? chestra , and is now building a million-dollar civic auditorium . It has a fine outlay of city parks , golf links , playgrounds , and bathing beaches . Washing ? ton , D. C. , is the only city that has more park area per capita than Seattle . Seattle is also the proud possessor of a fine monument on the very spot where the late lamented noble martyred President , Warren G. Harding , made his last public address . It looks out upon the Zoo , where monkeys and laughing hyenas gibber and howl . In discussing the cultural side of life , one must not neglect the Mountaineers , an organization to which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to scenic points , " leading the fair , frail , and fat , clad in thick shirts , high shoes and " tin breeches , " up to the tops of high mountains , where they admire the view and in due course slide down upon the leather seats of their pants . Nor must one neglect to mention the up-and-coming Chamber of Commerce which has lately given one of its own second-Vice-Presidents to be ? come President of the University of Washington , presumably under the advice and protection of His Excellency , Governor Roland G. Hartley , who fired President Suzzallo and the whole Board of Regents for no reason thus far divulged . The Lions , Ki ? wanians , Rotarians and Realtors make minor music for the Chamber of Commerce 's diapason booming . The WTobblies are destroyed , the unions are much decayed , the Tunnels are being built , build ? ing is booming , the Mountain can be seen ( some ? times ) , the Tourists are coming , the fish are being caught ? things are looking up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . She surely has the will , is earnest , honest , and persever ? ing ? she must succeed or the Chamber of Com ? merce philosophy is all wrong .
