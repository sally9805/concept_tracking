The Presidential Train of Old Paul von Hindenburg rolled into Berlin , last week , with its heating apparatus most unfortunately not functioning . The honored passengers were Their Majesties the Amir &; Queen of Afghanistan who , with almost their entire suite , appeared to be suffering from colds . They arrived from Caux , Swiss-Alpine resort , where they have been recuperating from previous official entertainment at Rome , Paris &; Brussels ( TIME , Jan. 23 , Feb. 6 ) . Last week as Amir Amanullah , ' ' The Light of the World , " emerged again into the limelight he was gravely greeted by the solemn figure of President Hindenburg in tight broadcloth coat and high silk hat . Less formal was an immediately subsequent greeting administered by Socialist Prime Minister of Prussia Otto Braun , who violently shook the Amir 's hand . Meanwhile Old Paul von Hindenburg presented a bunch of orchids with ponderous gallantry to Queen Thuraya . <P> Because Their Majesties are the first reigning sovereigns to visit Berlin officially since the War , their reception last week included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upstanding greenery and many an Afghan &; German flag . The famed Prince Albrecht Palace had been entirely renovated for their reception . <P> As the Royal &; Presidential party swept up from the station and through the Brandenburg Gate , a crowd of some 30,000 saw with amazement that the last motor in the procession was bright red and driven by Friedrick Wilhelm , onetime German Crown Prince &; Crown Prince of Prussia . Uninvited , he had merrily slipped up behind . Prudent , he soon turned down a side street amid scattered cheers and more booes . <P> Throughout the week Amir Amanullah pursued a strenuous routine . At his request all banquet speeches were cut to bare minimums of compliment . Thus time was gained in which His Majesty visited numerous industrial plants and later the great Tempelhofer flying field . There he was presented with a 10-passenger 3-motored plane worth some $60,000 . Doubtless the makers hope for future cash orders from Afghanistan , but last week " The Light of the World " did not so much as take a trial sweep in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a military review , during which Reichswehr troops first goose-stepped in mass formation and then staged a sham battle enlivened by dummy tanks , wooden howitzers and other substitutes for weapons which the Treaty of Versailles forbids to Germany . <P> Interest keened at a statement from Amir Amanullah 's resplendent Minister of State . This functionary affirmed that His Majesty still regards with " uncompromising hostility " the British Empire , from which he wrested Afghan independence in 1921 . Nonetheless the Amir will shortly visit London , " because of a desire to see our worst enemies at home . "
