txt " The motto on our coins , " says Professor Joan IsE , in his book , " The United States Oil Policy , " " should not " be made our national policy in pro " viding a future oil supply . " This should be kept in mind in considering the Federal Oil Conservation Board 's report . Conservation is the duty not only of the Federal but of each State Government . There have been disagreeing estimates of the quantity of oil still left in our soil . The President 's board should speak with authority , after a year of investigation , when it says that total reserve wells are about 4,500,000,000 barrels  --  about enough for six years ' supply , if the United States does not import oil . In 1925 , the Committee of Eleven of the American Petroleum Institute , made up of expert oil men , placed the reserves at 5,300,000,000 barrels , and belieVed that there would still be left in the sands after the wells had ceased to flow 26,000,000,000 barrels , which could be recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a production of 9,000,000,000 barrels in the United States up to June 30 , 1926 , 3,000,000 , - 000 must be credited to the last five years . Our consumption is increasing so fast that early conservation becomes imperative . The United States is consuming 70 per cent . of the world 's oil supply . " Future maintenance of even current supplies , " says ' the President 's board , " implies the constant discovery of new fields . " It adds the comforting statement that " hitherto there has been no failure to " discover such new fields as were re " quired . " Still , our national experience is that other natural resources have been depleted . The board says : There must be natural concern over our future supply of oil because of the manifest dependence or so large a part of our industrial life , national defense and domestic comfort upon continued adequate supplies of lubricants for all machinery and fuel for automotive engines . The President 's board does not reflect upon the Committee of Eleven 's estimate of a billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing and proven area in the " United States is asserted to be in ex " cess of 3,000,000 acres . " It cuts in half the Committee of Eleven 's total of 26,000,000,000 barrels procurable by working the sands where wells have stopped flowing . One hundred leaders of the oil industry discussed all phases of it with the board in February . It hopes for an addition to the oil supply by extending the process of " cracking . " It thinks that SO per cent . of the oil now going into fuel can be treated in this way . Improvement of mechanical devices that use oil products is urged . Shale , the board believes , would afford an unlimited reserve , because many shales yield a barrel of oil per ton ; but nothing is said about the expense of the process . Something must be done to stop baste in competition . In a single field $200,000,000 has been lost by waste The Federal Government has a great deal of promising oil land not yet developed . It must provide for our naval needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the conclusions of the President 's board . The latter makes no better recommendation than that of active cooperation between the oilproducing States , unless it is that the Federal and the State Governments act in unity to regulate oil and gas production .
