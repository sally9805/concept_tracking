Pennsylvania Millions <P> Senator James A. Reed of Missouri last week had the time of his life . He was just digging into the expenditures lying under the recent Pennsylvania primary for Senator , and though his colleagues on the special investigating committee took some part , he , as often , had the centre of the stage . <P> Highlights . Mr. Vare was placed on the stand and he admitted that besides his contribution of $71,000 to his campaign he had signed a note for $100,000 to help campaign finances . Mayor Kline of Pittsburgh was questioned about a speech he was alleged to have made to city employes declaring that if they did not vote for Pepper they would be separated from the city payroll . This he vehemently denied . Colonel Eric Fisher Wood , Chairman of the Pepper Committee , admitted that a letter favoring Pepper had been published by his committee which purported to be signed by William Green , President of the American Federation of Labor but was a forgery . He said that the publicity department had received it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Totals . The campaign committees filed their expenditures as required by law in Pennsylvania , and showed approximately $1,620,000 spent for the Pepper ticket , $670,000 spent for the Vare ticket and $195,000 spent for Pinchot . <P> Expectations . The Democrats had already begun to make the Pennsylvania primary an issue . It seems quite likely that there will be a bitter fight in the next Congress to prevent the seating of Vare if he is elected , and there is no small likelihood that an effort will be made to put on record Senators who come up for election as to whether they will vote to unseat Vare . <P> Anti-Saloon League . Senator Reed called Wayne B. Wheeler , general counsel and " legislative representative " of the Anti-Saloon League . The pretext for calling him was that he had sent the committee information that Wet interests had contributed to Mr. Vare 's campaign but the real reason was that Senator Reed has been eager to dig into the affairs of the Anti-Saloon League . During an interval in the hearings , Mr. Wheeler looking rather worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Will I be called this morning ? " <P> he asked . <P> " Who are you ? " snorted Senator Reed . <P> " I 'm Wheeler , " was the mild answer . " I would like to know because I have an appointment at 11:30 . " <P> " I think you 'd better cancel it , " said the Senator sharply .
