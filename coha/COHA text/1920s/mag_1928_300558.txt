Out of one pocket the U. S. citizenry pays for Prohibition , out of another for bootleg liquor . Next year the enforcement funds will be some 37 millions-$13,500,000 for the Prohibition Bureau , $14,686,798 for the Coast Guard , $9,000,000 for the Department of Justice . The House passed on the first two items last week . <P> How much the smugglers and their customers spend is a matter for guesswork . But Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , U. S. Assistant Attorney-General , was able to put a figure , in her annual report , on at least one item-$18,883,541 worth ( Canadian value ) of Canadian whiskies exported to the U. S. in 1928 . Previous years : 1925 , 10.7 millions ; 1926 , 15.4 millions ; 1927 , 17.1 millions . <P> The Ways &; Means Committee of the House asked Prohibition Commissioner Doran how far his $13,500,000 enforcement allotment would go . " It is a matter of policy , " he replied . " If Congress wants to embark in the police business it will take $300,000,000 a year and a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three hundred millions is about the total sum spent on enforcement since Prohibition became the law . <P> According to Dr. Doran and his men , smuggling by sea has been suppressed to one-eighth or one-fifth of what it used to be when Rum Rows twinkled off the coasts at Christmas time . According to Mrs. Willebrandt , the Canadian traffic " continues to be unsolved . " It is on that front that the Prohibiters will work hardest next year . A step projected is to revise the U. S.-Canadian anti-smuggling treaty , which now provides only that Canada shall advise the U. S. of liquor clearances from her ports . Perhaps Canada will be induced to declare it illegal for her liquor-men to sell to U. S. customers . <P> A step taken last week was the indictment , by the Federal Grand Jury in Buffalo of 30 Canadian distillers and their agents , including Board-Chairman Harry C. Hatch of the Hiram Walker-Gooderham &; Worts distillery , Canada 's largest . The offense charged : conspiracy-to-smuggle . The significance : none , unless Distiller Hatch &; friends set foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be extradited.
