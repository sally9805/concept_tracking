THE LAST SEPTEMBER-Elizabeth Bowen-Dial Press ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Story . At Danielstown , charming county seat near Cork , lived Sir Richard and Lady Naylor ; lived also a niece , Lois , a nephew Lawrence , and many a lingering guest . At the moment it was the Montmorencys who lingered : she because of Danielstown itself- " doorways had framed a kind of expectancy of her ; some trees in the distance , the stairs , a part of the garden , seemed always to have been lying secretly at the back of her mind " - and he because of Marda Norton . Marda was leaving next day , to visit her fiance in Kent . Meanwhile she walked with Montmorency- and Lois-along the river toward a deserted mill . <P> " The river darkened and thundered towards the mill race , light came full on the high faade of decay . Incredible in its loneliness , roofless , floorless , beams criss-crossing the dank interior daylight , the whole place tottered , fit to crash at a breath . Hinges rustily bled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Marda wanted to explore-and incidentally to escape Montmorency ; she and Lois ventured into the gloom , relishing a fear that was " a kind of deliciousness . " A crop of nettles , a dead cow , and by the stairs a prostrate lump that was a man . Sleepily he stirred , instinctively levelled his pistol at them ; accidentally it went off , nipped Marda in the hand . The girls explained they were merely out for a walk ; the man snarled it was time they gave up walking-for he was a Black- &-Tan,; exhausted from days of guerrilla warfare , and they were the Irish aristocracy that ignored his existence , gave tennis teas for English officers . <P> One of these , a subaltern , loved Lois- genuinely ; but not pugnaciously enough to defy her aunt 's disapproval : he had neither riches nor pride of family , his relatives lived vaguely in Surrey , and that , thought Aunt Myra , would never do . Lois , for her part , loved , but did not bestir herself to contradict her aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol , was shot from ambush , Aunt Myra thought it sad , and continued her teas . Lois pondered , to no avail , and went abroad to get on with her French . But that was their last bland September ; by the next , revolutionary incendiaries had laid fiery waste to Danielstown . <P> The Significance . Such , expressed with infinite restraint , is the terrific indictment against an indifferent generation . A girl 's lover is killed-she feels no emotion ; a country is in revolt , " the best people " pay no attention . Not that they do not love their Ireland : their patriotism flowers in smart patter about their vulgar cousins , the English- " they tell the most extraordinary things-about their , husbands , their money affairs , their insides . They do n't seem discouraged by not being asked . And they all seem so intimate with each other ... of course they seem very definite and practical , but it is a pity they talk so much . . . .
