Cox , who was beaten for President in 1920 by the Hays-managed , Oil-financed Harding campaign , rode down New York Harbor on a cutter , to meet Mrs. Cox , who was returning from Europe . Ship-news reporters asked Mr. Cox about Mr. Hays .

During my Presidential campaign , almost eight years ago , I dwelt repeatedly on a $15,000,000 ' slush fund ' which I accused the Republican Party of receiving . . . . There are untold funds that went to the Harding campaign fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all probability . <P> " I have definitely retired from politics . . . . "
