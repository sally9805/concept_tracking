LORD KELVIN was once visiting a northern town ; and , in his honor , an admiring Dominie had planned an oral examination . To show off his pupils ' knowledge , he asked whether any boy could tell the famous scientist what electricity was . One bright lad raised his hand . But it was not his turn . " Well , sir , " at last said the good schoolmaster , " what is electricity ? " " Please , sir , " replied the boy , " I have forgotten . " " Too bad , top bad , " exclaimed Lord Kelvin , sadly , " And he is probably the only chap who knew . " This anecdote may have recurred to many who are curious to learn what the wise ones know about the great , strange , new force which is to save or destroy us . I call it for convenience , a " new " force , but the existence of this special form of energy has , for years past , not been a secret to our scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matter termed electrons ; and to laymen it is still at most a name . Distinguished scientists have written pamphlets on this wondrous natural agency . But they have wrapped up their meanings in cryptic formulae . It was not without submitting to snubs that I was able to get side lights thrown on the mystery . My investigations were regarded as the vain gropings of a weak and foolish child . Yet surely laymen might be pardoned for some  |p1836  human curiosity as to what they and the world could hope or fear of a potentiality which , as some have declared , might smash the universe . From time to time , alone on their high towers , astrono mers have chronicled the quick blotting out in space of what seemed planets . It has been hinted , if not argued , more than once of late , that these startling disappearances may have been due to the misus* ' ' ' , by unknown scientists in other spheres , of what I have called tentatively the electronic force . Mere guesswork , and possibly nonsense , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British Association , in Edin burgh , electrons and their relationship to atoms were dis cussed at length . We learned that all matter was made up of one single mother substance , a combination of minute positive and negative particles of electricity , which at tracted and repelled one another . The positive particles had been christened " protons , " while the negative particles were called " electrons . " We also learned that the stability of matter , the persist ence of the universe itself , was due to the inter-relationship of the positives and the negatives . The disturbance of the balance by which protons and electrons neutralized one another , might spell calamity . We were told much about the good that might result if the great force were only harnessed . But , if the force were in clumsy hands ? What then ? It comforted me slightly to be told in London a short time ago , by no less an authority than Sir Robert Hadfield , that there was no immediate danger to humanity from the new force . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the disruption of the universe by electronic energy are talking bosh . Nature moves slowly , and this universe of ours has en dured for aeons . If Faraday came back to us and saw how electricity has developed since his day , he might regard it as a terrifying agency . "  |p1837  Sir Ernest Rutherford , like Sir Oliver Lodge and others to whom I addressed myself , objects to discussing science from the layman 's point of view . No one knows more about the electronic force than he , not even Moseley or Soddy or our own Millikan . Rutherford and Lodge have made wonderful revelations . But both these wise men have a hateful way of proclaiming what they know in terms of algebra ! One fact , however , does stand out : the fact that , in the course of experiments in the Cavendish Laboratory , at Cambridge University , the internal energy of the electron was " tapped and measured . " But , to go back to the beginning . What is an electron ? Not some new-fangled kind of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . According to Sir William Bragg , and others , the elec tron is " nature 's unit of electricity , " and the smallest of all particles of matter yet discovered . The atom has been overhauled , probed , subdivided . It is now known that atoms are composed of multitudes of protons and electrons ; all , of course , imperceptible to the most powerful microscope . The electronic forte ( some name it atomic force ) appar ently resides only in what scientists have called the nucleus , or proton ; a minute positive particle around which revolve negative electrons , much as the planets move around the sun . Professor J. W. Nicholson , of Balliol College , Oxford , obliged me with this explanation : " The atom is a miniature solar system . In this system the positive electron , or nucleus , is as the sun , with a posi tive charge of electricity . It is surrounded by negative elec trons which revolve around it . But negative electrons re pel one another whereas planets attract one another . The proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elec trons to protons , ? in atoms varies . In the atom of hydro gen , the lightest so far known , there are eighteen hundred negative electrons . The atom of oxygen has fourteen times ,  |p1838  the atom of radium has two hundred and twenty-four times , the atom of uranium has two hundred and thirty-six times , the mass of the hydrogen atom . " When atoms group themselves to form higher or more complex forms of matter , the resulting aggregations are named molecules . In order to form troops , they lose part of their motion , come closer together , and revolve around one another , constituting enties called compounds . As they combine , the atoms give out light and heat ; light be ing a wave movement in the ether , and heat a molecular motion . Matter is now regarded as composed of positive and nega tive electricity . The negative particles are the so-called electrons , the electron being the ultimate unit of electricity . This unit is infinitely small , light , and mobile . Two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its neighbor , would extend only over a distance of one centi meter . As to its mass , a thousand million , million , million electrons weigh only a single grain . Very little is yet clear as to the composition of the proton . But from an experiment of Rutherford , who broke up the nitrogen atom into hydrogen and helium , it seems probable that it is itself partly made up of negative electrons . The problem with which scientists in many lands are at this moment wrestling is as to whether it is impossible to let loose the energy contained in positive electrons , ? the protons or nuclei of atoms . The German physicists and chemists , we may be sure , have not neglected the experi ments of Lodge and Rutherford , of Bragg and Millikan and Soddy . What they are up to we can only guess . ( The mysterious explosion which took place at Oppau set many thinking ) . That they are up to something , who can doubt ? Something inspired by the old , kindly dream of " Deutschland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question lightly . But within the past ten years , we have seen many prodigies . We shiver as we read of the tremendous radio-activity which  |p1839  is supposed to be packed , somehow , in the proton . This radio-activity is due to " the rebellion of an atomic nucleus against over-packing of constituent positive and negative electrons , with the positives in a great majority . " For ele ments of positive electricity must repel one another , and can only be held together by the presence of negatives . If the positives preponderate too greatly , the negatives can no longer keep the peace . This sounds alarming , if rather vague . But to scientists it means much . A faint notion of the force may be divined when it is said that the energy of the electrons massed in a tiny piece of chalk might be sufficient to drive the Leviathan across the Atlantic , or to hoist a battleship from the sea to the summit of Mount Everest . It might enable terrifically quick pro jectiles , of enormous size , to be fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , ? a big " if , " ? some process could be hit on ! Heaven only knows how many minds are at this moment straining to find out how to de tach negative electrons in great quantities from protons . Sir Ernest Rutherford has so far succeeded only in detach ing two or three ; which in effect is negligible . Some good , though , has already been accomplished . Sir William Bragg not long ago laid stress on the immense im portance of the electron in mechanics . Thanks to the study of electrons , he declared , " We are now able to express quantitatively laws and relations which have hitherto been matters of mere surmise . " The whole world of experimental physics " is now full of a new life ; and , when an advance is made in the realm of physics , all other natural sciences must feel the impulse . " Before scoffing at electrons , the massed tiniest particles yet known of matter , we must learn what mass means in the modern electrical theory . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of matter only in bulk ; and this matter consists of a vast concourse of posi tive and negative units of electricity , practically equal in total amount , and thus neutralizing one another and provid/ ing no outside electrical effects , from ordinary matter , which we can experience , or even measure with delicate instruments in the laboratory . " The mass of matter is the etotal added mass of all the electric charges which compose it . This , after all , we can perceive and measure . In all cases in which what British physicists call " statisxical phenomena " appear , we may lose sight of the real genesis of these phenomena . The ultimate constituents of matter , ? positive and negative electricity , ? possess , however , certain properties . Some , as , for instance , mass , are found in both kinds and have only to be added together . Others are opposed and produce nothing observable , when the two kinds are equally represented . " Statistical phenomena " belong to a large concourse of units , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up of myriads of electrons . You , I , our dogs and cats , the air , the fields , are merely innumerable electrons grouped together . The number of electrons , or units of electricity , contained in any visible piece of matter , is almost incalculable . The mass they form can , on the other hand , be weighed and calculated . Electricity and electrons may be said , in a rough way , to be synonymous . The transfer of electricity from point to point consists always in the transfer of electrons . The electric current is , as Sir William Bragg declares , a hurrying stream of electrons ; and the electrons have a rythmic , spiral movement. - Our electrical machinery concerns itself with setting electrons in motion , giving them energy , and then withdrawing it . Till lately it had not been found possible to make them move fast enough , in spaces sufficiently empty of air and other gases , to measure their mass and charges . It is speed which gives separate existence to moving electrons ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presence to us . The terrific force of electrons caused by the disintegration of the radium atom is now known and proved . But ire at scientists are searching for elements more powerful  |p1841  and deadly than radium , and studying wave movements of ether in their effect on matter , with a view to shaking loose the electrons from certain materials , and thus producing new beneficent or maleficent energies . There seems no limit to the amazing possibilities of the electronic force . It has already , we are told , helped in the solution of the problem of wireless telephony . By com binations of electrons we ' may some day find it possible to transmute all metals , to transform harmful into useful substances , to improve travel by increasing the rapidity of our transportation , to dispense with coal and oil and devise new kinds of heat and light . And only a few years ago the world had hardly heard of electrons . The atom was supposed to be the smallest of existing forms of matter . There are two kinds of electronic energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the energy concerned in the keeping , in close proximity , of the planetary electrons and the nucleus , the usual distance between an electron and a nucleus being about one hundred millionth of a centi metre . Chemical changes and combustions are a result of the detachment of one or more o , f those electrons , and heat generated in a chemical change is an instance of elec tronic energy becoming available . If they could all be removed , a quite remarkable amount of energy would be pro duced , even in a single atom . To remove , electrically , the single electron from a hydrogen atom requires a potential gradient of about twenty volts in a centimetre , and the difli culty of removing successive electrons from a complex atom increases on a sort of " compound interest " plan , till millions of volts could not remove many electrons , ? as we are as sured , ? from , say , a sodium atom . But the energy concerned here , great though it may he , is as nothing in comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the energy locked up in the nucleus , and involved in its tight packing . The breaking off of any bit of a nucleus , ? say , the shoot ing off of a negative electron as a B particle , or of a posi tively charged particle as an X ray , constitutes radio-activ/ become unstable , overloaded with positive or negative , or of such a nature that the velocities of the charges are so stupendous in their tiny orbits in the atomic sucture that one shoots off at a tangent . That the energy involved in these nuclear phenomena transcends anything of which we have experience is shown by the fact that nothing we can now do by the application of intense heat , or of great electrical force , or any other ordinary mechanical agency , can make the slightest direct impression on a nucleus , or cause it to , become more or less radio-active ( or inclined to shoot off particles ) than it was before . Happily , it may be , for humanity , scarcely any of this energy is yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now release it from the atom by any known means ex cept that lately discovered by Sir Ernest Rutherford , who , by bombarding atoms with what are technically termed H particles from a radio-active atom , has been able to let loose other B particles , but not on a scale which would be of the slightest interest , in practice , to power experts . Next , even if we could set free the energy , we could not , in the present state of our knowledge , lay hold of it . An electron treats everything in its path like a sieve with very large holes ; and a stream of so called B particles , which are merely very fast electrons , can not be captured by the gross agencies just now at our disposal . But what may happen in a hundred years from now ? Say what they will , those scientists who would limit the potentialities of creative or inventive minds are only guess ing . Things which , two centuries or more ago , would have been ascribed to black magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , a doctor of recognized standing has , under the surveillance of expert confreres , succeeded in mummifying a dead hand , which he now uses in his study as a paper-weight . Professor Frederick Soddy of Oxford believes it prob able that electronic energy will one day do the labor of  |p1843  the world . But he adds : " Should that day ever arrive , let no one suppose that such an acquisition to the physical resources of humanity can safely be entrusted to those who in the past have converted into a curse the blessings already conferred by science , " What could protect the world against the evil use of this great force ? What could preve : Lt some human fiend from blotting out a race he abhorred ? Law would be laughed at by a man who could by a turn of the wrist lay the earth in ruins . The scientists have suggested a variety of annihilations for this world of ours , ? all gloomy to contemplate . We have been told it will go up in smoke ; we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a pros pect of sudden and sure destruction by clumsy manipula tion of a vague new force . Perhaps in fifty or a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand years ! The universe may have endured for aeons ; but none the less it does go forward . Eppur si muove . And the vol canoes have given us hints of what it can accomplish when roused .  |p1844
