txt The accrued interest on the Iloreign loans of the United States is over $943,000,000 , working along toward the billion dollar mark . The loans themselves are over $11,000,000,000 . An interest payment now would meet a quarter of the American budget and could decrease taxation here as nothing else can . It is said that the debtor nations will use the debt as a trading point in the Washington con. ference .. What is to be gained by the trade , with the debtors making offers for their own advantage , is not apparent , but the United States as the erect . itor might propose some settlements . ? The debtors will not be pressed for cash , but they Might bo for equivalents , France and Great Britain have the largest sums . The British are owed a great deal of money- by their allies . We might say that virtually they have guaranteed loans made through Great Britain and upon her responsibility to the other nations . If Great Britain could collect she could pay , but she can not collect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be used as equivalents of cash . The British West Indies have no commercial importance to the empire and they have military importance only as against the United States . Their original inifitary importance died when France and Spain disappeared out of the southern Atlantic and Caribbean waters .

It is better to be in a position of responsibility , than one of danger . The French have Pacific islands in strategic relation to the Panama canal . They are of no value to the French except HS they furnish a few inactive posts for French ? Metals . If our allies want to make a payment with an equivalent of cash they could turn the islands in and allow the United States to clear up a situation which has too many loose ends for American good . The United States would have been in luck if it had taken all the Spanish Pacific islands in 1898 and had not allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then to Japan . That double play may in fact have retired our side , without our being aware of it yet . There is also the possibility of using the debts to ease up the German reparations . The refunding bill now contains a provision by which the consent of congress is required for the substitution of German bonds for the bonds of the allies . The United States has a financial stake in the German financial condition . When Germany becomes a going concern again everything will be on a sounder basis . A great deal of cash is due the United States from friendly nations , and the United States does not expect to get much of It soon . A great deal of cash must be paid by Germany to these nations , and Germany says that she may col. lapse under the payment . If the allies made partial payment to the United States in German bonds paid to them the pressure would be taken off In two directions . The United States , would take the burden of cash payments oft Germany and allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing its ( hilies for sums the lending of which seems to have rased further obligations on America and to make her an ungracious money loaner.
