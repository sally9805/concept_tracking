" I choose to run for the Republican nomination for Congressman-at-large from Illinois in the April primary of 1928 , " said Mrs. Ruth Hanna McCormick , among other things , last week . <P> Widow of the late Senator Medill McCormick , she , aged 47 , has lived and breathed politics since she was old enough to realize that her father , the late Mark Hanna , was a very important man . When Mark Hanna was in the U. S. Senate , she , a smart bud , fresh from Dobbs Ferry and Farmington , was there too , at work in his office . She says : " If I wanted to dance until four o'clock in the morning , well and good , but I had to be in the office just the same at nine o'clock and be good-natured about it . " <P> Having married politics , she rose to enjoy a prestige in the capital second only to presidents ' wives and to Alice Roosevelt Longworth , whose father was often at loggerheads* with Mrs. McCormick 's father . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just " burst upon the world as Princess Alice . " Miss Hanna thought Princess Alice a harum-scarum . Princess Alice thought the young lady who presided over the griddle cakes and corned beef hash at Senator Hanna 's political breakfasts in Lafayette Square , a superb prig . <P> Later , after Princess Alice married the dapper Ohioan , Nicholas Longworth , who became Speaker of the House , Mrs. McCormick and Mrs. Longworth formed the friendship that is now said to be one of the strongest influences keeping Mrs. McCormick in politics . Other influences are Mrs. McCormick 's unboastful estimate of her own undoubted political acumen ; her experience since 1924 as Republican National Committeewoman from Illinois ; and heredity . In Illinois , she will run for nomination as the protege of well-entrenched Mayor William Hale Thompson of Chicago , against Congressman Henry R. Rathbone who did not support Mayor Thompson in his loud " 100% American " campaign last year , and against Congressman Richard Yates . <P> Three years ago Mrs. McCormick was shouting from Illinois platforms against the Small-Thompson combination , which helped Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he died in 1925 . Her cry then was : " Turn the rascals out ! " Her explanation for associating herself with Mayor Thompson , and his friend , Governor Lennington Small of Illinois , now is : " Party regularity was a Hanna creed , you know . " <P> <P> * On the way from Buffalo to Washington in President McKinley 's funeral train , Mark Hanna exploded : " I told William McKinley it was a mistake to nominate that wild man at Philadelphia . I asked him if he realized what would happen if he should die . Now look , that damned cowboy is President of the United States ! "
