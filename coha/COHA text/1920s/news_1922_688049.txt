txt A Cape Town dispatch recounts . the efforts under way to unite the Nationalist and Labor parties in the hope of defeating Premier SMUTS in the next general election . It is a political combination admittedly hard to achieve or to make effective . The announced plan is to favor Labor candidates in the towns while putting forward Nationalists in the country districts . A similar attempt proved vain against General ' BOTHA , and the South African party which he formed , and to the leadership ' of which SMUTS came after Bona 's death , confidently expects to remain in control of the Government . Meanwhile , the South African Union may be enlarged by the accession of a. new State . In October Rhodesia is to have a referendum on the question of joining the Union . General SMUTS recently paid a visit to Bulawayo and in a speech there at a banquet in his honor discussed the matter in a largeminded and generous way . He hoped that the terms of union offered , especially the proposal in regard to the war debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory to the electorate . But he made it clear that no pressure would be applied by . the South African Union , which would have no complaint to make if Rhodesia voted to set up a Government of its ' own instead of joining the Union . In the course of his speech Premier Smuts paid a tribute to the far-sighted wisdom of CECIL RHODES , who , he said , was the first statesman to recognize clearly the impossibility of either British or Dutch domination in South Africa . Co-operation between the two races was essential and it had now been largely attained . The followers of KRUEGER and the followers of RHODES are now trying together to work out the destiny of the white race in So-nth Africa . Whatever the suit of the referendum , the people of the South African Union would always , asserted General SMUTS , regard the Rhodesians as brothers of the same blood , whether in the family or merely living next-door . On the last day of the session of the South African Parliament , General , SMUTS brought up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ? ment about them he did . not conceal his opinion that they lacked much of perfection and ' contained grave omissions . Referring particularly to the treaty dealing ' with the use a poison gas and submarines , he ? frankly declared that in it he , saw possibilities of a danger that " the flank of the " whole Washington position may yet " be turned . " Yet on the whole he had warm commendation to give to America 's " bold gesture " at the Washington conference in behalf of the limitation of naval armaments , and rejoiced that the Dominions had been separately recognized and freely consulted and now had the opportunity to give their approval t ? this great forward step toward world peace . Toward the end of his speech , Premier SMUTS expressed his regret that some members of the South . African Parliament had /taken occasion to sneer at the League of Nations . He thought this out of place in the case of an institution which has been and is still doing good work . He reminded the Parliament that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It h " still our faith that it will grow and " RA future be of real  --  first-class good " for the entire world . " The Parliament thereupon ratified the five treaties and adjourned .
