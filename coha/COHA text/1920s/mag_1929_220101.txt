One night , 25 centuries ago , Prince Gautama left Yasodhara , the beautiful young wife who had just borne . him a son , and went into the wilderness to meditate . Only Channa , the charioteer , accompanied him . In time , Gautama sent Channa back to the palace to take all the princely jewels and rings to Yasodhara in remembrance of her husband . Thus , alone , ventured forth the first Buddha . <P> In India the intellectual classes were egoists and Buddha could not altogether enlighten them . Still he did not wish entirely to withhold his teachings . So he taught them the Hinayana ( Little Vehicle ) which was best suited to their intellectual capacities . <P> Later , in China , flowered the sublimest school of Buddhism , the Mahayana ( Great Vehicle ) . And so , it is explained , from China there now issues " the greatest 20th century disciple of Buddha . " <P> Last week this disciple set foot in Manhattan . Clad in a robe of orange silk he stepped softly down America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy spectacles were incurious . He is Tai Hsu ( pronounced Ty Sh ) , onetime abbot of the Pai-Yun-Se Temple near Canton , and conceded China 's foremost Buddhist . <P> The Buddhists are not essentially missionaries . A Buddhist will not interfere if he sees a man about to cross a bridge known to be condemned . He will suppose , courteously , that the man knows what he is doing . However should the man inquire if the bridge be safe , the Buddhist will tell him . Similarly Buddhists do not generally interfere with other people 's religion nor try to lead them from paths they have chosen . <P> Tai Hsu , however , has a missionary-like ambition " to increase human felicity , virtue and intelligence , and to achieve universal peace and happiness . " Tai Hsu believes Buddhism can achieve these things . In U.S. colleges and universities , therefore , he will explain his doctrines . But unlike most Christian missionaries , he will seek to convert no unbelievers . He intends merely to offer his beliefs for intelligent examination , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose : to establish in Europe or in the U.S. a Buddhist Institute . In Paris a grant of land has already been given him . But Tai Hsu has not yet accepted . The Institute 's purpose will be to clarify Buddhism to the Western world , to represent Buddhism as a religion nowhere antagonistic to scientific theories . <P> Buddhists believe in reincarnation and , therefore , that life ceases never . When a Buddhist becomes enlightened and good he may himself become a Buddha . Then he reaches Nirvana where there is rest and surcease from the pains of life and death . <P> Familiar even to Western minds is the endlessly-turning Buddhist wheel-of-life . The wheel represents the cycle of conception , life , death , ascent to a higher plane ( or descent to a lower ) ; then reincarnation ; and then , again , conception , life , death , ascent . <P> Certain Buddhist doctrines read curiously like pages from modern scientific treatises .
