THE subject of evolution is like this round ball that we live on and call the earth ? it is so vast that no man can see more than a little of it at once . To any single human eye the earth seems nothing but a broad , flat plain more or less wrinkled with mountains and scratched here and there with lakes or rivers . A Limited View Similarly , it seems to many people that the theory of evolution means merely an idea of the bodily origin of man ; that it is the story of how this wonderful body of ours has been developed in the course of millions of years out of simpler and more primitive kinds of creatures . This really is , of course , one of the things that evolution means . It is the story of the evolution of man that we have been telling , in the main , in the previous chapters of this serial . But this is only a very small part of what is included and implied in the idea of evolution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the whole earth is more than your dooryard . It is probably the grandest and most far reaching idea ever grasped by the human mind . The idea of evolution may be defined , as I have explained in a previous chapter , as the idea of change . Things alter as time goes on and become new things . The unending panorama of growth and alteration is the universal law of life . All Things Change Continually Unliving as well as living things change . The earth changes . Mountains are worn down . Rivers alter their courses . The oceans advance and retreat . Ice sheets spread and disappear . The eternal hills are not eternal . The fixed stars are not fixed . Everything in the universe ? man and man 's ideas , the world he lives on , the sun that warms him , the stars that he looks up to and wonders at in the sky , even the chemical elements that make up the machine that man calls his body ; each and every one is in continual change . " Permanent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short a time . If a lifetime were a billion years , we should see the mountains melting before our eyes , the stars racing across the sky , the earth heaving and wrinkling under us . This is the greater theory of evolution , the theory that not man alone , nor living matt , alone , but everything is changing , moving , producing something new . Everything everywhere evolve Let us take a familiar example ? the evolution of inventions . Many people remember the first telephones ; a few remember the first typewriters ; nearly a of us remember the first automobiles the first airplane , with the Wright Brothers riding out in front of it on a Litt ; board , like some one perched precariously on a windowsill . Compare these recollections with present-day realities . Inventions , machines , human devices of all kinds obey the universal law . Not even so simple and satisfactory a thing as the buttons on your coat remain the same for 10 years in succession . This is evolution . Think of the history of transportation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be moved , they carried it themselves . Then some one learned how to catch wild oxen and make them into beasts of burden so that one man , using his brain to direct the muscles of his ox , could carry more weight and could take it farther in a day . Soon some other genius invented a drag of poles to slide along behind the ox and still more weight became transportable . Finally , men learned how to make wheels and wagons that rested on them and how to catch horses that could move faster than oxen and go farther in a day . And today we have tamed gasoline to replace the horses on the highways and steam to transport things still longer distances over rails . Life 's Inventions What is this but evolution ? The ancient slime specks , you remember , at first were not able to move themselves about at all . Then presently they invented muscle fibers so that they could twist themselves through the water . Next they invented a stiff rod down the back so that the muscles could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then began to swim like a fish . Gradually , invention by invention , they moved ashore and learned to creep and to walk . Some of them have even learned to fly . How similar this is to the history of the human inventions that have given us our present means of transportation . This universality of evolution is evident in every human activity . We can trace , for example , the history of the cultivation of the soil , step by step , from the most ancient way of stirring it with a forked stick down to the latest modern cultivators that pull a score of plows by gasoline .  | We can trace weapons of warfare in unbroken sequence from the hurled stone or swung club of the caveman to the poison gas and airplane bombs of modern destructive science . Even cookery is a traceable evolution from the ancient hot stone dropped into the stew with the bones . Fountain pens and fluid ink are direct descendants of the earth-smeared thumb of the prehistoric cave painter . We still have two buttons on the backs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had to be held up behind ; an evolutionary vestige this , quite comparable with the fact that we still have an appendix inside the human body . Ideas Are Subject to Change Nor is invention the only place where evolution is evident . Ideas , too , are sub ject to evolutionary change . Think , for example , of what men believed from age to age about the place and support of the earth in space . In the beginning they thought it was a flat thing like a saucer floating in a universal sea of water . A few people , more curious or imaginative than the rest , asked themselves what the water was resting on and found no answer except the mythical ones of a great ele phant or a broadbacked turtle or some gigantic strong man like Atlas . On some creature like this the whole universe that we know was supposed to rest . But as time went on , these ideas changed . Men perceived that the earth was really a round ball , the center of the uhiverse . The heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe now that the earth , far from being the center and focus of everything , is but a tiny speck revolving around a mighty sun which is itself a mere speck in the inconceivable vastness of space . And that the evolution of these ideas is still going on , that what we think about space and about the nature of the universe is about to change again , is evidenced by the theories of Professor Einstein with which the scientists are now so much concerned . Other examples of the evolution of ideas are visible in those that we call social customs . Consider table manners , for ex ample . The cave man merely grabbed what he wanted , dipping his hairy fingers in the pot or snatching bones out of the fire . Even so recently as three or four centuries ago most of our ancestors ate from a common dish , slicing off with daggers such morsels of meat as struck their fancy . Evolution has been much at work since then , and lest you think these matters of social custom un important in world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingly or promptly , either by business or by society , as crimes against custom , the crimes , - for example , of guzzling coffee from a saucer or of eating with your knife . It is not in the least an exaggeration to say that if one is unable to acquire such table manners as one 's social surroundings demand , this may be an even larger factor in the prosperity of the individual and in the survival of his offspring than was a weak backbone to a creature in the stage of evolution between the worm and fish or an un sure eye to the monkey who was on the way toward an ape . It is quite possible that the scientists of 10,000 or 20,000 years from now , when they come to look back on the 10 centuries of the millennium in which we are now living , will hold its most important evolutionary event to have been the growth of those social ideas and customs that scientifically we describe as humanitarianism but which find their real and everyday expression in what we call politeness .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accepted ideas , is subject to evolution . In primitive medicine , for example , it was customary to cut a hole into the skull in order to relieve headache . The idea , one imagines , was to let out some spirit or other evil creature who was believed to be producing the pain . These ideas have evolved . We think differently nowadays about the cause of headache and we treat it , we feel sure , more successfully . Yet it is probable . that the physicians of a few thousand years from now will look back on the medical theories and practices of 1923 with the same curious pity that we feel for the savage surgeons who cut into living skulls to let the demons out . But the evolution of ideas and of customs , like that of human inventions , belongs really to the evolution of life . The body of man has evolved and his mind with it . To prove that evolution is a universal law we must produce evidence more fundamental than this . We must show that evolution applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this he done ? Evolution Applies to the Stars It can . One of the greatest achievements of modern science is that it has been able to prove within the past 20 years that evolution applies not only to life and to all products of life , but also to things as lifeless and as fundamental as the stars and the chemical elements . If you take a telescope and go off adventuring with the astronomers into the depths of space , you will find that all the stars you can see are great suns like our own sun , many of them , in fact , much larger and hotter and mightier even than it is . All these star-suns belong , the astronomers find , to a single series , like the children of one family . But the family of stars has one great difference from a family of children . The youngest stars are not the smallest ones , but the largest . The baby stars , born only a few billion years ago , are tremendously big . The old , old stars , millions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly dead . What happens to the family of stars , the astronomers believe , is about like this : The first stage of a star , so far as we now know , is probably what is called a dark nebula . This is merely a vast cloud of very thin gas or dust spread about in a certain part of space . It sends out no light , so it looks dark . Gradually this cloud draws itself together into a more or less globe-shaped mass . As it does so , it becomes hot . It begins to shine . It enters the first visible stage of a star , a baby star in years , but a giant star in size . One of the stars that is in this stage is the great red star called Betelgeuse that forms the shoulder of the hunter in the constellation of Orion . The size of this star was measured recently by the astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory , and it was found to be so vast that if it took the place of our sun , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the matter of the star is very thin . It is a bubble of highly rarefied gas rather than a solid ball like the earth , or a globe of dense gas , almost liquid-like , such as we believe our sun to be . What will happen to this young giant star as it grows older we can foresee , we believe , from the present condition of other stars . It will grow smaller and denser and at the same time hotter . After a while it will be a brilliant white star like the dog-star Sirius . Though it will continue to shrink , it will stop growing hot . Instead , it will cool off a little and its light will become more and more yellow . Presently it will resemble our sun , which is a star past the first vigor of youth and well along in middle age . Finally , as it cools off more and more , Betelgeuse will become still smaller , more and more reddish in color , less and less brilliant , more and more dense . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every Star Is Changing Every one of the thousands of stars that you see in the sky and each of the millions more that the astronomers have counted on their telescopic photographs is believed to represent a definite stage in this development from a dark gas cloud . There are many details of this evolution that we still do not know . But of the fact that stars change there can be no question at all . And with the chemical elements the proof is just as sure . A distinguished and sincere opponent of the theory of human evolution , Mr. William Jennings Bryan , has argued that if evolution be true of life , it ought to be true of everything , and that since ( as he believes ) it is not true of the chemical elements it can not be considered true of life . It is unnecessary to pause over the weak logic of this argument ? the obvious possibility that evolution might be true of life and still not be applicable to everything . The evolutionist need not quibble . He can accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of evolution is to stand or fall , as Mr. Bryan argues that it must , on the question of its applicability to the chemical elements , it will stand and Mr. Bryan should accept it . For the chemical elements do evolve and science has proved that they do . The outstanding example of this chemical evolution is the element radium . The peculiar properties of this element ? its continual emission of heat , the rays from it that affect a photographic plate , its ability to make the air about it a conductor of electricity , its curative properties in disease ? all are due to the fact that the atoms of radium are in evolution . Radium belongs , in fact , to a series of no less than 27 chemical elements that make up a known evolutionary series . The first one , the original parent element ( so far as we now know ) of the entire series , is uranium . Uranium changes after a while into another element called Uranium X , this into a third and so on for four changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , it produces a ' gaseous element called niton . This , too , evolves and changes into another element , a solid one this time , and so on until we reach an element which , if it changes at all , does so so slowly that we have not yet proved the change . This final element is lead . No one believes , however , that lead is really final or unchanging . It merely changes so slowly that we have been unable , as yet , to detect the change . We already have , indeed , some evidence that it does change . Not only lead but all , other chemical elements have been found to possess in a very slight degree the same properties that make radium so remarkable . Radium produces much heat , but all kinds of matter produce a little heat . Radium gives out powerful rays , but all kinds of matter give out feeble rays of the same kind . It is probable , therefore , that all kinds of matter are undergoing evolution , though an evolution much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insect Story In an often quoted letter of Benjamin Franklin he speaks of those insects that live only for an hour or two in the summer and he imagines one of these to be describing to its companions the appearance of the world . The flower on which all of them lived was , quite evidently , eternal . Through the length of a long life , urged the oldest of the insects , the flower had not been observed to change . There were , moreover , ancient traditions that through many generations of previous insects there had been no change . How could such a thing as change be thought of in this pleasant perfumed plain ? Now we , who feel sometimes that we live so long and so importantly , have but little longer tenure of this pleasant earth of ours than had the tiny insect of his flower . Things that seem to us unchanging may be no more so , in reality , than is a flower , if only we grant time enough for them to change . Evolution is not a rapid process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able investigation , the accumulation and study of innumerable facts , in order to discern it at all . But this is not because evolution is concealed . It is because man lives for such a little while . Even the whole billion years of earth history into which we have crowded the origin and evolution of life is but a moment in comparison with the vastness of time .  |
