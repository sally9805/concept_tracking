txt Pressing his campaign to force the next Republican National Convention to demand specifically in its platform the enforcement of the prohibition amendment , Senator William E. Borah of Idaho declared before the National Grange convention tonight that a political party which would not declare for the enforcement of that amendment would not enforce it , and that if the party machinery was against enforcement the prohibition law would not be enforced . " I venture the opinion that if the Eighteenth Amendment can not be enforced and the people so conclude , " he further declared , " they will take the Eighteenth Amendment out of the Constitution . " Furthermore , he challenged those who maintain that the Fifteenth as well as the Eighteenth Amendment should be enforced to join him in making a declaration to maintain and enforce both amendments . Demands Fidelity to Constitution . " When political parties take up this law with the same fidelity and execute it with the same dispatch that they do other laws , you farmers will realize the worth of the victory for which you have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But so long as this sidestepping continues there will be inadequate enforcement . . " What I am asking is for party and political fidelity to the Constitution as it has been written . It would seem that there ought not to be any question about it . But there is a question about it . You know per fectly - well that a political party which will not declare for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment will not enforce it . And you know , furthermore , perfectly well . that if the party machinery is against enforcement , the prohibition law can not be enforced . " " I believe the law van be enforced . It is within the power of the party of which I am a member to enforce it . If it fails to do so it strikes a blow at the cause of prohibition , and a still more vital blow at the cause of constitutional government . For great political parties to stand neither for maintenance nor repeal seems to me a sorry plight in democratic institutions . " The whole fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eighteenth Amendment . Enforcement or Fight for Repeal . " Fifty . years ago the National Grange declared for national prohibition . That policy has now been incorporated into the Federal Constitution . The question now is , What do non propose to do with prohibition now that you have it ? " General Grant once said that the test of military genius is to know how to make use of the fruits of victory . You have been victorious . What use are you going to make of the fruits of victory ? " I venture the opinion that , if the Eighteenth Amendment can not be enforced and the people so conclude . they will take the Eighteenth Amendment out of the Constitution . The most solemn impeachment of constitutional government that I can conceive of is to have in the charter of government a provision which is ' being constantly and notoriously disregarded . " That kind of an impeachment of constitutional government the people of this country will not endure . You must either enforce this amendment or face the fight to take it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not enforce it through good intentions or noble resolutions alone . You can only enforce it through the political instrumentalities and agencies and machineries of political parties . Cites Tariff Law Enforcement . " All laws are enforced through that machinery and through those agencies . I do not care whether he is a United States Marshal or United States Judge , somewhere along the line they have passed under the surveillance of party organization . " All laws which are enacted must necessarily come in contact with that organization . The Tariff law , ' for which the President spoke so earnestly last night , is enforced through the faithful agencies of the Government . It is a pretty difficult law to enforce . but if there are any doubts about the law , the doubts are resolved on the side of the Government . " You let a Government employe in the port of New York connive at the entry of goods without proper payment of duty and his political head falls with the morning 's dawn . When political parties take up this law with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do other laws , you will realize the worth of this victory for rhich you have been fighting for fifty years . Demands Party Fidelity . " But so long as this side-stepping continues there will be inadequate enforcement . " What I am asking for is party and political fidelity to the Constitution as it has been written . It would Seem that there ought not to be any question about IL But there is a question about it . You know perfectly well that a political party which will not declare for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment , will not enforce it . " And you know , furthermore , perfectly well that if the party machinery is against enforcement , it can not be enforced . " I do not want to be misunderstood in this fight , although it seems difficult not to be misunderstood . I am against the liquor traffic . In that respect I take my Republicanism direct from Abraham Lincoln , who denounced the liquor traffic as the second curse of mankind . " I want to - see it controlled . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory covered by the American flag . I am perfectly willing , so far as I am concerned , to fight along that line . " But I think more of constitutional government than I do about the liquor traffic . I think that democratic institutions are passing through as severe a test as they have ever had or will have . Fascism on the one hand , communism on the other and a vast drove of timid souls in between make a pretty hard fight for democratic institutions . " If the time ever comes when a provision of the fundamental law under which we live is scoffed at , derided and denounced . nullified and still permitted to remain a part of the Constitution , that . in my judgment , will be the final impeachment of constitutional government . " I favor , therefore , the mobilizing of every ounce of power and political efficiency that we have to enforce this amendment . I would not compromise upon the subject in any way , sham or form . " But if the time ever comes when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not propose to enforce it , then I venture to say they will take it out of the Constitution , and they ought to . No provision of this Constitution ought to be permitted to stand indefinitely against the will of the American ' people . " I believe it can be enforced . It is ' within the power of the party of which I am a member to enforce it . If it fails to do so it strikes a blow at the cause of prohibition and a still - More vital blow at the cause of constitutional government . For great political parties to stand neither for maintenance nor repeal seems to me a sorry plight in democratic institutions . ? " Those who favor nullifying the Eighteenth Amendment have been thrown into a state of ecstasy by rediscovering the Fifteenth Amendment . They declare that the Fifteenth Amendment is being violated . Therefore , they are justified in violating the Eighteenth Amendment . " You would suppose the knowledge that a provision of the Constitution was being violated would cause regret . Not so ? great rejoicing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment . " Now let 's end this debate , so far al the Findenth Amendment is conc-n-rcd . There is no reason in the Why the- Republican Panty F'null not include in its declaration f'r constitutional maintenance and enforcement both the Eighteenth a -- -1 the Fineenth Amendments . Whatever my personal views may be as to whether the Fifteenth Amendrnent is being violated , which views ant not at this time discuss , I am Willing to take the view of those who think that it is being violated and include it . " In fact , if the Fifteenth Amendment is being violated and that can be shown , then it would he a shameless betrayal of a public duty for the Republican Party not to enforce it or to stand for its repeal , one of the two . The Republican Party wrote that amendment into the Constitution . It is its duty either to enforce it or to repeal it . If it is unwilling to repeal it , then it should enforce it if it is being violated . " I send this challenge , therefore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will join you in a solemn declaration to maintain and enforce both these amendments and carry out the declaration in good faith . Will you join us ? "
