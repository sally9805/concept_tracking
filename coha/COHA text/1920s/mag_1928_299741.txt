Augustus was the first and greatest Emperor of Rome ( 63 B.C.-A.D. 14 ) . He gave the world the adjective " august . " It reflected his Majesty , Serenity , Power . Therefore Signor Benito Mussolini recently caused the newest and largest motor ship in the world to be christened Augustus . <P> She came steaming across from Genoa to New York , last week , on her maiden New York voyage . She is 100% " made in Italy . " Il Duce saw to that . She has the Majesty of 33,000 tons , the Serenity of four giant silent Diesel Engines , and she has Power , 28,000 horse power . <P> A certain Miss Louise Moore , 42 , of Manhattan , furnished peculiar proof , last week , of the extreme spaciousness and luxury of the Augustus . Miss Moore occupied with a Miss Goebel one of the de luxe cabins . It had windows , not portholes . Miss Moore leaned out of her spacious window to enjoy the night breeze , leaned further , fell out and overboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unprecedented opportunity to show his metal . He is the new Commodore of the N. G. I.* Line . He is new on the Manhattan route . Until last week he had been engaged in taking poor Italians to South America , bringing rich Argentines to Europe . Commodore Taraboth is lithe , slender , quick , with pointed mustachios fascinating to Signoras . He did all he could , all anyone could , to save Miss Moore . <P> Click ! The automatic lifebelt release on the Captain 's bridge hurled a belt , coated with luminous paint , into the darkness . Click ! The Captain 's controller whirled from Full Speed Ahead to Full Speed Astern . Twenty-eight thousand figurative horses stopped galloping forward , galloped backward . Click , click , click ! The powerful searchlights of the Augustus were switched on ; and , as she stopped , lifeboats were lowered from whirring davits . <P> Two hours . Then the Augustus steamed on . None doubted that Miss Louise Moore had drowned instanter . But 17 hours later , the Italian merchant vessel Capo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragedy occurred . A lookout peering from the Capo Nord 's mast saw or thought he saw a woman floating . Whatever the lookout saw vanished before the Capo Nord could be stopped . Search again proved fruitless . The lookout said : " I distinctly saw a bobbed-haired woman in a pink garment . " <P> Connoisseurs who inspected the Augustus when she docked found her interior decoration rather commonplacely Italian , in Renaissance and various provincial styles . The Augustus has not the vast , gloomy , cathedral splendor of the Roma , her sister ship ( in hull dimensions only ) . The Augustus has not the rampant , modernist decore of the new Saturnia , a rival Italian motor ship of the Cosulich Line . <P> But the Ancient Roman Emperor Augustus , a great bath lover , would have joyed to behold the swimming pool on his namesake ship . It is on the top deck , under the sunshine , where it ought to be . All other big ship pools are many decks down , steamy , stuffy . <P> <P> *Navigazione Gnrale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
