txt In the stamp colThe Last lector 's album it Are seems to be truer Often First than In any other field of human concern that the meek shall inherit and the stone rejected of the builder becomes the head of the corner . The grand prize at the International Stamp Exhibition was won with a collection of Uruguay impressions . Of the large number of gold medals only a few descended upon such prosperous institutions as the United States , the British Empire and Germany . In the mass the honors went to humble members in the society of nations , like Afghanistan " . the Bahamas , Tasmania , Gambia , Cape of Good Hope , Palestine , Transardente . It is true that this is the kind of competition where the humble start with the advantage of their humility . If the most valuable stamps in the world are a British Guiana 1854 , a something from Mauritius or I'obago , the reason is that the little fellows issue their stamps in thousands where the big countries publish in billions , and so lay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same reason which makes Borrox GwrieNew 's signature the highest priced of all the Signers .

Such prices go to small places in far corners of the earth . School girls have Suitable Dress beat having trouble with their costumes for - since the opening School Gir/s. of the Fall term . There was the little girl of 9 who wore serge bloomers to school and was sent home to be more modestly dressed . Her Indiana mother thought that modesty in a nine-year-old was adequately and economically taken care of with such a stout and enduring garment , but her teachers saw Ili her garb the foundation for loose morals in later life . Reversing this instance was , the young girl who refused to take part in the required gymnasium work because it necessitated the wearing of bloomers . It was not the girl , investigation brought out , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that only girls were permitted In the class , but that did not influence his unbending mind . Bloomers are inherently corrupting , and his daughter was not to wear them even if no mg saw her . In Arcadia , Kan. , the girls entered school happily enough , with skirts that would be approved on Fifth Avenue and faces blooming with cosmetics . The School Board excitedly published a rule that cosmetics were not to be used and skirts were not to be shorter than a spot six inches below the knee . But the County Attorney held that  --  the board was not a law-making body , and the girls are dressing as they like . It is significant that the only dissenting voice in the board was that of its President . He is the father of several girls . Western reformers are Still the probably already viewCigarettes ing with alarm the . latest statistics showing Come , that we are turtling out more cigarettes than ever -- 88,000,000,000 last year . That is a figure that connotes electrons or war debts . Nobody has told us how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how big a cloud of smoke would be raised if they were all puffed at once . Somebody has made the ready calculation , however , that on a basis of total population our consumption works out at something like 700 per capita . But total population includes children , and even in these sophisticated days infants , at least our less mature infants , seldom smoke . If we deduct 35,000,000 children under 14 , it Is plain that the rest of us smoke an average of well over a thousand cigarettes a year . This is probably ten times as many as we smoked twenty years ago . And that Leaves out old ladies who do n't smoke , or who , like the late Miss LOWELL , prefer cigars . Doubtless smoking among women accounts for part of the increase , and the waning popularity of cigars for some of it . But that obviously is n't the whole story , and in the eyes of the crusader against nicotine we must look more and more like a nation of hardened sinners . The good fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British . air liner forced to Fortunate land in mid-Channel is plain to all who read of their experiences . They were lucky in having a comparatively calm sea and clear weather . Otherwise it is doubtful if any of them could have been saved . The English air passenger service has had an exceptionally good record up to the present . Two disasters in recent months have happened to French planes . French authorities have denied the charge that the wrecked French planes were old . Despite the general record of countless successful flights , these mishaps in crossing the Channel are certain to cause laymen to wonder to what extent commercial passenger planes cam ever be made " fool proof . " Reckless driving is as great a danger in an airplane as in an automobile . But there is little likelihood that those who drive the cross-Channel planes will fail to possess the needed skill or to exercise the greatest possible caution . In the latest accident the fault was apparently due to a defect in one of the motors .
