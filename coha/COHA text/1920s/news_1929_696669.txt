Last week 's $104,000,000 rise in security loans made by reporting member banks in 101 leading cities is not a bearish development in the credit situation nor an indication that " stock markEt demands are making serious inroads on bank credit .

While it was recognized that estimates were complicated by the amount of investment trust financing in progress , there was a tendency to expect a decrease as a result of recent liquidation in stocks .

It has been clearly demonstrated that the substantial expansion in these loans over the last two months has been largely due to the formation of new investment trusts .
