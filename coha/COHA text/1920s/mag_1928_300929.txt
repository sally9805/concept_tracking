If in a decade or two some honest historian should set himself to telling the story of the development of music in the U. S. , no name will figure more prominently than that of Walter Damrosch . Today 's sophisticates will differ perhaps . They will remember the Strauss of Mengelberg , the Debussy of Koussevitsky , the Bach of Stokowski , the Wagner of Toscanini ; and in the fervor of appreciation of individual performances they will have forgotten the millions whose musical sense has been awakened by Damrosch . They will have forgotten that it was Damrosch who first introduced to the U. S. such composers as Tchaikovsky , Stravinsky , Rimsky-Korsakov ; such artists as Kreisler , Lilli Lehmann , Paderewski ; that Damrosch , first of the important conductors , took stock of jazz and siphoned it off for the seriously musical to take or leave as they would ; that Damrosch first took his orchestra on the road , to cities and towns which knew no music ; that it was Damrosch who 20 years ago inaugurated symphony concerts for children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music history .
