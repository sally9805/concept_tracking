The greatest interpreter of modern times , ' and perhaps of any age , was Gustave Henri Camerlynck . Death found him , last week , in Paris , five days after he had taken to bed with influenza . As Chief Interpreter of the Paris Peace Conference , the Washington Conference , and the First Dawes Committee , Professor Camerlynck received the personal thanks of such statesmen as David Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson . He was to have interpreted for the new Second Dawes Committee ( see col. 2 ) . As illness stole upon him last fortnight , Professor Camerlynck interpreted , for the last time , between Prime Minister Raymond Poincare of France ( who speaks no English ) and the Agent General of Reparations , Seymour Parker Gilbert ( who learned his French at Rutgers College ) . <P> M. Camerlynck was no mere polylinguist . He comprehended many tongues , but he translated only between English and French . His German was too correct and stilted . It was only to his chosen and special art that this little man from Flanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gliding like an actor imperceptibly into the rle of the statesman for whom he was translating , Professor Camerlynck would seem to become by turns Statesmen Lloyd George , Clmenceau , Wilson , Balfour , Hughes , Briand , Dawes or perhaps that wily Greek , old Eleutherios Venizelos . " We Greeks ! " M. Camerlynck would cry , " We Greeks demand so-and-so as our rightful , our inalienable heritage ! " <P> Buried in the musty minutes of the Washington Conference lies perhaps the perfect tribute to Gustave Henri Camerlynck-his rightful epitaph . As the Conference was about to adjourn , Arthur James Balfour . Chief of the British Delegation , rose with his usual majestic deliberation and sonorously addressed the Delegates : <P> " One word and one word only more must I say . I think we should feel that if we separated without expressing our thanks to Mr. Camerlynck applause , we should be accounted among the most ungrateful of mankind . Mr. Camerlynck has an absolute genius for the work he has undertaken applause . ... I do not know what my French colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the English tongue . But I know what I always think when I hear my speeches translated into the French tongue , which is that it is a matter of most agreeable surprise to think that I have lapsed into such unusual felicity laughter . If all my colleagues around this table entertain the same views that I do-and I believe they do-they will thank me for setting myself up as their mouthpiece and giving to our friend Mr. Camerlynck our warmest tribute of thanks and admiration . " Turning to the little Professor whom he had thus made the hero of the moment , Mr. Balfour added : " Mr. Camerlynck , I shall undoubtedly meet you in Heaven ! "
