The British Foreign Office was the scene of many diplomatic talks . It appears that the entire question was boiled down to the fact that France would have to choose between isolation and joining the long-mooted conference on the Ruhr and reparations settlement . <P> It is evident that the British Government views with uneasiness the political , financial and economic situation in Germany and is determined at all costs to prevent a German collapse . If necessary , a separate agreement will be signed between Germany and Britain . <P> In passing , it should be noted that France is now the master of Europe and as such is feared . In short , she controls most of the Continental coal and iron supply ; she has the largest army and air force in the world , with the possible exception of Russia . A navy is not a primary need of France . It is thus evident that France 's supremacy invited a change in the Balance of Power . To summarize , Britain says to France : " Get out of the Ruhr or we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the funeral oration of the Entente Cordiale . <P> France is much divided over the Anglo-French tension . One party wants more time ; another wants the Entente patched up at all cost ; the majority seem to accept the isolation challenge and advocate a stand against the world if need be . The Government , however , is moderate and inclined to find a basis of compromise if it can do so with honor to its policy . An analysis of political opinion in European countries shows an almost solid backing for a conference to determine the capacity of Germany to pay-a suggestion emanating from U. S. Secretary of State Hughes , now sponsored by the British Government and endorsed by the Pope . As most countries are more or less vitally affected by the prolonged Ruhr row and the concomitant sterility in industry and commerce , it is only natural that they should favor any move calculated to bring the whole business to a speedy end . The Pope has not been idle . The failure of his letter of a week ago to Cardinal Gasparri was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgium , Paris , were hard at work . Mgr . Pacelli , Papal Nuncio at Munich , went to Berlin and had a series of consultations with Chancellor Cuno with the result that the German Government semi-officially discountenanced sabotage . The Nuncios at Paris and Brussels were requested to urge that nothing be done by the French and Belgian Governments likely to hinder an eventual understanding with Germany .
