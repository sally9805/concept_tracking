A caravan consisting of a soft-seated motor bus and four automobiles will purr out of Winfield , Kan. , on July 9 , carrying 45 students of Southwestern College on a tour of 22 U. S. states , and two provinces of Canada . It will not be a mere rubber-necking tour , for Dr. William M. Goldsmith , who is in charge of the expedition and of Southwestern 's biology department , has promised to instruct as well as point out . The students will visit Mount Vernon , Va. , and Bunker Hill , Mass. , as well as the Metropolitan Art Museum and the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan . Wherever possible , they plan to camp along the roadside , to sleep on air mattresses in pup tents . Mrs. Goldsmith , head of Southwestern 's home economics department , will supervise the cooking .
