In St. Louis U. Su attorneys filed an appeal in the case of the U. S. v. The Mammoth Oil Co. , et al. - the famous suit for the annulment of the Teapot Dome oil lease to Harry F. Sinclair . The suit tried in Cheyenne , Wyo. , was decided against the Government by Federal Judge T. Blake Kennedy ( TIME , June 29 ) . <P> Messrs . Atlee Pomerene and Owen J. Roberts , special counsel for the Government , thought they found 64 errors in Judge Kennedy 's conduct of the trial . So they are asking the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse his decision . The appeal may be heard in St. Louis in December , or more probably in St. Paul in May . <P> <P> In San Francisco Edward L. Doheny and his legal staff opened their appeal from the decision of Federal Judge Paul J. McCormick last June voiding the Elk Hills oil reserve lease ( TIME , June 8 ) .                 @ @ @ @
