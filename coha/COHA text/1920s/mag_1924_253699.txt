The Fifth Congress of the Third International ( Communist organization ) ended . <P> To the Executive Committee ( Komintern ) were elected Alexis I. Rykov , also President of the Council of People 's Commissaries and head of the Soviet Cabinet ; Grigori Zinoviev , Ivan Stalin , Leo Kamenev , Nikolai Bucharin , editor of the Pravda , official Moscow journal ; William Dunn of Montana and some others . <P> Grigori Zinoviev became President of the Committee for the second time ; the names of War Lord Trotzky and Karl Radek , two erstwhile powers of Communism , were dropped . This is obviously in retaliation for both Trot-ky 's and Radek 's criticism of the Communist Party , but it is exceedingly doubtful if the former , who is said to be popular in Russia , can be ousted from the Committee with impunity . <P> Most interest , however , attaches itself to the reappointment of Grigori Zinoviev to the Presidency of the Executive Committee . What is this Committee ? What manner of man is Zinoviev ? The Executive Committee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communism . Theoretically it is separated from the Soviet Government , but actually it is the most important branch of that body , controlling foreign policy and spending Government funds . Its prime function is the propagation of Communism throughout the world-a call to the world proletariat to throw off the capitalist yoke , overthrow the existing government , proclaim a dictatorship . " Workers of the World , Unite ! " That is its slogan . <P> The man who directs this policy and possibly has more to say about it than anyone else is Ovsei Grigori Aronovitch Radomyslski , alias Grigori Zinoviev . <P> Opinions differ widely as to the extent of the power wielded by Grigori . Some people claim that his is " the greatest force that has ever shown itself in Communist Russia , not excepting Lenin . " Others refer to him merely as " Lenin 's assistant . " <P> Undoubtedly he is a great power , perhaps the greatest power in Russia . His mind is a volcano spewing up from his revolutionary soul the cruel lava of Communism . In this he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is the conservative power functioning noiselessly . Grigori is " the bomb boy of Bolshevism , " whose autocratic impetuosity has earned for him the title of " Red Emperor . " Again , he is different from Trotzky , whose aggressive spirit is tempered with shrewdness and whose power is wielded less by the force of oratory than by Machiavellian methods . In Zinoviev the fire of revolution burns unextinguishably ; the power of his oratory is his most deadly weapon ; his lips form revolutionary metaphors and epigrams and hurl them upon his audience until it becomes intoxicated with his magic ; his voice , aided by gestures from " a windmill of arms and legs , " is like that of a tragdien , rising from the soft strains of pathos to the roar of dramatic agony . Some have called him " the thunderer of the Revolution , " others , " a demagogue , pure and simple . "
