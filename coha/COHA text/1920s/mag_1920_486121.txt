A T random recently I picked up an American daily newspaper published in Paris and marked in red certain items on the front page . They reported the progress of negotiations between Italian workers and factory owners for the control of the metallurgical and other industries in Italy ; the seizing of a Prague Socialist newspaper by its Communist employees ; an agrarian reform bill passed by the Latvian legislature ; the refusal at that time of Millerand to be candidate for the Presidency ; the expulsion by the New York legislature of five elected Socialists ; the latest declarations of British miners on the eve of striking ; the arrest of Communists in Berlin ; a supposed linking of Enver Pasha with a soviet plot ; the Polish-Bolshevik peace parley in Riga ; the execution in Siberia of the brother of a former Russian ambassador , and a number of other occurrences in scattered parts of the world . The items in red came to a total of sixteen out of the thirty-three ; they took up three and a half columns out of seven . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news on most other days would yield approximately the same proportion of red . Two types of misconception are current about such items as I have indicated . One is that they have no significant factor in common . But even the most casual study would show in all these apparently disconnected occurrences the stir of the Socialist movement throughout the world . The growth and forming of a vast army with red banners must be read even in such items as the refusal of a former Socialist to consider for the moment the Presidency of a great nation . The other misconception among those whom that invasion directly threatens is that this vast army presents a united front . The outstanding fact today is that the battle-front between capitalism and socialism is quiet compared to the fury of the conflict raging between the right and the left wings of the Socialist movement throughout the world , between the Second International of the Socialists and the Third International of the Communists ; a conflict which is splitting to the heart what has been perhaps the most powerful social , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And nowhere is the fight at the present moment hotter than among those " Center " masses of Socialists who have not as yet taken their stand either with the extreme right or with the left of the world revolution . From London , the capital of the Second International , comes a manifesto of war , which declares in part : Workers of the world . . . frivolous hands are tearing your unity to pieces . " Workers , divide ! " is now the cry . This is bringing distrust into your ranks and sowing the seeds of poisonous antagonism among you . . . . Throughout the world , the Second International . . . is waging the battle for the ideals of democratic socialism as against the slavery of capitalism on the one hand and the tyrannical dictatorship of bolshevism on the other . . . . The final struggle for socialism will not be decided in Russia but in those countries where capitalism is most advanced and most powerful . For this reason the International Congress ( of the Second in Geneva in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The Second International is willing to cooperate in all endeavors to restore the international unity of the working classes . It will oppose every at-tempt to break that unity . Long live International Social Democracy , the liberator of the nations ! The Executive Committee of the Second International : Signed ? Arthur Henderson ( Great Britain ) ; Emile Vandervelde ( Belgium ) ; J. Ramsay Macdonald ( Great Britain ) ; P. J. Troelstra ( Holland ) ; Otto Weis ( Germany ) ; Arthur Engberg ( Sweden ) ; Camille Huysmans ( Belgium ) . The Second International claims to represent about fourteen million Socialists and trade unionists throughout the world . Its rock and fortress , as indicated by the manifesto , is the British Labor Party and the British trade unions with their seven million adherents . It is buttressed by the German counterpart of the British combination , the Majority Socialists and the German trade unions with their five million members . Grouped about these are the labor and Socialist parties of Belgium and Holland , each with more than half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries throughout the world , many of them , however , rump bodies created by the contagion of splitting which is wracking the Socialist movement . From Moscow , the capital of the Communist Third International , have come numerous manifestos , brusquely characterizing the signers of the manifesto of the Second and their colleagues as the " confidential advisers of the bourgeoisie and reliable hangmen of the working class . " Describing the evolution of these men as participators in bourgeois governments , the Third International says : Engaged in the musty atmosphere of parliamentary work , witnesses of the base behind-the-scenes transactions , conducting negotiations on behalf of the trade unions concerning petty concessions and compromises , these leaders have lost touch with wide masses of the unskilled , with the toiling poor ; . . . Their own social standing secure and material position improved , they looked upon the world through the rose-colored spectacles of a peaceful middle-class life . . . . They declared to the proletariat that its war-cry of " Workers of the world , unite ! " should be substituted during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut each other 's throats in the defense of your fatherland ! " They persuaded the proletariat to strain all its forces for war work and to fight to its last breath on the battlefields for capitalism . . . . That this is not merely a paper war became clear when in Russia Bolshevik fought Menshevik , and in Germany Spartacist mobs fought the governmental forces of the Majority Socialists with hand-grenades , machine guns , and every other available weapon left in quantity by the Great War . The source of the rebellion and aggression against the Second is , of course , the Bolsheviki . And the tide of desertion has been running from the Second toward the Third during the last two years with increasing momentum . The first and most important body to stride definitely into the camp of the Third International was the Socialist Party of Italy , which recently carried the elections in over 2,500 communes in that country and has shaken capitalist control of industry to the foundations . In less than two years , since March , 1919 , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulgarian " Narrow " Social Democrats , the Swedish Left Socialist Party , the Hungarian Communist Party combined with Social Democrats , the Spanish General Confederation of Labor , a large number of rump organizations and Communist groups . In recent months alone the Independent Socialists of Germany have added their great numbers and influence to the Third , and the Socialist Party of France is about to follow . To estimate the numerical strength of the Third at this time is impossible . The tide is running too swiftly to weigh its force at a standstill . But out of over twenty-five official decisions taken by national Socialist and labor groups all over the world in the last two years only one or two have stepped back from the Third after setting foot into it ; and of these only one group , a section of the Hungarian Social Democrats , has actually returned to the Second . Another element difficult as yet to estimate in the strength of the Third is the Moslem . In the Caucasus , in Persia , and in Anatolia soviets exist , and throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third International is the aggressor in the split in the Socialist movement . It accuses the evolutionary Socialists as betrayers of the teachings of Karl Marx and Engels , therefore of socialism and of the working class . In the seventy-three years since Marx and Engels analyzed capitalist society and pointed out that justly and inevitably there exists between capital and labor an irreconcilable conflict which must- end in the overthrow of the former by the working classes of the world , only one factor has served to obscure the truth of that criticism and to weaken the force of the revolt it has inspired  --  and that is " evolutionary socialism . " In Germany . . . once established in seats of influence in the bourgeois state , these leaders found the revolutionary truth in the Socialist teachings embarrassing to them in their deals with the bourgeoisie . They became interested in the stability of the state in which they were councilors . . ? . When the Great War came , evolutionary socialism had acquired such deeply vested rights under the bourgeoisie that they became the tools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany collapsed of its own weight and rottenness , and the workers brought on a revolution , evolutionary socialism maneuvered itself into the saddle and helped up the bourgeoisie to a place beside them . When the revolutionary proletariat saw itself cheated of the fruit of its revolution and took up its fight against capitalist reaction , evolutionary socialism turned machine guns on the workers . . . . The hour for real revolution , through heavy civil war if need be , has come . The capitalist state must be overthrown , a dictatorship of the proletariat established , and in place of bourgeois parliamentarism , society must be based on the system of councils of the workers , the soviets . To this the defenders of the Second reply in effect : Capitalist production is a factory . A bad one , it is true . But still better than nothing at all . Workers depend on its working . We aim to reform it bit by bit without destroying its productivity . You , so-called revolutionists , are always prating about the economic miseries of the workers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are trying to do is to blow up the factory with dynamite and only then try to build something in its place according to a paper plan of yours for a utopian factory . What becomes meanwhile of the workers ? They get caught in your explosion , suffer violence , misery , hunger , lose productivity and employment , and starve . . . . Carrying on , as we do , our propaganda and movement through orderly and effective channels of education and democracy , we acquire a moral strength which you lose with your methods of violence and underground plotting . . . . A passion for democracy has been a habit of too long standing with Socialists for us to discard it now it comes our turn to practice it . If by " dictatorship of the proletariat " you mean that the will of the great masses shall prevail , that is our democracy . As we have seen it practiced in Russia , it is dictatorship by a group of men who arrogate to themselves the name of the proletariat , a dictatorship over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the soviet system , let us first see how it works before throwing away the only kind of governmental machinery we have . Between the Right of the Second International and the Left of the Third stand groups of Socialists captained by some of the most brilliant minds in the Socialist movement , the so-called Center . Their backs are turned on the Second as too reactionary and too tarnished with compromise and participation in the war . But they have not entered the Third . Until a few weeks ago the heart of the Center was the party of the Independent Socialists of Germany , the Socialist Party of France , the Independent Labor Party of Great Britain , and the Socialist Party of the United States , together with the Socialist parties of Spain , Switzerland , Austria , and large groups in other countries . The Center looks for truth somewhere between the two extremes . Because it retains independence of judgment and action the Center is suspected by the Left , and it is courted for its strength by the Right . Characteristically the Third becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are our enemy . We do n't know where in a critical hour the Center will stand . Those who belong to the Second at heart must go there . Those who belong with us must come in without ambiguity . Thus the battle line will stand out clear . In accordance with their program of applying the acid test to the applications of the Center for admission to the Third International the latter at its second congress in Moscow drew up a list of twenty-one conditions to all parties wishing to join them . These conditions threw a bomb into the camps of the Centrists . " The Independent Socialists of Germany , long leaders of the Center , had already taken up the challenge of the Third International and had sent a committee to Russia to study at first hand what membership in the Communist International promised for Socialists and the working class in general . When the committee came back to Germany Crispien and Dittmann began a country-wide campaign against the Third International , Daumig and Stoecker a passionate propaganda for it . A congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halle . For weeks the controversy raged in the columns of the party press and in every Independent organization throughout Germany . When the congress convened almost every delegate had been instructed by his constituency as to how to vote on the question of adhesion . Zinoviev , chairman of the Executive Committee of the Third , came to present its case . Martov , a Menshevik leader , came to oppose it . Longuet came from France to present the Center 's attitude  --  a solicitude for the unity of Socialist parties of the Center . He was against accepting without reserve the twenty-one conditions because they were impracticable for conditions in countries other than Russia . The debate was hot and full , with the result that the motion to accept the conditions for membership in the Third International was finally passed by 237 to 156 . The announcement of the vote was received in deep silence . Every one knew that the powerful Independent Socialist party of Germany , which had hitherto preserved a remarkable unity throughout the war and after , had come to a split . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose and read a statement that by passing the motion the Left had read These conditions were printed in full in the International Relations Section of The Nation for October 13 , 1920. itself out of the party and thereby deprived itself of the right to participation in its conduct . Shouts of laughter from the Left greeted this , and the delegates of the Right walked out in a body , while the Left rose and chanted the " Internationale . " There are now two German Independent Socialist parties . That of the Right retains the name and about 40 per cent of the membership . The Left , according to instructions from Moscow , will unite with the German Communist parties into one Communist Party of Germany . What the German Independents have done in this matter the French Socialist Party will probably do at its congress at Tours on Christmas Day . In America , the Socialist Party had voted a conditional adherence to the Third before the conditions appeared . Since their publication , however , the American Socialists have come out in open opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or been read out , of the Socialist Party . There is now a new grouping of the Center , which assembled at Berne in December at a conference called by the Swiss Socialist Party at which the Independent Labor Party of England , the Right Independent Socialists of Germany , the minority of the Socialist Party of France , and other Centrist groups were represented . Whether this new Center is doomed to a new split ; or whether it will succeed in becoming the center of gravity for the Socialist movement of the world is on the lap of the gods . Beethoven : 1770-1920 By HUGO VON HOFMANNSTHAL W HO is Beethoven that in this dark , uncertain hour we celebrate him as incomparable and mighty ? No longer do the modern peoples like the nations of antiquity present a complete inner unity ; no longer is any folk like a staff of metal that yields but one tone when the hammer of fate strikes . And that is most true of the German folk , divided from the beginning . A myriad souls separate themselves from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I shall not call these creatures of the spirit the flower of the nation nor yet its heart . But they are its wings with which it dares to rise from the abyss and face the sun . Nothing in them is worthy of surviving in so far as they are essentially estranged from the character of their folk . Yet isolation is their portion and their destiny is hard . For on them hangs the nation 's fate and they are the administrators of civilization 's heritage . Tossed hither and yon by great pride and by equal weakness they seem to themselves at times creatively akin to the gods in their impulse to embody the wealth that is within them . But often the fate of Icarus is theirs , for the element of the unsocial and the speechless in their nation is to them a source of torment . They are consumed by a feeling of incommunicable inner riches . Thus in the midst of mankind they have been lonely . To speak for them came Werther  --  measureless passion ; came Faust  --  measureless aspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who oppose to the laws of the world the law of their hearts . But the creative urge of these men did not find the word of Werther sufficient nor even the word of Faust ultimate and Schiller 's figures were the eloquence of their dreams , not the sinew of their deeds . For Schiller 's final intention was political and from it these German souls , unripe and overripe at once , turn aside . They strive after the living word and the living deed and yearn for the ideal union of these two . Thus Mozart was too serene , too mortally peaceful for their impassioned hearts . They needed one to bring unity to their soul 's division , to purify and consecrate their excess of sensitiveness , to be their priest and speaker before God , their sayer of the inexpressible . Thus did the spirit of the nation cry and Beethoven appeared . He entered the world of Haydn and Mozart , but his relation to music was no longer an innocent and naive one . In his hands the singing voice of the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang the stubborn solitary soul 's delight and pain . Alone he spoke in sound with his own heart , with his beloved , with God . Often that speech was halting and of a divine confusion . Out of a soul unbroken and still devout he created a speech that transcends all speech . In this speech there is something that is beyond sound , symphony , hymn , or prayer . It is inexpressible . It is the gesture of a man who stands before God . The word of liberation was found . But it was not the desecrated word of human language . It was the living word and the living deed and the two were one . His work derives from no folk art . The folk does not recognize itself in his music . But those who have arisen from the folk and are yet of it discern their own and their nation 's character in him . For he was like a man of the people in his unbroken soul . But he had what the people has not nor many who use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intrepid as a child . But presage and aspiration lifted him into yet uncharted regions . He was veracious , knowing all things of the soul save doubt , all things of the heart save frivolity . He was like Moses who was fated to speak to God for his folk and was a stammerer . His body and his soul were one and at last his great tormented countenance took on the aspect of his work and his grave is the grave of a hero . It is a solemn thing to remember such a man , to remember that he walked among us and that we tread in the print of his feet . It is the more solemn because this remembering comes to a great people in its hour of humiliation . But in darkness the constellations gleam and the soul is uplifted . This nation is stricken but not broken . It suffers in deep thought . It is aware of guilt toward its own spirit and would raise its heart above that guilt . Again it seeks rebirth through individuals conscious of the inexhaustible depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centrifugal and uneloquent character of the nation . The spoken word that should make for unity makes for separateness and divides men into heretics and anti-heretics . Thus the spirit of the nation has no single speech , no center for its activity and sickens of strange , confusing thoughts . But the creative individuals think of Beethoven and of that throne of passion whence the ardor of thought flies forth to snare the eternal . They are not eloquent and distrust spoken words through an inner chastity . But in their hearts is a speechless language that is above all speech . That language holds the uttermost darkness of life but also a hope that knows no bound . Thus in this solemn hour we are united , and where but two or three of us are gathered together , there towers above us a countenance of inscrutable expression , riven and devout at once  --  templum in modum arcis , a shrine in the shape of a citadel  --  the countenance of Beethoven .               @ @ @ @ @ @
