With the latest Mexican revolution successfully quashed , Secretary of War General Plutarco Elias Calles returned in triumph to the arms of his President and the streets of his capital . Waiting on the Mexico City railway platform to greet him was President Emilio Portes Gil , three brass bands , 25 Mexican generals . <P> The horde of welcomers made it impossible to descend to the platform . Smiling hugely , broad-shouldered Warrior Calles jumped down from his private car to the tracks . President Portes Gil advanced to meet him , arms extended . <P> " Abrazo ! Abrazo ! " cried the welcoming generals above the blaring of the bands . " Embrace ! Embrace ! " <P> President Portes Gil gave his War Secretary a lusty abrazo and several sound pats on the back . Not a general on the platform but attempted to abrazo the conquering Secretary . Most of them succeeded . <P> Followed a rapid drive through the streets to Chapultepec Castle . General Calles , still in his war clothes-a big felt hat and tan suede " windbreaker " - looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret conference with the President for some time , then motored to his own home . <P> At his doorstep General Calles dismissed the eager crowd of newsgatherers who had followed him all day . <P> " I am too tired to talk , gentlemen , " said he . " My one desire is to take a bath . " <P> The triumph over , President Portes Gil resumed his more prosaic task of governing Mexico . <P> The Army . His first move , as soon as his Secretary of War was bathed and rested , was to demote and dishonorably discharge from the Mexican Army 55 generals , " unworthy to belong to the nation 's military forces because of their active participation in the recent rebellion . " <P> Despite this catharsis , Mexico 's army still will not lack for generals . There were 350 of them at the beginning of the revolution , and only four got killed . So 291 are left to command an army of 76,000 men. * <P> Drink . President Portes Gil turned next to Prohibition , the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps by which he hopes to wean Mexico from the pulque bottle . He created a national committee , with the Secretary of Public Health at its head , to carry these steps out . The steps : <P> 1 ) Prohibition of the manufacture of whiskey , gin , absinthe and other beverages of high alcoholic content ; restrictions on the importation of such beverages . <P> 2 ) Limitation of licensed drinking places . No new licenses to be issued . No beverages of high alcoholic content to be drunk on the premises . No saloons within a certain distance of schools , barracks , factories . <P> 3 ) Free instruction of school children , in public and private schools alike , on the Evils of the Drink Habit . All textbooks , irrespective of subject , to carry a lecture against the use of alcohol . <P> 4 ) Organization of open air mass meetings to preach the virtues of Prohibition . Government cinemas on the Evils of Drink to be shown in all cinema theatres . <P> So much more stringent were these rules than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that distracted distillers and worried brewers had visions of Prohibition a la U. S.
