GALLIONS REACH-H . M. Tomlinson-Harper ( $2.50 ) . After he killed a man on board a boat at " Gallions Reach , " part of the grey , quiet Thames that breathes near the uproarious alleys of Limehouse , Colet was pursued by a ghost . Through shipwreck , riding the hot ocean in a tiny open boat , even in the green griddle of the jungle , there was always a hand upon his shoulder , a voice in his ear . Finally he obeyed the whispered command and sailed home , to " Gallions Reach . " The lands and water over which Colet is driven by a sprinting remembrance are faintly reminiscent of those over which the great figures of Joseph Conrad strode . Hence Author Tomlinson , a shy , ugly , middle-aged man whose life has been in strange places , who has written this first novel , full of fine and original writing , has been unjustly called an imitator , a disciple.                   @ @
