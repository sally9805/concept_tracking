txt The Canadian House of Commons is properly zealous for the encouragement of organs of local Canadian culture . It voted the other night that " measures should be adopted to en " courage the publication of Canadian " magazines and periodicals , " after , a debate in which American magazines were condemned as " trashy. " " antiBritish " and " anti-Canadian . " It came near voting for a prohibitory tariff on American magazines , which would at /east give the United States , an opportunity for an agreeable form 1 of reciprocity that might increase the pleasure quotient in both countries . As Canada bootlegs rum to us , we could bootleg literature to Canada . However , this is not to be . As yet the Canadians have contented themselves with a resolution . In so far as concerns the assertions made about the shortcomings of American periodicals , it should be observed that there are magazines and magazines .

The problem , however , deserves se ! rious consideration , south as well as 1 north of the forty-ninth parallel . It . is the familiar problem of a small nation which wants to hold fast to its own peculiar culture , though it happens to be adjacent to a large nation speaking more or less the same language . It is the problem which the Dutch have had in connection with Germany , the Belgians ( or at least the Walloons ) in connection with France , and Switzerland in connection with all three of the great Powers on its borders .

We have learned better . The Canadians , too , may learn that they will gain nothing by giving their own publications virtual freedom from competition . At present they seem to be obsessed by two more or less contradictory ideals . They think that there should be magazines expressing the peculiar culture of Canada .

Well , how do American magazines reach a circulation of two million ? Certainly not by emphasizing local issues . The Saturday Evening Post has nothing particularly Pennsylvanian about it ; its hatred for New York is shared by the whole hinterland . In that successful group of varicolored " books " that is published in Chicago there is very little that is peculiar to Chicago .

As for the particularist interests of Canadian life and letters , there are some encouraging examples in the United States . The Reviewer of Richmond , The Double Dealer of New Orleans , are the most prominent in a group of magazines that have recently sprung up in the South . holding a balance between Southern local interests and topics 15f more general character . In circulation they will never rival The Saturday Evening Post or The Pictorial Review , nor do they try . But they do give an expression to sectional variants of the common culture of English-speaking North America ; and they do reach a certain number of outside readers who are looking for good writing and do n't care about the postmark . There is no reason why Toronto or Quebec could not do the same . As for the great publications that count their readers by the millions , they become universal by giving up any attempt to be local .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
