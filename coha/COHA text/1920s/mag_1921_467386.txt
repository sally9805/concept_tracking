ABOUT this time of year , when we dose the doors and turn on the radiator , it is possible to approach closer to our real selves than in summer . This is true the more particularly after a season of torrid ferocity like the summer of 19H . Even at its happiest , summer , with its wide vistas , offers too many distractions ; it is far too easy to watch the world go by without really seeing it . Four walls , on the other hand , compel concentration . Questions which in midsummer we view languidly or in a spirit of irritation induced by the heat , may be contemplated with philosophic calm when the north wind rides hard and fast and cheerily rattles the shutter . But be not deceived . I have no intention of adding to the pyramid of literature bearing upon the respective merits of Winter and Summer . By these commonplaces I am merely negotiating a cautious approach to graver matters , hoping to establish myself with the reader on terms of our common humanity . Having heard during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it depressingly pessimistic , I am disposed to take advantage of a quiet evening at home to ponder these things yet again . The case of Age versus Youth is one of the oldest on the calendar of the Court of Time ; it is perennially pendens , never attaining the dignity of res judicatch Nor will it ever be disposed of and final judgment rendered until Time itself shall cease to be ; but it adds to the joy of existence for successive generations to dally with the case , bring it to an issue with a fine flourish of sincerity only to find that the plaintiff 's witnesses have passed beyond reach of the sheriff 's writ , whereupon the original defendant , having grown old , institutes a proceeding de novo against a new crop of Youth . Time , sitting placidly upon the bench , must be highly entertained and not a little amused that a ease which manifestly never can reach a final decree should reappear upon the records as each new generation begins to assert itself . What really is the gravamen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it supported by competent evidence ? Frankly , my sympathies are wholly with Youth , the mystified yet smiling defendant ; and , as the plaintiffs are so prone to default or show themselves absurdly unreasonable and violent when they dash in to amend the ancient complaint or to ask postponement of the hearing , I am disposed to change the monotonous routine by invoking an extraordinary process to compel the complainants to appear at the bar forthwith and unfold themselves as to the exact nature of the relief they demand . Just what is it that those who are so filled with forebodings as to the present and immediately succeeding generations would like restored of what has passed or is passing ? A demand for a concrete and definite expression from those who profess to believe that yesterday was a time of nobler aspirations and achievements than to-day would at least lay the burden of proof upon the complainant . The vanity of age is a curious thing . As we approach fifty most of us who have survived plagues , pestilence , and famine , wars , panics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begin to hark back to the good old times when everything was different . Because things were different we foster the delusion that everything was better . We expect youngsters to listen with rapt attention to our reminiscences . I confess that I myself find it necessary to fight constantly a tendency to corner some helpless youngster and describe to him the old state house , or the union station as it used to be in the good old times before the tracks were elevated and the mortality list lowered . Or , in a mood of condescension , I speak of that glorious year when our town figured in the schedules of the National League . Baseball , I intimate , reached perihelion in that year of wonder . When I speak of Kelly and Clarkson and other giants of those days and their visits to our capital , or recall Jack Glasscock as the most efficient and captivating short stop the diamond has ever known , he merely smiles sadly ; and if you continue he may be driven to ask you what you think of Babe Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been great men since Agamemnon , and we need n't imagine that the youth of today are not aware of the fact . Sufficient unto the day are the heroes thereof . Youth should he protected by law from the reminiscence of its elders . Pleasant as it is for me to recall that where factories now grace the river bank I , with my young comrades , once fashioned a boat out of a sycamore log with which to seek the gulf and the enchanted isles , there is , of ter all , no particular reason why I should bore the new generation with such recollections . The fact that the argosy stranded on a sandbar within an hour after it was launched and was abandoned makes against the success of such a narrative with present-day youth . The incident is one of failure , and in these clanging times it is a grave blunder for any parent , guardian , or elderly neighbor to confess failure to the luckless child who is snared in the meshes of such reminiscences . I seem to recall that similar scraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rather foolish . The joke of going ' coon hunting and not getting the ' coon may tickle the man who remembersthe joy of the hunt , but the humor of it is lost on the boy who is disappointed that the quarry escaped . Such revelations are dangerous ; a man must , if possible , be a hero to his children . Again , it is too much to expect that young people will be thrilled by accounts of their elders ' hardships in fighting through snowdrifts breast high to reach the little red schoolhouse ? an institution too remote for visualization by children who know that nowadays country scholars are borne at the public expense in motor busses to substantial brick buildings filled with all the modern apparatus of education . But I must have a care ! Of course there never was any such efficient teaching as that provided at the little red , or the old log , schoolhouse where nothing was taught but the three R 's , and corporal punishment was a. feature of the day 's routine . Children learned something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a licking ! The purpose of such reminiscences is to arouse youth to a realization and appreciation of its blessings . But , aside from teaching youth to be humble , which is always salutary , is there really much use in keeping alive the superstition that the educational methods of pioneer times were superior to those of to-day ? It would be difficult to find support for a movement to restore those little red , or old log , schoolhouses to the landscape . There may be , here and there , some grizzled veteran whose thoughts turn backward bitterly to neglected opportunities or to an early happiness not sustained with the years , who would like to punish the new generation for his failures as a member of the old ; but this , fortunately , is impossible . We may think fondly of the old spring , but we seek the spot to find that change has been busy there , too ; it is either obliterated or yields only brackish water . It does not follow inevitably that , because I was required to chop kindling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ashes , the same service should be imposed on my boy when he THE OLDEST CASE ON THE CALENDAR 2 ) 9 knows that there is a man on the place who is paid to do such jobs . It is my business to devise other ways , in keeping with the changed order of things , to instill in him ideals of obedience and service . Invoking the spirit of early delights ? and detestations ? I remember that another of my functions as a boy was the care of a horse . I took considerable pride in the placid animal which , on Sunday afternoons , hauled the family caravan to the cemetery ? in those days the only park the town afforded ? or to gather wild flowers or autumn leaves . The memory of those excursions does not thrill me . I certainly should rebel at being obliged to repeat them . The weekly reminder of man 's mortality was depressing , and I was always skeptical as to the decorative value of the native flora when translated to the center table or of boughs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hung over the mantel behind the base-burner in the sitting room . The boy who can take an automobile to pieces , repair it and put it together , can hardly be expected to express rapturous admiration when I tell him of my experiences as a hostler . My labors with the currycomb and brush and the cleaning of the stable do not establish me in his mind as a Herculean figure . To him the horse is all but negligible , a ridiculous beast bound for the museum of natural history and already confused in the young mind with the mastodon and the dinotherium . If pressed , I should be obliged to admit that an automobile is a far more delightful medium of transportation than the horse . Remembering the white glare of the tombstones in the cemetery and their doleful hint , not to say threat , of my own ultimate passing , I am not base enough to try to convince an intelligent wide-awake member of the rising generation that I would turn time backward if I could . The horse was once looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youth from the paternal eye . Not so long ago every farm boy commanded a coltand buggy with which to sally forth with his best girl . On quiet , moonlit roads the passer-by was often conscious that the horse required remarkably little attention from the driver . The consequences of this freedom were sometimes deplorable . In the day of its great popularity the bicycle , too , was denounced as a contributing factor in immorality ; it is not surprising that the automobile should be execrated for increasing an old danger . Morality must have been pretty unstable when the automobile appeared if gasoline can so quickly have become a menace to the chastity of the new generation . The sentries must have been dozing at their posts or they would have given warning . If the youth of these days have not the protection they once enjoyed it is not their fault . They did n't choose the time of their arrival or create the conditions into which they were born . Odd , what a queer jumble of unimportant things stick in the memory ! In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-flannel bag of asafetida to ward off infection . She believed in this as firmly as in the advisability of seeing the new moon over her right shoulder . The pervasive aroma of forty such amulets in an overheated schoolroom I recall to this day , but not with poignant regret for the passing of this superstition . Much as I enjoyed watching my maternal grandmother roll into her back yard every spring a huge iron pot in which she concocted soft soap from the winter 's accumulation of fat , my recollection of the product is not so agreeable ? the stuff was sometimes introduced into my ablutions ? that I should care to impose its manufacture or use upon any child of these times . This grandmother was a Virginian , thoroughly skilled in the household arts , but I am constrained to think that in these days she would be very quick to accommodate herself to the changed conditions . Speaking of grandmothers , I recall my astonishment the first time I discovered my paternal stepgrandmother taking a quiet pipe after slipper . It was a clay pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite solace . I think of her often as she sat in the bricked area between the kitchen door of Lhe farmhouse and the well , whiffing meditatively . There were members of the household who frowned upon this performance hence the rocker behind the kitchen . I think she would smile if she knew that young women of the generation of her great grandchildren create no disturbance by lighting cigarettes in parlors and public refectories . My heart warms to old people ? the number is growing , I think ? who enjoy the comforts and amusements of modern life . I knew an old lady who caused her family much anxious concern because she exacted of her chauffeur a speed in contravention of all the ordinances in such cases made and provided . I am not profoundly moved by the sighs of those who crave a return of the old simple times . For most of us , the simple life is satisfactory and sufficient only when it 's the only life we know . We may pretend all we please to disapprove of the modern machinery that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want all the comfort we can get . If it had n't been in the blood of the race to push against the horizons , to seek new shores and devise better ways of doing things , the history of the world would n't be a very jolly narrative . My mother , I am glad to remember , never lost her curiosity as to the passing show or her readiness to accept and adjust herself to changing conditions . By breakfast time she was always ready to discuss the morning 's news , and she could hear a boy calling an extra quicker than anyone else in the house . I ca n't recall a time when she was n't an ardent suffragist , and she took me to hear the early advocates of that cause . Nothing ever elated her more than the casting of her first ballot . Though she had seen Booth in his prime , she had , nevertheless , a heartfor the latest musical comedy . She talked less of the past than any other person I have known , kept busy and developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her hands . There 's no use in giving up the fight at the first frost . When we find the children slipping away , excluding us from their pleasures , it 's time to let them understand that we 're far from being ready for the scrap heap . The fact that children do n't run to bring father 's slippers as they used to does n't mean . any lack of consideration for the parent who has worked hard all day to support his family . I prefer to think the passing of this custom indicates a hope in the young mind that father has n't yet reached the slippered age , but still has a stomach not wholly satisfied with warmed-over cabbage . Slippers are the symbol , the outward and visible sign of approaching senility . Father would be a lot better off if he forsook the old armchair and took the family to a vaudeville show or a movie . When my fifteen-yearold son looks in on me when I 'm shaving and asks , cheerfully , " How 's the young hero feeling this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to be impudent ; he is merely greeting me as though I were a comrade of his own age . I should certainly forfeit his confidence in my sense of humor if I put down the razor to tell him that in my youth children showed their parents more respect . I tried that for a year or two and it did n't work . My past is nothing to him ; be finds the world as it is sufficient for all purposes , and if he can have the car this of ternoon he 'll be very much obliged ! If there is any vanity that is not only pardonable , but to be encouraged , it is the vanity of wishing to appear young . There is no shame in fighting wrinkles or baldness , and one is entitled to be as whimsical as one pleases about the color of one 's hair . I have observed that gentlemen aglow from a " facial " leave the barber shop with a springy stride , and even if the youthful color induced by the soothing massage lasts only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conviction that a man 's no older than the barber and tailor can make him . I hold it to be highly creditable to a woman that she is alert to resist the first encroachment of age upon her countenance . It may even be questioned whether it is n't her duty as well as her privilege to cling to youth with all the energy she possesses . The mirror is a great consoler and heartener ; it 's really the inner spirit that she 's renewing ! The girl who in the crowded elevator or on the street candidly opens her vanity box , inspects her nose , and dabs it with powder is guilty of no high crime . The passion for looking our best in a world that judges us largely by appearances is as old as the first brook that mirrored the first face . I overheard two women who had reached the middle distance discussing in a street car the edict of a department store against bobbed hair . One of them expressed the strongest disapproval of the store 's action . " Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang udne ! " This brought back to me not only the day of the bang , but also of the bang intricately curled and pasted to the brow with quince-seed mucilage . While my opinion in these matters is not of international importance , or even likely to carry weight in my home town , I shall , without the slightest hesitation , register my belief that the bob is , where related to the head of a pretty girl of proper age , the most decorative form of headdress affected in my time . The bang always somehow suggested a scowl ; one could not escape an apprehension that it might crawl down into the owner 's eyes . But the bob has distinct pictorial value ; it is certainly preferable by far to the earmuff arrangement which struck me in its heyday as neither beautiful nor sanitary . Must we be sad to be good ? This question used to worry me in those years when the books in the Sundayschool library were my prescribed moralpabulum . The good children did n't seem to have much fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five- and ten-cent novels and of weekly story papers that printed tales of gay buccaneers , and of wicked gangs of robbers and of Wild Bill and other frontier characters . I suppose that I read more trash than any other boy of my age in America . It did me no harm ; at least I ca n't see that it did . As the hero was always kind and chivalrous toward the weak and unfortunate and managed to crawl out of his scrapes alive , those tales were much more to my liking than the Sunday-school fiction whose heroes were usually misunderstood or tubercular . Happiness is not , I think , necessarily a synonym of sin . Little as the critics of youth may relish the fact , it is true that the world is growing cheerfuller . The loft of my grandfather 's barn was filled with bundles of early American magazines , and when my supply of dime dreadfuls ran low , in desperation I used to explore them . They were full of sorrow . The poetry in particular was pitched in a low key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the bard addressed a lyric " To a Sleeping Babe , " it was only to enumerate for the hapless infant the perils and sorrows of life with pleasant intimations that an early death would , in all likelihood , be a merciful solution of its problem . The popular song of the Irving Berlin lyrical school can hardly he said to rank high , either as literature or music , but to my taste the offerings of Tin-Pan Alley at its worst are more refreshing than a type of doleful ballad popular within my memory . Old love letters and faded ribbons and locks of hair were the chief ingredients of those compositions . The tune was always mournful ; it had to he to fit such words as these : In the little rosewood casket That is setting on the stand , There 's a package of old letters Written by a cherished hand . Go and get them , wo n't you , sister ? And read them o'er to me ; Often I have tried to read them , But for tears I could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records all night than be obliged to hear one song of that school sung in the old prescribed manner with everybody in the room sniffling . Save for the occasional revelations of the court room , we might well believe that love letters are no longer written ; certainly they are not preserved in rosewood caskets to any great extent . The telephone is a much more convenient medium than note paper for expressing one 's adoration , and it has the decided merit of respecting a confidence . I am conscious at this point that the serious-minded reader is growing restless , setting me down as a frivolous or evasive person , prone to skate only on the safest ice ; but nothing could be more unjust . In any speculations on this ancient subject of the old and the new there are matters which obviously can not be ignored . Would I restore and perpetuate , if it were in my power to do so , the old confident belief in the inerrancy of the Bible , the awe in which it was held by my parents or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a little . We can not think of the Bible as we were taught to regard it , of the church to which we marched as a matter of course every Sunday morning , without visualizing again the home , the pleasant social contacts of the church , and a thousand and one other associations of the family life . " The old home " derived a charm from the very closeness of its horizons . All this is in itself a kind of religion , built upon something fine and noble that we never quite lose ; and it is creditable to us that we never quite lose it . I can see my grandfather now reverently lifting the timeworn Bible from the table to read a chapter beforegoing to bed . My emotions , as I ponder his piety , his unquestioning belief , can not he otherwise than tender . Not for much fine gold would I have changed his faith . But what was sufficient for him has not sufficed for me . Brought up in a Christian household and possessing , perhaps , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual , I can not honestly say that I should want my children to believe as he believed merely that they might enjoy his serenity of life or the peace and hope in which he died . What was possible for him and good for the health of his soul is inescapably bound up in precious memories of other times and other manners ; but I could no more bring myself to attempt to persuade my children that hell fire and brimstone would be the punishment for their sins than I should try to convince them that the world would be a better place if steam and electricity were abolished . Of all emotions fear is the most hateful , the last to be encouraged in the mind and heart of man . I heard sermons in my youth which I should not want my children to hear ; or , if they heard them , I should be obliged to confess that I did not believe that the preachers had any true vision of spiritual things . " The heart of a boy is God 's springtime , " wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of wistful wonder , when the spirit is open and receptive , curious as to the mystery out of which it has come . There can be hardly a child whose imagination is not touched by the alternation of seasons , who is not troubled by questions he dare not ask as to the beginning and end of things . Verily the thoughts of youth are long , long thoughts , and their speculations and shy questionings are entitled to all respect . I like to believe that no child is horn a materialist , but a poet and dreamer , and it is incumbent upon Age to give substance and direction to the young aspirations . I beg not to be misunderstood as lending support to those who feel that Christianity has lost its power to touch the imagination and the conscience of mankind . I am rather of that considerable company who feel that its great work remains to be done , but that it must accommodate itself to the new necessities and the changed mood of the time . People have a way of visiting markets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm off last year 's goods on wideawake customers is bound to arouse their ire . Man 's spiritual needs change as the years roll by . To plant my back to the wall and say that what was good enough for my grandfather is good enough for his great grandchildren " is n't the answer . " The soul is a delicate instrument that can not perform its best service under conditions that cramp and stifle it . We are walking backward with our eyes shut when we try to persuade ourselves that Eternal Truths do not march onward with the genius of the race . A truth ceases to be eternal when it loses its vitality , its power to accommodate and adjust itself to conditions that have been changing since the earth emerged from chaos . if as to things spiritual the passing generation is handing on to the new a torch with a feeble flame , almost as grievous is the faint light of the untrimmed and smoking lamp with which I should symbolize our attitude toward polities and government . Democracy is fundamentally a product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally sit in the councils of the absurd idealists are fond of imagining this to be true . But , leaving this pleasing assumption and viewing the processes of government from a purely materialistic standpoint , I shrink from attempting to impress the young men and women now approaching voting age with the idea that we , their predecessors , have displayed any zeal or gained any noteworthy victory in the elevation of political standards . We love the flag , and under proper provocation will fight for it ; and certainly the young men and women of America , at a time when they VOL . CaLEV. ? No. 859.  - -  Swere the target of a withering fire , gave their critics a pretty hard jar by their splendid response to the call of the bugle in 1917 . Just . what we might have expected , of course ! But I am thinking of patriotism in time of peace , of everyday politics , of the administration of the affairs of your city and mine , of the meek tolerance of incapacity and venality , of the sickly whine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he reckons they always were so and always will be . Young men are warned to keep out of politics because it 's a dirty business ; a good man is bound to pay dearly for trying to make things better . I am unable to see that the generation now turning its face to the setting sun has advanced the cause of good government in any degree that can be looked upon as an inspiration to the youth of to-day to take politics seriously , to strive for the highest realizations of democracy . The quickening of the civic spirit in youth would , I think , assist greatly in stimulating the impulse of obedience , service , and responsibility . The discussion of public questions at the familytable would at least tend to relieve the children of the constant parental ragging for their evil , tendencies and the uncheering reminder that " things were not so in my day . " A mild inquiry from Tommy as to just what father has done to make America a safe place for American institutions would not he had for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or the other , and complains bitterly because the street he was taxed to pave a little while ago is again crying for repairs . If his party is responsible for the crooked job , the inquiries of Tommy and Lucy who , in spite of their follies , do manage to get something out of the civil-government course at the high school , may shake father 's confidence in the superiority of his own generation . We have witnessed many experiments with new devices within a quarter of a century , but the reports as to their efficacy are far from satisfactory . No kind of machinery , no device , no matter how ingenious or plausible , is of the slightest value unless a preponderant number of citizens stand squarely behind it . We complain of the breaking down of parental discipline and the general lawlessness of youth in a day when the statute books of every state are littered with laws that are not enforced , and some of them patently are not enforceable . Without expressing an opinion as to the desirability of prohibition , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws supported by it have wrought an even greater mischief than the evil sought to be abolished . Such laws should never have been passed until the government had perfected a machinery for their enforcement . The fact that they are not enforced has had the effect of suggesting to the young that all laws are foolish and made to be broken . Boys who were protected under the license system by ordinances against selling to minors are now free to patronize the bootlegger . I have seen more young boys intoxicated in the past year than in all the previous years of my life . I have heard more talk about drink than I ever heard before , among people of all ages . Statistics as to the increased bank savings under prohibition , the daily reports of raids by Federal officers and local police do not weigh against the fact , that in every part of the country with which I am at all familiar practically every sort of alcoholic beverage is procurable by anyone who wants it . No other laws have ever been so flagrantly violated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who might and did in other times drink to satisfy his curiosity as to the taste and effect of beer , or who sneaked a drink from the decanter at home , now satisfies his adventurous spirit by meeting a bootlegger in an alley and buying a quart of spirits . It must be bewildering to the lad of to-day to find his father boasting of his luck in picking up just a few bottles of some rare stuff ? somethingusually which he did n't care greatly about before the law forbade him to have it . If it's- " smart " for the father to circumvent the law , it 's " smart " for the boy . If I were asked whether I should repeal the prohibitory laws and go back to the old system I should say yes , until there was some reason for believing that public sentiment had grown powerful enough to compel their enforcement . Here , I think , is one point at which the new generation may well hold a grievance against its elders , for merely giving a new and dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were writing . in the farmhouse of my fathers , before a fire of logs that I had cut with my own hands and dragged over the snow , I might take up the quill and write an appeal to Youth to change its ways . But in an apartment house that does n't at all resemble the old homestead , with the steam radiator purring softly , I could n't do this without the rankest hypocrisy . My typewriter would be sure to buck if I made the attempt . Rather , I feel moved to address the young generation in some such words as these : " Do n't think badly of the world because we old folks have done so precious little to make it more just , more kind , more beautiful ! We 're mighty sorry for our failures , but we have every confidence that you will extend and strengthen the lines that we have advanced so little and defended so feebly . We 've let a lot of chances slip by ; we 've lacked courage , we 've compromised with truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our duty to God . Clean out our accumulation of rubbish and begin all over again in your own fashion ! Do n't take us as an example , but as a warning . Remember all the time that we 're right . behind , bragging about you , calling to the tired veterans of the army to stand up and cheer for you . You 're going to plant your flag on that peak yonder that we never dared attempt . ' Let 's go ! ' be your slogan ? and do n't you dare look back ! "
