Miss Alice M. Robertson of Oklahoma , the second woman ever to sit in Congress , returned to her home in Oklahoma . She was defeated for re- election last Fall , and now she says that she is through with politics- except for writing an account of her experience in Congress . " I have permission to print it in the Congressional Record and my first move will be to lock myself in a room and finish it . It will be my farewell to politics . " The cafeteria business , which she abandoned at the time she entered Congress , she will not reenter . She expects to live on her farm . The chief point that she is proud of in her Congressional career is the passage of a bill providing free transportation through the mails for publications for the blind .
