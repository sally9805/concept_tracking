UNDER a scorching sun Ohlsson , Arrhenius , and I drew toward the plains of the Ruindi River . It is said that these plains south of Lake Edward are the richest in game in the world . It was thus with great hopes that we looked forward to the future ? new specimens for our collections , meat for the pot , and animals always before the camera . In the mountains there had been difficulties both with regard to food and the camera . There the ground had been inhumanly difficult , and more suitable for monkeys and beasts with sucker-feet than for men . Now everything was going to be different ? scorched , open spaces , with short , burned-up grass , small well filled ravines , and pleasantly dense acacia groves . In a word , a dry park-like landscape . Our expectations were to be amply fulfilled . After crossing the Rutshuru River , we struck our tents the first night at Kayumba , where the nightly lion music , which was to echo unceasingly in our sleep for a month to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the next afternoon , when we had passed the hot springs of Maj-na-motos , in which you can almost boil eggs in a crevice in the mountain , and had reached the plains on each side of the Ruindi River , that the game began to appear in greater numbers . At Kanyamaranga , another day 's march toward the west , and just at the foot of the mountains , the wealth culminated . Scorched brown and silent , the plains lay in the intense sunlight . Not a man or a hut was seen . The acacias stretched their thirsty arms toward a glowing sky . The green branched candles of the euphorbia shone juicy and poisonous , completely untouched by the drought . The plant seems full of life , but the grass all about was often sooty black from some prairie fire , which stopped at the roots of the euphorbia and had never dared to lick its resisting trunks . Now and then we caught a glimpse of smaller woods or sparse copses of bushes and thorny plants , forming , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even curves the ground rose and fell , just as if enormous Atlantic ground-swells had suddenly stiffened in their motion . Deep ravines cut through the landscape in all directions , forming stair-like ledges amidst all the flatness . But otherwise it was flat , flat , flat . Here in this old lake bottom , where the waves of Lake Edward and Lake Kiwu once met in sisterly union , lay the animals ' paradise . Water they found in the Ruindi and in the occasional pools , pastures in the dry coarse grass that seems unsuitable for fodder , but is , all the same , the favorite food of all the hungry mouths . Antelopes are in the majority , alone , in pairs , in flocks , in herds of hundreds  | of heads . You can positively not take a step without seeing new heads popping up . But the number of species is not great . Here in one place you see stately water-bucks of massive muscular build and with long horn-like antlers . Blackgray and shaggy , they prefer the proximity of protective woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topi stare at the intruder . In order to see better , they approach slowly , with shining brown bodies and sloping backs and silly-looking heads . But suddenly the strange smell of the twolegged man-animal reaches their nostrils , and the whole flock turns round as quick as lightning . Slender kobs , with horns gracefully shaped like a lyre , look drowsy in the midday heat . Now and then a couple of bucks stand up to fight , so that their horns crack . Quick-footed reed-bucks leap high in the air and produce a strange whistling noise when they are frightened . In single file the terrifying and ugly warthogs run , with their curly tails raised stiffly in the air , if they are not nosing for food under some bush , and in the evening the shy bush-buck peeps out of his hiding-place . His horns twist spirally from the forehead , and the light streaks in his coat of hair give the impression that the animal is in Parness . Baboons and monkeys chat away the hours in the thickets along the river . Storks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make dizzy curves in the air , which vibrates with the heat . In the forests the buffaloes lead their shy life . Originally an animal of the open plains , they have slowly withdrawn in splendid isolation , since they have observed that man has begun mercilessly to pursue them ; but in the evenings and mornings they come out to graze . Then you can see their dark bodies like gigantic silhouettes against the surrounding plains . Even the elephants pay a call now and then , but keep mostly up on the slopes of the Rand mountains . Finally the lions and leopards live in the ravines in close proximity to those marauders of the night , hyenas and jackals . They are responsible for the movement in the plains after sunset , and they force the kobs and the topi always to keep a sharp lookout , so that they dare not sleep with more than one eye closed . Otherwise , woe to them ! In the midst of the open plains the antelopes graze , if they have not sought protection from the midday heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , but , all the same , one can come quite close up to them if the wind is favorable . A distance of from thirty to forty yards is not unusual at the first meeting , because the animals live in happy ignorance of man 's cruelty and desire to kill . After the first shot they often stand still and stare uncomprehendingly at their fallen comrade . Only after a time does it dawn on them that the noise from the gun spells danger , and then their shyness is boundless . They gallop away at the first suspicious breath of wind , and are afterward very difficult to approach . Two hundred yards or a little more is on such occasions a good range . ? 2 As soon as our collectors ? that is , the National Museum ? had acquired their desired specimens , it was only unwillingly that we raised a gun to the shoulder . Why disturb the idyl ?  | Why spread death and destruction in this animals ' paradise ? It was vastly more amusing to follow their lithe movements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water-hole and witness unseen how they quenched their thirst and how the bucks fought for the best place . It was only the necessity of obtaining food for ourselves and a handful of blacks in the camp that made us even hesitatingly raise the finger to the trigger ; or else the need for fresh carrion in order to keep the lions in order . Otherwise , why not leave the grazing herds in peace ? It seemed almost criminal to disturb the calm of the paradise . 3 For five weeks the expedition lay on the plains south of Lake Edward , sometimes down by the lake , sometimes in the middle of the savanna or just under the shadow of the mountains . West of Ruindi , east of Rutshuru , and of course between the two rivers , it was not difficult to obtain the necessary specimens for our collections . That was done in a few days , and then we occupied ourselves chiefly with filming the game and also with lion-shooting , because this district was overrun by those beasts of prey . To film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , but that is in no wise the case . For if you go up to the animals on the open plain , they certainly stand still for a moment , but always start off long before the camera has been put up . It is therefore important to find a suitable place , preferably near a water-hole , and to build there a small , well concealed grass hut from the wall of which only the lens protrudes . Then you must wait for hours , days , even weeks , perhaps . Sometimes the light is unsuitable , sometimes the roll of film runs out just at the critical moment when a careless noise in the camera is enough to frighten away every living thing within a radius of a mile . Some days the game is shyer than on others . And if you have got a series of good pictures of a kob , for example , but lie in wait for a reed-buck. it often happens that just as these shyer animals come to drink , an old kob will stand a few yards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you then get tired of it and gently ask him to get away , he certainly willingly does so , but takes with him at the same time all the suspicious reed-bucks . He who wants to film must first of all practise the difficult art of being patient . It would take too long and also be too monotonous to let the reader accompany us on all our excursions over the plains . One day was , on the whole , very much like another . Only the game varied . And so did the situations . The camp became an unimportant detail in which one only occasionally set foot . During the light hours of the day we shot food , built a boma , or made blood tracks . And when evening came we crept into our primitive little hut , made of twigs , listened to the sounds of the night , waited for lions , and stared in the intervals up at the twinkling stars in the sky . What , then , shall I talk about ? How the first lion fell one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How fifteen of them came after carrion at nine o'clock one evening , and how , in order to get peace at last , we shot eight before the last one in pure fright jumped at the barrel of my rifle ? How an old wounded p 416 male lion played hide and seek in a ravine , where we fell among millions of inch-long migrating ants , and had to give up the pursuit and tear the clothes off our bodies instead , and pick one another clean from the stinging and biting insects , whose strong jaws took away a piece of skin every time one was removed ? Or how a wounded buffalo , which attacked us in a mad onrush , was overthrown just when the tip of his horns was only a few yards distant from his slayer , and his heavy body almost over him ? This sort of thing you have both heard of and read so much that it has lost its interest , but out there in the wilderness the problem of life or death is simplified extremely . You are confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not react to it any longer . Let those who so choose boast of their achievements . If a man consciously and in cold blood exposes himself to a risk , he need not on that account shout the fact into other people 's ears . Anyhow , I prefer to talk of something else . ? 4 So there will be only one real hunting-story here . It is neither more exciting nor more remarkable than others of the same kind , but springs from an experience that left a very deep impression ? a full moon and the night when I shot my first lion from the boma . Far away from anywhere there is a place called Kanyamaranga . How it ever got a name I do n't know , for there is nothing there but the plain , with its acacias , euphorbia , and ravines . Perhaps there were some huts there long ago , whose inhabitants were obliged to move when the lions became too bold and enterprising ; for that often happens in these parts . First you try to protect yourself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has jumped over and tasted the first human blood , the whole village removes to safer grounds ; for such a beast shuns no means to reach his victim . He goes through fire and water , and very soon feels quite at home in the village . The district was full of beasts of prey . In the daytime they slept in some cleft where the thickets and deep shadow prevented any sight of them , but at night they were all the more active . Then their dull , bass-coughing roar was heard on all sides . It rose and fell , now farther away , now closer to us , plaintively drawn out or more staccato . The king of the beasts had started to hunt in his own kingdom , and woe to the antelope that was not on his guard to avoid as quick as lightning the death spring ! The next moment he would assuredly lie torn to death , with sharp fangs in his still trembling body . Not even man was safe . The whole day we had struggled . In the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lion we had cut a way into a dense bush , strengthened the openings with branches of acacia , marked two loopholes with grass , and thrown in a few rugs and a piece of food . This is called " building a boma . " Then we shot a kob , trailed the carcass up to the sad remains of the water-buck , and prepared blood tracks radially from the boma . For twelve hours Ohlsson and I had been on our legs . The camp was far away and seemed almost a myth . We had not been in it for two days . Then the sun set . The colors  | paled . The plain was bathed in an uncertain half-light in which outlines became blurred and everything floated more and more together . The bushes melted together with their own shadows . The grass waved in the evening breeze like a great sheet of water . For a moment the sky glowed in pure crimson , then slowly changed into violet and green . But the next moment it was night . Without warning , terrifyingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last long in a country where the sun 's path cuts the horizon almost at right angles , and soon the constellation of the Southern Cross burns over the distant mountains . On a few rugs I made myself comfortable with a sleeping-sack . The ground begins to grow damp toward morning , and therefore it is best to have something beneath you . With my hands I groped for my cartridgebelt , and felt for the last time if the heavy express rested within easy reach in its place by the loopholes . Then I lay down on my back and stared up at the white stars . From the carrion , well fastened to its pole , rank odors were wafted to us now and then , but gradually the wind died down altogether . The soughing in the leaves ceased . The stringed orchestra of the crickets swelled to a nightly music . From a little pool of water in the neighborhood came the croak of the frogs , sounding like a chime from many bells . Otherwise all was still . All chirping had ceased long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the plains , first from one side , then from another . It died down and started again . The lions had started their night rambles . Would they find their way here ? I turned round and looked out through the little square loophole . Resting on my elbows , it was just pos. sible to distinguish the shot kob and a little bit of the ground behind it Everything was calm . For a moment I peered as hard as I could at a shadow farther away . Did it not move ? Imagination ! It was only a white antheap . But when you lie like this in tense expectation , even the shadows come to life . I rolled over again and resumed my reflections . The moon had risen , and it was lighter now . The acacia branches over my head were all clearly silhouetted , like a Japanese pattern . against the sky , black , bizarre , and gnarled . A mosquito buzzed in my ear , and a beetle crawled lazily over the rug . My thoughts ran away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loneliness oppressed me , but its pain was delicious . A dull growl close to the boma startled me out of my thoughts . In a second I was wide awake and lay peeping out through the loophole . Everything outside lay steeped in moonlight , white , cold , full of expectation . At a distance of scarcely two yards lay the carrion . It was so light that you could count the hairs on its shin . And the ant-heap farther away was sharply defined against the background . Suddenly there was a sharp rustle to the right , pattering feet to the left . The next moment two large male lions appeared each from his own side , almost ghostly and unreal in the white light . One came crawling up as if ready to leap . He seemed to have taken fright . The other one , more aware of his superiority , walked erect , and there- fore seemed bigger . As he stood motionless , sniffing with his nose slightly raised , he was indeed a picture of strength , agility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He impressed you with his calm greatness , his untamed savagery , and his firm confidence that nothing could beat him to the ground . I began to understand why the species is called the king of animals . The lions stood as if carved in marble . They appeared almost heraldie , staring at each other . Neither would allow the other to come first to the feast . Then the one that stood upright shook his mighty head . His mane was tossed in brownish black masses . It stood out like a glory in the moonlight . Then he walked carelessly up to the kob and began to eat . The other one was still suspicious . He walked carefully . His movements were as quick as lightning , but controlled and well balanced . He stared at the loophole , and our eyes met , but only for a second . The next moment he also lay by the buck and began to seek for the best pieces . I have looked into many lions ' eyes at night , but I have never seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better in a description to speak of eyes of fire that follow the lonely wanderer in the dark . The animals were now so close that I could almost put my hand on them . The carcass cracked . The shreds of meat were flung about ; the claws slashed and tore . The jaws ground and chewed ; the red tongue licked the corners of the mouth now and then It was the haunch that they wanted to get at first of all , that delicacy above all others . Each of the lions tore one away . If the carrion were not so wel fastened , they would long ago have pulled away the whole lot . Now they had jolly well got to stay . They growled , tore , and growled again . We would leave them to it a little longer . The rifle lay at the shoulder with free trigger . The front sight , which was capped with cotton wool to make it more visible in the dark , did not leave the shoulder-blade of the nearest visitor for a single moment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw dripping with blood . Now ! A flash . A report . Two simultaneous shots that sounded like one , for the film man beside me had also shot . The lions leaped yards high , crossed each other , and disappeared each his own way . The place was empty , if possible even more desolate than before ; but from the thicket not far away we could hear the death-rattle of an animal . To judge by the direction it was Ohlsson 's . Then a furious roar started to the right . Time after time it vibrated with its deep bass tones . Incessantly it rose and fell , roaring , mumbling , growling . It sounded as if all the furies of wrath had been let loose and were giving a concert . I stood up and caught sight of the lion a short distance away from us . It was half sitting , with straight fore legs , and its head tossed wildly . The mouth was wide open , but the back part of the body was quite motionless , evidently paralyzed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood ; the moonlight makes aim uncertain . He would have lain there safely till dawn , but I could not bear to see an animal suffer like that . And , besides , his roaring warned others of  | his family not to come . In that case the rest of the night would be spoilt . Therefore , I carefully crept out of the boma . If only Ohlsson 's lion were really dead ! When my wounded beast caught sight of me , his fury increased , but it was impotent rage . His body had no longer the power to collect itself for a spring . How he could ever jump after the first shot was inexplicable . But here he lay , anyhow , about twenty yards from the boma . A shot rang out , but with no result . In the moonlight I had evidently shot above his back . He continued his roaring . I must go closer till only a few yards separated us . Then a bullet lodged in his heart , and his roaring ceased with a sigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . As quickly as possible I crept back and pulled the twigs of the boma after me ; for the other lion might still be heard among the bushes . If it was risky even by daylight to pursue such game , it would be sheer madness to expose oneself to an attack in the dark . For a moment I listened to the sound It grew weaker and weaker ; at last it ceased altogether . Then I rolled myself up in the blanket again and tried to go to sleep . But my slumber was restless . In a few hours other lions were already after the carrion . This time two female lions , each with her young one , came creeping out of the shade , and once more I lay looking at them from my hiding-place . The old ones were careful and shy they tried to keep back the young ones But these had good appetites ; they whined and growled . Soon one o them was sitting on top of the buck while the other was on the point o eating his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment only the hind legs stuck out in the moonlight . As nothing unexpected happened , the old ones also ventured to come out , and soon the feast was in full swing . I really hesitated to disturb the family idyl . The young ones looked as if they enjoyed themselves so thoroughly and the mother purred with satisfaction that it was so easy that night to get food . She did not seem to attach any importance to the shot male a short distance away . However , soon there was another crack . She fell on the spot . In her desire at the moment of death to feel something between her teeth she had bitten her own front paw to the very bone . Time after time the young ones came back . You could hear them and the remaining female fighting in the neighborhood when she wanted to prevent them from approaching the suspicious spot . But they were obstinate , understood nothing . At last she lost patience . With a gigantic leap she was on the spot , roared out something as she passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something similar , and had disappeared with them the next moment in the darkness , as ghost-like and unreal as when she came . By and by the night grew lighter . The sun rose shining red , like a freshly polished copper pan . The female lion lay in the same position and bit her paw . Only with the help of an ax could we break open her jaws . Farther away the morning breeze tossed about the shaggy mane of the big male lion . He almost gave the impression of having gone to sleep with his head against a stone . A short blood track easy to follow through the high grass  | on which the drops hung like crimson berries finally led to the film man 's bag . It lay stone dead , shot with mathematical precision through the heart , under the shoulder-blade. ? 5 From the camp we sent for bearers , and in the early morning hour a circle of black bodies soon danced round the bag , the arch-enemy . Arms and legs waved about in wild delight . Triumphantly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simba anakwisha . " ( " The lion is dead , the lion is finished . " ) To shoot lions from a boma is nothing to brag about . The sport is , as a rule , not dangerous , because it very rarely happens that an animal jumps in . And in that case it is always by mistake . No , it is fairer to seek for them in the daytime . The only difficulty is to find them . But if you meet a wounded animal in the high grass , you had better be on the lookout ; because in that little game only cold blood and a quick eye can possibly save the hunter . If he shoots too soon , it may be fatal ; if he waits too long , it may perhaps be too late . You must watch the right moment , so that the bullet has the greatest probability of reaching a vital spot and stopping the attack . But that is really exciting and puts the nerves to a severe test . What is really the most dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elephant , buffalo , or rhinoceros ? Some say one , others insist with just as much emphasis on another . It is probably because different animals behave in very different ways in different situations . You never know beforehand , when you have them , what they will do on a particular occasion . At one time they show fight , at another time they are cowardly . If the bullet sits badly , you have every reason to expect the former . But even with a shot that has touched a vital part they may still attack . A lion , for instance , might after a full hit in the heart still use the strength of the last beat of his pulse to leap about ten yards , and after that lie stone dead over the victim he sprang upon . And it has happened to me that a buffalo that I shot from the front , when the bullet went in between the eyes and out at the back of his head behind his horns , nevertheless turned round , made a treacherous circle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hit in the forehead the moment before . If , however , you try to take the average of the experiences of different hunters , I believe it leans most to the side of the lion . That is to say , I believe that of one hundred big game shot , the highest percentage of those that have attacked in order to kill their assailant has been found among lions . After that come the elephant and the buffalo ; last of all the rhinoceros . My own experience , however , points decidedly to the buffalo . But that is because I have nearly always had trouble with him , whatever the reason may be . This , however , does not signify much and will not affect the average figure , for opinions on this subject are , as has already been pointed out , highly individual . A chapter on the paradise of the animals south of Lake Edward would not be complete unless I touched in a few words on the life of the rivers . For if the plains are the promised land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called the promised land of the hippopotamus . I have seen these huge monsters al over Africa . In Kenya , in the Lakes of the Great Depression , and on the Nile , but nowhere have they been so fearless as here ; no stretch of water has in such a very small area concealed so many . I have never come so near to them and never been able to enjoy their clumsy games so undisturbed as in Rutshuru . When Eric von Rosen visited the place in 1912 , there were still , he wrote , herds of more than a hundred animals . What must not the river have been like in still remoter times ? It must have been like a great antheap of pachydermata . But now the stocks in the rivers have decreased . Despite repeated visits to the best places , we could never find more than fifty animals in any one herd . Generally there are only twenty or thirty ; but that is a fair number when one considers that the water is in many places no broader than twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to them under the protection of the grass and papyrus that skirt the shores . About five yards was the closest I ever came . There is a puffing and panting , a grunting and snorting , beyond description . Everywhere the unshapely heads pop up above the water , with their pointed ears , narrow little pigs ' eyes that peer comically up at the sun , and pink nostrils through which the water always seems to be running . Or otherwise the animals climb up on the sand-banks , where they lazily bask in the sun and let the quick little birds pick the insects off their backs . In a compact group they stand body to body , rubbing their sides against one another , and resting their heavy heads on the shoulder of a comrade . Now and then an old bull will open his gigantic mouth in a record yawn . He gapes and gapes till the jaws form an obtuse angle , and you think the jaws must have been out of joint long ago . In the wide cavity thus formed you catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tusks , which look like white stalactites growing out from the walls . He takes his time and prolongs the pleasure of the yawn as long as possible . Then he gives a few grunts at the joy of his free and careless life , snaps his jaws together , and resumes his interrupted slumber on the bank , unless his desire for a bath suddenly gets the upper hand , when he will , instead , leisurely roll into the lukewarm water , from which soon only ears and eyes peep out . Then he blows a fine spout of water high up into the air for the fun of the thing , and disappears completely . Only a few water rings mark the spot where the gigantic head disappeared a few moments before . You can sit and watch the animals for hours . It never becomes dull . The young ones play about , looking like big fat pigs as they wallow in the mud , rubbing their broad snouts . Their parents give them a rough push whenever they become too impudent and threaten to disturb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became very busy , and the camera was hard at work for days , taking with never failing keenness and never lying eye pictures of this idyl , which , I suppose , has in the main remained unchanged ever since the days of the Tertiary Period . Excepting , of course , for the number of beasts .  | Why have these herds been so enormously diminished , especially when the hippopotamus never does any harm to man ? The explanation must be sought in the reckless behavior of certain ivoryhunters , in the need for food for the negroes in Rutshuru during the war , and in the desires of the natives round about the river mouth for the flesh , which they consider better than the finest roast beef in the world . Nor is there any difficulty in hunting them . If the animal goes on land , it is like practising at a target on a small diningroom table . And a baby can not miss when the distance is only a few score of yards . It is true , however , that the bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill ; but the hippopotamus is so little shy that you have only to walk on till you have a point-blank shot . But things are different from a canoe . Then the chase may be both difficult and dangerous . The water protects its body , except the top of the head , and more than once it has happened that the light boats of the natives have been tipped over by one of these playful or vindictive pachydermata . At night the monsters walk ashore to grass . They have their definite paths leading to or from the watercourses , and these form real mazes in the reeds and grass . You can often hear them far out on the plains , and one evening such a colossus stood just outside my tent and grunted in the moonlight . It was only when the negroes began to shout at the top of their voices and the askaris came running up with rifles that he thought better of it , and began to lumber slowly and with dignity toward more peaceful pastures . As they have such nocturnal habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaws out of joint in the daytime . ? 6 On a prearranged day the Ruindi and Karissimbi safaris met again at Kabare . Only then did Ohlsson and I discover that Easter had passed and that we had spent most of it in the boma with lions and other wild animals . The only calendar which the expedition possessed was in Gyldenstolpe 's hands . And he wisely took good care not to lend such a treasure to unauthorized persons . Time had flown . We were already well into April . We had a hope , though it proved to be a deceptive one , that there would be a little motor-boat on Lake Edward which might take the safari with its numerous belongings over to the northern end of the lake . However , there were two biggish iron barges at our disposal , besides about twenty canoes . They saved the situation . Of the barges the biggest looked like a photographer 's developing-dish ; the other had the shape of a sauceboat . Nevertheless , they took a fair amount of baggage , which was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not very seaworthy , thanks to the low freeboard , which was only about one inch high . The small canoes , on the other hand , had scarcely room for anything . Consequently , it was not without considerable difficulty that the whole expedition was conveyed across to Kassindi . Nor was this achieved in a single journey ; we had to paddle our way across in two sections . The crossing to and fro took ten days , so that three weeks were altogether wasted in these transport operations .  |
