txt Arguments for the acceptance of the master 's report in the case of the Consolidated Gas Co. against the Public Service Commission with state and county authorities was resumed this morning before Judge Learned Hand in the United States District Court . Wilbur W. Chambers opened the arguments for the defendants and prefaced his remarks with the statement to the court that they were prepared to show the 80-cent gas law was constitutional and that the master 's report as submitted to the court was entirely contrary to the fact the testimony at the original hearing showed . Mr. Chambers said in part : " The defendants restacca , fully submit that they have not had their day in court such as they feel is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States . The Master repeatedly sustained objections to important and material questions , asked by defendants upon direct and cross-examination when no objection was made by complainant counsel . Complainant comes into court with the fact established it has violated the law in that it has not supplied quality of gas specified . For that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question should not he declared unconstitutional unless the court finds average rate of return is less than 6% for a considerable period of time . " Records of complainant company when analyzed show it made enormous profits from its gas business from 1906 to 1918 , inclusive , and has made or should have made if properly managed , more than a fair return in the first eight months of 1919 . For 1918 company books show a net profit of over $4,000,000 and if oil had been providently purchased would show a profit of over $7,000,000 . " Fair value of property on which it is entitled to a fair return does not exceed $28,586,555 for the year 1918 , and founded upon the assessed valuation of land , and actual cost of tangible and intangible property , not more than 832,569,146 ; while the master 's report finds that as of Jan. 1 , 1919 , the company is entitled to a fair return exclusive of working capital , of $71.054,351 . " The Mfenter failed to follow the rules laid down by the United States Supreme Court that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deducted . " The Master says ' I find that $4.00 a 1,000 cu . ft. sold fairly represents the actual investments in property used in manufacturing and distributing gas and such investment may for the purpose of this case be taken at least at that sum . ' There is no testimony in the record from any witness that the fair value of the property is $4.00 a 1,000 cu . ft . From what sources and by what process the Master reaches thin conclusion i , not stated anywhere in the findings or in his opinion Defendants can not conceive of a finding based upon less evidence or justified less by the record d . " Defendants claim Master committed reversible error in admission of complainant 's books . Books in question , as clearly proved by testimony , were not bocks of original entry . In one instance , discussed in one brief , the Master ruled in every voucher , record , and icport reflected in these bucks . These vouchers were not offered in evidence but the Master swept them in along with the books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
