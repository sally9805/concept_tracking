In the stockmarket , which has lately been the band ahead of the Business Prosperity Parade , a purely technical reaction has occurred . Meanwhile , industrial and commercial news continues to grow more favorable . Commodity prices at wholesale are experiencing a sharp rise . Gasoline is being marked up . The steel industry is operating at about 85% capacity , while other metallic industries are doing well . Automobile companies , despite keen competition , anticipate good business this coming year . Except for a handful of roads , among them the St. Paul , the railroad outlook is singularly good . Moreover , the absence of sensation in business at present is a sign of continued rather than merely brief prosperity . <P> The foreign news continues hopeful , although United States politics may intervene to check financial cooperation of the fullest character from this side .
