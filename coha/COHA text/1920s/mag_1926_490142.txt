AS A general rule we are one to admit that no country in the world is the equal of the United States when it comes to keeping up with the times , but fairmindedness compels us to give credit to other countries when credit is due . Take Finland for instance . With incredible promptitude the Finnish match kings have put on the market a match named after a recent play , as anyone can see who frequents the restaurants these days . The Finnish triumph is called the Green Hat Match . MR . TUNNEY was seen at the Park Lane Hotel last week at a smart party . We know the party was smart because some of the guests were stage people . But that is not the point . The point is that those present , and especially the host , were charmed by Mr. Tunney . The champion ate nothing , smoked nothing , and drank nothing . And we have decided to make him our ideal . They say he even pronounced long words like " heavyweight " and " especially " without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ravishingly beautiful girl was running an elevator in one of the Fifth Avenue department stores , and one day we went into the store in question to see for ourselves . But the law of nature , as defined by the mayor of Atlantic City , had been atwork ahead of us . As the elevators came down one by one and permitted us to inspect their operators , we realized that she was n't there . With a sinking heart we approached the starter . " Oh , her ! " he said in response to our question , " We had to fire her . She was too dumb . " IT SEEMS we have been maligning Park Avenue in calling it the coldest , hardest , most unsympathetic street of the city . We met a waggish individual on the corner near the Ritz Tower and saw him shake his head emphatically when we expressed our views . " You 're wrong , " he said . " Come with me . " Escorting us down the avenue a way he pointed to a torn bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is n't Life on this street , " he said solemnly . We peered at the scrap and saw that it was part of a pawnbroker 's ticket . N ONE of the current magazines I that deal in photographs of houses are some views of the interior of Henry Ford 's home , which , except for the absence of information booths , apparently looks juit like the lobby of the Pennsylvania . We may be of an over-sanguine disposition , but we still hope that someone will someday step forward and explain rich men . The probabilities are that Ford , if compelled to pass a night in the Pennsylvania lobby , would he discouraged ; yet he makes his house just like it . RECENTLY , after a fruitless tour up and down the island in search of the typical New York scene , we returned and flung ourselves despondently on the window sill of an office . Suddenly , like the child who discovered the Blue Bird in his own home , we realized we were looking at the very thing we had been seeking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street .

" Pelage and Plumage XTEW YORK has a happy way of changing seasons to suit herself . In the Catskills and Berkshires , summer passes into autumn slowly , but not here . When daylight saving and the World 's Series go New York calls it autumn  --  and it is . In the first place American Womanhood has entered the winter season ; from now until Easter , charms must be shrouded in the streets . And the men have replied by wearing gloves and carrying a cane . In their more rational fashion they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women do , but wear them when they feel cold ; so that now is the time to tell the warm blooded from the cold . Five o'clock is the hour when the new season shouts the loudest . The gloaming has disappeared from city life . The lights are on in the office buildings and the show windows , the sidewalks move faster , the traffic becomes more and more congested , and Pierre 's is full of metallic debutantesto-be , watchful-eyed , calculating their chances for the coming season . The games of baseball and handball that characterize every open space and blank wall from the Battery to Baker Field are ended ; the colleges are being flooded with applications for football tickets , and Saturday afternoons have come to have a new significance . Nature-lovers and the hardy-skinned replace the neckers on the bus tops . But it is mostly the sidewalks at going home time and the traffic floods that illustrate the new season  --  and the women 's overcoats . If you still cling to summer , loiter some evening by a news-stand at a subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We stand upon the brink of the fur coat season . stantially aided by Cornelius Vanderbilt . Its new quarters will be as well equipped as a club . The church will have an auditorium which will seat 6,000 , reading rooms , libraries , kindergarten , club rooms , squash court , a swimming pool larger than the Shelton 's gymnasium and marble baths to scrub the visiting bishops . Return of Raquel SENORITA RAQUEL MELLER , with delightful consistency , has again arrived on our shores . Instead of posing and smiling for the Sunday supplements , the first thing she did this time was to slam her cabin door in the faces of the ship reporters , thereby cutting herself off with a meager paragraph in each of the morning papers . When remonstrated with by her manager , Mr. Goetz , the incorrigible prima donna responded to his pleas for tact by stoutly disclaiming from her hotel any faintest desire of making her home in America , as reported . Only this past summer she bought a villa between Nice and Monte Carlo with exotic hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this she intends to return . Each of the Senorita 's demonstrations appears to be followed by the release of a new and more startling rumor . The latest is that she will appear in a moving picture based on the life of Josephine and Napoleon , Charlie Chaplin to play Napoleon . It is said that Chaplin , seeing her for the first time during her visit to the coast last year , was thrown into a frenzy of appreciation until , when he heard her a second time , he observed that her songs were not impromptu , as he had at first thought . Yet he is still impressed and Meller in a picture directed by Chaplin is a possibility . Her chief concern just now , however , is the proper preservation of several cases of honey . It appears that Raquel refuses to travel where Spanish heather honey ca n't be procured . The famous lime tree honey of her native Catalonia , as clear as jade and with a scented taste , is not at all to her liking . She insists upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is very hard to preserve . Incidentally , Miss Meller now objects to being referred to as a diseuse . It is thought that this is because she can not trust our western press . On her last American tour she picked up a paper in the hinterland and saw herself announced as " the great Spanish disease . " Tact A HOSTESS is seldom so ready to tell a story on herself as ours of last week who reported verbatim the Baths and Bishops THE FIRST brisk promenaders of the season have been viewing with regret a rocky chasm on Park Avenue where once was a lawn with pleasant trees . The rare patch of green adjoining St. Bartholomew 's has not , however , given way to a skyscraper , but is to he replaced by St. Bartholomew 's parish house  --  in architecture free Romanesque , to correspond with the church . Already the concrete foundations are taking shape . The new wing- is simply a continuation of the original church plan as made by the late Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue , which also calls for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose from the fact that simultaneous excavations for a new Cathedral High School have begun just behind St. Bartholomew 's , so that Catholic and Episcopalian caverns touch each other and appear as one . Saint Bartholomew 's parish house , which for many years has been at 209 East Forty-second Street , was subconversation between her own taxi-driver and another . " Hey , Bill , " shouted the impudent driver of an adjacent cab , " Who 's your fat friend ? " Bill sat up in alarm and responded gallantly : " My fat friend says you can go straight to blank , and that you 're a ? ? " Then he turned to our hostess , smiled and yelled : " That 's telling ' im , ai n't it , lady ? " Why ? MM ARY GARDEN 'S return has as usual started discussion  --  but perhaps even more than usual this time . She has n't been here for five years . What everyone wants to know is her purpose in returning . Obviously the return means something , but obviously also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could get many audiences here , her contract provides that the Roosevelt concert on October 23d will be the only one this season in New York City . Moreover , she could make all the money she desired by appearing only " in the provinces . " The most intriguing theory is that the inimitable Miss Garden has a stiletto up her sleeve , that some prodigious plot is afoot which shall be her revenge . For it is well remembered that she left in a huff five years ago at the close of the Chicago Grand Opera Company 's engagement with many nasty words on her lips about ? ? New York City being provincial , uncultured , boorish . And she left with the parting declaration that she would never sing here again . Miss Garden has been spending the summer as usual at Monte Carlo , her intimates being members of the Opera Comique . There has been rumor that an Opera Comique company is coming to America , so that the question has naturally arisen , whether she is backing it . Gossips are delighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the fact that New York opera was overwhelmingly and smugly German and Italian to the exclusion of French , that was part of her quarrel five years ago . She is using her feminine right to change her mind in staging this return , but not even her managers were sure that she would n't use that right and change it again , so they went to Lloyds and tried to insure against what would be an expensive non-appearance . But Lloyds refused to write a temperament policy . Meantime the largest box at Mary 's concert at the Hotel Roosevelt musicale is being reserved for Queen Marie and her party , in the hope that on her return from ' Washington the Queen will attend the concert  --  not so much to hear Garden as to honor the man who is to support the prima donna as her violin accompanist . This is Geza de Kresz , the Hungarian who had his American premiere last season and who was formerly court violinist at the Roumanian capital . Zoo AST Sunday , when all our friends , I were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaked away to say goodbye to the Zoo for the winter . Broadly speaking , the season is about over ; the sky was cold and gray ; and even the dragons , which we should have been to see long ago , were indoors . In common with all beasts who wilt at the approach of winter , they had retired . We found them in the reptile house . Unfortunately they are not on view in the main room of that torpid and torrid edifice , but in a back room with the tortoises . In order to see them one must overture a keeper and procure his escort . They climb up the bars of their cage and are as terrifying as ever they were reported outdoors . They do not look like alligators ; they are appalling-looking . The newspapers made no exaggeration . Our only other interest was to make a point of shedding tears for the fate of the two baby polar hears . Certainly they will never again see their native arctic whence the literary Mr. Putnam lately dragged them by the scruff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated to know a polar bear when it sees one , and so these darlings must live their lives behind the bars . They seemed worried , frightened and obviously wondering why it was n't snowing . Laurel Wreath THE surprising news is that Mr. Gene Tunney , Lieutenant of Marines , has been discovered by Manhattan , not as heavyweight champion but as embryo man-about-town . His social conquest of New York seems to have required only a party or two , a few dinners and luncheons ; for though he has been here most of the time since the big fight , his schedule has been for the most part that of a business man  --  a round of conferences with his ( and everybody else 's ) manager , Dudley Field Malone . The word is about that Tunney is a charming fellow , a modest though fluent conversationalist , with a definite bent and attraction for nice people . He has been a weekend guest of the Ogden Reids , and has lunched with Alice Duer Miller , and he has finally met " the other famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties which must have been good because Dick Barthelmess and the cinema celebrities were there . He likes to dance , he collects old prints , he will talk of anything , including , when pressed , the Dempsey battle . Anecdotes already afoot and circulated by the ladies are in a new tradition . There is one to the effect that he interrupted a somewhat risque story with the modest protest , " Say , do we have to go as far as that ? " Another concerns his arrival at a smart and rather late Park Avenue affair where the guests were eagerly awaiting him . When introduced by a host who mumbled his name , the champion , quite unconscious of his importance , won the hearts of the gathering by explaining to the first man who shook his hand , " The name is Tunney . " Of the gentleman-boxer 's immediate future , it is rumored that the movies may prove to be his next conquest . Several companies are said to be dickering for his services . Meantime , while Mr. Malone weighs their offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE LATEST after-theatre fad is to drop in at a shop on Broadway , between Fifty-first and Fifty-second streets , and have one 's picture taken by the simple method of dropping a quarter into a slot . The night we were there we could n't get in , so popular has the pastime become , and the gentleman who took us says that it has been the gayest " studio " in town for a fortnight . The new machine is called the Photomaton and produces , in exchange for your quarter , a strip of eight all-different poses . The new invention , which was introduced only a few weeks ago , was expected completely to revolutionize the taking of photographic pictures for passports , commutation tickets , and rogues ' galleries , but so far it has merely influenced the after-the-theatre hour . Ace and Deuce MEETING the moving picture executive , Mr. Walter Wanger , on Fifth Avenue , has reminded us that he was pointed out by an acquaintance on the boulevards of Parisduring the war . " There , " we were told , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was explained that Mr. Wan-gee had been turned over to the Italians for final flying training , had crashed with five of their planes and had been thus dubbed by a frantic Italian army . There is at least one other somewhat similarly noteworthy aviator in town , Mr. Newman Levy , the writer and lawyer . Mr. Levy entered the aviation corps and progressed in the regular manner until he was sent up for his first flight alone at a big Texa field . There were forty other planes humming in the air , all describing a one-direction circle about the field  --  a procession he had been instructed to join . Due , he confesses , to a forgetfulness as to just what certain levers were for on a plane , and to the astonishment and peril of all , Mr. Levy cut , instead , a few figure 8 's . Finally when he did join the circle of machines he was going in the wrong direction . Many whistles were blown , guns fired and other proper military measures taken , but this did n't stir Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILLIES SANG " MY RoSARY " :  --  ENG . BY JOHN HELD JR WM A LUMP IN HIS THRUM " Hey ! Who diyub think y'are  --  the Queen o ' Roo-mania ? " ? ? Levy 's memory on the subject of how to turn around . So a ground signal was put out to clear the air and soon all the other forty planes had landed . Thereafter , for two hours , while staff officers conferred and thousands of eyes gazed skyward , one solitary aviatoi had the whole welkin to himself . Finally the plane ran out of gas and Mr. Levy , perforce , came down . He made a safe landing ; but , after certain other experiences , the army decided that he was without the " aviation sense , " and he finished the war in the navy . The Last Twenty HLAUDER is arriving for an- 1 1 other concert tour which begins on Monday at the Century Theatre . He will be here a week before starting on the vast succession of one-night-stands which will take him all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him busy until next April . His whimsical explanation is that since he is now 54 years old , he must get busy on his " farewell tours , " because he plans to make twenty of them . For the past three years he has been touring the world , having been to India , China , South Africa , Aus tralia and all the principal ports in between . If he plans to make an equal number of farewells to those countries as well as to America , he has his remaining years fully mapped out for him . THE gay Scotchnian returns with Lady Lauder , with several new songs he has composed since his last visit , with all the old songs , and with a lot of new stories about his Scotch stinginess which he adores , nurses , and uses as publicity . He has a keen publicity sense and is his own press agent . Whenever he can make a waiter angry because of a ten-cent tip up at the Plaza , which is where he always lives when in the city , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . But he is suspected of not being as tight as he pretends , since he is generous in his support of charities of all kinds . The new songs he has written are : " I 'm Lookin ' for a Bonny Lass tae Love Me , " " The Boss o ' the Hoose , " and " Susie MacLean . " The titles sound as though they had been used by him before , but we are assured that they are brand new . Lady Lauder still knits his socks , as she did in the old days when he was a miner and sang his songs to his fellow workmen during lunch hours ; but on the other hand she will knit them in the lounge of their private car on their tour of the States , so that one suspects her of knitting into them a record of Sir Harry 's jokes as they are invented , rather than making them for less practical use . He is a professional wisecracker and always sprinkles his conversations profusely with puns and jokes so that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the making of phonograph records , or radio broadcasting . We are told that he is just a little grayer and balder and seems a trifle shorter than he was on his last visit , but that he is as gay as ever .
