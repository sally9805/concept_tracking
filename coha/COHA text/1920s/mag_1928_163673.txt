A kinetic surprise lurks always up the faded , military coat-sleeve of Josef Pilsudski , beloved Marshal of Poland , resolute Dictator , quixotic Prime Minister . <P> Last week , however , Deputies of the Opposition felt safe . Pilsudski was sick . They knew that he had been too ill to receive the King of Afghanistan six weeks ago ( TIME , May 14 ) , and had lain abed ever since , some said paralyzed . Therefore the Polish Sejm ( Parliament ) rang with furious denunciations of the Cabinet 's Budget Bill . This time there seemed no hope that it could be saved by a sudden , dramatic appearance of National Hero Pilsudski . <P> An appeal to the Opposition by puppet-President Ignatz Moscicki was ignored . A story gained credence that the sick Lion of Poland had fallen victim to delusions of persecution , had shot his own gardener , was raving , confined in a straitjacket . <P> Then , with the budget about to be voted down , came , as in Polish fairy tales , the surprise . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once more the frayed field uniform , the old sword , the drooping ferocious mustachios : PILSUDSKI ! <P> The Marshal , himself again , had characteristically concealed his convalescence until the last dramatic moment . Impressionable Polish Deputies , stirred once more by the mere presence of him whose glory is that he led Poland to independence from <P> Russia , shortly voted through the Budget . A second striking result of the Dictator 's sudden abandonment of the role of " Possum " was the sending , last week , of three Polish light cruisers to anchor threateningly in the port of the famed Free City of Danzig . Polish cargo ships , it was alleged , have recently been denied adequate anchorage and docking facilities by Danzigers .
