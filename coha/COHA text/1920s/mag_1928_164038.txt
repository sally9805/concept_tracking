Last week was perhaps the most remarkable speculative week in modern history of the New York Stock Exchange . Speculative , because there were no political or geological events like the declaration of War in 1914 , or the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 . Modern , because in olden days ( up to 1907 ) , the trading was small in volume and almost entirely between professional speculators , consequently subject to more sudden and violent whims than the trading of today , which affects the fortune of perhaps 7,000,000 U. S. security owners . <P> Long will it be remembered in Wall Street that last week 's unparalleled bull spurt came immediately after a dull bear market , precipitated by a sudden break ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . Equally long will market historians discuss the reason for last week 's phenomenal spurt . The principal reason was the unexpected action of the officers and directors of the General Motors Corporation in purchasing 200,000 shares of their own stock in the open market for their own account . <P> The result was not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon-but a record week in the quality of the stocks that went up under the leadership of General Motors . Only the best stocks gained . <P> General Motors managers acted against the pessimism of the Federal Reserve Bank . Why ? Because their annual report for 1927 , published last week , was far and , away the most encouraging document which the financial year had so far brought forth . Assets of $1,098,477,577 , an increase of $77,583,470 over 1926 earnings of $235,104,826 , the largest peacetime result ever achieved by a corporation ; total business of $1,269,519,673-these figures stimulated Wall Street speculators and investors everywhere , and they bought 2,431,500 shares of General Motors stock in five and one-half days , lifting the price of the stock from $144 to a high point of $161 . There are 17,400,000 shares of General Motors stock outstanding . Last week they increased $282,750,000 in value .
