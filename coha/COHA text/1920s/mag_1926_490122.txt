NOT the least amusing thing about the new Garden is the character of the ticket-takers Tex Rickard has put at the doors . They are tough , tout-like , heavy-jowled , and heavy-bellied  --  the Irish appendage of the sporting arena since time immemorial . They are exactly like the political attendants one sees in the court-house except that instead of being unnecessarily disagreeable they are busy politely taking tickets .

WE think that the drive to make New York the art center of the world , which is to start February tenth , has an excellent chance of succeeding . While feeling in our hearts that art is certainly for art 's sake , we are cynical enough , looking back at Athens , Rome , Alexandria , Venice , Florence , and the like , to believe that the art center is always where the most money is .

This , because of the experience of the Graybar Company , which adopted for its trademark a black shield with gray bar running from left south to right north . It was not until after the company had expended considerable money on stationery , paint jobs and other equipment necessary to its well-being that a competitor gleefully informed its officers that they had inadvertently chosen for their brand the Bar Sinister . Versailles THERE is a generation already to whom the Beaux Arts Ball is an institution , a generation which can no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venetian Fete of 1914 . If that is evidence that New York , hard upon its three hundredth anniversary , still has its growing pains , it is pleasant evidence , and our Landmark Editor , weeping for great houses gone , may dry his eyes ; for new and glorious traditions come to fill the breach . Such is Manhattan , where the death agony of one tradition gives birth to another . Hardly older than a decade , the Beaux Arts Ball is already almost our pleasantest event . A bit of the carefree attitude , on Friday the twenty-ninth , might easily have been due to the fact that last year 's party was so successful that the architects , who give us all these good times for the benefit of their kind , studying overseas , made enough money to last them two years and all the Fete at Versailles aimed at was a great party . At that they made money , though undoubtedly not as much as their official costumer , Brooks of Broadway . Last year the pageant was the circus , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gardens of Versailles " , and only the raiment of the court was allowed , and the censorship was strict . Vividly , we remember our slow progress across Forty-fifth Street in a close-packed taxi , heavy with the powder of wigs , The crowds which lined the sidewalks to peer in at us might have been the swarming mob lining Louis the Fourteenth 's way from Paris to Versailles , except that in Forty-fifth Street they were too good-natured , we saw only one young gentleman thumb his nose at the finery that flowed past him . Vividly also we remember the gasp of astonishment when each new entry discovered the transformation of the Grand Ball Room of the Astor , and vividly we recall the grand parading , with only two thousand of the three thousand guests packed in the ball room ; Whitney Warren , the benevolent monarch ; Harry Milliken , the herald , whose orders the band would not obey and who , between announcings , kept muttering , " Never , never , have I seen costumes so effective in a pageant ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swirling Benda masks ; Alexander Kirkland , the dashing Bonnie Prince Charlie with his piper ; and the tiny turbaned and very modern pickaninny shuffling through a much-applauded Charleston above the powdered wigs of his audience . BUT most of all we liked the real cow that Ben Morris brought down from the hinterland and installed by the bar , La Ferme of history . We liked the cow and the French we heard spoken everywhere about us . There is nothing like costumes to bring Americans out . Everyone was so polite it hurt  --  such bowings and scrapings early in the evening , such recalling of French phrases , rushed into appropriate use . Later one saw a wig pushed back , here and there ... " How did they ever manage in those days ? It 's so hot , my dear .

From Abroad pOSSIBLY it would serve the inter-1 ests of international and artistic amity to call to the attention of Mr. Arthur C. Fredericks and Mr. Augustus Lukeman a certain message which arrived from Croydon , England , with the carillon presented by Mr. John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , to the Park Avenue Baptist Church . Thus , since the Messrs . Fredericks and Lukeman have been quite agitated of late days because Mr. Ralph Adams Cram , chief architect of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , has employed foreign artists for certain works . The message which is submitted for the assuaging of the eminent gentry 's resentment is a simple , prideful , and unquestionably truthful statement . It was chalked on the largest of the perfectly-tuned bells , plain for all to behold . " You can make your Fords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOMEBODY is always discovering Poe , usually on account of the arrival of a visitor with literature inclinations from France , Belgium , Germany , and sometimes England , who says ingenuously , not knowing America , " Oh ! The first thing I must do is go and see the house of your great writer , Poe . " Ibanez , they say , is still telling the story around Spain of how he asked upon his arrival in New York to see the monument which he presumed had been raised to the author of " Annabel Lee " ; and how the reception committee looked blank , and how one of them said to the others , " Maybe he means the guy who gave that park up in the Bronx . " There is a Poe Park at t9oth Street and Kingsbridge Road  --  given to Poe not by Poe  --  with the author 's cottage in the middle of it ; a charming , cunning , sweet house , to use the phrase of somebody else ; a phrase which is the occasion for these words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it some of the original furniture and generally spruced it up so that it would look as it did when Poe lived there , it was seriously suggested by somebody that the whole thing be moved to Coney Island . And now the lady who thinks it is so cunning , suggests that they move it down to the Metropolitan Museum . The reason she gives is that no one ever sees it where it is . Which is a poor reason , according to the Bronx Historical Society , which says that 34,000 people visit it every year where it is , not counting the millions who pass by it going up and down the Kingsbridge Road . Our Animal Friends DOG stories arc almost as unconvincing as fish stories . They have , nowadays , to be sworn to just as vociferously .

On the third occasion , the implement was run over and broken . Bally was given a severe reprimand , which he took with wagging tail . Half an hour later a neighbor telephoned , saying : " I do n't like your dog any more . Look on your back porch . " A visit to the back porch discovered the jubilant beast , with a mop in his mouth , waiting patiently for his praise . To procure it from the neighbor 's house , he had cleared a six foot fence . And the mop , being wet , weighed ten pounds . The 2 00 ONE of the most vital questions raised by Mr. Kahn 's proposal to move the Metropolitan Opera is the question of what provision will be made for the poor old Opera Club .

These subscribing members have all the privileges of regular members except that they have n't so much honor and that they ca n't sit in the club boxes . At the present time they number one hundred and thirty-six . The principal function of the club is to provide a place where members can take their ease between acts , and also a place where husbands and fathers who do n't like music can enjoy a quiet nap while their wives and daughters are getting culture upstairs . Its quarters are furnished with a score of easy chairs , a regal bar and buffet , half a dozen flunkeys and a red carpet . Ladies of members have the privileges of the club except on Monday , Wednesday and Friday evenings . The initiation fee is one hundred dollars , and annual dues are twenty-five dollars , plus the cost of opera tickets . Despite the exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason has ruled that any member who runs up a bill exceeding fifteen dollars shall be suspended . INCE its incorporation in 1899 the k ? -7 dub has never had more than three honorary members . At the present time they are Giulio Gatti-Casazza , Andreas Dippel and Antonio Scotti . Its code of social procedure is extremely rigid . Full dress is technically required , but dinner coats have finally won grudging recognition . Tradition makes it a faux pas for a member to appear in anything but an opera hat . That the latter rule is strictly adhered to we have first-hand knowledge . We met a friend getting into a taxi the other night on his way to the opera club . He was wearing a crush hat , but he had his opera hat with him . It developed that because he lives in a neighborhood where small boys still think God made tall hats to throw mud at , he is compelled to carry his topper folded under his coat and change headgear in the cab . Pornography pORNOGRAPHIC literature is an institution far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You recall the aesthetic merchant of " Cruel Fellowship " ; his prototype is not unknown to the informed ones of town , and lesser models may be found by the initiates in upstairs shops and down . The long profits that lie in the bartering of fleshy works help greatly in tiding these over a dull month . Authors and publishers collect their payments only on the publication price . The increase is garnered by the smuggler , if it he a foreign work , and the retailer , whether it be foreign or domestic ; and such tales are most frequently subjected to pirated editions , for it is difficult to claim an infringement of copyright in cases where our laws look none too kindly on the original . MHE commoner run of lusty writ -- I ings may be purchased almost anywhere now , and at little cost .

So , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mallare " , D. H. Law-rence 's " ' The Rainbow " , and Floyd Dell 's " Janet March " . Five dollars will bring almost any of them . BUT there are others which corn- mand good , round sums . " A Man 's Life " , eight volumes and very rare , commands seven hundred and fifty dollars . " The Memoirs of Casanova " , " Fanny Hill " , or a first edition of James Joyce 's " Ulysses " will bring one hundred dollars , although cheaper edi- tions of the last may be had around thirty dollars . " The Modern Evelyne " does better ; its cost is one hundred and fifty dollars . The " Memoirs " of our old friend , Frank Harris , two volumes , pass under the counter for fifty dol- lars . " Painted Veils " is held at ten dollars higher , while George Moore 's " A Story-Teller 's Holiday " goes in the hidden marts for from thirty to forty dollars . Among the poets , the unexpurgated works of Eugene Field call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which includes spicy offerings of Bobby Burns and others , is quoted at the same price . One may do somewhat better in " Songs of Bilitus " , which a paltry ten dollars will take home ; and the same insignificant sum will possess one of " Aphrodite " , with a sigh of relief from the book-seller when the bargain is sealed . Paint HOWEVER many people there are who are following hockey in the Garden , they are all alive to the fact that , whereas a month ago the ice was a dirty and disturbing brown , it has lately become nice and white . The procedure , until recently , was to run a couple of inches of water over the concrete floor and freeze it , with the result that the concrete showed through a shabby chocolate color . The first night it became white , some wit spread the rumor that it was the result of milk being mixed with the water . Unfortunately this is not so .

Parkes Cadman 's daily effusions was moved to telephone the Herald Tribune lately in order to propound a personal problem for the public confessor . He dialed PENnsylvania 4000 , and presently a voice spoke , in dulcet tones . " Lord , " it said , sweetly . The perplexed one stammered a startled request for confirmation and again the angel-like voice replied , " Lord . " There was a temptation to listen acutely for the swishing of angelic wings in flight , but the inquirer managed to insist on further enlightenment . " This is the Lord Electric Company , " the angelic voice assured him . " Pennsylvania 3000 . " " Oh , " said the perplexed one , lamely , and proceeded to dial once more PENnsylvania 400o . Fleas COMING out of Mr. Ziegfeld 's New Amsterdam Theatre , probably the most successful of its kind in the world , and heading for Eighth Avenue taxi-hunting , we fell into Hubert 's Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem as to where the freaks are when they are not in the circus . Two-bodied men , fat ladies , human skeletons , fire-eaters , Zips , and so on . They 're there in force . But greater than all of these is the flea circus . We have been amazed since we have talked flea circus to find people in the most unexpected quarters who know all about it  --  four in all , which indicates , we suppose , bowing always to the professional statistician , ten times as many thousand existing . THESE much misunderstood fleas can pull wagons , rotate merry-go-rounds , jump through hoops , juggle balls , and throw balls into pill boxes . The trainer while they are doing these things gives a most instructive talk on flea psychology , proving , he feels , that loyalty and affection are not confined to the mammal kingdom , but are the glory of the flea world as well . Not the least amusing part of the show takes place at feeding time when the caged performers are taken out on leashes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all healthy brutes , they love their food . They are not the ordinary flea which we see from time to time on cats and dogs , but the flea that attacks mail , Pulex Irritans , found throughout Europe and in warm and sandy districts like California . No other kind of flea , be it noted , has ever been trained . The first step is to break them of the habit of jumping , which is done by tying wire about their necks so that when they jump they give themselves a bad wrench . They soon begin walking . Then by taking advantage of their instinctive longing to get from a white spot where they are visible to a black spot where they are invisible , they can be inveigled into doing almost anything . The flea takes two months to learn a trick , and lives a year . It matures in two weeks , after which the female lays an average of seven eggs a day . Tenors S " " Tristan " , and Signor GattiCasazza will look at you furtively ; he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messrs . Gilman and Chotzinoff , for the German tenors whom he has presented in Wagner 's love show . " Where can I find a better one ? " he will demand , repeating the challenge he flung last season at Ernest Newman . And so far there have been no suggestions . Perhaps Lauritz Melchior , the Danish tenor , is the answer . Maybe not . And yet Signor Gatti is not unaware that his " Tristans " are not all they might be . One who ought to know has repeated Signor Gatti 's latest observation on the subject . " I wish that the half dozen worst tenors would get together , " spoke Signor Gatti , " and agree never to sing Tristan ' . What would happen ? A misfortune , perhaps ; for the opera would disappear from the repertoire ! ' Incidentally , Edward Johnson knows the role , but he has sung it only in Italian , and nobody has wished on him the relearning it in German ; but he would be the answer . Fencers WE hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , seems to have been exceptionally good , from the point of view of whatever makes a good fencing year  --  the number of fencers , we presume . The sport , they say , is enjoying a slow but solid growth , particularly in the colleges . There are about fourteen colleges in the fencing league now , whereas there were only five a decade ago ; the estimate being that about two hundred additional men practice the game each year . The result has been that with the arrival of graduates in the city , clubs have been demanded where they can keep fit . Fencing is quite as good as squash as a business man 's exerciser , and is even less expensive , owing to the fact that any room will do , providing it is large enough and solid enough . Of the twelve clubs where one may fence , the largest are the New York Athletic Club and the Fencers Club , both of which have strips for ten bouts . And much slashing goes on in those places . Enthusiasts maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil , you can get all you want in fifteen minutes ; if you take it easy , you can fight for half a day . Physique is not important , excepting perhaps in saber fighting ; certainly not in the use of foils or epees . And a man of fifty is as good  --  almost  --  as one of twenty .
