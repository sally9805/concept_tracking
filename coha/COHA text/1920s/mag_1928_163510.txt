Pennsylvanians who had looked forward to the spectacle of two Pinchots running for the U. S. Senate next autumn , as a Washington newswoman lately reported they might ( TIME , Jan. 9 ) , had their hopes dashed . Alert , grey-haired , humanitarian Gifford Pinchot , onetime ( 1923-27 ) Governor of Pennsylvania , announced last fortnight that he would not run at ail . And last week , able , redhaired , social-working Mrs. Gifford Pinchot , his wife , announced her candidacy , not for the Senate , but for the House . Her opponent in the Republican primary will be Representative Louis T. McFadden , longtime member from Canton , Pa. , and lately famed as chairman of the Committee on Banking &; Currency . Mrs. Pinchot promised to " vote dry , live dry , work dry , " to favor all , not the few ; to help farmers .
