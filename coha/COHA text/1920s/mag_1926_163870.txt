Despatches reported that Super-Tuchun Chang , who is reconsolidating his grip upon Manchuria ( TIME , Jan. 4 et ante ) , has apparently incurred the active displeasure of the U. S. S. R. <P> The Soviet Foreign Minister , M. Georg Tchitcherin , officially charged that Chang 's troops interfered last week with the Soviet-operated sector of the Chinese Eastern Railway south of Harbin . Allegedly M. Ivanoff , the Soviet general manager of this sector of the railway , was " arrested " by Chang 's soldiers , who thought that they should be allowed to ride free . Certain rolling stock appears to have been smashed , a mail car looted , and two Soviet engineers forced to operate trains on which the Chinese soldiers rode . <P> On the basis of these charges M. Tchitcherin sent a threatening telegram to Super-Tuchun Chang demanding the release of M. Ivanoff " within three days " and observance of the Chino-U . S. S. R. treaties , which guarantee Chinese non-interference with the railway in question . <P> Thus far M. Tchitcherin appeared to have entered merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which irresponsible Chinese soldiers are in the habit of committing now and then . He despatched another telegram , however , to Tuan Chi-jui , the impotent Chief Executive of the Chinese Republic , at Peking . M. Tchitcherin demanded that the Tuan Government force Super-Tuchun Chang to heed the demands made upon him or authorize the U. S. S. R. " to use its own efforts " in coercing Chang . <P> Since the Tuan Government is notoriously so weak that its pretense of representing " China " is a mockery , M. Tchitcherin 's " impossible " demand that it coerce the powerful Chang was regarded as a warning that the U. S. S. R. is seriously considering the employment of the Red Army against the pro-Japanese , anti-Soviet " Manchurian War Lord . " <P> Late and unsubstantiated despatches from Moscow reported that Chang 's troops had seized " numerous additional Soviet workers and officials at Harbin . " Allegedly Chang imposed a complete censorship upon the local Soviet newspapers , which appeared " with big blank white pages " in protest .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
