txt Nearly seven years ago at a moment of grave peril an appeal was made to this country for men . We all know how that appeal was met . Those who were fortunate enough to get early places in the queue caned themselves The First Hundred Thousand . This week the country has been confronted with a situation equally grave . Once again the appeal has gone out and today we have another hundred thousand in being  --  a new hundred tlibusand . Here they are , encamped all over the country  --  and there they seem likely to remain for a while . The threatened general strike , it is true , has collapsed , but there is plenty of trouble left to go on with . The miners are out for a fight to a finish and it may be a long and bitter fight . And behind the dust ? the coal dust ? of this particular conflict other forces are at work . Unemployment and unrest are widespread and there is a tendency here and there toward sabotage and " direct action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation to ply their furtive trade and exploit honest hotheads . Inflammatory speeches are being made and seditious literature circulated in every favorable district . It is just as well , then . that , the forces of law and order should be mobilized and equipped to protect all of us ? both the just and . unjust  --  from the sudden upheaval . That is why they will carry on until the hotheads have come to themselves again and the mischief makers been relegated to their holes . " : ew Defense Force in Training . Behold the defence force undergoing training . It has a strangely familiar appearance . It is the old First Hundred Thousand over again with a difference ? a most obvious and gratifying difference  --  the difference between crudity and maturity . In 1914 the life of the newly joined recruit ' was labor and sorrow . He lived a hunted and precarious existence . He had never been.from home before and was correspondingly homesick . He was sullenly resentful of the peremptory atmosphere in which he found himself and the obligation suddenly thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given without any kind of argument or back-chat whatever . He was cowed by a welter of ritual and ceremonial . He was constantly getting into trouble for doing what deemed to him perfectly natural and . sensible things , such as relieving the Monotony of battalion parade by humorous asides to his neighbor or of life in general by unauthorized excursions to some adjacent centre of population . In fact he was dazed and helple , ss . He had to be nursemaided and chaperoned to his meals , his bath and his bed . If left to himself he preferred to go without any of these things rather than risk an interview with a superior . He had no knowledge of his rights and privileges as a soldier of ' the King . In fact he would have been greatly surprieed if you had told him that he possessed any at all . He regarded an officer as a tyrannical employer and his company sergeant as that employer 's hired bully ? a pair enriching themselves at his expense by an ingenious system of fines and deductions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , and being for the most part tqwnbred and accustomed to bright lights and noisy surroundings was not by any means too happy when left alone on a quiet Country road in the dark . A Different Soldier Today . But the private soldier of the new Hundred Thousand is a very different individual . In the first place he is a citizen him the spectacle of a battalion on the march no longer inspires a feeling of condescending compassion or scornful derision . Instead it awakes in him a thrill of old comradeship and the proud consciousness that he , too , is of the craft . Above all , he knows enough now of army life to have lost his fear of the unknown . To him " a sergeant now , however grim , a simple sergeant is to him , " and not a roaring lion . A Quartermaster is no longer a corpulent vampire fattening upon the private 's lifeblood . He is merely an obstructive but placable guardian of the treasure-house. who , if tapped in the right spot , will ooze forth boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are  --  officious loafers in red brassards and not ravening wolves . Army procedure contains no mysteries for him . He understands the rules governing pay and allowances . He knows all about leave and when he is entitled to it . He knows how to salute and whom to salute , and when to present arms . Small matters but uplifting to one 's military dignity once they are mastered . He is no longer struck with a dumb palsy when brought up before his commanding officer in the orderly room . If he has a case he states it simply and without whining . Above all , he ** soldierly habits . On the march he takes care of his feet . In camp he can shake down with a minimum of fuss  --  gleaning a stray blanket here , wrangling an extra ration there , grousing conventionally the while but seeking in the main for expedients to keep himself comfortable and efficient rather than for excuses for not doing so . in short , his period of service with the colors has taught him to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face whatever badge of rank those men may wear . Above all , he understands the meaning of esprit de corps  --  which is the beginning and end of a military system such as ours . With such seasoned material to work upon you can set the machine running in a space of , time incredible to those - familiar with our pre-war capabilities in that direction . A Camp on the Outskirts of London . Here is a camp on the outskirts of London . Last Sunday it did not exist . Now it is an orderly wilderness of tents and huts , housing a division of three brigades of infantry with its proper complement of gunners , sappers. supply and transport . Over in that corner is a hospital sent with the Red Cross floating over it . Here are bath houses , wet and dry canteens , and mess huts with crockery and cutlery complete . Shades of 1914 ! Recreation is not forgotten either . There is to be a football match tomorrow between two brigades . There was a moving picture show last night . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . the band of the Third Queen 's Westminster Cadets came down from London at their own charges and played lustily round the camp for our benefit instruments nstruments incredibly large for the bodies that carried them . This very afternoon we are expecting a party of famous actors and actresses from the West End who have volunteered to devote their hard-earned Sunday to the entertainment of the new Hundred Thousand . There are positive promises of Violet Loraine and Leslie Henson . There are rumors of George Robey . The camp is seething with excitement . If this be the soldier 's life , who would be a civilian ? The English Summer is setting in with its usual severity and may get worse , but the ground inside the tents-is dry and blankets are plentiful . Uniforms are being issued rapidly and it is guaranteed that every one will be fully equipped by tomorrow . Certainly if this store piled high with bales of clothing and those open packing cases brimming over with new boots mean anything the promise will be fulfilled . Contrast this orderly preparedness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fresh quarters you lived in unfinished , roofless huts or barns , or lay in the mud . Rations were scanty and intermittent and fuel almost unprocurable . As for uniforms , if you possessed a pair of khaki trousers , a postman 's tunic " without buttons , " and your own bowler or possibly woolen nightcap. you were an aristocrat . Plates , knives and forks we neither saw nor needed . Our diet was limited to sustenance which could be eaten with a spoon or drunk out of a mess tin ? in other words , stew and tea . Recreation huts and concert parties were never heard of until far into 1916 . Yet here we are inside of seven days in a fully-equipped camp , drawing pay twice a week , with separation allowances , all in order , and a weekly bonus for men with war service , with leave placed upon a liberal and regular basis . with wet and dry canteens , with an entertainment program and boxing tournament already fixed up and a divisional concert party of our own in process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the western front ! Military preparedness may be a demoralizing and degrading business , but it certainly provides the mere soldier with a standard of decency and comfort which is apt to be lacking under more enlightened and less militaristic direction . Personnel of the New Army . What of the personnel of the new Hundred Thousand ? How do they compare with their predecessors ? Well , in many cases they were their own predecessors . A glance at this group of officers will tell you that their history sheets are emblazoned across their breasts in the ' form of prismatic ribbon . The ranks , too , contain a large leavening of trained soldiers . Observe this company returning from route march . Such as are in uniform sport at least general service and Victory ribbons . Many of those in mufti wear a particolored strip above the lefthand waistcoat pocket . Others display a silver badge . These form fours and slope arms with a click and snap which nothing but long training can impart . Watch that sentry before the guard tent . Beneath that frayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and straight back of the trained soldier . That short , quick stride and crisp turn of the heel were never learned in the street . Amid their admiring juniors , who proclaim their novitiate in every pose , these ironsides stand out like poplars in an osier bed . The greatest contrast is furnished by the Sergeants and Corporals . ' In the early days of Kitchener 's army the noncommissioned rank was fairly evenly divided between middle-aged gentlemen of mid-Victorian bearing and an obsoete military vocabulary and diffident be- ' ginners , who owed their " stripe " to possession of a raucous voice and a diBiety.in the defense force today every N. C. 0 . bears the genuine hall-mark . If you glance at the record of service furnished by medal and ribbons you will be astonished at the number of Military Crosses indicated . Here and there you will observe a D. S. 0 . Here actually is a C. M. G. Now the D. S. 0 . and the C. M. G. are only awarded to officers  --  and fairly senior officers at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's simple enough , " he says . " That Sergeant Major with the C. M. G. was a Brigadier General during the war . He had worked his way up from Corporal and got his commission after the first Ypres show . He was demobbed after the armistice and went back to his civilian job . But he did n't stand on his dignity when this force was raised . He just came along and enlisted as a private . During this week he has risen to the dizzy rank o1 a company Sergeant Major . We have three Colonels among our N. C. O. 's , too , and a Captain with the Military Cross acting as an officer 's servant . Bless you , they do n't mind what they do so long as they get back . " Verily , love of soldiering , when it bites into a man 's system , bites deep . As to Morale and Discipline . What of the morale and discipline of this overnight army ? Let us consult two opposite authorities . First , the company commander . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " In them the ordinary soldier 's utter childishness and incapacity to look after himself seem to be lacking altogether . We have all sorts , of course . There are a lot of city and professional men what you might call the best type of amateur . They regard the whole business as a glorious opportunity to get physically fit . You can imagine how keen they are . " Then we have a contingent of real old-fashioned professional fire eaters . They are quite annoyed with the Government for guaranteeing that this force is not to be sent overseas or to Ireland . They are out for a scrap and nothing else . Still , their discipline is all right and they serve as a reminder to the rest of us that we are after all a fighting force if required . By the way , the G. 0 . C. looked us over yesterday and certified us fit to go anywhere and do anything at once . Then we have a good many of genuine unemployed . The defense force has been a godsend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces have filled in and their tails gone up with regular meals and a real man 's job once more . Do you see that customer over there ? That 's one of our company characters " ( he points to a rubicund gentleman in military negligee basking in the April sunshine ) . " He was half starved when he joined  --  more like a. lost dog than anything . Now he has n't . a care in the world except anticipation of te- day wIten the present unpleasantness subsides and we disband i ? " No , we have no trouble in enforcing discipline . In fact we do n't need to hold the reins at all tightly . Most of these men seem to know the rules of the game already . They look after I themselves and one another . I have had only one man up before me , during the whole week and that was only for intertrosing an interjection during church parade . " ' What did he say ? ' The officer points again to the rubicund gentleman now removing a temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Oh , Lord , please make the Bolshies good again  --  but not just yet . ' " Next the lady superintendent of the N. and A. C. B. Canteen . What the Lady of the Canteen Says , " This hut , " she explains , " is a fair test of discipline and good manners in itself . At the far end you see Le a wet bar . At this end my girls and I sell groceries and cups of coffee . You can imagine what things might become for us if business were too brisk at the other end of the hut , but I never had occasion to complain of a single man . They play the game  --  that 's all . " That seems to be the general verdict . I wish some of those softly living moralists , who bleat furiously against the brutalizing effects of militarism , could be here . They would learn certain things which it would profit them to know , namely : that the man who has been a soldier of his own free will during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life seems to carry with him thereafter certain priceless attributes , ? such as love of law and order for their own sake , a certain pride in having things " just so , " and a hatred of sloppiness , a personal sense of responsibility and enormous self-respect . There are exceptions to the rule , of course , but If a man is of the right material discipline only refines him . Such is the defense force  --  the living symbol of the relentless common sense of the British people . Above all , it is a portent  --  a sign of the times . Its existence amounts to a plain intimation from the average citizen of this country that his patience is running out : that in future capital and labor will not be permitted to brawl indeterminately across his prostrate body , and that tin ' less they can settle their differences expeditiously and reasonably they must expect to have their heads knocked to ' gether . It is also a plain hint to apostles of revolution to take their pigs to another market . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that they will stand no nonsense from wild men . That , incidentally , was why the First Hundred Thousand went under canvas In 1914 . There are those who assert , and who appear to enjoy asserting , that the war was won in vain . It was certainly won at a terrible price . But it has at least left us a tradition  --  built up or rather reincarnated , through more than four ' testing years ? of calmness under stress and entire refusal to be bustled or dragooned by faddists , extremists or traitors . Never have we been so conscious as today of our existence as a community and of our steadfast determination to maintain the rights of that community in face of violence and intrigue . That is the spirit that lies behind the New Hundred Thousand . There they are , unemotional , undemonstrative , willfully neglecting their own lawful business , flippantly careless of the acuteness of the crisis , yet conscious deep down in their hearts that so long'as they toe the line , and close ranks the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . A ? great price has been paid for it . But perhaps in the Elysian Fields those who paid the price for us realize . that it was they and their example that put the New Hundred Thousand into the field  --  to fight for the rights of the community as surely as the Old Hundred Thousand died to preserve its life . This being so , perhaps they will decide that the price they paid was not too great after all .
