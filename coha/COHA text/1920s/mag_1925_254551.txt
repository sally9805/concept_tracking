In the year 1415 , Emperor Sigismund , the perfidious ruler of the Holy Roman Empire and the last of the Luxemburg dynasty , had burned at the stake one John Hus , protestant against the Catholic Church ( he is alleged to have intimated that the Antichrist might be found at Rome ) , and a hero of Bohemia . <P> Last week , on the 510th anniversary of John Hus 's death , Czecho-Slovakia celebrated her first " Nation Day " by commemmorating Hus . Up went the Hussite flag over the Presidential Castle and loud and strong were the cries from Rome . The Papal Nuncio was recalled and the Czecho-Slovak Minister to the Holy See was ordered to return to Prague . The situation had the earmarks of a first-class row . <P> To be sure , the Hussite celebrations were only part of the causes of Catholic hostility . In Catholic eyes the Czecho-slovak State was formed by a group of heretics and , as a matter of fact , the leaders of the nation are today mainly Protestant or " liberal freethinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Republic had caught its wind was to seize Church property , much to the discomfiture of Rome , and then to make a bold bid for a National Church . The Hussite celebrations were the sparks which caused the explosion . <P> To make the picture still more extraordinary , three fourths of the people are Roman Catholics . The Government , which is predominantly anti-Catholic , can not last without Catholic support and hence , while the Socialists are demanding a break in diplomatic relations , suppression of religious teaching and complete separation of Church and State , the Catholics , as the greatest political force , have to be mollified . <P> In a Slovak village-the Protestants are mainly Czechs-a priest rashly called President Masaryk a heretic . Gendarmes arrested him after a struggle with the people in which many were wounded , one killed .
