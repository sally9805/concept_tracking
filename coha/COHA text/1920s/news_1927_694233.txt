txt Freight Car Mileage . THE Times editorial of Aug. 14 , " BAN way and Highway , " has just been brought to my attention . With your argument for the supplementary relationship between the railroad and motor transport I am in agreement . I would like to point out , however , that the average mileage of a freight car Per day hardly means what you assumed it to mean in your opening paragraph . It is a vital figure in railroad operation , but can hardly be fairly used with so simple a connotation as you gave it . It must be borne lit mind that shippers have forty-eight hours ' free time in which to load cars , and consignees have forty-eight hours ' free time in which to unload cars . All of this free time is included in the computation of average movement per car Per , day . Also included are all surplus cars for which there is no traffic , as well as all Cars in shops end on sidetracks awaiting repair . In short , the average movement per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement per day by the total number of ears , a considerable part of which are not moving for the reasons set forth above . Hence , you can ace that the actual movement of the cars in motion must be many times the average miles per car per day . This average for the year 1926 was 30.4 miles , and to produce this average the cars actually in movement each day had to travel well over 100 miles . HOBERT R. BINICERD .
