In a house in Baltimore , a mature-looking woman with pale , patrician flesh above her square-cut bodice , with brows like ribbons over quiet , uninterested dark eyes , looks out from a wooden panel at the doings of Jacob Epstein . Mr. Epstein , once a peddler , * now a dry-goods millionaire , will admit to a few friends that the lady cost him $250,000-about $1,250 per square inch since the portrait is only 17 in. x 11 ? in . Her name is Emilia Pia de Montefeltro , and to set his mind at rest as to whether or not she was painted by her fellow townsman Raphael Sanzio , Mr. Epstein has letters from such authorities as Connoisseur Bernhard Berenson of Paris and Dr. George Gronau of Cassell , Germany . Mr. Epstein 's agents , F. Kleinberger Inc. , of Manhattan , told last week how Dr. Gronau had discovered her , through a friendly priest , in a dusty room in a decaying house in an old precinct of Vienna . <P> Modernist noses are elevated at any mention of Raphael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prefer the austerities and twisted imperfections of painters who , as they say , " knew less and hence could feel more , " the pre-Raphael primitives . But the " modernists " of today are the conservatives of tomorrow . Painter Raphael 's fame has never been any more gravely beclouded than was his princely young life , which , beginning at the ducal court of Urbino where his painter-father enjoyed generous patronage , was strewn with the gold of rulers and the blandishments of their women , in Perugia , Florence , Rome . One of his mistresses became " Poetry " in the Vatican ; another , the Sistine Madonna . <P> Such has been Raphael 's fame that all his pictures have been taken away from little Urbino just as he was . Not one remains . Nor is there is a peddler-millionaire in Urbino with 5,250,000 lire to spend in bringing back even a small-size Raphael of questioned authenticity . <P> But there is Mussolini , director-general of everything from apple-carts to art in Italy . The citizens of Urbino lately sent a delegation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from its hooks in the Uffizi at Florence , Raphael 's portrait of a relative of Emilia Pia de Montefeltro , one Francesco Maria Della Revere , Duke of Urbino and patron of its painters . After a fitting period of exhibition in the Ministry of Public Education at Rome , the duke will be restored to his duchy , courtesy of Signor Raphael Sanzio . <P> *And not to be confused with expressionistic Sculptor Jacob Epstein of London .
