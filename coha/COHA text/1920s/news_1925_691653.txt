txt One sometimes wonders just what are the fundamental teachings of Christianity after examining the claims of the Fundamentalists and the Modernists . I sometimes wonder what is the explanation that either side will give when confronted with the fact that there are records of saviors coming to different races , in different climes and periods ? some long anterior to that of Jesus  --  and around whose figures are built the same stories of having been born of a virgin and being raised from the dead . Our friends the Fundamentalists and the Modernists prefer to ignore this question . The Roman Catholic Church , far more logical , argues that the appearance of these false saviors was the work of the devil , who was cunning enough to seek a means to continue to confuse men 's minds . Could it be within the range of reason to suspect that our modern conceptions of things religious are the work of that same devil ? Probably that which is unwelcome will continue to be ignored .
