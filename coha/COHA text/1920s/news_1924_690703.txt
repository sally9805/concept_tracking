txt I have read with much Interest the statement which Mr. La Follette made in Washington on Sept. 17 as regards Ills making a thorough housecleaning , if elected , and removing all of the present Cabinet members . In Justice to our Secretary of Commerce , Herbert Hoover , I wish to ? say that at no time has he abused his office or been connected in any dishonest dealings whatsoever . He hag contributed to the welfare of our American industries . He has managed the nation 's business with great care , Ire has put simplified methods in a great many industries and has saved millions of dollars for the American manufacturers , and he has achieved more success than any of his predecessors . Ire has bandied the American Relief , which was under his jurisdiction , with the greatest care apd ability , and has accomplished much to that end as a humanitarian , and he has won the admiration of the American people , as well as that of the European tuitions . He - has reorganized our Bureau of Domestic and Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most able business engineer , Dr. Julius Klein , who has put etflclency , in the4Bureau of Foreign Commerce  --  more efficiency than any of the former directors . Ho has tried , and Is trying , to educate the American manufacturer and exporter who Is seeking foreign trade how to obtain better results , and has been more than nueeaseful to that end , as statistics of our foreign commerce show in the thousands of inquiries received by the Commerce Bureau from foreign markets ; and there Is n't a commodity or manufactured article which Is not represented in our Foreign Bureau . ot Com- merce . The game of politics is not played in his department ; . the best men , well experienced In this line , are sent abroad as our commer cial representatives , and American merchandise is flowing in ? all corners of the foreign world ; all of this is due to the good management and foresight of our Secretary of Commerce , Herbert Hoover , and , therefore . I believe that Mr. La Follette is unfair in reflecting upon the characters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their work and ability that the interest of the American nation and public is ever in their minds .
