The Reichsarchiv requested that the U. S. Government return the originals of all German official documents ( several hundred in number ) captured by the American Army in the War . Similar American documents in German hands are offered in return . They number about a dozen . <P> The documents are the property of the United States and can not be dis posed of without the consent of Congress . <P> American army officials are anxious to grant the favor , in view of the ready access given American army officers to the German records , war plans and orders of the German General Staff . <P> It is probable that true copies will be sent to the German archives , pending action by the U. S. Congress .
