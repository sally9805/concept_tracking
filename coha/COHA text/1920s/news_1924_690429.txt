txt Some progress was made today in the preparations for the session of the Interallied Conference , though the debates in the committees were marked by heated controversy and a show of obduracy on points held by the French delegates to be vital . This was notably the case of the First Committee , which is concerned.with the problems of possible German default . France has in principle accepted the view that it is unnecessary , if not impossible , to define the exact nature of the penalties to be imposed in case of wilful default , but she is not willing altogether to exclude the possibility of separate action against Germany . It is hoped that some compromise may be reached whereby all the signatories may 1 , ne. themselves to concert and execute such measures as may seem ma , . but France may still think it necessary to make it clear that in the event of such measures appearing to her to be inadequate she will feel in no way debarred from independent action .

" It not now thought likely , however . t1 , at any stipulation to this effect will .. e inserted . The British and French views , which : ? ad been put into writing , were argued et at length . Mr. Snowden is understood to have agreed to drop the stipulation that no measures . involving occupation of German territory shall be taken . Naturally , this does not imply that such measures are definitely foreseen , but there is simply to be no reference to action of that sort . The American members of this committee were active with helpful suggestions , and the Italian and Belgian delegates vied with the Americans in seeking a solution ac , eptable to both France and Great Britain . In general , it may be said that French delegates fully realize the necessity of reassuring- the bondholders and , are ready to agree to give absolute priority to the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reparation Commission for the purpose of adjudicating on default , this will , it is hoped , produce the desired effect . The military experts of the French and Belgian delegations were summoned in ' private consultation to give their views on the safety of the troops in ' the occupied area during and after the withdrawal of the Franco-Belgian railway men now working there . It was decided that it would be absolutely necessary to retain a nucleus of not fewer than 3,000 men , as otherwise a German strike might paralyze the railway organization at any moment . On the other hand , it is hoped to arrange for complete economic evacuation in two stages instead of five . The Third Committee practically completed its work.  --  It concluded its examination of the problem of transferring reparation payments from the internallied receiving agency which is to be set up in Berlin under the Dawes scheme to the various creditor counfries . It is understood that each'country is to arrange its own machinery for receiving payment , which may be made in either cash or kind . Belgians Dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitch arose out of the drawing up of a report by M. Seydoux , the French delegate . relative to plans for the restoration of Germany 's fiscal and economic unity without previous consultation with the Belgians . As a consequence this committee was not in a position to hold a meeting today . The difficulty . however , was adjusted and the committee will meet tomorrow morning under the Presidency of J. H. Thomas . Most of the delegates are preparing to take things easily during the week-end . Premier who began the day by having M. Herriot , Signor de Stefan ' , M. Theunis and Ambassador Kellogg to early breakfast and then discussing points with his guests until 10 o'clock , went to Chequers this afternoon and will have a number of the chief delegates lunching with him at that delightful country residence on Sunday . Arrange= ments have been made by the British Government Hospitality Committee for most of the members of the foreign delegations to visit Wembley Exhibition tomorrow afternoon . Today 's atmosphere is described as a distinctly good one .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
