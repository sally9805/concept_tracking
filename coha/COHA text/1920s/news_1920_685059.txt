txt LESSONS OF THE STORM . Incompetent City Management and Indifferent Citizenship . To the Editor of The New York Tilites : After trying for a fortnight to collect the pay for a few hours ' work for the Street Cleaning Department , I can suggest at least one of the reasons why capable men are not allured even by the promise of SO cents an hour . Skipping the five hours wasted in trying to find work ? at a time when the department complained that men could not be had  --  let us jump to what happens when work is done . The laborer , after standing in line in the cold for half an hour or more , gets his ticket punched with the - number of hours worked . This ticket , which ought easily to be cashed , may only be turned into money'at the branch office where Ile man was hired , when the paymaster is there .. This mysterious individual is supposed to come twice a week at about 7 o'clock in the evening , but he goeth when he listeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday , and at 7 or 11 or midnight . In my own case I missed him on his first visit , and was told next day to go to the Municipal Building . After three visits there , I finally found the cash window working , . only to be told that " they only sent you here to get rid of you , " and that the only place tickets could be cashed was the branch . office . I was on hand at -7 the next pay-day evening , was told to return at O .. and after finally giving it up that- night , made a deal with an amiable maid servant , living near by , to collect the honorarium on a commission . She returned the ticket after the next pay day with the report that when she had gone to bed at II o'clock the men were line , having broken a window with their pushing , and that as a matter of fact they were not paid until 3 o'clock in the morning . Undoubtedly , if nothing but this moneyhad stood between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first pay evening all night , if necessary , but it seems doubtful if the city is justified in treating even down-and-outers in this fashion , or if ambitious laborers are likely to be ? attracted by such a prospect . There are plenty of good fellows among the snow shovelers ? I shall remember the charming young Italian who improved my ice-breaking technique ( and there is more of a trick with a pick than you might think ) ; the exercise is splendid , and after shoveling on three afternoons I am more than ever struck with the colossal silliness of a big city in an emergency like this . There are . thousands of men in New York who , if they were to return tomorrow to the small towns from which they came , would shovel off the front sidewalk , a path from ' the house to the street , and another along the clothes line  --  several hundred ' feet , like enough  --  and think nothing of it . But collect them in Manhattan , and they will gape at a few square yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were bound hand and foot . There must be some way . of mobilizing this wasted strength in an emergency , even if we do not go as far as some European cities and compel the householder to clean , not only the sidewalk , but the pavement as well , out to the middle of the street . The thing that strikes the amateur shoveler overwhelmingly is the lack in the department of all that spirit with which the whole air was electric a , year ago , that local pride and sense of service , that morale ' and teamwork , the value of which one would suppose the war had taught everybody . Is it too much to ask that sonic of the intelligent enthusiasm which was thrown into preparation for a foreign war should be used in running our home affairs in tirnes of peace ? Here is a job in which time is money ? in terms of millions of dollars ? in the most literal sense of the word ; on which the safety , let alone the comfort and self-respect , of millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious fact he brought home to the people , then let it be done by posters and Pretty girls , if need be , and bands and speakers who have a real sense of personal shame in the disgraceful condition of their town , the ultimate aim being , of course , a properly equipped and disciplined body of men , treated . not like hoboes working for a handout , but as self-respecting citizens engaged in a difnified , interesting and important work .
