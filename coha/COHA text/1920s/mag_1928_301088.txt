MIDSUMMER NIGHT , And Other Tales , in Verse-John Masefield-Macmillan ( $2 ) . <P> John Masefield is no minor poet , yet his genius is for telling a tale . The tale has been told time and again of Arthur and his knights , of Gwenivere and her Lancelot , but never so utterly that a master craftsman dare not render his version . Not as an epic drama in the Tennysonian manner , but like the medieval minstrel in fitful lyrics Masefield catches a climax here , a sad mood there . The variegated metres and intermittent themes are disjointed in a whole effect , but the wistful beauty of moments and moods stands out as never in earlier classics . Thus Arthur dying : <P> He gathered up his dying strength , he <P> swung <P> The weapon thrice and hurled it to the <P> stream ; <P> It whirled like a white gannet with a <P> gleam , <P> Turning blade up in moonlight as it <P> fell ; <P> Bright-flying foam-drops stung <P> The steel , the spray leapt as it <P> disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
