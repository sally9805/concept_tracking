txt An attempt was made today to resuscitate the joint resolution by Representative Porter of Pennsylvania to reduce by one-quarter the taxes payable this year on last year 's income , but without success . After a meeting of the Republicans of the Ways and Means Committee , called especially to consider the Porter resolution , the announcement was made by Chairman Green and by the floor leader , Mr. Longworth , that it had been killed and that there would be no op .. portunity to pass it before Saturday , the final day for paying the first instalment of the income tax . .. , - 03ie.rpoIntion 's only supporters at the " etilleienee-APparently were Representatives Tilson , Treadway . Bacharach , Mills and Chindblom . Mr. Green and Mr. Longworth were opposed to separating the reduction from the tax bill , which brought the criticism from other members that they feared the gift tax and the Long-worth income schedules might be lost through a Presidential veto . " The parliamentary situation in the House makes it impossible for the resolution to get through , " explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter understood from committee members that his resolution would remain before the committee , to be taken up if the tax bill is lost in conference or vetoed . Representative Chindblom , Republican , of Illinois , in.troduced a bill embodying Title 12 of the Revenue bill , which reduces taxes retroactively 25 per cent . He said that it also could be enacted as an independent law if necessary . The Mr. Chindblom 's resolution was regarded by Democrats and insurgents as another argument that the Administration would either have the tax bill killed or would advise its peaceful death in.conference before Congress adjourned . In that event ; they asserted , the Republicans would then go to the country with the claim : " The tax bill was not passed , but we have put through a separate resolution cutting 25 per cent . off your taxes . " The Administration " die-hards " of the Icommittee were disappointed that the Porter resolution was nat accepted . In spite of the opposition by Radicals and Democrats , and even some of the Republicans , these men said that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever reached the House floor . No indication that the White House had demanded passage of the resolution developed during the day . On the other hand , men on the committee close to the Administration stated that even if President Coolidge desired the legislation , he would not be in position to urge it , because he might be accused of a desire to get the tax bill into position for a future veto , and also because legislative direction might be charged against him . Senator Smoot said that if the resolution could pass the House , he believed the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate itself would approve it . Before the income schedules of the revenue bills are considered by the Finance Committee , Secretary Mellon will be asked to appear and estimate the necessary revenue to be raised , Senator Smoot said today . At the meeting of the committee an amendment was approved limiting to six years the time in which the Government could enter legal proceedings to collect tax assessments . In Doubt as to the Estates Tax . At the session of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bill as it passed the House continued in doubt , A number of Republican leaders , including Senator Watson of Indiana . are opposing it on the ground that such a levy should be kept at a minimum in order that the several States might use it as an important item of their annual incomes . The committee also continued its discussion of the proposal advanced last Friday that this tax be made ' one of direct inheritance rather than a percentage of the estates of decedents . Such a change would raise the rates as they are in the bill at present and reduce the exemptions , which now stand at $50,000 and below . No decision was reached on either point . The committee continued throughout the day to consider these administrative sections of the revenue bill , planning to take up the income schedules tomorrow , including the 25. per cent , reduction in 1923 , which remains in the bill because it was found impossible to expedite it as a separate joint resolution to be passed before March 15.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
