txt America 's old acquaintance , Dr. Dernburg , told the German Reichstag , in effect , that German lying had been so clumsy during the war and the peace negotiations that it had brought the German intellect into contempt . When the Soviet 's official prevaricator undertakes what seems an impossible task , he should at least assure some remote possibility in the falsehood he tells . His explanation of the famine in Russia is not merely untrue but is , on his own showing , demonstrably false . A correspondent of Hearst 's foreign press service , in Stockholm , quoting one whom he describes as " the Soviet Government 's commissioner at Stockholm " , says : " Lust year the grain growers were unable to save seed for this year 's sowing . However , the government provided seed , and ' all lands , so asserts the Soviet commissioner to me , were fully and hopefully sown . " Then followed the unprecedented great European drought of the present year . " This should easily be the record even for the wildly improbable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Journal showed , on May 3 in this column , that a greater famine in Russia this year than China had ever experienced was a certainty . It did not predict , because no one could , the drought , which , incidentally . has not affected the black earth region where Russia grows its grain . The famine was a certainty because , as was then stated , the Red army and the Soviet commissars had eaten up the seed grain as faithfully as the locust . It will be noted that this commissioner admits the grain growers had no seed grain . That fact was incontrovertible beyond the reach of any lie . So he says , with suspicious sequence to the repetition of the truth made in this column on August 5 , that " the government provided seed " . Where did it get it ? Certainly not in Russia , for it had all been eaten . But if there were such a store of seed as would be necessary to supply all or even a large part of the growers , how was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all transportation ? It has been truly remarked that a liar should have a good memory . From exactly the same sources assurances of a large grain crop , successfully sown , were freely supplied three months ago . The possibility of a famine was indignantly denied . But the great Russian growers of grain have been wiped out and the peasant has been plundered of every kernel , save perhaps the small part he managed to conceal to keep himself and his family alive . The Soviet commissars no more realized that the seed reserve was absolutely necessary for future support , than Lenine and his followers saw that the capital they destroyed was indispensable for the future support of the workers . Estimates , by the Soviet Government itself , place the number of people dying or dead of plain hunger at 18 , - 000.000 . That guess might perhaps he exaggerated , to stimulate the world 's pity . But it is far more probable that it is an unucrestimate to save the Soviet Government 's face . Raising the three-mile sea limit to twelve sounds easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides .
