The Professional Golfers Association used to give a silver cup to the player who won their annual tournament . This year they put up a radio phonograph with a bronze plate for the winner 's name . Nobody knew where the cup was . Walter Hagen had won it so often that he got careless about it and forgot it one day . When Leo Diegel beat him last year , Hagen 's manager had to tell the committee where the cup was . " I do n't know , " he said . " It 's hard enough getting him out of bed in the morning without picking up after him . " Playing unevenly at Hillcrest Country Club near Los Angeles last week , Hagen was put out in the semifinal by nervous , capable Diegel . John Farrell put out Al Watrous who was his best friend when they used to caddy together on courses in Westchester County . N. Y. <P> Every tournament brings up some new player . The one at Hillcrest was a giant Californian , Fred Morrison , who made 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 136 , four better than Diegel . Before long he disappeared into the traps that medalists so often discover in a match play . Harry Cooper , who had been given a starting time , was ruled out because he had not played in the elimination tournament in his district . Tommy Armour , one-eyed Scot , was sick at home . Al Espinosa put out Bill Melhorn in a match that went 40 holes , then was put out himself by Watrous . In the finals Farrell kept on Diegel 's heels until the ninth hole in the afternoon when he knocked the wrong ball in the hole trying to putt past a stymie . He did the same thing on the next hole and then Diegel won three in a row to get his name on the radio set .
