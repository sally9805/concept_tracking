txt I am glad to be home again . I should like to have stayed longer in Europe and taken a good look around , but now that we are anchored off Pineypoint , Md. , and in sight of land , it feels good to be back . It has been a wonderful trip in every way . I was not seasick a minute , though we had some pretty rough weather at the beginning . I got a fine rest aboard and now I am ready for anything . I have been thinking a good deal about my future career in the last few days . Many people seem anxious to know what I am going to do . Well , you can bet that whatever I do it will be closely connected with flying . I am not going to permit even the receptions and the trips I may make around the United States to interfere with my flying , and mob week I am going to get in a fair number of hours in the air . To Fly to St. Louis From New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a dollar , but in my opinion there is only one way to ' travel , and that is by air . Just as soon as the New York reception is over I am going to get in my little plane and make a non-stop flight to St. Louis and thank the people there who made this flight possible . Later in the Summer I want to fly to San Diego , thus reversing my original flight from California to St. Louis and from there to New York . My plans beyond Washington , New York and St. Louis are indefinite , although I must decide quickly concerning the invitations from at least fifty towns and cities which have been kind enough to ask me to to visit them and the good wishes sent to me from the people , that is , some people , who think that now that the flight has been made , I ought to " settle down " and go into some sound commercial undertaking . These people do not realize that aeronautics is , in itself , one of the biggest potential industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the United States within the next few years . Nothing can stop it . Nothing can prevent aviation in America from rapidly advancing to a point where it will take a prominent place among the nation 's chief activities . Eager to Accept Some Offers . My future is definitely tied up with aviation . At present I am not considering any important flights , although what the future may briny in the way of new attempts can not be indicated . As to the many offers I have received I am not considering any but dignified ones , as I announced at Paris . The spectacular ones will not even get a hearing , but all the common ones will be carefully studied as soon as 1 get an opportunity  --  probably before leaving Washington . Of necessity , a large number will be rejected ; but I am anxious to accept a certain number of them . I am anxious to do as much for aviation as I can ; and if writing and talking and other things can help , I shall probably do some , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to speak in public , despite what newspaper men have said about my " histrionic ability . " I should like to have a few weeks ' vacation as soon as it can be arranged , but from present signs I do not suppose that this will be possible for another six months . Then , sometime , maybe next year , I want to go back to Europe to study aviation there seriously . As I tried to make clear in yesterday 's article , there is much that we can learn from Europe when it comes to aviation . I think the United States will inevitably lead the world in aviation , but before that goal is reached there is considerable ground to get over , and we must adapt ourselves to our needs at home . . When I get a chance to cover all Europe I shall try to fly to every country there and in that way I shall get first-hand knowledge of the situation . Hard to Realize Crowded Experiences . I can hardly realize that I have packed so much experience into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , in fact , tomorrow night at ** I taxied down the darkened flying field at Le Bourget and 100,000 frenzied people rushed my plane . It seems a long time since I took off from San Diego , and in other ways it has been a short time . I suppose these last three weeks will stand out as the most kaleidoscopic period of my life . I am proud of what our ship did in the Paris flight . In checking back over the flight I have come to the conclusion that the Spirit of St. Louis carried the greatest cruising range in the world for its type and the greatest load for a 200-horsepower motor . You must consider that I landed at Paris with eighty-five gallons of gas on board , or enough to carry me at least another 800 miles . We had already done 3,610 miles . ( By the way , these are the official figures recorded before I sailed . ) The motor in the Spirit of St. Louis has gone sixty-six hours and is good for another 250 . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another 1,000 or 1,500 hours ' work . He Recalls Entry Into Aviation . I pulled out my record book today for the first time , and I had some fun bringing it up to date . It may interest readers to know that I have flown 1,835 hours and 55 minutes , made ' 7,199 flights and carried 5,952 passengers . That is all in five years , for I took my first flight at Lincoln , Neb. , on April 9 , 1922 . In the early part of that month I decided to take up flying , so I went to Lincoln and began a course with the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation . I was the only student at the time . I shall never forget my first flight . I liked it immediately and felt right at home . I have flown in thirty-eight States of the Union and in Mexico , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland , Ireland , England , France and Belgium . My flights were made with thirty-four different types of machines , three of which I flew in Europe . Maybe you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the order in which I flew in them : Nebraska , Kansas , Colorada , Wyoming , Montana , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , Arkansas , Louisiana , Texas , Oklahoma , Iowa , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Florida , Utah , Nevada , California , Michigan , Ohio , Indiana , Arizona , New Mexico , West Virginia , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York , Connecticut , Rhode Island and Massachusetts . Slept While Films Were Transferred . The Memphis established her first contact with the United States at 4:34 o'clock this morning when the destroyer Humphreys met us and took off a sackful of movie films , which were aboard the ship during the homeward trip . But I slept soundly during the entire transfer . Every one thought I would have a busy day and needed the sleep . Captain Lackey told me about it later , and it must have been a beautiful sight . The sea was like a mill pond and the brilliant sun was just rising over the velvet water when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken off by one of the Humphreys 's boats and the Memphis steamed away at n. speed of 23.75 knots . We reached territorial waters late this afternoon and anchored off Pineypoint , just sixty miles from Washington . " The Memphis is very proud of her present crossing , for several records have been established . Not the least among these is that of the radio room , which handled nearly 100,000 words of press and private dispatches . I suppose a good portion of this total is accounted for by the hundreds of wireless messages I have received , and the remainder by the daily accounts sent by the press association correspondents aboard and my signed dispatches to Tns New YORK TIMES . Other records concerning the speed from Cherbourg , I referred to I in my dispatch last night . Stirred by Coming of Destroyers . This afternoon I stood on the bridge with Admiral Burrage , Staff Captain Lackey and his officers and watched one of the most impressive sights I have ever seen . At 1 o'clock four destroyers from the operating base at Hampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signals were exchanged between the destroyer leader and the Memphis , and in a quarter of an hour the trim ships steamed within several thousand yards off our bow and then took up position . Shortly afterwards , we passed with two on either side and then the destroyers escorted us all the way into the bay . Half an hour later another destroyer , the Goff , came into view and we slowed down and then stopped while the Goff 's boat , only several hundred feet away , put off with Richard Blythe and the United States ' Customs men . The fifty newspaper men and camera men aboard had a close-up of us as we stood on the bridge and waved , and I began to feel that we were actually nearing the end of the journey . Welcoming Planes Sweep Overhead . After this , four smart seaplanes appeared on the sky line and in a few minutes they crossed our bow , circled and came down low enough for me to wave to the pilots . Fully fifty other planes of the army and navy welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am deeply grateful to the navy for it . It was fine to see Blythe again and obtain the latest information . We had a long talk and were able to make several decisions about the reception and other pressing matters . Blythe tells me that everybody in New York wants to see me . Well , I will try my best . We anchored at 9 o'clock tonight off Pineypoint and I am going to bed early to store up lots of pep for tomorrow 's arrival at Washington .
