Henry Ford purchased 120,000 acres of undeveloped coal lands in Kentucky , containing a potential supply of 500,000,000 tons of bituminous coal . He plans to supply fuel from this huge virgin tract for all his own factories , the factories making Ford accessories and those other manufacturing plants that care to participate in his coal conservation scheme . <P> This conservation scheme embodies a plan to use the coal twice . Mr. Ford has announced that he will ask all industrial users of his coal to install furnaces that will remove only the gas , leaving a fuel unimpaired for domestic purposes . The coal , after this process , would be sold to heat the homes of hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the country . According to a technical explanation of this gas removing process , the fuel would then be more valuable than ordinary coal for heating . <P> While he is working at his mining plans , Mr. Ford will also devote his energies to reforestization . There are half a billion feet of timber on his coal lands , but not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr. Ford 's idea to use the surface of the ground for scientific research work and experiments in timber conservation , while the miners are digging beneath the soil .
