A speaker who could not be arrested preached flat disloyalty to George V and mere lip loyalty to the British Crown before a huge audience at Harrismith in the Union of South Africa , a British Dominion . " We do n't accept the King of England , " he roared , " but only his Crown ! " <P> Strangely enough this astoundingly incautious orator was not a " Red . " He is simply a grizzled South African statesman of Dutch stock who has risen to the highest office in the Dominion . The office is that of " His Majesty 's Prime Minister in South Africa , " and it is held by General the Honorable James Barry Munnik Hertzog . The speaker first amplified and then qualified his treason-smacking premise thus : " We of South Africa can have done with all kings tomorrow and introduce a measure in the Dominion Parliament to abolish kingship ; but the English among us would protest and probably many Dutch would support them . The English might even take up weapons and rebel against the Dominion Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other Dominions would resort to force . . . . <P> " We already possess the right to appoint our own Governor-General ! I doubt , however , whether the time is ripe for such action . . . . " <P> " Right " v. " Treason . " Whatever the " right " of South Africans , their Governor-General continues to be appointed by His Majesty George V , who sent to that post in 1923 a younger brother of Queen Mary , the Earl of Athlone ( TIME , April 30 ) . <P> Such extravagant speeches as that made by Prime Minister Hertzog , last week , are to be taken with about as much seriousness as the exaggerated platform promises of U. S. statesmen . Naturally General Hertzog 's platform must satisfy his large Dutch secessionist following ; and , like many another sly old dog , he relies more on his bark than on his bite . <P> Even so , however , General Hertzog is by far the most secessionist of all the Dominion Prime Ministers ; and at the last Dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1926 ) it was his bite which finally nipped the British Commonwealth into formal recognition that : 1 ) The Dominions are nations , with rights to accredit diplomats to non-British countries ; 2 ) Great Britain is on a plane of " equality under the Crown " with the Dominions ; 3 ) Great Britain , while continuing to administer the colonies and the foreign policy of the Empire must now do so in concert with the Dominions , and not with her onetime parental status as " The Mother Country . " Clearly these formulae are intentionally so loose and general as to leave enough space in Mother England 's cupboard for much harmless rattling of the skeleton called " Treason to the King .
