txt Attorney General Daugherty issued a general denial tonight of all the charges that have been made against him by witnesses before the Senate committee investigating his conduct of the Department of Justice . Referring to the testimony of Roxie Stinson , divorced wife of the late Jess Smith , Mr. Daugherty 's statement says : " Any inference , direct or indirect . that I ever participated in any way with the late Jess Smith or ony one else , for a consideration , either monetary , political or social , in any dishonorable way , In connection with the adzniniatration of the liquor laws , or any other laws , is false and untrue . " The Attorney General characterized Miss Stinson as a " disappointed ant malicious woman , " and said she blamed him " because her divorced husband did not make her sole legatee under his will . " The statement says further that the Attorney General will deal with the testimony of Gaston B. Means when the latter 's recital is ended . A series of other statements also was issued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation by the Senate committee . These statements were accompanied by copies of documents and Department of Justice records on the subjects cited . Assails Stinson Woman 's Story . The Attorney General 's personal statement reads : " It has been my purpose to make no public statement in connection with the hearings before the Senate committee until the completion of the committee 's work . In view of the - fact , however , that Roxie Stinson , the divorced wife of Jess W. Smith . deceased , was reported ill and unable to appear before the committee to conclude her statement this morning , my counsel have been deprived of the right of cross-examination upon her statements of the two preceding days . I feel , therefore , that I ought to make a general reply while her statements are fresh in the public mind . " She is a disappointed woman who blames me because her divorced husband did not make her sole legatee under his will ; an angry woman , because the courts have decided against her in litigation over the estate of her divorced husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General have brushed aside and disregarded all her tentative efforts to capitalize her silence . " Every lawyer who reads the statements made before the Senate committee by Miss Roxie Stinson will know at a glance that they were wholly incompetent and no court of record in the United States would have admited any portion of them for any purpose in any Sudicial porceeding . The public , however , unskilled in matters of this kind . may not distinguish between competent evidence and the gossipy conversations between Miss Roxie Stinson and her divorced husband . now deceased . " It appears that Senator Wheeler . a Member of the Committee on Investigation of the Department of Justice , who 13. in addition to his duties as , Judge , also designated as the prosecutor , left the city , proceeded to Columbus . Ohio . and personally visited and subpoenaed this ex-wife of the late Jess W. Smith . and for two days and a half the publicity emanating from the Investigation Committee has consisted of alleged conversations as related by the said Roxie Stinson to have taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Smith . " This gossip , incompetent and milcious , has been heralded throughout the country in headlines as though it were competent testimony to establish a controverted fact . " Any inference . ' direct or indirect , that I ever participated In any way with the late Jess Smith or any one else for a consideration , either monetary , political or social , in any dishonorable way , in connection with the administration of the liquor laws or any other laws , is false and untrue , and with all the emphasis I am able to command I resent the inference , and if a positive charge should ever be made by any responsible body J now deny the truthfulness of such cnarga Denies Any Interest in Darden . " I positively deny that -I had any interest whatever with Colonel Darden in his promotion of some western oil company . and knew nothing about any such promotion or interest therein - on the part of Jess W. Smith . " The inference attempted to be drawn from the statements of Miss Roxie Stinson that 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a party to any speculation to make money out of violation of the law is false and untrue . - Senator Wheeler has in his possession a full report of the activities of the Department of Justice showing that the law was enforced most strenuously , and he also has a list of the parties a. , - rested. prosecuted and fined , furDished hint under date of Feb. 19 , 1924 , at his request , which he has withheld : ince that time . The department is today releasing the full report for the first time . " Certain statements made by Miss atinson to the effect that there was a large amount of money from the East deposited in the bank at Washington Court House as the result of my illegal connection with prize fight films is absolutely false . I had no connection therewith , directly or indirectly , except as an officer of the law strictly enforcing the same . " As an Illustration of the unfair inference which can be drawn from general statements by persons wishing to do so . it is perfectly apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the simple fact that the Alien Property Custodian of the United States , in order to have inactive funds in circulation and earning for the Government a reasonable rate of interest . had at different times caused to be deposited certain sums of money in the bank of which my brother is President , at Washington Court House , Ohio , this being one of the banks . some 300 odd , throughout the United States that were used as depositories for public funds . " These moneys thus deposited and amply secured , drawing 3 per cent . interest . amounted at one time to . ' 5173,000 . The amount now on deposit there is $100,000 , secured by bonds with the approval of the Alien Property Custodian and drawing 3 per cent . Declares Sate of Pardons False . " With reference to the intimation that the late Jess W. Smith was collecting moneys for his influence in securing pardons , and in which I was interested . and with particular reference to a case in which Joe Weber of Weber &; Fields . New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently referred to was that of Dr. Leopold Harris of New York City , who was found guilty of violating the Harrison Narcotic act . July .23. 1919 , was sentenced to two years and began serving sentence November 18. 1921 . " Application for pardon was denied by President Harding on my recommendation , and he served his full sentence . I absolutely deny that the late Jess Smith ever approached me at any time for pardon , parole or commutation of sentence of any one , and any such claim or inference-is without basis of fact and absolutely false . " With reference to the intimation that the late Jess W. Smith in some way obtamed twenty-five shares of White Motors stock for nothing , and gave It to Roxie Stinson. his former wife ; with the statement that it cost us nothing , by implication and indirection hoping to have it believed that I was a party to some transaction whereby certain shares of the White Motors stock were obtained . it is almost unnecessary for me to deny . but I do deny any such charge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Motors stock was circulating and being transferred without any name appearing on the front of the certificate is so contrary to business transactions that it is not worthy of any credence . No purchaser would take it . and no registrar or transfer agent would transfer a certificate of stock under these circumstances . ? " It is impossible for me in a statement of this kind to follow in outline the statements made by Miss Roxie Stinson , but in so far as any of her statements on the stand implicate me in any way or reflect upon me in my personal or official capacity , I deny the same and ask only for an opportunity to present competent testimony in connection therewith . " I know nothing whatever about the difficulty between Miss Roxie Stinson and the executor of the estate of her divorced husband over matters pertaining to the estate . That matter is in the courts and will be decided between them , and I have no interest in the matter , one way or another , and know nothing about it . " On several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Roxie Stinson , that for a consideration her silence could be purchased and any documents in her possession could be delivered , all of which deliberate and serious attempts at blackmail have been absolutely and unconditionally rejected . " When Means has concluded his story it will receive our immediate attention . " Department Report on Pardon Case . Another statement issued by the Department of Justice tonight , touching upon the testimony of Miss Stinson relative to the alleged pardon of a relative of Joe Weber . the actor , read : " Available records in the Department of Justice fail to disclose that any man by the name of ' Solomon ' ever was pardoned oh paroled , or . in fact , ever served a sentence in any Federal penitentiary , as was intimated by Mrs. Jess Smith before the Senate Investigating Committee . ' Mrs. Smith testified that a relative of Joe Weber , an actor , named ' Solomon , ' was in a Federal penitentiary and that Weber had importuned Mr. Smith to secure his release , but that Mr. Smith hesitated to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cheap . ' " Search of the records in the office of the pardon attorney do disclose , however , that a Dr Leopold Harris of New York City was arrested and convicted on July 23 , 1919 , for dealing unlawfully in narcotics ; that he served his full sentence ( with the customary time off for good behavior ) , and was released on June 26 , 1923 . " In this case it appears that one Joe Weber , describing himself as being in the theatrical business , supplied one of three customary affidavits testifying to Harris 's connection when Harris , after his release from the penitentiary , applied for a pardon in order that his civil rights might be restored : . ' The pardon . however , was not granted - until seven months after thaman 's release from the penitentiary . " . . Report on Fight Film Cases . Among the other statements issued from the Department of Justice was the following report to Senator Wheeler on the prizefight picture prosecutions : . Feb , 19 , 1924. - Honorable Burton K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In compliance-with your requ est.over the tele for a list of the Dempsey-Carpepntierhone. prizefight film cases which have been prosecuted to a conclusion as well as . of those in process of prosecution , I beg herewith to enclose , with the approval of the Attorney General , the information asked for by you , so far as it is disclosed by the records of the department . Because of the methods adopted by those who were interested in the interstate movement of this film , speaking generally , there was no occasion for the United States Attorneys to communicate withthe department with respect thereto . For this reason it is deemed not improbable that there are other cases in which fines have been imposed of which-the department has no record . The method of these people was for some one to approach the United States Attorney and make known to him that he had such a film and ask about exhibiting it . When told that there had been a violation of law in taking the film from one State to another , either the individual calling upon the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty . As a general rule , the department did not hear of the cases until after they had been disposed of in court . But , owing to the similarity of procedure followed by those interested in the enterprises , the department became convinced that it was the result of concerted action . Because of this belief , after a conference with the Director of the Bureau of Investigation , a circular letter was sent out to all special agents in charge throughout the country , instructing them to keep a careful lookout for such violations , and also with a view to securing evidence ' of a conspiracy in violation of Section 37 of the criminal code . A copy of , this circular letter is enclosed . Under date of Feb. 9 , 1922 , the United States Attorney at Philadelphia called the department 's attention to certain circumstances in connection with the circular letter , and he was directed to make a thorough investigation and to prosecute vigorously any person found guilty of transporting the Dempsey-Carpentier film . As it had at that time been brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a fine which apparently was having no deterrent effect , the department concluded that it would be necessary for the courts to impose a more drastic punishmen or in other wors , tha there should be a sentence ofd imprist - onment . The act , as you know , prescribes a fine of not to exceed $1,000 , or imprisonment not to exceed one year , or both , in the letter to the United States Attorney at Philadelphia . He was , therefore , requested In the event that an indictment was returned in his district , and the defendant proposed to enter a plea of guilty , to immediately inform the department so that it might delegate , some one to appear specially for it before the court in advance of sentence . Subsequently , upon receipt of advice as to when the case would be called , an attorney from the department was directed to appear before the Court and call its attention to the : apeated violation of the law , and the text of a prison sentence in order to secure proper respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these offenses were the result of a prearranged plan to defy the film statute , and that the payment of a fine did not seem to deter further violations whenever a field seemed to offer good financial returns . The case was that of Joe Griffe , and the Court fined the defendant $1,000 . As opportunity has offered from time ' to time , the department has , in communications to - the United 5tatee Attorneys in various parts of the country , as its files show , emphasized its attitude regarding the vigorous prosecution of cases of this character . There has been ? an ex:ende 1 investigation as to the substantive offence and- a conspiracy , and in sonic instances it is still in progress with respect to not only the Dempsey-Carpentier film , but as to the WillardDempsey , the Dempsey-Gibbons , . and the Dempsey-Firpo films . According to a wire of the 5th instant from Special Agent Wheeler , laos  --  Angeles , eat . a conspiracy indictment has been returned there involving seven defendants . Respectfully , EARL J. DAVIS , Assistant Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosures ishowing a list of persons prosecuted for illegal . transportation of the fight films and the court action in each case ; copies . of the department 's instructions to its agents-in connection with these prosecutions and Quotations from the Criminal Code on this subject . - Testimonial from Ohio Neighbors .
