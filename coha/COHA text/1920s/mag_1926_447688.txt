A YOUNG man who had just joined the staff of one of the larger advertising agencies sought his boss in some perturbation . ' I wish you would tell me the truth about this advertising business , chief . Is it all bunk ? ' To which his employer replied , ' There is just as much bunk in advertising as there is in law or medicine , or for that matter in literature and life , but it is never necessary to use bunk to practise advertising successfully . ' That young man 's state of mind was the natural result of his reading . He had been recruited from the profession of writing , and he still followed the animadversions of the ultra-intellectual world , which has lately concerned itself with the inconsistencies , the waste , and the smugness of advertising . In short , with the ' bunk . ' The pages of those delightful magazines distinguished by good writing , distinctive typography , small circulations , and no advertising , offer some interesting points of view to the professional advertising man ? who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chesterton , hearing that truth in advertising ' is the slogan of those advertising clubs which two years ago invaded England with so much tumult and shouting , goes through a recent copy of Punch in the character of Diogenes searching for an honest advertisement , and finds it not . Gilbert Seldes ? hoping , no doubt , to list advertising among the lively arts ? peruses the Saturday Erenim Post and reports the literary style of the advertisements as lacking in a sweet reasonableness . William McFee finds the floor of his post office at West . port littered knee-deep with circulars cast off by disdainful recipients , and deplores the destruction of forests to make the paper for so futile an end , And Joseph Pennell , who is pleased with few things , apparently despise : advertising more cordially and with stronger adjectives than he does ; * other manifestation of our commereia civilization . // Then there are the fiction-makers , with h less restriction and more imagination . The younger men , most of them after brief experiences inside advertising organizations , have seized upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have Felix Reisenberg 's P. A. L. , Will fiwin 's Lew Tyler 's Wives , Roger Burlingame 's You Too , Scott Fitzgerald 's The Great Gatsby , Christopher Morley 's Ginger Cubes , Sinclair Lewis 's Babbitt , Sherwood Anderson 's A Story-teller 's Story , and Bunk , Lottery , and Bread and Circuses by William Woodward , all presenting advertising as a sort of gigantic conspiracy , fostered and main-tamed by highly paid advertising men , whose interests , like those of the priests of ancient religions , lie in keeping up the great illusion , and who go about their work with their tongues in their cheeks . Sometimes the conspiracy is imagined as directed against the business man , but the popular conception is that the public is the victim , and that manufacturer and advertising agent are working together to put something over . This something may be higher prices for worthless goods , creating unnecessary wants and desires , or exterminating a competitor making a better article at a lower price ; but generally just misleading people with bunk about memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Commission is even now engaged in prosecuting all advertising agents for conspiracy in restraint of something or other , and not so very long ago a Congressional committee sat in judgment on an advertisement in which display had been obtained by a liberal use of white space . It was gravely determined that , as the advertisement was not big enough to fill its space , the advertiser melt be trying to evade his excess-profits tax . The slogan , ' It pays to advertise , ' acquired its currency through use by George M. Cohan as a title for a play . Admitting that advertising pays , whom does it pay ? It pays the professional advertising man beyond doubt . It also pays the manufacturer who uses it to increase his business . But the crucial question is , Does it pay the public ? Are the people as a whole better off for advertising ? Is it a benefit to mankind ? And who pays for the advertising ? Is the cost of advertising added to the cost of the goods ? Would it be desirable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial fabric , and should we be better off without it ? II Mr. Stuart Chase has written a book entitled The Tragedy of Waste , in which there is a chapter discussing the waste of advertising ' ? not , as one might think , the admitted waste incidental to the present practice of advertising , but the far more sweeping indictment that advertising is itself economic waste . Perhaps we can not do better , in an inquiry into the question whether advertising is a benefit to mankind , than glance at this chapter , which is written with spirit and documented with figures , for it presents what may be called the complete case against advertising . Here are all the stock arguments . Advertising is the life-blood of quackery , ' pink pills and muscle-builders . ' It stimulates desires for super-luxuries . Billboards spoil the scenery . Advertising creates no new dollars . Its purpose is to drive one article out of the market and replace it with another , soap chips against laundry soap . The author quotes Edward Boles estimate , made in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TRUTH ABOUT ADVERTISING spent annually in advertising , and avers that the desire to evade income taxes is responsible for a large part of it . Among his authorities he quotes that redoubtable patent-medicine man , Ponderevo , in H. G. VeHs 's Tono Bun-gay , and a humorous skit by Don Herold from Life . His remedy is restriction of advertising to something like one tenth its present volume , the administration of that ten per cent to be governed by an impartial scientific body , and he asserts that this would release for productive occupations some 600,000 men now engaged in advertising work . This arraignment will have no weight with the professional advertising man , or with the manufacturer who has successfully employed advertising to sell his goods . They know that this superficial catalogue of drawbacks and disadvantages does not even so much as recognize what advertising is . But the average man gives it serious consideration . It chimes in with his own experience . He sees what is on the surface , and does not credit to advertising the advantages it provides for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent medicines at this late date , though , strange to say , they are still one of the stereotyped crimes attributed to it . The fact that proprietary remedies are fighting for their lives , greatly reduced in numbers , with few real advertising mediums open to them , is due to a movement started by Edward Bok , when editor of the Ladies ' Home Journal , and magnificently backed by every real advertising man . It was no burst of altruism . The advertising profession has the same interest in exterminating false , fraudulent , and misleading advertising that the stock exchange has in barring wildcat stocks , or the medical associations in suppressing quacks , or the bar associations in excluding shysters . Advertising depends on the confidence of the public , and any betrayal of that confidence weakens the effect of honest advertising . Out of such efforts has grown the Vigilance Committee , which has worked so aggressively in bringing to punishment those using advertising to mislead and to defraud that the first award of the Bok medal for distinguished service to advertising was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless advertising , ? patent medicines , cures of all kinds , physical and mental , memory courses , will-power developers , beauty enhancers , all that ' you too ' stuff , ? but the advertising man is not to blame , and the amount of it is negligible beside the body of legitimate advertising . Few reputable mediums are open to it . No advertising agent of standing will accept it . And the forces which are slowly closing in and eliminating it are set in motion by advertising men . ' The sOi-called billboard ' is another unfortunate instance . The author really means painted bulletins , which are the only form of outdoor advertising that disfigures rural highways . The poster board , formerly the billboard , is confined to the cities , where it frequently hides vacant lots at least as unattractive as the poster boards , which can be and are being made into something much better . But let us admit that the poster board , and its more offensive brother , the painted bulletin , are frequently eyesores , blots on the landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerates so many hideous structures in its cities can not make a special case of these particular edifices when there exists a necessity for them as great as for the gas tanks , freight cars , train sheds , workmen 's cottages , and other utilitarian and unbeautiful adjuncts to // town and city life . Also the movement to better them is coming from within . The company that now controls most of this outdoor advertising is making it a part of its policy to erect neat and attractive stands , to place them where they will not mar the scenery , and to censor what appears on them . Finally , billboards are a small part of advertising . Eliminate them all and the question before us would remain , as large as ever . As for that legend which still crops up , as immortal as the snake 's tail which does not die until sunset , that the business man spends money for advertising to save it from the tax-collector , it is difficult to disprove because it is impossible to prove . It is mere suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of one , and do not know an advertising man who has heard of one . But why should a presumably intelligent manufacturer or retailer prefer to give his money to an advertising agent to buy space with rather than to a tax-collector to buy airplanes with ? The money is gone , in either case . The only possible answer is that he gets some advantage from advertising . But if he gets an advantage , if advertising helps him to sell his goods , why is it not a fair supposition that he makes his advertising appropriation to get this advantage rather than to evade taxes ? If he built a factory with the money , or bought raw material with it , would he be suspected of so disposing of the money to evade taxes ? This tax situation seems to be what the Greeks called a dilemma ? not the modern two-horned dilemma , but a syllogism which ran something like this in the schoolbook I studied : ? Epaminondas the Cretan says : ' All men arc liars . ' But Epaminondas the Cretan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says is not true , and all men are not liars . VOL. 137 ? NO. 5 But in that case Epaminondas spoke the truth , and so forth . Advertising is useless and worthless . Those who spend money for it have an ulterior motive . That ulterior motive is evading the excess-profits tax . But the advertising thus bought increases sales , and increases profits . Those who use it , instead of reducing excess-profits taxes , increase them . Therefore they could not have invested in advertising for that purpose , so they must have bought it with the intention of making their business bigger , which would necessitate their paying still more excess-profits taxes . About all the comfort the suspicious folks at Washington and elsewhere can get from the situation is that the excess-profits tax does not act as a deterrent from advertising . But these things are all by the way . They do not affect the real current of our inquiry . To prove that advertising has drawbacks and disadvantages is nothing . It has lots of them . So has making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question again reverts to this : Does advertising , with all these disadvantages , real and imaginary , its pervasiveness , its vulgarity , its hypocrisy , its exaggeration , its use for unworthy purposes , its admitted wastefulness , its lack of wholly scien-. title methods , does it serve a useful , necessary purpose ? Is it a benefit to all of us , or only to those of us who use it or produce it ? In considering III the value and necessity of advertising , we must accept the present civilization in which we live . To discuss whether advertising would be necessary in Utopia is futile , though that is the argument of Stuart ? Chase . But life being what it is , in this country and at this moment , could we have what we now have , without advertising ? Since most people live by making and selling goods , can they go on making and selling goods without advertising ? You see , we are all in the same boat . We can not divide ourselves into two classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small one exploiting them by advertising . We each live by making and selling something , and the more we make and sell the better we live . We can not say , ' I will sell my goods to you by advertising , but you can not sell your goods to me . ' It is the right of each to advertise and sell . This interchange of goods constitutes what we call business . When we say business is good , we mean there is a brisk exchange of commodities and money . When it is slack , the interchange has slowed up . There is just as much money in existence , and , except for the fact that production is slowed clown in dull times , there are just as many goods in existence , but both are static . The money remains in the pocket , the goods remain on the shelves . Here are three men : A makes soaps , B soups , and C scaling wax . A needs sealing wax , but does not buy it because business is not good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income is B , the soap-buyer , and B is n't buying any soap . The reason B is n't buying soap just now is that the soup business is not good . No one is buying soup . Does A sit in his shop , longing for sealing wax , and wait for customers ? No . He advertises . He tempts B with pictures of soap , with text about soap , to create a desire for soap on the part of B. By this effort , by breaking up the inertia , he starts a movement . For when B buys a cake of soap of A , A has money , which he uses to buy sealing wax of C , and C immediately supplies himself with soup from B. Nor has A 's example been lost on B and C. They too make efforts to sell ; that is , they advertise their respective soups and sealing wax to each other , and to A , and thus keep up the merry exchange , which spreads to cabbages and kings , and to the other letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to sell the soaps by which he makes his living are extended by advertising . All selling is advertising , and all advertising is but an extension of selling . The day A opened his soap shop and tacked his sign over the door Ile began to advertise . And all advertising is but an extension of the first instinctive effort to sell what one has to sell . Going on from this primitive picture , we all know , of course , that in these days the maker seldom sells direct to the public . He sells to the retail dealer , who in turn sells to the consumer . We will skip over the jobber , who is merely a cog in the distributing machinery , to simplify our story . Now the retailer is merely a convenience . His store is on Main Street in your town to save you the long journey to the factory where the goods are made . It is of the utmost importance that your particular store should have the goods you want . If it does not , then you suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of hunting another store which does have them , or of buying a different article in place of the one you want . Your material life consists of a long list of named products , utensils , commodities , foods , wearing-apparel , toilet articles , tools with which you perform the operation of living ? feeding your family , keeping house , dressing yourself and your children ? playthings and work things . Not all of these articles are vitally necessary . Some of them may have been adopted through the persuasiveness of advertising . But there is an irreducible minimum which you can not do without , our modern // civilization being what it is . It is manifestly convenient to you that the shops in your town have these things in stock when you want them . The fact that they are there is the result of what is technically known as distribution , and without advertising distribution would be impossible . Whether it is better for us to live nationally , as regards the goods we consume , or locally , is too large a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact remains that we do live nationally , that by far the greater quantity of goods now made is sold to the country as a whole ? or , if not yet nationally sold , that is the goal aimed at . It is this fact that has evolved what is disparagingly called big business . ' It means that a manufacturer can count on a market comprising the whole United States . More than that , he must count on the whole United States if he is going to manufacture a large enough quantity of goods to reduce the cost to the point where he can compete with other manufacturers of the same goods . We will ignore for a moment the purely competitive side of this . It is true that two products of the same kind compete for the trade of the consumer . If there are five toothpastes all equally good , one brand would be sufficient . But that allows nothing for the instinctive individuality of choice , for the spur that competition offers to improvements in quality and reductions in price . If there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary to create another , for the benefit of the toothpaste consumer . The interest of the consumer and the interest of the manufacturer are here identical . It is to the best interest of the manufacturer to have his goods sold in the retail stores of every town in the country , and it is to the best interest of the consumer to be able to buy those goods in any town in which he happens to be or to live . The only way the manufacturer can obtain that distribution is by being able to assure the local dealer who buys the goods that he will be able to sell them . And the only way to give that assurance is by advertising to that portion of the public which constitutes the customers of that particular dealer 's store . If it is good for us , the public , to have goods made for us , it is good to have them sold to us . And if the printed word is added to extend the word of mouth , that is merely a change of degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising from the point of view of the advertiser , or of the man who makes his living by preparing advertising . Both have their problems , and those problems are a part of my job . But here I am trying to look at it as one of the public , using my technical knowledge to correct the errors into which writers outside of the profession , and some inside , fall when they try to reckon the good or ill that advertising does to all of us . The fact that there may be too much advertising is incidental , just as the fact that there may be too many motorcars . If there is overproduction in any line , the economic laws will take care of that . The manufacturer who makes more goods than he can sell will go broke . But overproduction of anything is not proof that production is economically wrong . Nor is the way that some advertisers use advertising any argument against it . I shrink from many of its phases . But the fact that some advertisers show bad taste , selfishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit them , is also a detail . There is even more on the other side ? unselfishness , altruism , and farsightedness . By such a criterion one 676 THE TRUTH ABOUT ADVERTISING could condemn literature , or art , or government . The question before the house is simply this : Is advertising a benefit to the public as a whole ? Is it necessary , to retain the desirable phases of our present system of living ? Does it impose an unnecessary burden of cost on the ultimate consumers of goods , becoming thereby an economic waste ? Or does it , in short , add to the sum of human happiness ? IV When I was a boy , ? about fifty years ago , more or less , ? mother used to buy a bar of Castile soap half a yard long and four inches square and saw it up ( she kept an old saw for the purpose ) into cakes an inch thick . The cake was as hard as Stonehenge , and the corners sharper than a serpent 's tooth . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably fitted the hand . To-day we have a cake of toilet soap ? a great many of them , in fact ? just the right shape to fit the hand , just as pure as Castile , scented if we like , tinted to match the bathroom decorations if we prefer , reasonable in price ; and when we want another cake we go to the nearest grocery or drug store , and there it is . And not only toilet soap . We have seen the evolution of shaving-creams , safety razors , and tooth-pastes , as well as soap powders , laundry chips , washing-machines , vegetable shortenings , self-rising flours , electric sadirons , vacuum cleaners , hot-water taps , aluminum cooking-utensils , refrigerators , and kitchen cabinets ? everything , in short , that constitutes the difference between our mothers ' kitchens and our wives ' . The amount of sheer drudgery that has been taken out of housekeeping in fifty years can be realized only by comparison , by drawing the illuminating parallel . An iron , soft-coal cookstove ; reservoir at the back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wooden corner-sink for cold ; drinking-water from the pump outside ; saleratus instead of baking-powder ; hog lard instead of vegetable shortening ; butter and milk hung down the well by a string to keep them cool ; heavy iron pots and skillets to be lifted , to say nothing of the coal hod ; dishes washed by hand ; no device to alleviate the frightful labor ? no rubber scrapers , scouring-mops , metal-ring dishrags , wire brushes , drying-racks , or cleansing-powders ; baked beans an eighteen-hour job ; oatmeal an overnight operation ; sugar , salt , dried fruit , pickles , crackers , rice , coffee , pepper , spices , lard , bought in bulk , scooped out of open boxes or barrels or tierces , exposed until sold , and clumped on a sheet of paper laid on the scales : molasses and vinegar drawn from the wood , and between whiles the gallon measure standing around , proving the adage that molasses attracts more flies than vinegar . Food was unclean , there was no sponsor for its quality , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The housemother became a miniature manufacturing plant before the food was ready for the family to eat . And the preparation of meals was but a small portion of the housewife 's burden . There was cleaning ? with no other implements but a rag , a broom , and a turkey wing . Clothes were washed with a rub-rub-rub that wore the zinc from the washboard . Put such a kitchen beside the one pictured in most advertisements selling kitchen equipment , or those complete ones shown in the housekeeping departments of the women 's magazines : ' How to furnish the ideal kitchen . ' Or , better still , take a modern housewife ? // not the delicatessen and can-opener ivpe , but a real housekeeper , who keeps her house and takes pride in it ( there are such even to-day ) ? and put her in an old-fashioned kitchen like that described above . She could not do in a week what my mother did every day of her toil-bound life . To keep house with what was available half a century ago was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been lost , except among the newly arrived foreign-born . You say I am contrasting a poor woman 's kitchen of fifty years ago with that of a woman of means to-day . Not at all . What my mother contended with was what they all had . If she could have afforded it , she would have hired another woman to struggle with it . It was not a matter of wealth at all . It was a question of facilities available . That was all they had ? raw materials , a few crude tools , and ' elbow grease . ' The amelioration that has come about in fifty years is clue directly and indirectly to advertising . These things did not come into existence because women demanded them . Women did not know they were possible . They exist because there was a method of distributing them , of teaching possible buyers what a help they would be , of educating the housewife while offering her the means of applying what she learned , and of doing it on a large scale . And the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of distributing them ; that is , selling enough of them to make it worth while . Sometimes advertising supplies a demand , but in most cases it creates demand for things that were beyond even the imagination of those who would be most benefited by them . A woman knew the use of a broom , but she could not imagine a vacuum cleaner . There fore she could not demand one , even though she was aware of that vague unspoken demand that has existed from the beginning for some lightening of the terrible drudgery of keeping a house livable . The vacuum cleaner was introduced by educational advertising . The advertising was clone partly by manufacturers anxious to sell vacuum cleaners and partly by electric-light companies anxious to sell current . The spread of electrical housekeeping devices has followed the increase in the number of houses wired for electricity , and that too has been brought about by advertising , by the selfish desire to do more business , to sell more goods . But the result has been a public benefit , an increasing willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the waste of human energy spent in the operation of living . No vacuum-cleaner factory could do business as a neighborhood proposition . Only a national market would furnish enough business to make the manufacture economically possible . And a national market is possible only through advertising . And that advertising must be educational . It must teach the sound economy of paying more to get the greater benefit . The woman 's time and health and strength are worth more than the difference in cost between a broom and a cleaner . But not all of these improvements are in the vacuum-cleaner class . Most of them add nothing to the cost of upkeep . The greater number lower it . They teach the use of something better that costs less . V I do not think I am claiming too much in giving to advertising the credit for the great change in housekeeping that we have seen . I have had to observe it very closely for thirty 678 THE TRUTH ABOUT ADVERTISING years , and I have to some extent helped to bring it about . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's magazines . It is true that they have directed their editorial energies to the same ends , and with remarkable results . But it should not be forgotten that it is advertising patronage that makes such magazines possible . It is the revenue from the advertisers that pays for the services of domestic economists , physicians , interior decorators , cooks , dressmakers , and other experts who teach women better ways of doing things . More than that , while such departments are conducted with the primary purpose of being helpful to readers , they furnish an excellent background for the advertising . Magazines with constructive departments on the care of babies , cooking , interior decorating , housekeeping , dressmaking , laundry work , and all the other activities which go into home-making , , , are preparing audiences to listen to manufacturers who sell sanitary nursing bottles , infant wear , prepared foods , salad oils , paints , fabrics , wall papers , electric mangles , and washing-powders . This is no reflection on those departments . It is meant for praise . The editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest professional character , and the advertisers who are permitted to use space in such magazines are often subjected to rigid censorship , not only as to the real utility or value of what they sell , but also as to the way they talk about it . Some magazines maintain laboratories for testing utensils and foods for household use offered in their columns . Behind the successful and intelligently conducted magazine is the advertiser , who buys space and makes the magazine profitable , and so the educational work of home-making magazines should be credited largely to him . Advertising is not an end . It is a means to an end . So the question not , Is advertising desirable ? but Are those ends desirable , and is advertisin2 too great a price to pay for them ? To those who look upon advertising as merely the selfish effort of manufacturers to induce them to buy more goods , it seems that the world could easily do without it . People say to themselves , ' I do not want to be persuaded to buy more goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are concerned advertising is unnecessary . For the manufacturer who uses it , advertising is a means of selling goods , but its present proportions are due , not to the manufacturer 's desire to sell goods , but to the real public need it supplies . A familiar paradox is the man who tells you with much earnestness that he never reads advertising and does not believe in it . And as he sits there he is dressed from head to foot in advertised goods . His office is equipped and his home is furnished with advertised goods .. How did they get there ? Because they were the things most accessible , the ones for sale in the stores where he bought , the ones the salesmen showed him , and the ones that most exactly met his needs . It was not necessary for him to read the advertising . The advertising he did not read distributed the goods , brought them within his reach , geographically and financially , and keeps them there for his benefit ? better things than he could buy for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . And most of them would not exist , to say nothing of being distributed , if there had not been advertising . But advertising adds to the cost of the goods . You still hear that . So does production add to the cost of the goods . and so do traveling salesmen , and retail // stores , and jobbers ' percentages . Everything that is done to a manufactured article and all handling of natural products must be added to the price that the customer pays . But nothing is so well established as the simple fact that , the more you make , the less the cost of each . And not only is cost of making lessened , but also cost of selling , including cost of advertising . And the cost of selling can be and is lessened until the advertising costs nothing . Why does a tailor-made suit cost more than a ready-made ? Why do custom-made shoes cost more than the product of the Lynn factories ? It is difficult to prove these things by tables of statistics because prices of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But consider the motor-car . Nearly everyone is interested in this product of advertising . Nearly everyone is aware of the continual improvement in the cars and the steady lowering of price , due to quantity production . Some are as much concerned over the congestion of motor-cars as they are over the congestion of advertising . They feel that there is too much of both . Granted in both cases ; but the only alternative is to turn the page back to medieval times , when each village was self-contained , or forward to one of the many Utopias which promise enough of everything and not too much of anything . The point is that we can not eat our cake of accessible and convenient apparatus of living and have our cake of freedom from advertising , freight trains , industrial villages , steel and cement construction , riveting hammers , congested highways , and the other annoyances of a prosperous , material , mercantile age . It ' s a fair question whether or not our modern life is worth while , but that has nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern life is worth while , and we want to continue it , is advertising necessary to that end ? It is related that a man was going along a London street , deep with mud , when he spied a straw hat floating on the surface . He poked at it with his stick , and discovered that the hat was on a head . ' My land , ' he exclaimed , is it as deep as that ? ' ' It ' s deeper than you think , ' replied the head . ' I 'm on a bus . ' We can not go any deeper into this question . Advertising is a machine for making it easier to live the way we now live . If the way we now live is not desirable , all right ; but that 's the bus , and not the hat . VI Advertising , then , is a means to an end , the end a worthy and desirable one . Not even those who are annoyed by it would surrender what it brings for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad . The railroad is also a means to an end . That end is transportation . No one since Ruskin has seriously maintained that railroads should be abolished because they are noisy , dirty , and ugly . They are noisy , dirty , and ugly ; but the necessity of moving passengers , mails , and freight from place to place outweighs the resthetic drawbacks . Whether a railroad must be noisy , dirty , and ugly is something for the future to decide . Probably not . But neither are the shortcomings of advertising essential to its success . They are due to the present imperfect method of administering it . Advertising reflects the crudeness , vulgarity , and materialism of the age . Some day we shall have ideal advertising , but that will be when our industrial plants and transportation systems have also become ideal . Objections to advertising based upon 680 TH E TRUTH ABOUT ADVERTISING . advertising itself , the amount of it , its persistence , congested pages of magazines and newspapers , mail cluttered with circulars , painted bulletins marring attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are pleased when a railroad adopts electrification and puts its trains underground , or when it designs and builds a station that is an architectural ornament to the city , or when it traverses a district of scenic beauty , giving the passenger a by-product in his journey . So advertising is aware of the opportunities of making itself more attractive , while not jeopardizing the ends at which it is aimed . Such results may be called the by-product of advertising . In the total they are tremendous and should not be overlooked in a fair appraisal of the real part that advertising is playing in our civilization . The physical form of advertising has undergone a great improvement , and the improvement continues . It was gradually realized that art had power to move minds , and that the sordid , material ends of advertising were better served in proportion as advertising became more attractive . The physical properties of advertising are composed of picture and text , and both have had for some years careful consideration by minds trained in taste . Sober observers who do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising , have repeatedly said that the art of printing owes its recent progress more to advertising than to any other influence . Each year the Institute of Graphic Arts arranges an exhibition of commercial printing . A rigid censorship is exercised , and a comparatively small number of examples of printed advertising is selected for exhibition . After being shown in the Art Centre in New York , this exhibition is sent on its travels . Two and sometimes three duplicates are made , but the requests from various art-societies , museums , and galleries in the country for the privilege of showing this exhibition are more than can be granted . These specimens are produced by the earnest desire of the advertiser to give the printed message the most perfect typographical form , that it may be pleasantly received and easily read , and by working along these lines there is produced what typographical experts consider good printing . Even more remarkable has been the record with art . The commercial artist is extinct . He has disappeared . The men who produce advertising art are the men represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction , and no stigma attaches to art used for business . Artists realize that advertising offers them an opportunity as great as any in the world to-day , not merely to be well paid for their work , but also to realize their artistic ambitions , without sacrifice of their standards or their ideals . There is nothing essentially debasing in art applied to a purpose . The great pictorial art of the world , the art of the fifteenth century , was applied art in a strict sense . Those altarpieces , triptychs , murals , depicting the mysteries of religion and the lives of the saints , that adorn the churches of Italy , France , and other Catholic Colin-tries , were really applied art . Commissions were given to the artist by the Church or by some wealthy prince . subject to certain restrictions and limitations ; but within those limitations the artist found it possible to express himself and produce a work which is preserved , not because of its primary purpose , ? that of selling the Church to a populace which could not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced great art . .1s artists realize the truth of this , and , more important still , the manufacturer learns the secret of buying the best the artist has in him , the result becomes evident in the pages of magazines and newspapers , in books , printed matter , and , to a lesser degree , on the poster boards . If such work is good art , and if it is well reproduced , as much of it now is , advertising becomes a humble picture-gallery for millions who never see the inside of an art museum . Nor should the effect of this influence on the goods themselves be overlooked . Much of the improvement in the artistic quality of the goods ? textiles , rugs , furniture , jewelry , porcelains , glassware , domestic architecture , and interior decoration ? is due to the re-Ilex influence of a powerful and influential body of artists working in close proximity to the factory that produces the goods . The advertising artist is asked to design a package , and to dress ' the goods better . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the goods themselves . Sometimes the patterns of fabrics are made by the men who produce the advertising of them . Colors selected by a manufacturer of enamels are revised by an artist to supply a palette adapted to the new taste in color . As the motorcar slowly moves toward that ideal and natural form and shape which is to be its ultimate expression , artists , sculptors , and architects are being called into consultation with automotive engineers to make the form express the purpose . The carriage , as we know it , was a slow evolution . In the course of time it acquired a pattern which satisfies us and which we feel is the happy and logical shape of a carriage . But it had a thousand years for its evolution . In less than twenty-five years the automobile has gone a part of the way from an ugly machine to something more nearly approaching good design . And the influence that is bringing this about is the artist who creates the advertising ? the necessity for the product to live up to the advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor-car made by the advertising artist is adopted by the factory for the actual car . The necessity of living up to his advertising lifts the manufacturer to new levels , and so we arrive at another byproduct ? the effect t hat advertising is having in raising the standards of business . And this applies not only to the aesthetic appearance of the goods but to business practices and standards . A business which advertises , which puts its name before the public and puts its trade-mark on the goods , has entered into a contract with the public , with its customers . It must live up to that contract . It must make good . It is in honor bound to justify the advertising . It has given a hostage to fortune . It can no longer escape responsibility for its products or goods or service . And this effect is beneficial , and ensures , on an average , better goods and better service . It is responsible , in a way , for the welfare movement . Welfare movement was originally a talking-point . Manufacturers learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant place to work , and that conditions were healthful and comfortable , was one way to sell goods ; and in order to say these things it was necessary to do them , and conditions became better . Other manufacturers emulated the pioneers . Not only did advertising bring this about , to a large extent , but it works to continue it . A still more remarkable by-product of advertising is cooperation . One charge brought against business is that it is competitive ; it aims to displace another man 's goods and sell one 's own ; 682 THE TRUTH ABOUT ADVERTISING one advertiser 's gain is another advertiser 's loss . All business is competition . Through advertising it has been brought about that manufacturers in one line unite to advertise their common product . For instance , paint is necessary for the upkeep of buildings ; there is a national economy in keeping paintable structures painted and thus protecting them from the ravages of the elements and the depreciation of time . Makers of paints and varnishes and other finishes unite in cooperative advertising , unselfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , but merely teaches people the wisdom of painting in their own interest . The result is to make more people paint , which creates a demand for paint , and all paint manufacturers are benefited . The whole industry benefits , but the public benefits as well . Such advertising takes nothing from anyone . It contributes to the general prosperity of the country . It makes the visible physical property of the country more valuable . Such cooperative efforts are being made by the manufacturers of Portland cement , tile , brick , stone , and lumber ; by the growers of fruits , such as oranges , raisins , and nuts ; and the public is the gainer . Consider the ease of oranges . When the growers of oranges first united to teach people to eat more oranges , the average consumption was thirty-nine per capita per year . Today it is fifty-eight . The producers of oranges have a larger and more stable market for their fruit . The public is benefited by eating more oranges , and no one has gained by taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making their natural and normal market a better market than it was before , and they have sold the people something that is good for them and taught them habits that are endorsed by dietetic authorities . But such aspects of advertising are , as I have said , by-products . They offer a pleasant prospect for the future amelioration of the manifestations of advertising to which many justly object . The actual public benefit of advertising is that it creates a rapid interchange of commodities and money , producing what we know as ' good times , ' and , by effective distribution , brings within easy access and at easy prices the vast number of articles with which we live and which make life less difficult , smoother , more restful , more efficient , and more worth while .
