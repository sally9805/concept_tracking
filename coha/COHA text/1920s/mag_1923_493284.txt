A Journal of Opinion , The Week As though in deference to the traditional spirit of Christmas , reports of reconciliation , peace and good will in Europe have suddenly begun to fill the air . France consents to direct conversations with Germany over the details of the Ruhr occupation , and asks the appointment of a new ambassador for this purpose . America is to be unofficially represented on the expert committees which will investigate the reconstruction of Germany 's financial system and ways and means for seizing the alleged German wealth abroad . Germany is expected in January to ask admission to the League of Nations next autumn , which presupposes a secret French promise not to oppose her admission , at least to the Assembly . She is also considering a request that the League shall take over the task of her financial and economic restoration , as has been done for Austria and is about to be done for Hungary . Further and even more surprising indication of an apparently altered spiritis to be found in the suggestion from Paris that the French debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would agree to a new interest rate of two percent . I T is deplorable , especially at the Yuletide season , to be cynical about a change of heart ; but we regretfully confess we find it impossible to believe that the French policy has altered in any important particular , or promises any more tangible hope for the peace and happiness of Europe than it has since June , 1919 . M. Poincare. at last controls the Ruhr , not only in a military but in an economic sense . At least a year ago he gave up all expectation of any reparations from Germany except such as could be produced in that region by German labor under the threat of French bayonets . The policy of passive resistance has up to now made the experiment as economically unsound as it is abhorrent from the point of view of humanity and justice . With the abandonment of resistance , Poincare for the first time gets a chance to demonstrate the operation of the plan which is fundamental to his policy : the permanent , complete separation of the Ruhr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inclusion of Ruhr coal with Lorraine ore as primary factors in the French industrial system . ONCE the cat has eaten the canary , why should n't it smile ? Poincare has now every reason to play a waiting game . The more delay he obtains by temporizing and conciliation , the stronger becomes the position of France and the weaker that of Germany . By his seeming amiability , moreover , he blunts the weapons of his opponents in the coming election . Conversations with the German government can do him no harm , as long as the essential fact of the Ruhr occupation must not even be mentioned . If the Reparation Commission 's group of experts , or the League of Nations , or anybody else can devise a scheme by which German finances can be stabilized and her population maintained with the Ruhr entirely shut off , so much the better for France , which may then extract some blood from the rest of the German turnip after all . M. POINCARE knows , however , if he knows anything at all , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . The industrial era of the last seventy-five years has produced in that country a population far larger than can be supported by agricultural activity . In the past , the people have been kept alive by manufacturing goods which were exported in exchange for foodstuffs . For this process the Ruhr is an integral necessity . Without it , at least 20,000,000 Germans must emigrate or starve . The people themselves have no funds with which to finance emigration ; neither has the government ; and it is difficult to see from what quarter outside aid could be secured for such a process . If the nationalists remain in power in France and continue their present policy , it therefore seems altogether likely that in the fairly near future about one third of the population of Germany must starve , or die of the diseases which prey upon those in the process of starvation . The one element in the situation which French policy seems to overlook is the political reaction from the horror at such a spectacle which would be aroused among the citizens of the neutral countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poincare 's momentary mildness , if mildness it be , is to be found in events across the Channel . The Conservatives , the only one of the three parties that could be counted on to swallow anything from France rather than permit the Entente to dissolve , have become a minority . The Liberals and Labor are far apart on domestic questions . No ordinary issue can weld them into a secure coalition . A French policy that would thrust Germany promptly over the verge into revolution and civil war might very easily unite the two parties on what the French would regard as a pro-German policy . There is no doubt that a good majority of the British Parliament think that Poincare has gone too far . France is not strong enough to bite her thumb at England . It is therefore the part of wisdom to avoid any action that will transform this potential opposition to France into a paramount political issue . RECENT developments in European politics are of a character to make the French consider soberly the consequences of increasing their moral isolation . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from the economic and social disabilities of the war , the position of France as a Colossus astride the continent is already beginning to be challenged . The rapprochement between Spain and Italy is a grave obstacle to French ambitions in the Mediterranean and northern Africa . Specifically , it imperils France 's line of communication with the Negro colonies and thereby tends to reduce her from her present boasted position as a nation of one hundred million , white and black , to one of forty million , white . I N the north , the projected alliance between Sweden and Finland is regarded as hostile to French ambitions , and particularly so in view of the warm approval with which it is contemplated by Great Britain . The Little Entente , also , is beginning to show faint signs of a desire to walk by itself . At a meeting in Belgrade on January 12-14 , representatives of its members will discuss the whole European situation and , according to Dr. Benes of Czecho-Slovakia , will formulate a general policy toward it . The members of the Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Versailles , have had , of course , an interest in aiding France to maintain that treaty throughout Europe , quite apart from the other diplomatic ties which the French have forced upon them . If the day arrives when they feel that the treaty settlements from which they benefit no longer need French support , some interesting developments may be forthcoming . Finally , France has not yet succeeded in coming to friendly terms with the Soviet government of Russia . Unless she can do so , all her efforts to maintain Poland may be swept away ; in case of a new war a Russo-German alliance would destroy the tottering government of Poland overnight . M. Poincare may yet be brought to realize that in pursuing the policy of French domination , he has not only inflicted a terrible wrong on the rest of Europe , but on ' his own country as well . THE series of efforts by the Marx government to reach an agreement with France , to put Germany 's affairs into the hands of the League of Nations , and it is rumored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for rescue , are indications of an acute realization of the appalling plight in which that unhappy country now finds itself . The descent of the mark has been temporarily halted by the rentenmark issue , but there is no guarantee that it will not plunge again , the security behind the new currency having already been exhausted . The Berlin government has announced its inability to pay more than half of the salaries due to its own officials in December . Five hundred thousand civil servants , who had , as in the case of Austria , been carried on the payroll as an alternative to giving them unemployment doles , are to be discharged at once . The working day of all government employees is to be increased , and new taxation plans will seek to take some of the wealth of those enriched by the inflation process . In the meantime , Dr. J. A. Morehead , of the American Lutheran National Council adds his voice to those of the Quakers ' representatives , and to Secretary Hoover 's , declaring that a food credit of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population through the winter . Otherwise , fully eight million of the twenty million who are now on the ragged edge , will inevitably die before the winter is over . Germany has formally asked the Reparation Commission to grant , priority to a loan for the purpose of establishing food credits abroad , and France must now show whether or not she really intends to refuse permission for this to be done . THIS request of Germany 's is not without its embarrassment for Americans . Like every other peoPle possessed of common sense and humanity , Americans must regard feeding the German peoPlc as an obligation on the German government and the world which takes precedence over any other . But if the priority is granted , a great part of the $50,000,000 required will be spent in the United States and contribute to the profits of American agriculture and business . It is a silly accusation that America is humanitarian for the sake of her own pocket , but it is an accusation that is freely made in Europe . In this case we can refute the accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining any net national Profit . We can not fix prices on food exports against a possible rise . But we could vote a sum to be given outright in the form of food , thus reducing the amount of borrowed money that Germany would need . THE United States government has selected the first two of the three " economic experts " who are to represent us , in the most unofficial possible way , in the inquiries under the Reparations Commission , as to Germany 's fiscal system and as to ways and means of confiscating the wealth she is supposed to have concealed abroad . Neither Mr. Owen D. Young , chairman of the board of the General Electric Company , nor General Charles G. Dawes ? f Chicago , is exactly described by the phrase economic expert . " The former is an attorney and industrial leader , whose high intelligence and broad general experience make him however an excellent choice for this difficult post . General I ) , awes , attorney and financier , is best known for work in France , and for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tvjere he earned the nickname , " Hell and Maria " , 1-3avves , because of his forceful habit of expression . If an attitude of neutrality as between the parties to the dispute is desirable in a member of the ex-Pert committee , General Dawes is open to some criticism as a partisan of France , by whom he has been awarded membership in the Legion of Honor . As recently as November 28 , 1922 , in a public address he assured the French that the fruits ofvictory " shall not be lost by the action of the political trimmers of the world , " and added that you need not fear that America or the world , with the knowledge that France has been invaded every fifty years for fifteen hundred years , will regard your claim for the right of self-protection as a demand for empire . " This disqualification , if it be one , might be taken more seriously were it not for the certainty in advance that the investigation in which Messrs . Young and Dawes will take part will be permitted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the misery of Europe today . THE British political situation remains an appalling muddle . Mr. Baldwin has now decided to remain in office until Parliament meets again on January 8 , and thereafter until his government is overthrown in the House . This can not be long delayed , and the Labor party , it seems inevitable , must then take the reins . Its leaders , of course , can only do this with grave misgivings . They are without a majority and will themselves be unable to remain in power unless they consent to patch up some such working agreement with the Liberals as Mr. Lloyd George has invited . The international situation remains so dark that Mr. Macdonald and his followers can hardly hope , thus hampered , to accomplish much in amelioration of unemployment . The Labor party suffers also from an actual dearth of men qualified to fill the numerous important posts in the Cabinet . On the other hand in the eyes of many of the rank and file of the party 's membership , and the public generally , failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the fact that no coalition which it could effect with the Liberals would permit any steps toward the capital levy or the nationalization of mines , railways , etc. , the two chief planks in Labor 's program . What seems most probable and , indeed , almost inevitable , is two interim governments in quick succession , Unionist and Labor , to be followed in the near future by another general election . THERE is one assertion in the letter of Mr. and John F. Moors published in our last issue entitled " In Defense of Mr. Wilson " which deserves additional comment . He says : " The best jurists in England and America deny " that France is occupying the Ruhr by due process of law . Is this assertion true of American jurists ? The only pronouncement that we have read by an American international lawyer on the legality of the French invasion of Germany is that of Mr. George A. Finch in the October issue of the American Journal of International Law . Mr. Finch is the secretary of the Board of Editors of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all the American jurists such as ex-Justice Clarke , Manley 0 . Hudson , George W. Wickersham and J. B. Scott , who are most interested in peace and who presumably have investigated the question whether France is invading Germany with or without due process of law , not one has , so far as we know , expressed a public opinion . The natural inference is either that they too affirm the legality of the French occupation or consider it impolitic to denounce an act of France as illegal . PRESIDENT COOLIDGE has done an honorable and courageous thing in releasing the thirty-one political prisoners who , to the lasting disgrace of this country , have remained in jail until this time because of the expression of , opinion deemed inimical to the conduct of the war . The recom mendation of the special committee appointed by President Harding , consisting of Newton D. Baker , former Secretary of War , Bishop Charles H. Brent and Gen. J. G. Harbord , should have been made , and acted upon , years ago ; but since at last it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the praise he deserves , and doubly so since we differ with him on so many of his other policies . It may seem incredible that there should still exist any considerable number of . Americans who could disapprove this act ; but so thoroughly has the hysterical fear of radicalism been worked up among our people by professional agitators , that undoubtedly President Coolidge will incur some animosity because of what he has , done . That fict must not be lost sight of in giving him credit for performing this long overdue act of justice . HIRAM JOHNSON is well justified in his criticism of the Republican National Committee for overriding the orders of the convention of 1920 . That convention ordered amelioration of the long-continued disgraceful overrepresentation of the Southern states where the party is largely unreal . Instead , the National Committee has increased the representation of the South . Chairman Adams defends the action on the plea that it is merely in accordance with the principle of one vote to each congressional district , and argues that the South gains only nine delegates while the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact remains , however , as Mr. Hull of the Democratic National Committee is prompt to point out , that the South , the Northeast and the border states give the reactionary Republican group a majority of about 14o , which of course will next year be used for Coolidge . Indeed , if the border states stand firm , the western progressives might as well stay away from the convention entirely . There is no possible justification for the act of the Republican Committee other than the unabashed determination to gather up all the votes it can for its candidate . Such tactics as these increase the already excellent chances that the Democrats , if they are shrewd enough to choose a liberal platform and candidate next year , will win . A GROUP of Japanese militarists has been indulging in a pleasant pastime which is well cal-dilated to discourage aid to their government by other powers in the event that another catastrophe like the recent earthquake should visit their country . These gentlemen took advantage of the confusion following the calamity to execute a policy which leaves the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League simply nowhere . They rounded up as many political radicals as they could lay their hands on , and assassinated a goodly portion of them under conditions of peculiar ferocity . A particularly amiable Captain Amakasu strangled with his own hands Mr. and Mrs. Osugi , while an assistant did the same to their seven year old nephew , born in Portland , Oregon , and registered as an American citizen . In Satama prefecture , nearly a hundred young men and women were killed , according to Japanese newspaper accounts translated in the columns of the Living Age . In another district , fifty-eight individuals were murdered by an hysterical mob . It is reliably reported that a number of foreigners , especially Koreans , were brutally murdered immediately after the disaster . Careless generalizers who have been in the habit of saying that American or French tories , are the most stupidly vindictive and cruel in the world , have probably been too hasty : there is also Japan . I F the fortunes of the graduates of a single college in a single year have any statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad way . Statistics of income for 98 men who graduated ten years ago from the University of Michi gan show that the Phi Beta Kappas , the honor men of the class , have average incomes of $3000 while the members of the most select social fra ' ternity have over $ o , 000 ; those of the next most select , $8,000 ; athletes , $6,400 ; while the average for all , including the due proportion of simon pure dubs , is $5,800 . It is explained that the Phi Beta Kappas go in for scholarship and the scholarly professions , which are notoriously underpaid . TWO additional explanations occur to us . One is that the socially elect in any college consist largely of the sons of men of wealth and influence . They have therefore a long lead in the race for success . The other explanation is that there may be some ' thing wrong with the principles of selection for Phi Beta Kappa . Are students elected to Phi Beta Kappa for originality and independence , or for docility and discipleship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges bear out those of Michigan .
