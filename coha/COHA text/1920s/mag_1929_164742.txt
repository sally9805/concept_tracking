On the northeast shore of Lake Michi- gan they say ( some Indians do ) that there is a drum of the Manitou that sounds whenever the Lake takes a life . If so , the Manitou 's drum sounded 52 times one night last week . <P> On his parlor radio a code-wise listener-in in Wisconsin heard screeching buzzes : " S. O. S.-S. 0 . S.-Water up to- ' That was all . He telephoned the Coast Guard . But they heard no more signals . Next day the Milwaukee , one of the Grand Trunk R. R. 's big car ferries out of Milwaukee for Grand Haven had not reached her destination with a crew of 52 . Two days later lake steamers sighted empty life boats , mattresses , the upper part of a ship 's cabin . They picked up bodies strapped in lifebelts stenciled S. S. Milwaukee . Then they found the body of the Milwaukee 's captain , Robert McKay , lake sailor for 35 years . <P> Thus the fate of the Milwaukee . Old lake sailors described how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freight cars break from their clamps . On the Milwaukee were 27 loaded cars . Back and forth they must have creaked and strained , bolted and battered , gaining momentum until they catapulted thunderously overboard , capsizing the careening , helpless ferry . <P> Near Detour , Mich. , the ore boat William B. Pilkey , wedged helplessly on a reef , was heaved and pummeled by the storming surf of Autumn 's first bad storm . Desperate Coast-Guardsmen rescued her crew of 32 . <P> <P> On a rock spur of a Lake Huron island was impaled the S. S. Maplecourt . Coast-Guardsmen , defying the walloping surf , rescued her crew of 23 . <P> From Lake Superior came S. 0 . S. signals . Henry Ford 's lumber barge Lake Frugality and the steamer Chicago were both driven aground . Their crews clambered off unharmed . Lake Frugality 's crew debarked on the mainland , but Chicago 's crew of 32 , less lucky , found themselves on a desolate island . Faced with starvation , seven of them straggled nine miles through a bramble-clogged swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-caked clothing , gave them food , but stolidly refused to try to reach their derelict companions . Not until four days later , when the seas had abated , were the marooned sailors rescued by a Coast Guard cutter . <P> On the north shore of Lake Erie lay a contorted pile of scrap iron , all that was left of the freighter M. J. Nessen . The crew , twelve men , a woman , was rescued before the ship broke up . On a sandbar nearby was lodged the steel sandsucker C. M. Caldwell . A crew of 18 , gambling that she would ride the storm , stayed aboard . <P> In Chicago , beaches , lakeside parks and streets were awash , strewn with rocks and wreckage . Breakwaters crumbled before the unprecedented autumnal surge . Chicagoans fled through the storm from shorefront homes and hotels . Hundreds of feet of concrete boulevards were crumpled . Waves mounting up 30 feet battered a new government lighthouse . A disrupted disposal plant poured sewage into the lake , made " city water " undrinkable.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
