txt A report that the French loan for $100,000,000 will be issued as early as Monday next does not receive confirmation in the best-informed quarters . The date of issue is not yet fixed , though the contracts have been signed in Paris . It depends largely on the outcome of the vote of confidence which Premier Eriand is seeking and a satisfactory settlement of the Silesian crisis . It is possible that the loan might be issued next week , but on the other band all probabilities point to a later date , even as late as the middle of next month . The fact that M. Casenave , head of the French High Commission , has not yet left Paris and is not expebted here before the end of the month seems to indicate no great hurry on the part of the French Government to issue the loan . M. Casenavi is understood to be bringing the contracts back with him .
