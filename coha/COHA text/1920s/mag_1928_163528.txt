A descendant of Daniel Webster returned good for evil , last week , to famed Lev Davidovitch Trotsky . The descendant is Poet Max Eastman , 45 , sometimes considered a dilettante radical , onetime editor of the brilliant but now defunct review , The Masses* and author of Since Lenin Died . Of this volume Comrade Trotsky wrote in his potent yesterdays : ' fallacious and mendacious . . . exploits single incidents of the Communist party discussion . . . perverts the meaning of facts . " Since writing those lines Trotsky has been exiled to the remote vicinity of Chinese Turkestan because he dared to continue " party discussion " in a party which demands blind obedience . Last week , at Manhattan , Poet Max Eastman returned good for evil by making public a letter from Russian Communist friends purporting to reveal , for the first time , precise details of M. Trotsky 's enforced setting out from Moscow ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) . <P> The letter told that Trotsky 's departure on the day scheduled was prevented by 10,000 sympathizers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave Moscow and then stood like a herd of cows upon the tracks so that his train could not leave . Next day 47 sympathizers were arrested for loitering near his house . Finally , continues the letter : " The police agents threatened to take Trotsky from his house by force . . . . Trotsky refused to go . The police picked up his overcoat and began to force him into it . His wife tried to communicate with somebody by telephone and they dragged her roughly from the instrument . Trotsky 's son attempted to defend his father and was subdued in a fist fight . <P> " Finally they dragged Trotsky out of his house by main force , put him in an automobile and drove him at high speed to the Faustovo station , forty miles from Moscow . <P> " He was placed in a compartment with two soldiers on guard . On the road he fell sick . At Samara they took him from the train in a serious condition and doctors were summoned . That is all we know . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly tampered with by the Soviet Censor , have uniformly declared that Trotsky left Moscow in the passive presence of a crowd which merely collected at the station , sang Communist songs , and wailed , " Oh how sad ! " as his train chuffed out . <P> <P> * Not to be confused with The New Masses , struggling , Manhattan organ of mass and class conscious intelligentsia .
