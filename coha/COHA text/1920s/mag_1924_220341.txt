Last year the Sistine Choir , sweet singers of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican , turned their faces west from the Holy City , traversed the Ocean 's watery floor , came to sing their lauds and hallowed canticles in the U. S. The tour , as everyone knows , was financially a success , artistically a triumph . This season the Sistine Choir will again visit the U. S. Among those who will be heard are : <P> Luigi Golinelli , giant white-haired basso , whose locks are snowier than the fleeces of Sharon , whose voice could shake the walls of Gaza ; Spartaco Morgia , dramatic tenor , with barrel chest and amber voice - a man like a hogshead of honey ; Attilio Boschi , young baritone , who , it is declared , is destined to be " the second Scandiani " ; the Rev. Antonio Grimaldi , basso at the Sistine Chapel for 16 years , a famed authority on ecclesiastical music ; Eugenio Andriselli , adult male soprano and assistant organist at St. Peter 's . In all , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the religious music of the sedate Palestrina , operatic numbers and folk-melodies of Southern Italy which , it is said , have never before been heard in the U. S.
