To the Editor of The New York Times : I notice in your columns the following reference to my own beliefs : " That Sir Arthur is , the reverse of skeptical is rather amusingly shown by his saying about the cast of an arm made in paraffin at a seance that it was proved to be of spirit origin by the smallness of the wrist . " It is curious that our critics while rightly exacting extreme accuracy from us , seldom . If ever , show the same virtue themselves . It Was not an arm in the case of the GeleyKluski experiments , nor was it in the first instance a cast . It was a mold of a hand , obtained by dipping the materialized hand into paraffin and then dematerializing , so that there was a large intact hand with a small wrist opening . Is there really anything very amusing in my assertion that such an effect could not be produced in a fragile material in any way but a psychic one ? The three witnesses ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Due de Granmont , and Geley. the well-known investigator . What Possible alternative explanation can be produced , and why should this not be the subject of Investigation by . any scientific committee ? ARTHUR CONAN DOThE . Crowborough , England , Dec. 19 , 1922.
