The Senate , having become stranded on the Muscle Shoals Bill , has stuck there for many weeks unable to get off - but not without diversions from its enduring struggles . One of these brightened the Senate atmosphere last week . Two men produced the diversion . <P> One was Senator William Cabell Bruce , Maryland Democrat , iron-gray soldier of the old school , the man who stood out against his party 's alignment with the Republican insurgents in the last session of Congress , the man who voted for the Mellon tax plan and other important measures with the regular Republicans . <P> The second was Senator Pat Harrison of Mississippi , also a Democrat , hardhitting , fierce-tongued orator , he who made the keynote speech of the last Democratic Convention . <P> The usual topic , Muscle Shoals , was being discussed . Mr. Harrison , in his usual pugnatious manner , made some reflections on a citizen of Maryland in connection with the " Fertilizer Trust . " Mr. Bruce rose , defended the Marylander and then continued : <P> " I sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the summit of this Capitol and place a big black pap bottle in its place . The idea seems to be that the Government is something to which resort is to be incessantly had for the coddling and artificial stimulation of private interests . <P> " This thing has gone on until the South itself , which used to be the chosen seat of State sovereignty and of individual initiative , enterprise and self-reliance , seems to be slowly succumbing to the same paternalistic notions . . . . <P> " The Democratic Party has recently been identifying itself to such an extent with departures of one sort and another from all the old true American ideas and ideals that it has lost for the time being the confidence of the country , which it had enjoyed so long as it was true to its time-honored principles and the leadership of Thomas Jefferson and Grover Cleveland . <P> " No ! We Democrats now , like Sisyphus in the classic fable , must roll our great , heavy stone uphill again , and we never will roll it uphill again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party to its former sound ideas of the proper relations between the states and the National Government and between governmental activity and private industrial activity . . . . " <P> Arose the steaming Senator from Mississippi : <P> " I say that there are some Senators over here who could tell me that we have lost the confidence of the country , and I would pass it by , but Senators who make the allegation must be pure of heart and true in record . . . . No politics has heretofore been brought into any discussion at this session . It is a pity that the first voice to be raised in this Chamber against the Democratic Party is by an alleged Democratic Senator proclaiming that the Democratic Party has lost the confidence of the country .
