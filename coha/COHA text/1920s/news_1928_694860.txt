txt The Montgomery Advertiser re , veals a curious situation in the South with respect to Governor SMITH . Citing a few on the list of important Southern journals which openly favor the New Yorker 's nomination , it grieves because the politic cians of the South are too timid to follow the newspaper . lead , even though it expresses their secret wish . What a sigh of relief hundreds of " Southern ' leaders ' great and small " will breathe when SMITH is nom " inated , " comments The Advertiser . " His nomination will solve all their " problems by making it safe for " them to advocate his candidacy . " This truth is becoming generally understood . It is only the irreconcilable followers who talk of States in the South going Republican this Fall if SMITH is the nominee . Most experienced political ob-'servers agree that Kentucky , West Virginia , Oklahoma and Missouri are as likely to go one way as another , whoever is nominated , for their past political history indicates as much . But The Advertiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the inner circles of the Republican Party  --  that the Solid South will stay solid under ' SMITH , and that Southern politicians , once he is nominated , will " grow increas " ingly eloquent and earnest as elec " tion day approaches . SMITH will " be described by them as the knight " liest Democrat ever heard of and " his detractors will be lashed with " the fury and zeal that characterize " the convert . " But these converts will not really be converts , for they are hoping even now that SMITH will be nominated , because they feel that he alone has a chance to win . These elements of the Southern political situation give the antiSmith campaign much of the aspect of a sham battle . Politics is a business of verities , and the practical workers know that a four-time Democratic Governor of New York , with forty-five electoral votes , surrounded by friendly populations in other great States , can not sensibly be rejected for a less-qualified candidate from a small State not in a strategic section . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anti-prohibitionist , their advocacy of him would be seized upon by a local rival , playing on local prejudices , to take the local organization from them . Hence , they hesitate to come out and say what they think about the nomination of SMITH , and that is what disgusts The Advertiser , The Charleston News and Courier , The Columbia Record , The Norfolk Virginian-Pilot , The Macon Telegraph , The El Paso Times , The Columbus ( Ga . ) Enquirer-Sun and other Southern newspapers which are heartily supporting the Governor of New York . " Weak and afraid , " says The Advertiser of these politicians , " with " scarcely enough favorite-son coat " tails for them to hide behind . " It is particularly right when it predicts that , if SMITH is nominated , " original Smith men and newspapers " will spring out of hiding in such numbers in the South that the present pioneers will have hard work convincing themselves that the present hibernation ever existed .               @ @ @ @ @ @
