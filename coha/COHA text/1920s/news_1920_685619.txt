txt Somewhere between the farmer and the city man an unconscionable profit is made . In the last few days lettuce that the grower sold for $1 to $1.25 a crate cost the public at the rate of $2.40 to $6 a crate ; onions that the Igrower sold for 11h cents a pound cost the public 5 and 6 cents a pound . A Long Island farmer whose potatoes should have sold at $5.50 a barrel wholesale , ? if he was to net a fair profit , was offered only $4.25 a barrel ; yet in New York and even in towns on Long Island the same grade of potatoes sold for $9 a ba5rel . The , dismal chronicle might be continued indefinitely . Such a condition is equally unjust to the farmer , whose produce is often wasted or fed to the pigs , and to the much-suffering city consumer . In the long run it can Only result in a general curtailment of production which will further increase lI the price of food . To locate the precise point of profiteering is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame . Unquestionably he at times makes exorbitant profits ; yet his business - is necessarily in some measure speculative and he stands to incur serious losses  --  of which the public never hears . The local grocer and butcher have also their risks , and furthermore differ widely in the amount of rent they pay and in the service they render in delivering goods . There is no recognized standard of prices , and many of them take advantage of the fact to do a deal of profiteering . To regulate such matters is probably beyond the power of the law and certainly beyond the possibilities of enforcing the , law . The remedy lies elsewhere . The critical fact is that the farmer has not developed his function as a business man ; no other set of producers has failed so signally to safeguard its position in . bargaining . Entering the market as an individual , he is at t : e mercy of the firm of middlemen  --  often at the mercy of a combination of middlemen engaged in a joint speculation .

His remedy is that which Sir HORACE PLUNKETT has demonstrated iii Ireland  --  agricultural co-operation societies . Thus , if the farmers of Long Island were organized , they would be able to deal on equal terms with the middleman and exert a powerful pressure upon the retailer . More food would be sold , and at lower retail prices . The difficulties in the way of organization are mainly legal . " Some of the " States permit farmers to organize " co-operative associations to market " their products . Some of the States " do not grant this privilege to " farmers , although they do grant It to " organizations of capital and of labor . " There must be a national law giving " the farmer this right in all States . " The pending Capper-HeVsman bill has been indorsed by every farm organization in the United States . Both polit- , ical parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended the couvee in a recent speech at Rochester , and many State platforms , notably that of Iowa , have spoken out forcibly . For the city man far more than for the farmer such legislation is indispensable . Of late years the proportions of urban and rural population have been reversed . The farmer can not be starved , and so is more nearly immune than most of us to an advancing cost of commodities . " With the " farmer curtailing production , as he " most assuredly is doing , it will be " the consuming two-thirds , not the " . producing one-third , that will feel " the food shortage first and most " acutely .
