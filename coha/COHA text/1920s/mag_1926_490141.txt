SOME time ago we were dumbfounded by a certain sign pasted on the window of a downtown butcher shop , and going by the place early this week we noticed that it was still there . We suppose it is left there because it epitomizes the United States of America in the year 1926 . It reads , " GOOD-BYE RUDY , HELLO TRUDY . " THE newspapers have accorded a very brief fame to Mr. Taylor Chamberlin , of Hempstead , Long Island . The explanation of his fleeting notoriety lies in the fact that he was awakened one morning at seven o'clock by a hand organ man and a monkey and that he subsequently persuaded the trustees of Hempstead to ban all music , if not all monkeys , from the streets of the community . It is possible that no one enjoys being roused either by a monkey or a hand organ , but it is certain  --  life bring already so difficult  --  that no one , not even Mr. Chamberlin , appears at his best when sponsoring repressive ordinances .

The Peary outrage he was up there for weeks without writing anything  --  must not be repeated . WHILE chatting with his doctors prior to going under an anesthetic a confrere reports that somebody introduced the subject of the reading matter in physicians ' waiting rooms . Being accused of bad judgment in this matter , the doctors protested unanimously that they are the victims of circumstance . They asserted that their selection is intelligent but that their patients quickly carry away all offerings of merit and leave but a ridiculous residue .

Mr. Malone is the first Irish lawyer with a sense of humor who has ever undertaken these two jobs . This , however , is not the first time the public has been made aware that there are easier ways to succeed in the law than by looking after the property rights of conservative old ladies or by trying to prove to Tennessee that this is not the seventeenth century . EVEN Raquel Meller is human EVEN enough to err . In announcing that she was going to make her permanent home in New York she said of America , " They could n't have treated a queen any nicer than I was treated . " We scent a slight inaccuracy . The Queen of Roumania has been offered $25,000 to act for one day in the movies . Though ignorant of Mlle.

Harvard colors Cambridge a dark crimson for miles around , but Columbia , New York University , and Hunter College lie by themselves in little puddles of learning while a block away the city pursues its ignorant way untouched .

To everyone 's surprise , the Washington Square branch of N. Y.

There are fourteen thousand students in the regular departments of Columbia , we read in the papers , and but a fraction of that number at the N. Y. U. ; but that fraction is frightfully collegiate . Sandwiched though they are between tramps , babies , nurses , and Greenwich Village artists , they succeed in creating a very respectable campus . They sit and bone , chew pencils , walk arm in arm , fraternize , sororize , giggle , and discuss professors and classes in an impeccable way .

The lady with whom he is staying being out , and the maid being likewise , and the telephone being ringing , he answered it . " Who is this ? " said a cheerful and jazzy feminine voice . " Who do you want to speak to ? " asked Mr. Walpole somberly . " I want to leave a message for Mrs. , " said the voice . " Who is this " " I 'll take the message , " said Mr. Walpole somberly .

One of them stumbled on a broken flagstone , paused politely , took a red crayon from his pocket , stooped , and making a large X on the offending pavement , wrote beside it , " Please fix ; " and then walked on down the street with his companion . Art " THOSE wild-eyed , happy people THOS may have seen running up and down the streets and avenues , throwing their hats in the air , are the artists who have just read that ( as we have suspected for some time ) America is on the edge of a renaissance in art . The word is about that money will flow like bootleg this winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the holes to keep the wind and rats away . The cautious statisticians who predict this new birth say that revivals in art have always followed prosperity and that now , with the American dollar supreme , nothing can stop the rich from filling their homes with paintings , torsos and such . We have had private word from most of the art dealers . Some we talked to were skeptical , saying that only the rich buy the pictures and that only a few of the rich care about them . Other dealers , mainly those who sell the work of comparatively unknown artists and beginners , declare that the masses are becoming art-conscious and that the moment picture buying gets to be the vogue the dam will break and paintings in the home will be as usual as Fords or radios . One dealer we found preparing a campaign of education for this winter to advise the general public of the money to be made in Genius Common .

The Great Unwashed THE Public Library , it seems , is to escape the fate of having its face lifted by the ever-busy sandblasters . We have been wondering about this for a long time , as the walls have gradually assumed the shade of the old gray Stone reservoir on the site of which the library was built some twenty years ago . Thomas Hastings , designer and architect of the building ( which , incidentally , cost about nine million dollars ) tells us that the color of themarble will mellow with time , and that in this condition it will he more interesting than if it had its face scrubbed with the rude sand blast every now and then . Then too , he says that as the building was put up to last some time , too much cleaning would not only show up great blotches of black or gray , with which it seems some marble is marked , but would injure the stone and its carvings .

" A Prolific Swede WE DROPPED in at the Mont-ross Gallery on Fifty-sixth Street to see one of the first exhibitions of the season  --  the New Mexico painters , and found that only one of them was what we would call well represented . B. J. 0 . Nordfeldt is there with both feet , that is , with both etchings and paintings , both landscapes and portraits . Nordfeldt , by the way , before he became a " modern " and before he " went West , " did a famous series of etchings of New York City , and also made important contributions to wood block color printing , examples of which seem to be in the permanent exhibition in the Public Library at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in America practically all his life . A short little fellow of middle age , with a white kewpie fore-lock on his round bald head , and a pipe permanently stuck in his mouth , he finds it possible to he amiably satirical on almost all subjects and occasions and amazingly prolific in his work . At the same time he is a business man , a stockholder and officer in the Spanish and Indian Trading Company in Santa Fe ; a discriminating collector of Indian pottery and blankets of which he is an authority ; a bridge shark , playing the game cheerfully through whole nights ; and one of the best cooks on the continent . Mrs. Nordfeldt , who is a doctor , is away lecturing much of the time , so that he is master in his own kitchen as well as in his workshop . Besides doing all his own cooking , he has built his house in Santa F6 , practically unassisted except by unskilled Mexican laborers ( who are , incidentally , his favorite models ) . He has likewise made all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lintels , beams and rafters , and expects to spend the rest of his life finishing and perfecting the place . The front door alone is a masterpiece , containing his whole life history in a series of tiny , hand-carved panels . The carved and hand-illuminated beams of the large living room have occupied him during his spare time for several years already , and will doubtless take more years to complete . Less than ten years ago he was making scenery and helping to direct at the Provincetown Playhouse in its early days . Mrs. Nordfeldt took many leading parts in the plays given at that time , notably the lead in " Suppressed Desires , " by Susan Glaspcll , which was the most successful of the Province-town plays . He still manages these pleasant side-lines in connection with the Santa Fe Players and has time for THE NEW YORKER al ! of his other surprising hobbies besides doing more etching than any other artist we know . St. John the Divine THE report is that Bishop Manning arid his assistants have at this very moment $8,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments , " which are almost as good as pledges . With these monies they can finish the nave and start one transept of the cathedral . In case there are some who do n't know it , every stone that comes to the big job on Morningside Heights is cut , finished , polished , and ready to be put in place . It is like a huge puzzle . Every stone is marked with a number , such as 41B135 , and that number is printed somewhere on some voluminous blue print ; and one of the jobs of the workmen , of which there are more than a hundred , is to find the right stone when they want it . They are to be seen wandering around through the marble piles like people who have lost a valuable pocket book and have come back to look for it , their lips moving silently , " Forty-one B one-three-five . Forty-one B onethree-five . " And occasionally they mention the name of the Lord . It only takes a glance at the new nave ( which is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built strictly according to rule  --  at least , not according to the rule by which Henry Adams says Chartres was built . In putting in concrete foundations , the architects have cheated ; for cement was unknown in the eleventh century , and in giving the workmen a substantial steel structure to work on they have outraged tradition still more . Yet , these glaring anachronisms can not altogether mask the beauty of what is going forward . As you stand looking up the scaffolded structure , you are impressed . At Chartres they worked to the slow rattle of hand windlasses , at Morningside they work to the clang and wheeze of the electric hoist ; the stones fly instead of crawl up to the tops of the columns where they are to rest . But they are nice stones . Compared to the speed with which an office building is built , progress is terribly slow ; although ecclesiastically speaking , we suppose the rate is phenomenal . It looks now as though this generation would have a chance to worship within the completed structure . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the columns are complete to the point where the West Front will rise . None of the sculpture is finished , the plan being to put the blocks that are to be carved in place in the rough , and to let the sculptor climb up afterwards and do his work .

It now appears that the rivalry between them in the bitter fight for customers in their respective dens has developed to an acute point , and the situation has not been improved by the fact that one of the pirates has gone over to the enemy and is now wearing sombrero and chaps across the way .

Consolation . " WELL , " said a taxi-driver to us familiarly by way of passing the time in a traffic jam , " I 'll bet I 've got something in this cab that you wo n't find in another car any place .

" Yeah , " said the driver , hurtling alarmingly down the avenue when the lights changed , but looking back at us instead of at the street ahead , " I used to drive an ambulance .
