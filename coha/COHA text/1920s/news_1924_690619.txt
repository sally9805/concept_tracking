txt John W. Davis , the Democratic Presidential candidate , arrived here this morning . well pleased with the results of his last week 's campaigning and satisfied from what he has been told by party leaders that he will carry Missouri and Nebraska and has a good chance of silos cess in Colorado and Kansas . Missouri is considered safely Democratic by the leaders of that party and Mr. Davis has been informed by Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska . his running mate , that the Democratic national ticket will probably carry Nebraska . The situation In Colorado and Kansas Is different According to Democratic leaders in those States , a large Major-. ity of the voters of each State , as in other States of the West and Middle West . are against President Coolidge . The problem from the Democratic viewpoint is the candidacy of Senator La Follette and to win the latter 's followers to support of Davis and Bryan . In both Colorado and Kansas the Republican Party is rent by a fight over the Klan , and this is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had considerable sue cess in restoring party harmony In Nebraska , where Arthur Mullen . National Committeeman , and Ex-Senator Gilbert M. Hitchcock . former political foes of Governor Bryan , are working for the ticket , and in Colorado , wl ; " antagonism of groups headed by Ge governor W. B. Sweet and National Committeeman John T. Barnett has been ended , found on his arrival here that party harmony had already been practically established in Missouri . The fax . tion headed by Senator James A. Reed of Kansas City and the anti-Reed faction , which thwarted Senator Reed 's Presidential ambitions by carrying the State convention against him last Spring . are both supporting the Democratic national ticket . Although the claim would be disputed by the Republicans , the Democratic leaders expect to carry Missouri for Mr. Davis . La Follett ! to Cut Into German Vote . According to a canvass made by party leaders , Senator La Follette is apparently cutting more into the Republican vote than the Democratic vote in Missouri . The third party candidate Is reported to be particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , where he has strung support among voters of German descent . In Kansas City , which is normally Democratic , Mr. Davis will lose a considerable number of votes to Senator La Follette among the industrial workers and railroad men , but this loss Is not expected to be nearly as great as the Republican less In St. Loofa . Democratic farmers are re . ported to be generally sticking to the Democratic national ticket . The Klan Issue has been taken out of the Missouri campaign to some extent by the action of the councils of both the major party candidates for Gov. governor adopting a platform denouncing the Klan specifically , although Dr. Arthur W. Nelson , the Democratic nominee , and Samuel Baker , the Republican nominee , had the Klan endorsement in the primaries in which they were nominated . During his stay here today Mr. Davie called on Senator Reed , who is still confined by illness to a room in the Motet Muehlebach. where Mr. Davis hi stopping . Senator Reed came out in support of Mr. Davis after his Seagirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Reed 's re ? port on the situation to Mr. Davis is understood to have been favorable . The Senator saki to newspaper reporters in the Davis party that there were SO many cross-currents In this campaign that a forecast of the result ' Was difficult , and expressed belief that the lines had not yet been formed . He declared that Mr. Davis could win many votes in Missouri by stressing preservation of constitutional rights , including freedom from search and seiture and freedom of religious worship . and the responsibility , of the President and the Republican Partx , for corruption In office . something that Mr. Davis has done in recent speeches . Senator Reed explained that great re . sentment hail- been caused In Missouri by prohibition enforcement agents breaking into homes and places of business without search warrants and In many cases doing much damage to property . lie added that there were itiarlY eases in the Courts as the result of the attempt to enforce the prohlbi ? ticiti laws by what he declared to be an Illegal method , and sae that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constitutional rights . During the afternoon Mr. Davis saw a number of the Missouri Democratic : leaders. ; including Congressman Harry Hawes of St. Louis . and discussed the local situation with thetp 1n detail . Davis at Barbecue Today . Today Mr. Davis will open the Missouri State Democratic campaign with a speech apt a barbecue at the home of Dr. Nelson , candidate for Governor , at Bunceton . A crowd of at least 30.000 la ezkectett -- at .. -1/14 -- -tattintro , : factlitica1r gath , ering , familiar enough to Missourians of the last generation . but unknown tor many years in the East . The fires for the barbecue were lighted on Saturday ' and great stacks of hickory have been piled to keep the fires going . There are three huge beds of coals on which 12,000 pounds of beef and 3.000 pounds of mutton will be Placed tonight . Dr. Nelson has ordered 2,400 double loaves of bread and 900 gallons of coffee will be prepared . Practically all the women of Cooper County have been baking cakes and pies for several days . Preparations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . Mr. Davis will remain over night at the home of Dr. Nelson and will have an opportunity to meet practically all the Democratic leaders of the State . He Will speak in Des Moines on Wednesday and at Chicago on Thursday night . From Chicago he will turn east , speaking in several cities in Indiana on his Way back to New York . Although the farmer vote is much stronger in Kansas than in Colorado , the situation in these two States is similar in that in each the Republican Party has a Klan fight on its hands and the practical certainty of an antiKlan Republican candidate for Governor In Kansas the prospective candidacy of William Allen White . editor of The Emporia Gazette , as an anti-Klan candidate is worrying the Republicans . Petitions are out for Mr. White and it is considered certain that he will run and thereby probably Insure the reelection of Governor Jonathan Davis , Democrat . Mr. white 's candidacy also will do some harm to the ' Republican national ticket . How much . future developments will determine . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading Democrats that President Coolidge would probably carry Kansas by from 30,000 to 50.000. about 100,000 less than the normal Republican plurality . Rope to Win Votes From La Follette . ' In their opinion , the ultimate result will depend very largely upon the sueporters of Senator La Follette , all of whom are agamst the Republican National Administration and presumably more opposed to President Coolidge than to Mr. Davis . For that reason the party chiefs showed great interest In Z &r.; Davis 's drive to convince the La ' Follette followers that a vote for the third party candidate would be a vote wasted and that the only hope for a progressive administration at Washington was in the election of the Democratic national ticket . The Democratic leaders of the Middle West expect this plea to have some effect and declare that a shift of even minor percentage of the La Follette supporters to Mr. Davis n-ouid win many Middle Western States for him end probably Meng about his election . A campaign to try to bring this about wile be made from now until election day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned by nearly every party leader who has boarded the Davis special train , and that is the inactivity of the Democratic National Committee . Freouent complaints hays b. - en received of inability ! to get either information or assistance from Democratic headquarters at Washington . and there has been considerable criticism of Clem I , . Shaver , Democratic National Chairman , for apparent inactivity in the West . There also has been criticism of the itinerary laid out for Mr. Davis on this trip . and complaint that the leaders In earth State were not consulted . For example . some of the Colorado leaders wished Mr. Davis to speak at Pueblo instead of Denver . in the belief that more votes were to be gained there . In Kansas . the Democratic National Committeemen and State Chairman would have preferred to have Mr. Davis go through Central instead of Northern Kansas en his way to Topeka. with a sto- ) at Wichita . in Wyoming , Senator Kendrick wanted the candidate to speak at Casper instead of Cheyenne . There also was a mix-up earlier in the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting at Des Moines for Sept. e . This mistake , however , was rectified , and Mr. Davis will speak there on Wednesday . Mr. Davis attended service this morn ing at the Central Presbyterian church . He had luhch with Reese Turpin , a former college mate , who is acting Democratic National Corn nitteeman in the absence of lee W. Kemper . CALLS ON WOMEN TO VOTE . Mrs. Rosalie Whitney Issues Appeal to Insure Coolidge 's Election . An appeal to Republican women to turn out at the polls in large numbere , in order to keep the election out of the House of Representatives , was issued yesterday by Mrs. Rosalie . Loew Whitney , member of the Republican Women 's State Executive Committee . Mrs. Whitney is a lawyer and was formerly a member of the State Industrial Commission . " Only one thing can prevent New Fork carrying its forty-five electoral votes to Calvin Coolidge. " she said , " and that is the neglect or indifference of Republican men end ' women . " The Republican women of New York State realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register and vote . Then the people of the United States and not the Congressmen will elect the next President , Calvin Coolidge . The men can not do it alone . Republican women must do their part . Every vote counts . " The Republican Party leaders believe there is no question that Calvin Coolidge will have the necessary majority , and more . Nevertheless , it behooves all who want to see Calvin Coolidge re-elected to insure the vote of every possible ' State . A third ticket  --  any third ticket-1 may pick up the tlectoral votes of a ! few States . This may prevent a majority for any candidate . " We know that the Empire State will go for Coolidge and Dawes . but we want the New York Republican women to come out and register . " NEGRO LEADER FOR DAVIS . Roscoe Conkling Bruce , Republican , Quits Coolidge Over Klan . Roscoe Conkling Bruce , a negro graduate of Harvard , and a lifelong Republican , announced yesterday that he would support Davis against Coolidge because of the Ku Klux Klan Issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former ' United States Senator from Mississippi . / After being graduated from Harvard , he became director of the academic department of Tuskegee , Ala . Later he went to Washington , D. C. , as head of the colored schools , for many Years holding the position of Assistant Superintendent of Public Schools . He now lives In Prince George County . Maryland . " The Ku Klux Klan is after the black man and he knows it . " said Mr. Bruce . " So , he is going to stand with those who Unmistakably repudiate this form of lawlessness . Mr. Coolidge said no word when his word might have helped . His method was shown in the Boston police strike  --  to sit on the fence until the eat called Public Opinion has made its decisive jump , and then to announce and sonorously support the principles of that jump until the unwary imagine the praise belongs to Mr. Coolidge himself rather than to the cat ! But , it I may draw upon the folk lore of my people , I would say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion is better than to exploit it . " - STRAW VOTE FOR COOLIDGE . ?
