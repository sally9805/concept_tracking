Gloria Dined NOW Gloria Swanson has had her banquet , as per the growing custom for the more famous mimes of the screen . Indeed , banqueting stars has become so well established a ritual in high church movie circles that , for all the layman knows , players ' contracts may specify , in addition to other perquisites and emoluments , so many hundreds of pounds of caviar , to be served publicly- each month . Banquets are given upon a star 's departure and upon return , and each succeeding one must be bigger and better than ever ; better meaning more expensive . If not , Miss Swanson , for example , is likely to say something cutting to her employers about Pola Negri 's having been honored with more pate de pis gram than was lavished on one who is a great box office attraction and a Marquise to boot , Fortunately this disaster has been avoided thus far . Nor are these affairs confined to the distaff element . Even such an expert with the pistol as Torn Mix felt that his presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . True , this cowpuncher , who sets fashion by wearing wine-colored evening clothes and white overcoats trimmed with brown leather for morning wear , did not elect to outdo Pola Negri. his was a modest affair held in the Hotel Astor , at which , however , Mrs. Mix was able to display the discomforts of being wealthy by having such an armful of glistening bracelets as made necessary treatment by a masseuse of muscles lamed by bearing such weight of jewels . These dinners seldom get much more than mere mention in the newspapers . The speeches are unimportant and , as a rule , full of banalities . It might be concluded that the affairs are tendered as measures of defense by shrewd gentlemen of the motion pic ture industry anxious to avoid unprolitabie rivalries . Pola Negri , the beautiful Pole , who rather likes the idea of a " beeg hed , " otherwise , a close-up , on the screen , recently arrived here from California en route to Europe . Her employers arranged the obligatory bon-voyage banquet . It was held in the Ritz-Carlton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been but a few days in this country . Miss Negri tritnnphed and Jesse L. Lasky was able to announce that Mr. Arlen would write special stories as her screen vehicles . Miss Negri may well have felt that here was a compliment which even the illustrious Gloria could not achieve . Well-known ladies and gentlemen appeared at the dinner and afterward for the dance . It was a brilliant gathering with plenty of room for all and everything . There was reason to believe that even the newly-made Marquise de la Falaise de la Coudray could not expect anything better as her welcome to her native ' land . M ISS SWANSON is in the happy position of having a contract for one more year with the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation , whose officials are greatly concerned lest Cecil B. DeMille wean from them their popular actress . With true aristocracy , Miss Swanson is avoiding unpleasant discussion of a renewal of her contract and obviously flirting mildly with more than one rival magnate who might be willing to give her $15,000 or more a week . So Adolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no complaint to make about her welcome home dinner . They elected to hold the banquet and dance at the Park Lane , where special rooms were engaged for the 30o guests . Miss Swanson , one of Mack Sennett 's bathing beauty graduates , was signally honored when she entered the room . The lights were turned off as she gized Thomas Meighan , a great drawing card , who has not arrived or departed for some time , and therefore has not been honored with a banquet . Bebe Daniels sat and looked as if she thought her turn ought to come some near day . Miss Negri will return soon from her European trip . It remains to be seen what will be done for her in the way of a " welcome home " affair . It is difficult to imagine what can be done , except possibly to have every guest 's name stamped in platinum on the invitations , dress the waiters in specially designed livery and summon the high of the land to attend the salaam . ELABORATE dinners are , as one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are not being done much in any of the intimate circles which compose our large and loosely joined Society . Occasionally , of course , there are such affairs as was that given lately by Senor Simon I. Patino , a leading citizen of Cochobamba , Bolivia . Eighty guests dined . Eight thousand dollars . Senor Patino owns the tin mines in his native land , and Bolivian officials admit most cordially that his income is larger than the government 's revenues . He has a home in Paris , one in Nice and one in Biarritz . He follows , with equal zest , the sunshine and the fashion . At this writing he is with his family at the Plaza . There are Senora Patino , two daughters , three $ie took her seat ; a spotlight was thrown on her shingled head , and the orchestra struck up her new national anthem , " La Marseillaise . " It was highly dramatic . On went the dinner , obviously with the intention of convincing Gloria that she was a stronger favorite with the company than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the tables , passing around Napoleonic paper hats , singularly appropriate for the gentlemen who wore them . Mr. Zukor praised Gloria , and Marion Green sang lyrics introducing girls dressed in the roles played by the versatile star . Tactfully , also , Mr. Zukor eulo sons and a battalion of secretaries and servants . They have a . fine view of the Park and a hotel bill which one patriotic New Yorker has suggested should be included among this city 's exhibits at the Philadelphia sesqui-centennial . Prohibition Threatens  --  Again UR Prohibition Authority predicts that this Spring and Summer will tell the story of liquor smuggling . If the Coast Guard , as expanded and with longer daylight for observation , can not stop the flow of Scotch now , it can not hope to do so unless it is able to build a fence along the entire coast . Admiral Billard , the chief of this service , admits encountering difficulty ' in recruiting the kind of men he wants ; and he wants 1,000 more . Human nature is frail and large operators can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little blindness . This campaign , now in its first stages , has not as yet affected the supply of liquor available in town . Scotch is plentiful , and fairly reasonable in price . Quotations vary little from fifty dollars a case , up or down . Indeed , so ample is the present supply that some petty bootleggers are adopting various subtleties of approach to overcome sales resistance . The most popular pose is that of a steward on a liner . Very obliging liners these are , too , permitting their stewards to remain about New York to take orders , postponing sailings on an hour 's notice to allow deliveries of needed case goods ; generally adapting themselves to the whims of the local drinker . The theory seems to be that customers will be impressed with the genuineness of liquor if it is offered by one seemingly a steward on some Atlantic liner . OUR Prohibition Authority advises , since we are becoming a city of Scotch drinkers , that the best way to assure excellence is to buy only new brands . Once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazingly . But first shipments from abroad usually are good and reasonably aged . This , of course , is an old trick in many businesses . It makes a market . One of the most successful of the great liquor importers , now richly retired , always bought from different sources every time he visited Scotland . He sought nut small and comparatively unknown distilleries in the north of Scotland , took over their entire stocks , and never went to any of them a second time . Whoever followed him was certain to get nothing but green whisky , the canny Scot devising a special article for overseas business just as soon as he discovered what it was all about . Which proves the Scots deserve their title of " the Yankees of Europe . " This eminent captain of industry informed our Prohibition Authority that his last advices showed the export center for Scotch shifting from England to Hamburg . He advanced a reason , but his explanation was so involved in the mazes of international banking and credit practices that our Prohibition Authority found himself way beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told our Prohibition Authority a tale of the early days of the smuggling industry , when hearts were gay , profits were high and foreign distillers were trustful . A gay blade known on the Jersey Coast as the Yale Boy , finding himself flush by some freak of the capricious dice , engaged passage to England , where , shortly , he ran out of funds . The first rumors of the huge profits being made in whisky smuggling ventures were current then among London offices of distilling concerns and among ship brokers . Timidly approaching some of these , the Yale Boy , to his surprise , found a whisky merchant and a ships ' agent eager to fit him out with case goods , schooner and crew , profits to be split among the three . It seemed too good to be true , but the Yale Boy sailed eventually and , after three months lying off the New jersey Coast , disposed of his cargo . He went ashore one night , taking with him all cash , and never returned . Credit immediately went to pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegantly at an historic hotel in town , having many motors , a genuinely titled lady and every other refinement of luxurious existence . His riches lasted only a year , such was his penchant for cards , so he found it necessary to repeat his former deal , The second time he chose Hamburg as his scene of operations and again put the thing across . The rum industry at large is greatly interested in the Yale Boy 's present finances . It is wondering now how soon , and where , he will strike a third time . The King 's Pajamas THEY were pink and they positively set the exclusive social circles of Asheville and Biltmore , N. C. , agog , for the pajamas in question belonged to King Babe Ruth himself . In Asheville it was , as all the world knows now , that the King first swooned away . The fourth breakfast porterhouse and a rough train ride had upset His Majesty . Doctors were called . Consultations held . It was decided that the indisposed monarch must be sent home to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel to the train . It was suggested that it might be better for His Majesty if he were carried out on a stretcher . The King was not adverse and , between pinochle hands , so expressed himself . held until His Majesty should tire of cards . But what of the royal raiment ? The King had no pajamas . Being a democratic monarch he frowns on unwonted luxuries . A messenger was despatched to obtain the going out outfit , the King specifying that it must be pink . Search in every store in Asheville disclosed only one pair of pink pajamas in the city . They were size 42 . The King measured a goodly 48. in the end the messenger had to take the small size . By discarding the trousers altogether and splitting the coat up the back , they were made to do , the King being cautioned to stay quiet on the stretcher. g. et e rst oay , no crepe-so sport shoes will tread lightly on the fairways , nor will French heels bite into delicately-cultured putting greens . From this date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no closer to the Colonial Hunt estate in Mount Vernon , which is the Bronx- ville Golf Club 's home , than fifty feet from any and every boundary . This ruling was made after much propaganda afnong the club members by Mr. Jesse Winburn , who has fought a long and determined campaign to restore the Ancient and Royal Game to its pristine masculine splendor . Mr. Winburn , as one may have gathered , takes his sport seriously . When he voyages to Ber- muda and Winter golf , he packs along his private pro- fessional . He lent the French Olympic Committee tapl1,000,000francs , without interest , to make possible the Paris Olympiad . He is a retired advertising man and is wealthy . He is an enthusiast for a game which breeds nothing but enthusiasts ; so much so that when he presented to the Metropolitan Ravenstyn 's " Por- trait of a Gentleman , " he had himself photographed standing beside the masterpiece , wearing his most ex- pressive plus fours .               @ @ @ @ @ @
