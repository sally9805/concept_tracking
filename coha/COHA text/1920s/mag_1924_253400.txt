When the price of wheat went below $1 a bushel and the price of other farm produce , comparatively , almost as low , then remarkable things happened to the farmers and the farming industry . <P> The first of these was hard times . Everybody who has read a political speech in the last nine months knows that more mortgages have been foreclosed in some parts of the country than there is land . Hard times hurt . But others came with hard times that will last long after these hard times are forgotten . One was a remarkable system of credit facilities for agricultural regions . Another was a great impulse towards diversified farming and more scientific methods . Another was a boost for cooperative marketing . Another was a farm bloc , then an insurgent bloc , and finally a third ticket in politics . Another was the cry that the railways are overcapitalized and freight rates need reducing . <P> Within a few days sudden changes , the development of events , have cast a new and important light on several of these phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldest step toward cooperative marketing that has yet been taken was made by five of the largest grain elevator companies of the Middle West. * They banded themselves together into a great unit , the Grain Marketing Company , with capital stock of $51,000,000 . Not more than $26,000,000 of this will be outstanding at one time , however . First , to the public is to be sold $25,000,000 of preferred stock . Then gradually an equal amount of preferred stock and a million dollars ' worth of common stock are to be sold to bona fide grain-growers . As the farmers buy preferred stock , just so rapidly will the preferred stock of the general public be retired . Executive officers of the companies agree to continue in their present posts for five years The Board of Directors is to consist two-thirds of farmers . The plan will go into operation as soon as the general public has subscribed the first $4,000,000 of preferred stock . <P> There are a great many " if 's " about the success of the proposal : <P> If the public will subscribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find $25,000,000 in their overall pockets worn full of many holes during lean years , <P> If the farmers can learn in five years to manage such a gigantic enterprise successfully , <P> If anyone can run the elevator business profitably- ( it is hinted that the reason the grain elevator companies are so willing to sell out is that they have been losing money ) , <P> Then the farmers may make something out of this great scheme . One advantage will be on their side : they will have a virtual monopoly and moreover can not be prosecuted for it under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act because farm organizations are expressly excluded from its provisions by a later law , the Capper-Volstead Act .
