Forty-five years ago the Indians of western Canada were roaming the plains as free as when Columbus first placed the standard of the Spanish crown on American soil . The white man had not yet come into their country . To-day they live on large reservations situated far out from the towns and cities that have since grown up , and therefore they have seen very little of the white man since . For these reasons they may be said to be the truest type of aboriginal American left on the continent . They retain all their old customs ; they are mainly non-English-speaking , and they still paint their faces and wear much of the native raiment . The Indians whose photographs appear on these pages are : Blackfeet ; Sarcees ; Bloods ; Bush , Swampy , and Plains Crees ; Assiniboines ; Sioux ; Stonys ; Nootkas , and Musqueams of Alberta , Saskatchewan , Manitoba , British Columbia , and the Northwest Territories . All of these tribes , except the Sioux , Assiniboines , and Stonys , are indigenous to Canada . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest following the Minnesota Massacre of 1862 and the Custer Massacre of 1876 . The Assiniboines broke away from the Sioux in what is now the United States three hundred years ago and settled in Saskatchewan , where they became known under their present name . During the big smallpox epidemic , which all but wiped out the Assiniboines one hundred years ago , what are now known as the Stonys fled from the Assiniboines , went farther west , and settled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains , where they now live , just forty miles east of the well-known mountain resort , Banff . In this new territory they lost both of their original identities ? Sioux and  | Assiniboine ? and became known by the English translation of Assiniboine , which means " Stone Indians . " But they continue to speak the Sioux language , and , like the Sioux , they still refer to themselves as the Dakotas , a word which means " Friends , " but which is used by the Sioux to designate all Indians . Many that have written about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then , believing that they have learned all that is to be known about the race , they write a volume on " The Indian . " Even an Indian can not do that . All Indians have so-called red skin , but further than that one can not generalize with safety . There is as much difference between the Plains tribes and the Bush tribes of the Hudson 's Bay district as there is between Americans and the Russians . The Plains Indians , and especially the Blackfeet and the Sioux , are proud , independent , defiant ; they can not be driven . The Bush Indians are docile , slovenly , and rather inclined to dodge a fight . Without the knowledge that Indian tribes differ just as white nationalities , many well-meaning writers have done more harm than good to the Indian race . One group portrays the Indian as a romantic god . Another group depicts him as a shiftless , irresponsible good-for-nothing . The reader of the romantic writer happens to see his first Indian in a country where the Indians are extremely peace-loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected contrast arouses a repulsion that would never have existed had he not got the impression that all Indians are alike . On the other hand , writers of some Western novels and cheap motion-picture plays have probably never laid eyes on a representative of one of the Plains tribes or a pure-bred Indian . I have sometimes felt like putting a bullet through a movie screen on  | which I have seen an Indian bowing and salaaming to a master like a Hindu . ' That is not in Indian nature ? not even the tractable Bush Cree . Again , I have seen the Indian portrayed as a treacherous timber wolf . The Indian is not treacherous . The word of the pure Indian is as good as his life laid in your hand . It is true that Indian blood mixed with certain foreign bloods produces individuals that are too crooked to trust themselves ; but these disreputable characters are no more Indian than they are white . They are mixed breeds . Scotch blood mixes better with Indian than any other . Irish , English , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with the Spanish mixed-bloods . Some of western Canada 's best citizens are of Scotch and Indian descent . Lady Lougheed , wife of Sir James Lougheed , minister of the interior , is a half-breed . So are Brigadier General H. F. MacDonald , C. M. G. , D. S. O. , and D. H. MacDonald , member of the Saskatchewan legislature . James McKay , chief justice of Saskatchewan , is of Scotch and Cree descent , as are many others holding responsible positions in Canada . The Indians are proud to call these people their " half-brothers . " These fine representatives of both races , Scotch and Indian , are very numerous in Manitoba and Saskatchewan , the mention of which reminds me of an incident : A few years ago the Scotch missionary of the Qu'Appelle Agency , Saskatchewan , received a letter from the Old Country , inquiring into the nature of the half-breed . He replied : " The half-breeds are pretty poor specimens of the Indian race , but they are quite an improvement upon the Scotch ! " This leads me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of humor ? " I dare say there are few races that have a deeper vein of humor than the Indian . But his humor inclines to funny situations and actual happenings rather than toward manufactured jokes , which  | seldom " get over " with him . If a person tries to act or be funny , then he is not funny in the eyes of an Indian . Instead , he is ridiculous , and will sometimes bring forth scornful laughter that freezes into stolid-faced contempt . The following is a typical Indian joke ? one that he will laugh at long and heartily , because it happened without intention : George Brass , Cree interpreter for Polley Agency , Saskatchewan , was interpreting a sermon for the Anglican missionary ofthat agency . The missionary was a cockney Englishman who took extreme liberties with his h 's . In this particular sermon he quoted : " Do not be afraid , ( h ) it is I. " George interpreted it thus : " **40;671;TOOLONG " ( " Do n't be afraid , hit him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hit ) by banging his fist into the palm of his hand . I have repeated this occurrence to many Cree gatherings on the plains , and each time I have had to stop under the laughter before I could go on talking . People often ask me about " the Indian dialects . " Among the score of tribes with which I am acquainted , there are no dialects . Distinct tribes have distinct languages , more different from each other than English and Turkish . For instance , the words " white man " in the Blackfoot language is " apeekwan ? " in Sioux , " washeechu ; " in Cree , " monias ? " in Squamish " whulwhullaten . " It is interesting to note that the Cree word for white man , " monias , "  | means : " a helpless person with little experience . " The white man first impressed the Crees as being helpless because he had to carry around with him so many things that seemed unnecessary to the Indian , such as : compasses to find his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking cups , combs , and so forth . The Indian languages are very elaborate . Blackfoot has nine conjugations ; it takes forty-nine pages of foolscap to conjugate one verb . Cree has twelve words for " snow , " each expressing a different condition of snow , and each requiring a sentence to express it in English . There arc no " swear words " in the Indian languages . Indians are perfect in their grammar ; not to be able to speak the language correctly lowers one to an inconsequential position in the tribe . Hence , the first duty of the mother is to teach the child how to speak properly . In the foregoing I have been telling of the Indians with whom I am most intimate ? those of the great American plains and those of the North and the Northwest . There are certain outstanding characteristics that may be attributed very generally to these Indians , and among them I would mention in the order of their predominance : their deep religious nature , their love of sport , their fidelity to friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , their honesty and truthfulness , their great power of physical endurance , their dislike for manual labor , their great understanding and adaptation to things mechanical , their equanimity ,  | their inborn respect for the aged , their love of gathering together and of ceremony , and their unfailing concern for the poor and needy . I would add to this the inability to appreciate the value of money and the desire to turn money into something tangible that one can eat , drink , or use . The restless , aggressive Blackfeet are a very tall people , averaging well over six feet . They arc of a dark copper hue , with retreating foreheads and long , crooked noses . They stick to the custom of painting their faces according to the way they feel when they arise in the morning ? happy , angry , revengeful , in love , warlike , or sad . They wear their hair in two long braids , taking particular care to shave off all superfluous hair around the temples , in the groove where it parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two narrow , straight lines ; and they did this for hundreds of years before civilized women adopted this fashion . The Blackfeet are expert riders , but since the passing of the final buffalo herd in 1883 they have ceased to be hunters . They raise cattle and stock extensively on their large reserve near Gleichen , Alberta , which is forty-six miles long and ten miles wide . During the last ten years they have made great strides as grain ranchers . They cling to all their native customs . Once a year the whole tribe , numbering seven hundred , journey to the Tallow Flats along the Bow River to hold their famous Sun Dance for two weeks . They pitch their  | beautifully painted tepees in a large circle , about a half-mile around , and in the center of this they erect the big green Sun Dance lodge , where , hidden from the eye of the white man , they carry out their ancient rites . Chief Calf Child , whose photograph is shown on page 17 , is one of the leading figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tepee during the Sun Dance last year , August 3d to 12th . Every morning I would be awakened long before sunrise by a queer noise . I would turn over in my bed and see the chief sitting on the side of his pallet , singing his " medicine song " and gazing wistfully at the breakfast fire that his wife had already built in the center of the tepee . This was his morning prayer . He was keeping up the ancient custom of the Plains the enemy . The Canadian Government has tried for years to do away with the Sun Dance among the Blackfeet ? the only tribe that has preserved it in its entirety but their efforts have not met with success . Chief Weasel Calf is the last chief living who signed the famous Treaty of Peace in 1877 , which settled the roving tribes of the Canadian plains on permanent reserves . At the close of the Sun Dance this year ? while we were holding a council of chiefs in his tepee to discuss the Government 's efforts to abolish it ? Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny thing : all white people of different nationalities have the same skin and the same God ; all Indians of different tribes have the same skin and the same images . I do not know which is right . But I know there is but one Great Spirit . " Weasel Calf is one of the Indians who still have more than one wife , as was the custom in the old days . Mrs. Weasel Calf , one of his two remaining wives , is said to  | possess the powers of a spiritualist . She is one of the few women who have attained to the rank of a medicine man . She is head of the Old Wornen 's Lodge , an organization which meets in secret for four days , once a year , to carry n their weird incantations with the " spirits . " The Blood and the Piegan tribe of Alberta are identically the same as the Blackfeet , together with the South Piegans ? so-called Blackfeet ? of Montana . They became split up into these so-called tribes about one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage on the Northwestern plains . These tribes were one at that time , with a head chief whose three sons were minor chiefs of these three bands of the tribe ? all tribes are divided into two or more bands under minor chiefs , for war purposes , much the same as a military division is divided into brigades . No buffalo had come north that year , as a result of a switching of the warm Chinook winds to a more southerly course . The big tribe was facing starvation during the coming winter . The head chief called his three sons together . He instructed the chief of what are now the Blackfeet to go east with his band , and not to return until they had located a herd of buffalo . He sent the band now known as the Bloods south with the same instructions , and he dispatched what are now the Piegans westward . None but the aged and infirm remained with the head chief to await their return . Months afterward the band that became known as the Blackfeet , having veered far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned by a prairie fire , returned to the head camp with their moccasins jet black . Following out the universal Indian habit of renaming things according to circumstances or characteristics on momentous occasions like this ,  | the head chief forthwith called this band the " Siksika , " meaning " Blackfeet . " The band that is now called the Blood tribe was the next to return . During their long absence they had acquired a wide reputation as dangerous fighters , having time and again defeated all their enemy tribes to the south , and spread disaster among all that crossed their path . The head chief called them the " Kai-nais , " meaning " Bloods . " The Piegans were the last to return . They had grown to like their separate existence so well that they refused to join the parent body again . And the chief called them the " Pia-canis , " meaning " cut off , or separation , " which has become corrupted by English pronunciation into " Piegans . " I might say that this is a fact that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to judge , heard by white writers and researchers among Indians . From this time on the three bands grew more individual in their movements and habits , but they kept sufficiently close together to fight their enemies as one unit . When the Treaty of 1877 was signed , the three bands chose to continue their separate existence on reservations located in the hunting grounds that each found during the buffalo shortage one hundred and fifty years ago . Thus the Blackfeet took up the most easterly position at Blackfoot Crossing , now Gleichen , Alberta ; the Bloods chose their southern hunting grounds between Whoop-Up and Stand-Off , Alberta ; and the Piegans went west , near Brockett , Alberta . There they are to-day , separated , but all speaking the same language . The Bloods speak much more rapidly than the Blackfeet , and the Piegans speak about twice as rapidly as the Bloods . It is a pecul- iar fact that all mountain Indians speak very rapidly ? both the Bloods and Piegans are near the foothills of the Rockies . The guttural Kootenays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the Stonys , since going into the foothills , have grown to speak so fast that their parent body , the Assiniboines , have to be with them about a week before they can understand them . Shortly after the Blackfoot split-up , the Sarcees , a tribe belonging to an entirely different stock from those already on the plains , came down from the country of Athapasca ? Rubber Sky ? lying far to the north in what is still the Northwest Territories . They fought the Blackfeet for years , until they were overpowered , and then they joined them as allies . Thus the Blackfeet , Bloods , Piegans , and Sarcees became known as the Blackfoot Confederation , which spread havoc among all tribes of the West , much the same as the Iroquois of the East . The Sarcees now live on a reserve just south of Calgary , having dwindled down to less than one hundred and fifty , a sorry remnant of their former tribe of ten thousand strong . They will soon be extinct . In fact , there is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose photograph is shown on page 18 . The remainder of the tribe are mixed with Blackfoot . The Sarcees speak a language that no white man has ever learned . Even their allies , the Blackfeet , Bloods , and Sarcees , have never been able to grasp it . Hence , the Sarcees have been forced to become the linguists of the plains . Although they speak their own language among themselves , they are all able from early childhood to speak Blackfoot , and most of them speak Stony and Cree . Archdeacon Tims , who wrote a grammar of the Blackfoot language and put the language into writing ( syllabics ) , spent three years among the Sarcees with the same end in view , but he was forced to give it up . He still lives on the Sarcee Reserve , having been their missionary for thirty years ; but he has  | to converse with them in Blackfoot . The Sarcees have three gutturals for every vowel sound . One of these gutturals is pronounced high up in the throat , another deep down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two points . To complicate matters , they change these vowels in the throat without a break in the voice . And again they will take one vowel , " a , " for instance , and switch it back and forth through high , low , and intermediate without a break , as given words may require . If the slightest mistake is made in placing the guttural vowel in the part of the throat in which it belongs , the word may mean an entirely different thing . Fox Tail , the last pureblood Sarcee , retains the history of how the Sarcees happened to break away from their brethren , the Beavers of the North Country , and come south . The big parent tribe was crossing one of the immense northern lakes one winter 's day , when one of their women-folk noticed the antlers of a moose sticking out of the ice . She went over and struck the antlers with her ax , to see if they were shed or on the head of a frozen moose , which would make good food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split in half from one side of the huge lake to the other ? a distance of some miles . The noise was terrific , and the gap kept widening . All those on the south side of this parting of the ice ran south , while those on the north fled in that direction . The Sarcees kept rushing south until they reached the shore , many miles away . They never returned north . They continued southward until they met the Blackfeet . Although they ultimately allied themselves with the Blackfoot tribes , they chose a separate reserve at the Treaty of ' 77 , much against the wishes of the government authorities . But they believed that if they should be brigaded with the Blackfeet these lordly people would always look down upon them as inferiors.  | The Sioux on the western Canadian plains all came from the United States as refugees . The first bunch came over in 1862 after they had massacred five hundred white people at Redwood , Minnesota ? called the Minnesota Massacre . They are now scattered over six reservations in Manitoba and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further outbreaks . But these Sioux , now numbering more than one thousand , are the most industrious , self-reliant Indians in the Canadian Northwest . And they retain much of the Sioux spirit of independence . The second lot came over with Sitting Bull , following the Custer Massacre of 1876 . Sitting Bull and his legion roved the Canadian plains , gaunt and half-starved , for eight years before returning to the United States under promises of amnesty . But fifty families of his band remained in Saskatchewan , and they are now living on a small reservation near Moose Jaw . Sitting Bull , as many may know , was duped and murdered at the Standing Rock Agency , North Dakota , in December , 1890 . He had said to the American commissioners when they came up into Canada to meet and parley with him under the escort of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police : " God Almighty made me ; and he never made me an Agency Indian -- -And I will fight and die fighting before any white man can make me one . You come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our rights you would hang us like dogs . If I did not fight you , you would hate me . If you think I am a fool , you are a bigger fool than I am . Now I want you to go home ; and I want you to take it easy going back . " The Minnesota Massacre Sioux brought a little white baby into Canada with them ? one that one of the women had picked up out of the bloody mud and saved after its parents had been killed . This child grew up as an Indian , and is living at Amaranth , Manitoba , to-day , a man over sixty . His name is  | Ross Tanner . I have spent the last year trying to find out whether he has any surviving relatives in the States . When he reached the age of ten and found out that he was not an Indian , he ran away from the Sioux . He hid in badger holes during the day and traveled at night until he came across a roving band of half-breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is from the fact that he was given the job of curing the buffalo hides that he acquired the name Tanner . He is entirely illiterate , speaking only the colloquial English of the half-breed and being unable to read or write . Every now and then he journeys far ? to wherever I happen to be in the Northwest ? to find out whether or not I have located any of his relatives . The Assiniboines , the parent body of the Stonys , and themselves an offshoot of the Sioux , live on two reservations in Saskatchewan . Chief Carrythe-Kettle , head chief of the Assiniboines , died last February at the age of one hundred and seventeen on the Carry-the-Kettle Reserve near Indian Head , Saskatchewan . He was the oldest and most renowned pre-frontier chief surviving in the American West , having ruled his tribe for some forty years before the white man came . He was one of the few survivors of the historic smallpox epidemic at the beginning of the last century , which all but wiped out the tribe and caused the Stonys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic to me just two months before his death , he said that he and his father rode through camp after camp , along the Upper Missouri River , to find all of their occupants piled into decaying heaps , and dogs feeding on their bodies . The chief said that during this terrible scourge all the little orphan children in his camp would gather at sunset and climb to the top of a certain hill overlooking the camp . Here they would sit down in a circle and say to each other :  | " Let us cry . " As twilight grew into darkness , they would sit and weep for an hour or more , while the coyotes yelped and fought over the bodies of their parents a few hundred yards below . The Cree tribe is the largest in western Canada , and it is said to be the largest north of Mexico . They were originally a part of the Ojibway , or Chippewa , tribe . They migrated from the Montreal district about three hundred years ago and settled on the plains and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far better specimens than the Bush Crees . Closely allied with them are the Saulteaux ? really the same people who have acquired a different name since migrating West , and a different accent . The Crees inhabit every province west of Ontario , including British Columbia and the Northwest Territories , and it is the only tribe in the West which has that distinction . Their name is derived from the word " Cristeneaux , " given to them by the early French voyageurs ; and this word was latterly abbreviated to " Cris , " pronounced in French " Cree . " But the Crees refer to themselves as the Nehiyowuk ? " The Exact-Speaking People . " The Saulteaux are so called because they once resided on the Saulte . It is interesting to note that practically none of the Plains tribes refer to themselves by the name under which they are known to the white man . The only exception I know to this rule is that applying to the three Blackfoot tribes , who happened to be named by their head chief . The Cree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the white man 's language : " moccasin , " " squaw , " and " Eskimo . " Eskimo comes from the Cree word Iyeskimo ? " Eaters of Raw Flesh " ? the  | cognomen which they applied to these residents of the Far North . Squaw is derived from the Cree word Esquao , their term for woman , which means literally translated " the lowest of beings . " It might be mentioned here that Eskimos and Indians have always been enemies of each other , and have never intermarried , although they live very close to each other in the North Country , and meet and mingle at the trading posts . They have definite lines running from east to west , south of which no Eskimo ever trespasses , and north of which no Indian ever wanders . Some will wonder why the above Indian words mean so much when translated into English , That arises from the fact that the Algonquin languages are agglutinative ; that is , words meaning whole sentences are made by taking a root syllable from each word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show the brevity of these roots , and at the same time show why hyphens are always used in such Indian words and names , I shall give here the longest word in the Blackfoot language : **60;713;TOOLONG . This word means a whole paragraph . It will also be noticed in this word that certain letters do not occur in the Blackfoot language ; namely , 1 , b , r , d , f , j , z , or hard g . It is full of gutturals and very staccato . On the other hand , Sioux contains more of these consonant letters than any others , and it is full of c.h 's and sh 's . This is not an Algonquin characteristic , however ; as Chippewa contains all these letters except " r " , and it is full of " bungs " and " zoos . " The Algonquin tribes in the Canadian West are the Blackfeet , Bloods , Piegans , Crees , Saulteaux , and a few straggling Chippewas from Ontario . The Dakota , or Siouan , tribes are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe on the plains is the Sarcec the home of this big linguistic stock embraces t:he great North Country up to the Arctic Circle , Crossing the Rocky Mountains into British Columbia ? which is never referred to as western Canada , but as " The Coast " ? we come upon an entirely different set of Indians , Their customs , traditions , dress , and physical appearance are as different from those of the Plains Indians as black and white . They are of a short , stocky build , big-headed , powerful about the shoulders , and short of leg . Generations in the canoe have not given them the long , sinewy appearance of the foot and horse Indians of the prairies . They are intelligent , but their facial features are not so strong as those of the Plains tribes , Many of the tribes bear a strong resemblance to the Oriental . They belong to many tribes that have never been heard of by the Plains Indians ; and they represent four big linguistic stocks ; namely , the Salish , K.uawkiutl-Nootka , Tsimshian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought together for the first time in nearly fifty years , during which time they were purposely scattered over . widely separated reserves to insure peace and safety to the white settlers . By permission of the Government they journeyed to Calgary in order to  | take part in the stampede ? a week 's celebration in the Canadian Northwest . The Indians decided that while they were all together once again they would play a little joke on the white man , and at the same time have the fun of going out on one more war party before returning to their lonely reserves to live and die in the memories of the past . The head chiefs , Running Rabbit , Big Plume , Buffalo Child Long Lance , and White Head , held a council in Running Rabbit 's tepee , in which elaborate plans for the retaking of the city of Calgary from the white man were drawn up . On the following day they lined up two hundred warriors , many of whom carried human scalps dangling from their weapons , and led them galloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the seat of civic government . While their braves careered around the big building on horseback , they dashed into the city hall , took the mayor out of his chair , and installed one of their own chiefs , Running Rabbit , as mayor of the city of Calgary . They bound the mayor to a horse and took him to the center of the public square , and there , in front of several thousand citizens , they formally handed the city back into the hands of the white man and initiated Mayor George Webster as an honorary chief of the Alberta tribes ? with the Indian name of " Chief Crowfoot . " The mayor reciprocated by making Chief Running Rabbit mayor of Calgary for one month . The mob of white people cheered for fifteen minutes ? they came up and shook our hands and inquired if we were happy ? they had not believed that Indians were sufficiently humorous or original to play a joke like that . Some of the scenes of this affair are pictured in this number . Chief Running Rabbit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alive among the Plains tribes . In his last battle with the Crees and Assiniboines he had his head split open from between the eyes to the crown ' of his head ; he received a bullet through his chest and another that smashed his thigh , but he is still hale and hardy . In the big Indian massacre on the North Saskatchewan River in 1863 , he was responsible for saving the lives of practically the entire tribe of Black- feet . On the night before this massacre he dreamed of the defeat which lay before the Blackfeet , Bloods , Sarcees , and Piegans , and he advised the head chief to turn back . The chief told him that if he or any of his followers chose to turn back , they had might as well go home and " put on their wives ' dresses . " Running Rabbit , who was not then a chief , replied : " I am not married , but I will go home and put on a woman 's dress . " The head chief continued his advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the four allied tribes , believing in Running Rabbit 's " strong medicine , " turned back with him . On that same day the advance party ran into an ambuscade , about " two camps , " or forty miles , north of the present city of Saskatoon , and were practically annihilated . From that time on Running Rabbit 's fame as a medicine man spread among all tribes of the plains , and he subsequently became a great chief and medicine man whose prowess is still talked of daily among the Prairie tribes . Although the Indians of the older generation who were here before the white man came appreciate some of the better things that civilization has  | brought , they can not be said to be entirely pleased with the new era . They fret in their stolid way under the restrictions which now exist . They were rovers of the wide , open plains until a few years ago , and theywill never learn to like their present mode of existence ? where there is no game to hunt , no adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old people spend their waning days sitting in their tepees , going over their deeds of yesteryear , reminiscing back into those days that can never be again . It is pathetic to listen to some of these old people , quietly reviewing their plight . I have seen old Indians walking along the prairie with one hand over their mouth , singing their song of sadness : " Enepoka , where are all our old men to-day ; where are all our warriors ; why have fences come over our hunting grounds ? Enepoka , we are no longer men ; we are dying . " In the preceding paragraphs I have been speaking of the generation that was here before the white man came . The younger generation is groping between the old and the new way , rather dazed sometimes , but trying hard to comprehend things as they are , and to become " civilized . " The older people will soon die off , and then , without the haunting background of the freedom that was , the younger generation will perhaps go forward more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the civilization which will envelop and absorb them . But it is to be hoped that they will hold on to the true Indian character which is still possessed by their old people , and which is so easily lost , once an Indian has mixed with the lower elements of other races . In closing this article , I shall quote the concluding entreaty of all Blackfoot speeches : " Mokokit-ki-aekamimat ! " ( Be wise and persevere ! )  |
