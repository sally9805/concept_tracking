txt With coal bringing $20 a ton , more or less , and often unobtainable regardless of price , there is impatience with the usual weekly official report that up to Oct. 2 there had been mined 404,114,000 tons , against 352,794,000 last year . Why should an increase of 50,000,000 tons double the price , and who Is responsible , whatever the ex-. planation ? The first step is to ask what has become of the missing 50 , - 000,000 tons . It was said that the closing of navigation by ice would make the condition of the Northern States so desperate that they must be supplied first . It appears that during September the lake coal shipments were 4,138,583 tons , against 2,505,827 fast year . But for the year the.corresponding figures are 15,469,176 and 18,514,130 . In other words , the increase of shipments in September is less than the loss for the year . The situation of the Northern States was desperate , and is not yet entirely relieved , although supplies have been diverted to them liberally . It would seem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the fact is that they fell into a hole . The hole was the excess of consumption over production in 1919 , when the record of 1918 was reversed . The year 1918 was one of maximum production , and 30,000,000 tons was either added to stocks or burned . In 1919 this 30,000,000 tons disappeared , and 10 , - 000,000 tons more . That is , last year consumers used 40,000,000 tons out of stocks , instead of out of production . The excess of production this year of 50.000,000 tons over 1919 is explained by the fact that the production of 1919 was 96,540,000 tons below 1918 : 352,794,060 against 449,334,000 . Here are fluctuations enough to explain almost anything , but there are still clues for the coal Hawkshaws . The Consolidated Gas Company has 103,003 tons in reserve , and fourteen local public utilities have 441,545 . They have none too much , and they are taking more out of the hole in which 50,000,000 tons was lost to the view of the private . consumer . The coal dumped at five Atlantic ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first week of October was 26,361 tons . Much coal is used for bunkers , and the exports are larger than the above figures show . Nevertheless , the export of coal is not large enough to reduce the . 50,000,000 tons of lost coal very largely , to say nothing of making a dent rn the 404,114 , - 000 of total production . But the export coal disturbs the prices more than ' tile quantities . Notwithstanding the anxieties here , the foreign situation is even more desperate ,  --  and foreigners will pay anything that will produce the coal , instead of clamoring for cheap coal . The remaining mystery Is how the foreigners are able to get coal not obtainable for money here . The explanation in the coal trade ? is that those responsible for the regulation of the coal trade rejected the allotment of coal cars to the producers of contract coal  --  for which the price is moderate , but the coal unobtainable  --  and widened the allotment so as to allow the independents to share in , the supply of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an assessment of 4,000 cars daily was levied on- the railways to be allotted to all producers , under contract or not . Thus there was a reduction of the " contract coal and an increase of the " free " coal open to the highest bidder . The railways would have preferred ' supply cars to contract producers , for railways use contract coal mostly , and there even have been charges that th ? railways used their car control to supply themselves rather than the general market . The outlook is better than the prices indicate . There is not . much coal going at the nsurious prices , and it would take comparatively little more to take much off the peak of necessitous demand . The hole into which the 50 , - 000,000 tons fell ? is ' being ? filled , and soon will be overfilled . The deficiency of production due to transportation disability has ranged above 1919 , but is constantly falling . The labor shortage has been too great , due to the strikes , but that , too , is falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal supply are under too close observation to persist .
