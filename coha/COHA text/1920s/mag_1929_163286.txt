At New Richmond , Ohio , crowds lined the river banks . A shout went up when smoke was discernible in the distance . On Dam 35 the judges grew prematurely alert , fingered their watches . Up the river , belching like twin-snouted dragons , sloshing along at an uproarious nine-knots-per-hour came the doughty Sternwheelers Tom Greene and Betsy Ann at the grim finish of a 21-mile race upstream from Cincinnati . Long before they could see which was ahead the crowd could hear the roar of the laboring engines . Children cringed , fearing an explosion . Old rivermen felt young again at the familiar sound . <P> Past the finish line the packets steamed , engines wide open , passengers hullaba-looing . Spectators on the banks were still disputing the result when the ships , carried far upstream by their momentum , returned . The judges declared the Tom Greene had won by a few feet , repeating the performance of its sister ship the Chris Greene which defeated the Betsy Ann in last year 's first revival of an old-time race . <P> Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is descended from a long line of rivermen . His first mate , the only woman on the Ohio river to hold a pilot 's license , was his mother . <P> From New Orleans , heading for St. Louis 1,200 miles upstream , " out to beat the record of the Robert E. Lee , " sleek express cruiser Martha Jane and a smaller mahogany runabout called Bogie started up the tortuous Mississippi . The Robert E. Lee 's record , made in 1870 when she beat the Natchez and many a shiny dollar changed hands , was 90 hr. 30 min.
