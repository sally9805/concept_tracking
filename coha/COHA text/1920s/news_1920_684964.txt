txt Conditions in the exchange ? market on Wednesday were absolutely without precedent . Never before in the experience of dealers had rates undergone such wild gyrations in the course of a single day . They were literally at their wit 's end , as it was practically impossible for them to follow the course of the market during the , greater part of the day . At one and the same time widely varying rates were quoted in the same exchange . A typical case was that experienced by a broker , who at one time was in simultaneous communication on the telephone with three bankers . One quoted him $3.23 for sterling cables , another $3.27 and the third $3.30 , an extreme discrepancy of seven cents . The weakness of the market was pronounced from the very opening . Taking its cue from London , which cabled a severe drop in rates as compared with the previous close , the market started with demand sterling at ** an overnight decline of five and one-quarter cents . Thereafter , there was no let-up in the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after the noon hour . At this point there was a sudden transformation in the aspect of the situation . The London report that cotton imports were stopped because of the collapse in exchange was apparently garbled ; and a rumor was set afloat that an actual embargo had been imposed on the imports by the British Government . This , coupled with the wild rush of the shorts to cover , caused sterling to bound up to $3.31 . When denial of the rumor was received , the bearish forces again gained the ascendency . A few good-sized offerings put the sterling rate down to $3.25 , and then again to $3.1914 . Toward the close a steadier tone set in , and the finishing rate was several cents above the low record of $3.19 established during the day . Most of the other exchanges suffered declines which were more or less comparable with that in sterling . Of all the remittances lire showed the most conspicuous weakness , dropping at one stage below 19.00 lire to the dollar , which represented a loss of about 134 lire from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over half a franc to the low of about 15.12 per dollar . In the latter part of the day these exchanges experienced rallies along with sterling . Throughout the session marks by contrast with the rest of the list were comparatively firm , being quoted in the neighborhood of $.0103.
