txt Two murders , one in the Bronx , the other in ' Brooklyn , yesterday put two problems , as yet inexplicable , up to the New York police for solution . They could find no reason why an undersized , partly bald insurance collector in his middle thirties should have been pierced by four bullets fired , presumably , by three young men in a Bronx apartment courtyard about 8 o'clock last night . Nor could they understand why a man of 29 years was found , his head crushed in , and one eye gone , in a vacant lot on Albemarle Road , Brooklyn , yesterday morning . The . insurance collector was Louis Stabile , father of five children . He lived at 787 East 185th Street . The other was Frank , a truck driver , of 1,269 Rogers Avenue , Brooklyn . Stabile worked for the Prudential Insurance Company branch at 318 East Kingsbridge Road . At one time he had the collection route which included the big apartment building , holding fifty-four families , at 2.238 Adams Place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet it was from that building that he was emerging about 8 o'clock last night . The doors of the apartment open onto a courtyard , where cement and stone decorations give an appearance of Florentine luxury . One or two persons were passing in the street and others lolled at the windows opening onto the court . These heard the swift report of a pistol , fired four times . They saw Stabile fall and three young men run from the court . Stabile was dead . Three of the shots had pierced his body , the fourth his arm . The young men sprinted to the street , and turned north on Adams Place . At 183d Street they separated , two of them running east , one west . Patrolman Hulroyd of Bronx Park Station called Dr. Pennock of Fordham Hospital , but Stabile had died instantly . District Attorney John E. ' of Bronx County and Inspector John Duane in charge of Bronx detectives , came to the scene to start an inquiry . The police found a .32-calibre pistol in the gutter at 184th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30.50 in cash and ' a check for $25 in his pockets , which was evidence that robbery was not the cause of the shooting . Nobody in the apartment on Adams Place could be found who knew him . Part of a sleeve button from his coat found in the hallway leads to the belief that at least one shot had been fired before he left the building . Persons who saw the three young men running away described two of them as wearing blue suits , the third a gray suit . All were well dressed , it was said . Stabile himself was rather shabbily dressed . Passer-by Hears Groans . The mystery had been preceded by about fourteen hours by the discovery of the truck driver , dying ' in a Brooklyn lot . A passer-by going along Abemarle Road at 2:30 o'clock yesterday morning , was startled to hear muffled groans at the corner of Veronica Place . He looked into the lot , saw a dark form lying among the long weeds , ... nd then called the Snyder Avenue Police Station . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found a young man lying in a pool of blood . The weeds were tramped down as if a number of persons had dragged him in from an automobile parked at the edge of the street . The man was still alive , but he died less than on the theory that might have met his death in a speak-easy . They pointed out that when a fatality occurs in a speak-easy row it is customary for the proprietors to carry the body to some distant spot to avoid police action against their places . Such a theory explains the trampled ground in the lot near where the body was found , they said . half an hour later at the Kings County Hospital . The detectives who began working on the case at once were as a loss to explain the murder , and for a time they could not establish the victim 's identity . Finally , in the middle of the afternoon , James of 1,269 Rogers Avenue , Brooklyn , went to the morgue and identified the man as his brother , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no possible motive for his brother 's having been killed , for as far as he knew the dead man had no enemies . He was a truck driver by occupation , his brother said , although he had not recently been working . The detectives were astonished at the apparent brutality of the murderer . The dead man 's head had been partly crushed by some heavy instrument  --  the police think an iron or steel bar  --  and his face had been badly cut up . Most of his clothes were in shreds , as if his death had been preceded by a hard fight . The police last night were working
