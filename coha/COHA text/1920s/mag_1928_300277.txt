INNOCENT BYSTANDING-Frank Sullivan - Liveright ( $2 ) . <P> Like most innocent and hence significant humorists of the printed page , Frank Sullivan makes no blatant wisecracks in public places . He is an amazingly quiet Irishman , just short of plump . His occasional spoken words make sense and everybody likes him . <P> Last spring , he wrote for the New York World an obituary for famed Nora Bayes , which ended : " I do n't know where she is now , but I do know that whoever is with her is having a swell time . " That applies well to Frank Sullivan , whether you are with him or reading his works . <P> Many of the pieces in Innocent Bystanding have appeared in Mr. Sullivan 's column in the World and in the New Yorker . He takes a news item , a musical instrument ( the zither , for example ) , an actress , an animal or the income tax and starts telling about it . Suddenly the reader becomes aware that Mr. Sullivan has left the ground and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a specimen loping on the subject of Joseph Twiggle , dean of New York street cleaners : <P> Mr. Twiggle was in his study when I called . . . . There was a piece of ice autographed by President Grant in a glass case . <P> " President Grant slipped on that , " Mr. Twiggle explained . " Here 's a piece of snow that snow collectors have offered me a pretty penny for , but I would n't any more sell it than I would sell my right ear . " <P> " Let me see your right ear , Mr. Twiggle ? " I requested . <P> " Gladly , " said Mr. Twiggle . <P> The ear proved to be in none too good condition . <P> " I think you 're making a big mistake , " I told him . " I think the snow is worth more than that ear . You 'd be a fool not to sell . After all , you 'd have your other ear . . . . " <P> Other innocent lopings : " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , " The Temptation of Anthony , " " The Origin and Growth of the Tiller Girls . " <P> Nobody of any importance will be annoyed if you put Innocent Bystanding in his or her Christmas sock or stocking .
