txt ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE DENIES That Its Leaders Are Cool to Bryan and That It Prefers Republicans . To the Editor of The New York Times : As General Superintendent of the AntiSaloon League of America , please permit me to reply to statements in the news columns of your issue of last Saturday . Your correspondent stated , under the heading " Antagonism to Bryan , " that a coolness has arisen between Mr. Bryan and leaders of the league , and that a majority of our leaders think Mr. Bryan 's usefulness has ceased . These statements are entirely without foundation . There is only the best of feeling between the national officers of the Anti-Saloon League of America and Mr. Bryan . The further statement in your article that the Anti-Saloon League is more in favor of the Republican Party as a party than the Democratic Party is also untrue . The AntiSaloon League of America continues ifs historic policy , upon which it has won its battles for thirty years , in standing not for any party as a party , but for dry candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their party affiliation . P. A. BAKER , General Superintendent the Anti-Saloon League of America . Westerville . Ohio , July 2 , 1923.
