Leonid Krassin , bade the party bon voyage and bon chance . <P> It was reported that the French Ambassador had been instructed by Premier Herriot to impress upon the Bolshevik Government the necessity of paying its Imperial debt to France . Hostile wags in Paris thought , if he persisted , il va revenir de suite du pays rouge . <P> For three days a train chugged Ambassador Jean Herbette to Moscow , where he was met by Chief Protocol Floninsky , the French Charg d'Affaires and a guard of honor and was conducted to the French Embassy to the strains of a military band playing the Toreador 's March from Carmen .

We are anxious to restablish our mutual relationship . We are confronted with great difficulties , but I consider that there are no questions before us which will be hard to solve , should there be shown good will by both sides . " <P> He told them that before leaving France , he had been almost mobbed by hundreds of poor men and women who had invested money in Russian bonds , and who would never consent to forfeit them . The Ambassador continued : <P> " The recognition of her debts by Russia would return the sympathies of these poor people to the Soviet Union . " <P> A journalist was emboldened to remark that Russia could not pay her debts without first obtaining a loan . M. Herbette rejoined : " The recognition of her debts would help Russia to restablish her credit . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
