txt In front of 3,000 athletes of ? twenty-seven nations at the Olympic stadium this afternoon a white-clad Belgian swordsman swore before his King ? that all assembled would take part in the games in a chivalrous spirit for the honor of their countries . As he made the vow he stood on a little platform facing the King , with right arm raised and in his left hand the staff of a great silk flag of black , red and gold , the colors of Belgium , and as he finished speaking the other twenty-six national flags in the background were dipped in honor of the King and the vow just taken . That was the real opening of the seventh Olimpiad . A few minutes before , the King , speaking from his box , had declared the games open and Cardinal Mercier of Malines , who sat red-robed at the King 's left hand , had given the . Benediction .

The national character as well as the national colors showed in each team . There were some , like the Spaniards , in their red and gold , who threw up their right arms in greeting as they passed the King . The Italians shouted like one man , " Long live the King l " The French , who marched with military precision , threw out their right arms in front of them , while the Americans and British , composedly as is their wont , contented themselves with " eyes ' left " as they faced the royal stand .

But the flights to Chili and Japan being somewhat beyond the birds ' ability , they are carrying their messages to lofts near embassies of the further countries .

Their delegation of 290 was the largest in the field with the exception of the Belgians , whose ranks , swelled by scores of officials , numbered 301 . Under the warm sunshine of a perfect day the beflagged field was thronged with Olympic competitors , who ranged in color from the pale blond men and women of the Northland through all shades of brown of the Japanese , turbaned Hindus and fezzed Egyptians to the almost jet black of some of the Americans .

Two flags , the German and Austrian , which flew over the stadium In the Sixth Olympiad at Stockholm , were missing , and these countries , barred from participating in the meet , as were all enemies of the Entente Powers in the war , had no representation either in the arena or in the , diplomatic boxes , The Russian flag ale() was missin . In their places , however , Were the athletes and flags of a nation newborn o the war , Czechoslovakia , replacing Bohemia , , whose athletes , though . then listed separately , had to march just behind the Austrians at Stockholm. ?

Signified not only the formal opening of the Olympic games , but the comPetiOn of a task by Belgium , which , undertaken at a difficult time in her history , seemed almost impossible of cdneemmating .
