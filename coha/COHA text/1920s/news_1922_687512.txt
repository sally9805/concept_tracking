txt A certain builder today has at his back " a great gang of men . " They are first class workmen and intensely interested in their . job . Often they stay on duty ten hours a day . They are " enthusiastic as a football team . " Much of their work is intricate , yet they score remarkable records for speed . With many thousands of feet of flooring to put down , for example , they have gone for weeks at the rate of 7,000 feet of forms and floors every three and a half days . Many are Italians , and they are a versatile " crew. ? ' Does a foreman want a cement finisher or a steamfitter , an engineer or a blacksmith , he calls for " Tony " or " Joe , " and out steps the man he needs . The men know their jobs are secure . They are contented and well paid . This " happy family " is the outcome of a full year of warfare with the labor unions . The labor leaders denounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have tried in every conceivable manner , direct and indirect , to hamper this builder and compel him to unionize . The story of his battles with these unionists is a tale of nerve and tactful patience in the face of the possible loss of tens of thousands of dollars . There were 41 bricklayers on the walls ; 40 were members of the union , one was not . For weeks the unionists tried to " get " or " frame " or somehow get rid of that one man . ' Once completely unionized , the- builder would no longer have been in control of his own business . The presence of the one non-union man made this an open-shop and secured the builder his liberty . Labor , delegates came every day to threaten or cajole the men . At last the 40 men did quit , expecting to have the builder at their mercy in a few hours . But he adhered to his determination to stand by that one man , in spite of their abusive threats to shut off his labor supply . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been engaged . One man came back that afternoon and replaced " the pier . The story spread rapidly over the city . Pluck and sqUare dealing had their reward . In three - days 56 brickmasons were on the walls , including ten of the quitters who were glad to return . Again , there were 27 carpenters on the building . They worked under individual yerbal contracts at 90 cents an hour . They were to have hours off withotit prejudice any time in the week and to work at their own option on Saturlay afternoons . They themselves arranged for a nine-lour day with flat rate for overtime . All went well for a . while . Then appeared the labor delegates with a dozen letnands . The non-union men must be discharged . Tre ) uilder must hold back the fines of the union men who lave been working , on this " unfair job . " , Some of the Ines would amount to $100 each . One hoisting engineer with five children must pay $200 . The builder refused under any circumstances to ac:ede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Union men might work on his job , and non-union men ; he cared not at all whether or not they belonged to the trades union so long as they did their work properly ; but the union men should have no monopoly-on his job . Persistently the labor leaders kept after the men . Bad feeling developed . Finally the carpenters on a Saturday so botched the building of some concrete forms that the work had to be done over , and on Monday they struck . In two days 40 men applied for the vacant places , and the builder managed to " carry on . " Tact and patience bilped him . One man , for example , was so weak and emaciated he could hardly handle a hammer . Without work for six months , destitute , with a big family , he was not physically fit to toil . The builder advanced him money day by day . He is now one of the most active men in the force . Thus the employer builds up his " gang . " These delegates tried many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalize Min somehow for his audacity in undertaking to fight the unions . For example , the bids for plastering were very high . He rejected them all . Then five contractors , all strangers , without solicitation , submitted bids so low that he became suspicious . Investigation showed them all to be associated and almost beyond doubt to represent really the unions . Experienced builders well know the game probably intended in this case  --  let the owner furnish the materials and advance money as the work progresses ; then by collusion the contractors would stop paying the men for a few weeks and quit the job without warning . The owner would have to make , good the men 's " losses , " so that his costs would be quite high enough when he got to the end of his plastering . This builder avoided the trap ; he hired his own men , foreman and all , at 90 cents an hour , and saved himself large amounts both of money and trouble . Several of the men at the outset were not A-1 plasterers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents an hour to put on the " scratch coat . " Today they are . his loyal friends and supporters . That trap was tried many . times , as by the marble men , for instance . But he was wary . He kept clear . The full tale would involve manifold repetition both of how he evaded the fake bidders and how he defied the union delegates . This man  --  who happens to be both the builder and the owner of this large structure  --  has been waging a 12-months ' war against labor union monopoly and tyranny . Actually the issue involved is not the relatively minor one of a single million-dollar job ; it is the greater issue of the public welfare . A closed shop , in which no non-union man can work even at union wages , invariably means waste , extortion , the end of competition , artificial limitation of output , absolute dictation to employers and the public at large . This builder has been fighting for what should be a fundamental right in every American community . The right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally recognized . But every man must be guaranteed the right to work and to market ijs labor without hindrance or compulsion . The closed shop denies that right , and the closed shop must go .
