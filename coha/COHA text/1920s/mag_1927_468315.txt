THERE are times when , as a weekly journalist watching the daily press , I am tempted to write that the most numerous and active criminals in America are the officials sworn to uphold the laws of the several States and the nation . If one were to take at its face value half of what one hears about the great army of prohibition enforcers the statement would be true . I am ready , however , to change it to read that by far the most dangerous criminals we have in America are the officials who in growing number openly disregard or violate the laws . There are many of our fellow-citizens who lie awake nights over the " red " menace , the alleged growth of communism in America , and shiver whenever they read of Socialist gatherings to hear sentiments which these timid souls believe to be aimed at the forcible overthrow of the government of the United States . I venture to say that all these " red " movements in America do not weigh in the balance in comparison to the injury done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order by men in uniform or officials of high position in Washington or the several States . And I insist that not one of the numerous studies now being made of the so-called crime wave by official , semi-official , or private bodies will give a complete picture of lawlessness in America which does not include therein a survey of the unceasing examples of official misbehavior . For there is a widespread and often justified popular belief that especially those officials directly charged with law enforcement are utilizing their positions in order to feather their own nests or to put themselves above and beyond the law . Who can measure the effect of the example of the two Harding Cabinet officials declared by the Supreme Court to have been guilty of selling out the interests of the United States , and of the Ex-Attorney-General of the United States defending himself in the dock against well-grounded charges of corruption and refusing to take the stand in his own behalf ? Can any half-educated Communist in a hundred speeches conceivably do as much to destroy people 's faith in the American republic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indiana in Atlanta Penitentiary for fraud , or the head of the United States Veterans ' Bureau in Leavenworth prison for robbing the Government and cheating its pitiable soldier wards ? What does the average American think when he reads of the conviction for official wrong-doing of the Alien Property Custodian ; when he learns of another Governor ordered by the Supreme Court of his State to return to the treasury of the State $800,000 held to be unjustly taken and justly due by him ; of the present Governor of Indiana involved in a far-reaching scandal ; of a former Governor of Texas successfully impeached , and then conspiring with a successor , his own wife , to empty the prisons by an indefensible abuse of the pardoning power , to say nothing of wholesale charges of corruption in State contracts ? But I do not wish to dwell in this article upon this long list of high officials who are guilty morally or legally or both ; nor even to touch upon the demoralizing defiance of the Constitution by the Executive and the Congress , who refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some millions of our fellow citizens are illegally disfranchised because of their color and are thereby convinced that even the Constitution may be violated freely by those who have the power and the duty to enforce it . There will not even be space to touch upon the deliberate refusal of Presidents Harding and Coolidge to carry out that provision of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 which orders the Executive to give notice of the termination of certain articles or provisions in commercial treaties to which the United States is a party . These articles restrict the right of the United States to impose discriminating customs duties on imports entering this country in foreign bottoms and to levy discriminating tonnage dues on foreign vessels entering our ports . In this ease these Presidents deliberately refused to enforce one of the laws they solemnly swore to uphold . Nor shall I rehearse again the endless cases of local officials who have set themselves above the Constitution in matters of civil rights such as the holding of legal meetings ; the freedom of the press , the free expression of private opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dwell rather upon some of the official lawlessness and criminality which touches many people at close range . II Let us take , for example , what is known as the " third degree . " It is a *Bee article by this writer In Harper'r Maccrine for Sept , 1925 : " The New Fight for Old Libertine. " notorious fact that the grossest brutalities and tortures are deliberately and systematically applied in the police stations of the United States in order to obtain confessions and that in this respect we have hardly advanced from the dark ages . The newspapers constantly report these happenings ; every police reporter knows of their regular occurrence . Not only the criminals , but masses of innocent people know of these incidents and are aware that they not only contravene rights guaranteed by the Constitution , but that they are permitted or encouraged by mayors , commissioners of safety , and chiefs of police . Within the last few years this practice has , I believe , greatly increased ; at least more and more instances of it find their way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police stations into other branches of the public service . In its every aspect the " third degree " is utterly repulsive and contrary to every dictate of justice . Every prisoner is presupposed innocent until found guilty ; he is entitled to the benefit of a lawyer ; and the law does not permit his examination without the presence of counsel if he asks for an attorney . The arresting authorities are merely charged with the custody of the prisoner ; his conviction either through voluntary confession , or because of legal proof of his guilt , is the duty of the prosecuting attorney and the judge and jury , toward whom the police have no other responsibility than to turn over such evidence as in their judgment warranted the prisoner 's being charged with crime . It is also the sacred duty of the arresting officer to hold the body of his prisoner inviolate . The Constitution furthermore requires that there shall be no " cruel or unusual punishments . " It meant , of course , cruel or unusual punishments instituted by statutes , or local regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not in law the " third degree . " Nor is the duress practiced to be justified by the consequent unravelling of certain crimes , or the fact that many subjected to it are hardened , brutal criminals whom the police have every right to fear and hate . The Inquisition may have had a few honest successes , but that it doomed innocents without number the world now believes . When men are tortured for days and days , when they are denied sleep for seventy-two hours , and food for longer periods , are refused access to a toilet for days , and during all that time are steadily beaten with a rubber hose , the strongest character will break down and confess to anything to stop his agony . Theodore Dreiser , the novelist , once asked an Italian boy in the death-house at Sing Sing how he came to confess . Pantano replied : " Easy to ask that . Harder to answer . You 've never been grilled by a mob of detectives . They had me in the room thirty hours . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished another jumped on me . They hammered , hammered , hammered . I got tired and faint . Pretty soon I would have sworn to anything , to assassination , just to get a rest . " " So you just caved in and said yes ? " " That 's right . I just wilted and yessed everything . " Here we have the complete picture of the essential cowardliness of the system . Twenty-one men against one , attacking him hour after hour without mercy . That such happenings can take place is proof positive of the way the work of a policeman inevitably breaks down his manliness and sense of decency when he is entrusted with unlimited power over the person of another and is given officially to understand that he may go to any lengths in committing crime in order to detect crime . Especially great is the temptation to resort to the " third degree " because the average American detective is wholly without any scientific training for his work . He becomes a detective because of physical gallantry , or luck in making some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman he is no different from any worker of a similar economic and educational status ; he is surely never instructed in the rights and privileges of the citizenry . If he can pound a confession out of a man , it saves endless trouble in bringing about a conviction ; it insures that conviction , and it results in a favorable entry upon the detective 's service record , for not merely arrests but convictions count heavily in the policeman 's favor . If proof of the illegality of all this obtaining of confessions by duress is needed , it is furnished by decisions of the two highest courts on this Continent : the Supreme Court of Canada and that of the United States . On June 17 of this year the Chief Justice of Canada ordered , for the Supreme Court , a new trial for Joseph Sarkey , an Indian , convicted of murder at Prince Rupert. , R. C. This man was found guilty because the police handed in a written confession " obtained only on a fourth questioning to which the accused was subjected on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the proof of the voluntary character of the accused 's statement to the police , which was put in evidence against him , is most unsatisfactory . . . No particulars are vouchsafed as to what transpired at any of the three previous ' interviews , ' and but meager details are given of the process by which the written statement ultimately signed by the appellant was obtained . " it will be noticed that there arc no allegations by the court that force was used or brutalities were resorted to . It is not alleged that the prisoner was starved , or tortured , or denied food and sleep . It is enough for this great English-inspired court that there was not adequate police proof that the confession was entirely voluntary . The chief press service of Canada none the less stated that " the Supreme Court of Canada to-day set the stamp of its disapproval on any police methods in Canada savoring of the ' third degree ' ? although the term itself is not used . " Commenting on this the Toronto Mail correctly declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British system of justice .. . . It is always to be condemned as an alien weapon whose use will never be tolerated in Canada , "  - -  a slap at the United States as direct as it is deserved . As for our own Supreme Court , it , too , came to the rescue of an alien . Ziang Sun Wan was just a poor Chinaman charged with the murder of three Chinamen . He denied it , but , under the shadow of the American capitol , the police tortured him in his room in a hotel by day and by night , " hurling questions , demands , affirmations at him . " For seven whole dreadful days this lasted , Then , on the eighth , he was taken to the scene of the crime and there examined and cross-examined for ten consecutive hours . Not until the ninth day at 5:30 in the morning was he taken to a police station and formally placed under arrest . All day long the gruelling continued . On the tenth day he was again taken to the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the eleventh day , his spirit broke ; his suffering was so great that he confessed the crime , only to retract the confession as soon as he could . Nevertheless he was convicted . Justice Brandeis , for the Supreme Court , declared , of course , that " the alleged oral statement and the written confession should have been excluded . " Ziang Sun Wan is only one man out of thousands . The prisons are full of men who , both innocent and guilty , are there because of confessions wrung from them by methods absolutely forbidden by law and equity . It is no defense and no excuse that many guilty or depraved creatures are thus deservedly landed in jail . The law is flaunted and degraded when even the guilty are convicted by lawless methods . Unfortunately , the Supreme Court could not order the prosecution of the torturing police officials ; nobody else did . Probably they are still in office . Unfortunately , too , the press and the public in America are so little informed or interested that no American journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toronto Mail , that the " third degree " will be stamped out in the United States . Who can believe , for instance , that the commissioner of police in New York City will pay any attention to views of the Supreme Court of the United States ? Let us inquire , " If you approve of what the gunmen did on this occasion , there is no doubt that they will recognize you as their champion . " Thus wrote Commissioner George V. McLaughlin , head of the New York police , in reply to a polite note from the writer of this article asking for the facts in regard to the injuries to the Wallon gang of thieves , who were captured in the Owl Club in New York while " holding up " that place . The New York Evening Post and Times reported specifically that the men were surprised and made no resistance , the former stating that " they waited peacefully for Patrolman Green to descend to the dance floor , line them up , unlock the door , and lead them out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the four men were arraigned in the West Side Court their faces were puffed and bruised , so swollen , in fact , that they could hardly see or speak . " Confirmation of this was afforded by photographs of the men in the Daily Mirror . Naturally I wished the official side of the case ? only to be told that Policeman Green " saved his own life , and probably the lives of some of the guests , as the prisoners , relying on their superior numbers , attempted to overpower the officer . " This courteous commissioner , who has now retired to private life amid the encomiums of the daily press , declared that the writer could not " in good faith give publicity to the story , " although it had already appeared in the newspapers quoted above . A letter to the District Attorney , Joel II . Banton , only brought out the fact that he , too , believed that the policeman had merely done his duty and that he was opposed to all lawlessness in police stations . Unfortunately for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on parole to John J. Molloy of the Welfare League Association . He visited them immediately after their arrest . He was so shocked by their condition that he immediately notified the Society of Penal Information , whose representative , William B. Cox , accompanied Mr. Molloy to the jail and certified that Wallon and Abrahams had " lacerated head and bad body bruises , Chrusario fractured ribs , fractured arm , lacerated head and temple , and body bruises , and Reggione lacerated head , finger and leg , and body bruises , " while O'Brien ? what 's in a name ? ? got off with only a slight black eye . It must be admitted that if all those injuries were the work of a single policeman with a revolver in his hand , it indicated rather remarkable physical vigor and energy on Mr. Green 's part and amazing inefficiency on the part of the reporters . The five prisoners , stated by the Society , with the exception of O'Brien , to have " presented a most frightful appearance , " were so unkind , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , it appears , with all official gentlemanliness " jumped upon their bodies from a table or desk while they were prone upon the floor . " When the hospital surgeons were finally called the police refused to accede to the surgeons ' request that the men be at once removed to a hospital , and they were kept in their cells and compelled to appear in court the next day . A committee of four men , including Messrs . Molloy and Cox , together with a former assistant district attorney , Robert H. Elder , and Louis Fabricant ? the two latter members of a committee of the New York County Lawyers ' Association charged with investigating police beatings ? called upon the Police Commissioner . They were received with about the same courtesy extended to my written inquiry ; Mr. Elder was charged with being there " simply because he was making money out of criminals " Finally this polite official said that the case would probably come to his attention in due order and that he would then investigate it . A visit to the District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of his opposition to the lawlessness in the enforcement of the law and sent a surgeon to examine the men . This medical man confirmed the report of the injuries given above . But to date neither the District Attorney nor any other official appears to have done anything to uphold the righteousness and the majesty of the law by bringing the detectives to trial . The Walton gang went to Sing Sing . Who cares if injustice was done to a gang caught red-handed ? I have given this case in detail because it brings out so clearly the usual attitude of the higher-up officials the country over in the matter of police crime . The critic is abused and the guilty are not punished , unless they happen to come before an exceptional judge , which merely increases the public belief that the law enforcers are themselves violators of the law and entirely beyond its reach . Of course no New York police official can truthfully pretend that the " third degree " is not in constant use . As I write I have before me thirty-three other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ? necessarily superficial perusal of the files of the last few years . A precisely similar case to that of the Wallon gang was that of the Oberst gang . They named a police inspector as having told his men " to stick some hairpins into them until they 're within two inches of their lives , " and identified five detectives as having administered the rubber hose , that favorite police weapon which hurts more than a billy or club , yet leaves no marks . Several of these policemen were promoted for their activities in this case . But when the gang was taken to court a mistrial occurred ; juror number eight asked for his relief and obtained it on the ground that " the story of police brutality in this case has become so revolting that I can not stand it any longer . " These cases do not all rest upon the uncorroborated assertions of the prisoners . For instance , on March 24 , 1921 , Judge Charles C. Nott in sentencing Policeman Cornelius J. Flood for manslaughter in the second degree for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd of eight or ten boys ? " some in short pants , " declared that " the verdict was one much needed in the community . . Only the other day a defendant who was arraigned before me had two ribs broken and his head cut open . He received these injuries at the time of his arrest . . . . If police officers can not keep order without resorting to undue and unwarranted violence on their own part , if they have to break the law themselves to preserve the law , then the police force is a failure . " Excellent words ! And if they are true , about every police force in the country is condemned by them . Judge Nott is by no means the only New York magistrate who has acted . On the very day of January , 1922 , when Commissioner Enright ( Mr. McLaughlin 's predecessor ) denounced those who said that the " third degree " was habitually administered , Magistrate Corrigan ordered the arrest of Patrolman Patrick Lennon for beating Owen Watkins , a seaman , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots and bruises from his neck to his heels . His body gives every evidence of the absolute proof that he has been terribly beaten . The officer comes here and then commits perjury . In my judgment not only Officer Lennon proved himself a liar , but a poor liar . " In 1924 Magistrate Corrigan had before him a newspaper carrier who had been sobadly beaten by two policemen that he had to be assisted into court . But when the uniformed assailants were arraigned in court they were discharged by another magistrate " for lack of evidence . " This is a familiar happening . If a police victim " squeals " he is promptly notified by the police to move on to some other residence under penalty of more trouble and interference with his business . Respectable persons who have been the victims of police brutality are the very ones most difficult to induce to testify ; they want to be let alone . Magistrate Corrigan is also of the opinion that the beating of suspects " is largely due to failure to use legitimate detective methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , in contradiction of the several police commissioners , to be " a wide-spread practice " in New York . Blackjacks , he asserted , " are systematically soaked in water , softening their surface so that the punishment does not lacerate the skin . " He dwelt on the fact that there was undue protection of the rights of defendants in the courts , which infuriates alike the police and the prosecutors . The remedy is , of course , not the " third degree " but a change in legal procedure . Of course if a New York police commissioner really wished to find out the facts he could simply send for the police reporters . One of these , Mr. A. C. Sedgwick of the Times , has just written for The Nation a picture of a scene he himself by accident witnessed in which three prisoners were treated in this fashion : The " shellaein ' " has started . Blow after blow from the rubber hose , blackjacks , and night-sticks . The prisoners fall to the floor . The blood pours from their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in a white rage , look at them . The door opens . A young policeman in uniform pukes his head in . " You fellers is easy with ' em , " he says . " Is that so ? " roars a detective and kicks a prisoner in the face , pulls him to his feet , props him against the desk , then with the butt end of his revolver makes a gash in his head . The three prisoners go to the hospital . As Mr. Sedgwick points out , " as representatives of law and guardians of society they the police instil into the class of offenders contempt of law and hatred for society . The crooks believe them no different from themselves ; they just happen to be on the other side of the fence . " This abuse has not , of course , ceased with the latest change in police commissioners in New York . On May Si George Pons complained to Commissioner Warren that when he reported the murder of a friend he was beaten for an entire night and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two days later he was discharged from a police court as innocent . His appeal for an inquiry and punishment of the guilty will have no effect if the usual precedents are followed . He got off well , for he was only temporarily crippled . Others have received fractured skulls . One Krauss , arrested in Jamaica on suspicion , was found to be entirely innocent , but the rubber hose , used while a police captain looked on , put out the sight of his left eye ? nobody punished and no redress . That fear of the " third degree " is sometimes the cause of crime is clearly illustrated by the case of Luther Boddy , a negro boy , who killed two policemen when they sought to arrest him in New York in 1922 . Careful inquiry by a responsible and experienced New York editor , and by representatives of one of the chief organizations for the protection of the negro , brought out the fact that Boddy was again and again arrested on suspicion and invariably " grilled . " Prior to his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was confined to his bed for a week . He declared that he had not meant to kill the policemen , but that the impulse to get rid of them was born of a sudden feeling that he could not again go through the " third degree . " A coloredman Was stopped on the street soon after and beaten up in a gratuitous effort to get him to tell of some of Boddy 's crimes . Still another proof of the fear engendered by the " third degree " was afforded shortly after the Boddy case by that of William Hoey , " wanted " for shooting a policeman . He travelled to Sing Sing in order to induce the Catholic chaplain of that prison , Father Cashin , to go with him to New York to protect him when he surrendered to the police . When he was finally brought to a police station the press reported that the captain in charge said to the policemen who were lined up in front of him : " Now , boys , you must n't touch this skunk ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Commissioner has not moved as to the " third degree , " it is worth while recording that on August 13 , Mr. Warren announced that he would take drastic action against reckless shooting and crimes of violence by the police . In the next week two innocent citizens were killed by police bullets recklessly fired in the streets and one detective , mistaken for a " Red , " had his skull fractured by two brother policemen because he had a revolver in his hand . Iv Lest it be thought that the " third degree " is a peculiarly New York custom , it may be well to point out that police scandals of first magnitude , involving turpitude in addition to the " third degree , " have been reported of late years from such divergent places as Seattle , San Francisco , New Orleans , Chicago , East St. Louis , Pittsburgh , and Wichita , Kansas . In Seattle , the confessions of the chief of police for the years 1922-26 have been published in the Seattle Union and Record . One of the devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cell . When the current is turned on , he said , " sparks fly and the prisoner leaps , screaming in agony , into the air . . . . It is not fatal , its effects are not lasting , and it leaves no marks . " A method " highly recommended by the police of other cities " he described as follows : The prisoner is given a heavy iron ball and told to place it in a slot in the end of his cell . This slot , they show him , is opened by a trigger from which depends a length of stout cord . The prisoner is then bound and thrown on the floor in such a manner that his head is under the slot . One of his legs then is lifted at right angles to his body and the release cord is tied to his foot . So long as he can keep the leg upright he is in no danger . While he is kept in this position , the prisoner is questioned , the police commenting at intervals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aching leg upright . Prisoners sometimes become unconscious through fear and pain . The " catch " of the plan is that , while he is being bound , a detective has removed the shot and has put in its place a rubber ball ! In 1922 , the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners of East St. Louis reduced the chief of police , the chief of detectives and seven other officials to the rank of patrolmen , suspended them for thirty days , and requested their resignations . They all took part in giving the " third degree " to John Campanella , an Italian arrested on suspicion that he knew about the killing of another Italian in his saloon . After he had died from the " third degree " beatings his body was hung up by the neck in his cell so as to make it appear that he had committed suicide , but a coroner 's physician found no evidence of strangulation . In Chicago the " third degree " is always endemic . The most striking example of it of late was afforded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School in the Frank murder case . Before the two youthful criminals , Leopold and Loeb , were discovered , the police used the rubber hose unmercifully upon these two young teachers of one of the most respected schools in Chicago in order to make them confess . There is no record that these two innocent young men obtained any redress for their barbarous treatment at the hands of the law which they will hardly respect hereafter . Since then the suicide in the county hospital of a once-respected physician was investigated by a Chicago coroner with the result that the police were charged with the responsibility for his fractured skull , his black eyes , and the bruises all over his body . In Indianapolis a citizen is advertising in the press that there were 22,325 arrests in 1926 and only 7,518 convictions . " What possible good , " he asks , " can be expected from this annual crop of 14,000 or more ' innocent arrests ' ? Is it not reasonable to suppose that they will always think of , and speak of the city , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and ' rotten ' ? " In Wichita , Kansas , the police have gone so far in their extra-legal measures that , after a newspaper campaign led by Ex-Governor Henry J. Allen , who is facing a libel suit for $500,000 for charging a certain official with administering the " third degree , " thirty-seven of the leading lawyers have organized to " de-Russianize the police " of this American city . These members of the bar charge that innumerable people arrested on suspicion of petty offenses are finger-printed and photographed and their pictures and finger-prints retained by the police after their complete innocence has been proved ; they assert that the legal rights to release on bond in certain cases , and to the services of an attorney , are systematically violated by the police , many of whom have only " a hazy idea of their duties and limitations . " In one case they entered a house without warrant , broke open a trunk , compelled an innocent woman to dress in their presence , and falsely arrested her for harboring a criminal . Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guilty ought to be prosecuted civilly and criminally . Again , the lawyers cite as merely 11-lustrative of regular Wichita police practice the arrest of a man who had been out of work for months when on his way to a newly-acquired job . For three days he was kept incomunicado , not being allowed even to notify his family of his whereabouts . his family was driven nearly wild with anxiety before he was found to be absolutely innocent ? but he lost his new job . Being out of work he doubtless can not sue the police , who should be held accountable in every case of false arrest . As for holding prisoners incomunicado , this custom , borrowed from old Europe , is , of course , beyond defense . It carries with it the admission that the police wish to take extra-legal advantage of the prisoner before he can obtain counsel , the service of the writ of habeas corpus , etc . This Wichita uprising is the only hopeful occurrence it is possible to report in connection with this subject . Its protesting lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar and the judiciary of the large cities would arouse themselves , enlist the services of the press , and announce their determination to prosecute every police official who deems himself superior to the law , the practice could be stopped overnight . Judge Thomas T. C. Crain has suggested a simple remedy ? that no confession made to the police shall be admitted as evidence unless made in the presence of the man 's lawyer . This would prejudice no right of the prosecution , yet it would practically remove the police incentive to extort confessions . Unfortunately our Bar Associations have not yet proved equal to other simple reforms such as removing the technicalities which clog the administration of justice in criminal procedure and make it possible for rich men to escape for years the toils of the law . The law 's delays remain the criminal 's best friends . Perhaps the new American Law Institute , which is now rewriting the criminal code , will be able to end some of these abuses . If the bar ever seriously took up the question of official malfeasance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the London police do not carry revolvers and that the killing of a London policeman is practically unheard of ; that the " third degree " is unknown in England and would not be tolerated for an instant ; that in the United Kingdom , as law-abiding a country as there is , with a total annual murder toll less than that of some middle-sized American cities , no one respects the law as much as the officials themselves . They are the guardians not only of the peace , but of the rights of all prisoners , the sanctities of every legal procedure . In England , of course , it could hardly happen , as in Philadelphia recently , that a magistrate could be sentenced to prison for six years for corruption . This man pleaded guilty to extorting from liquor-law violators more than $80,000 in the ten months before his conviction ; there were literally hundreds of specifications . His hands itched for bribes . What a fearful blow he struck at the dignity of the law and the respect in which it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were actually fewer cases of disorder in the courts than are usually found there in the same number of days . In Amer-.ica there is scarcely ever a strike in which the masses of the working people do not believe that the police , so far from holding the scales even , are on the side of the employing class . The army of Passaic strikers saw the police denying civil rights to their sympathizing friends from New York , suspending constitutional guarantees , and beating up strikers who were well within their legal rights . Can anyone expect these workers to hold the law in awesome respect or to believe that justice is enforced with even hands ? But it is not only strikers who suffer from the police clubs . On July 26 last the Queens County Grand Jury in New York denounced the attacks of the police upon the K. K. K. marchers in a Memorial Day parade at Jamaica , Long Island . The grand jury found that the police " did more to incite riot than to quell disturbance . " The " disgraceful assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent civilians was described as " a high-handed and brutal attack , " and the jury directed Mayor Walker to punish the guilty police . In the State of New Jersey the public has also read of the conviction of a lieutenant of State Police and of a trooper for the murder of a woman and the shooting of her brother . They were guilty of gross abuse of their authority and the illegal use of their weapons . Three other troopers have just been arrested for beating two restaurant employees . In Pennsylvania the State Police have frequently sided with the employers , and the deniers of civil rights ; at least this is the belief widely held by masses with whom they have come into contact . The result is the same : the persistent belief that the law-enforcer is biased and considers himself above the law . But why go on ? One could recall that the Department of Justice in Washington has set the worst kind of example , as witness the suicide of Andrea Salsedo , who leaped from the fourteenth story of the Park Row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortures , physical and mental . The Department 's agents inflicted upon him grave bodily injuries ; they held him in confinement without due process of law ; they threatened him with pain and death until he became insane . But this is only one of many cases . A body of lawyers of the highest standing reported ? and proved ? that in this land of liberty the agents of the Department
