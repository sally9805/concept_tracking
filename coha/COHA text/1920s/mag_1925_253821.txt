When addressing a foreign government , custom and propriety demand that a foreign minister write it a note . But there are occasions when notes are ineffective . Then a foreign minister may address himself , say , to the public , talking loud enough so that the foreign government in question may understand . <P> This is what Secretary of State Kellogg did last week . Ambassador Sheffield , accredited to the Calles Government at Mexico City , returned to Washington " just for a vacation . " He had two long conferences with the Secretary of State . He had another conference with the President , Senator Borah , Senator Smoot and Attorney General Sargent . Together and unanimously , according to report , they decided on action . <P> Next day , Secretary Kellogg issued a statement " explaining " his conference with Ambassador Sheffield . It was couched in diplomatic language , which is to say it was just half as pressing in wording as it was in intent . <P> The " Announcement " : " Our relations with the Government of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are looking to and expect tho Mexican Government to restore properties illegally taken and to indemnify American citizens . <P> " A great deal of property of Americans has been taken under or in violation of the agrarian laws for which no compensation has been made , and other properties practically ruined and , in one instance , taken by the Mexican Government on account of unreasonable demands of labor . Mr. Sheffield will have the full support of this Government and we will insist that adequate protection under the recognized rules of international law be afforded American citizens . <P> " I have seen the statements published in the press that another revolutionary movement may be impending in Mexico . I very much hope this is not true . <P> " It is now the policy of this Government to use its influence and its support in behalf of stability and orderly constitutional procedure ; but it should be made clear that this Government will continue to support the Government in Mexico only so long as it protects American lives and American rights and complies with its international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now on trial before the world . . . . " <P> When word of Secretary Kellogg 's " announcement " reached Mexico City , the Mexican Communist party called a meeting of protest against the " imperialistic and capitalistic ideas of the United States . " <P> President Calles soon after made an " announcement " of his own ( see Page 13 ) . Unlike Secretary Kellogg 's , Senor Calles ' announcement was doubtless intended more for home than for foreign consumption .
