From England came recently the report of a considerable benefaction . Funds were raised to purchase Sulgrave Manor , the ancestral home of the Washington family . When the manor was purchased , it was found that there was little accommodation in the vicinity for American visitors . Then an ancient lady came forward . She had been a contributor to the Sulgrave Manor fund . Now she presented another ancient manor house near by to serve as an hostelry for visiting Americans . This manor house will accommodate some 30 guests at a time . It is about 300 years old . <P> Who is this benefactress ? She is no less than a onetime candidate for President of the United States . Yet history books make little or no mention of her . By name she is Victoria Claflin Woodhull Martin , now in her 87th year . Complete and reliable accounts of her life are rare , but the following outline is gleaned from a pamphlet published by one of her supporters several decades ago : <P> She was born Sept. 23 , 1838 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxanna Claflin . They were very poor . She had less than three years ' schooling . Her father was cruel . <P> At 14 she married . Her husband , just twice her age , was Dr. Canning Woodhull , by name . He came of an eminent family . He was a gay rake . He was cruel . To them was born a child . It was subnormal . <P> At last she left her husband and went to California . For six weeks she was an actress . Then she had a vision . She had an intimate view of God and angels summoning her to go home . <P> She went to Indianapolis and set up as a clairvoyant . Later she moved to Terre Haute . She wrought apparently miraculous cures , unveiled secrets , prophesied events by faith in her simple theology . " Every characteristic utterance " which she gave to the world was " dictated while under spirit influence , and most often in a totally unconscious state . " <P> In 1869 , she abandoned clairvoyancy , at the call of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereupon she founded a bank and began publishing a journal . <P> Meanwhile she had secured a divorce , and was married by the spirits to Colonel James H. Blood , Commander of the 6th Missouri Regiment , and President of the St. Louis Society of Spiritualists . Her ex-husband , Woodhull , then completely ruined , lived with them . This hurt her reputation . <P> But a few years later , " following the English plan of self-nomination , " she announced herself a candidate for President ( the British Who's-Who says that she was nominated by the Equal Rights Party ) . She went before Congress urging that women be given the vote in accordance with requests which came to her in a clairvoyant state . <P> So much her loyal supporter affirmed . The British Who 's Who further records that she " lectured throughout U. S. on Finance , Women 's Suffrage , Religious and Scientific Improvement of the Human Race . "
