The conference opened at Atlantic City . John L. Lewis , President of the United Mine Workers , led the miners . The Presidents of each of the Districts were present also , and with William J. Brennan , the head of District 1 , was Rinaldo Cappellini , the young and fiery President-elect . <P> For the first time in many years press representatives were admitted to the opening session . Another innovation was the election of a miner to be chairman of the Full Scale Con-ference-John L. Lewis . <P> The first day of the conference was largely taken up with the presentation of the miners ' eleven demands . The chief demands were 1 ) a 20% increase of wages , 2 ) maximum eight-hour day ( only 3,000 or 4,000 of the 150,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the major demands ) , 3 ) complete recognition of the United Mine Workers ( which means virtually a closed shop ) . <P> Mr. Lewis continued : " Our demands as a whole do not in themselves constitute iron-clad demands , nor are they to be received as an ultimatum . Rather , we appeal to your sense of fair play . . . . The operators may as well admit they are compelled to fix a decent wage and that they should not be blamed for desiring to fix a price in proportion to it . However , that does not mean that the American public should have to pay more for its coal . " <P> Following the presentation of the miners ' demands , the representatives of the operators , headed by Samuel D. Warriner , went into executive session to consider the proposals . <P> During the week-end recess both sides were occupied in considering the preliminary report of the United States Coal ( Fact Finding ) Commission .               @ @ @ @ @ @
