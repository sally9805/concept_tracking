Soil Waste and the Flood Menace THE Mississippi River , with its tributaries , . drains an area of 1,250,000 square miles of land ? over one-half of the entire United States . The best agricultural land of the country is included in this area ; in fact , it is the agricultural heart of America . Last spring , all the tributaries , except the Ohio , poured their flood waters into the main stream at the same time . As a result , 20,000 square miles of the lowlands , including 12,800,000 acres of agricultural lands , were inundated . Damage , estimated from $200,000,000 to $1,000,00040p , resulted . The flood left in its wake devastated farms and homesteads , and badly damaged towns and villages . Over 700,000 people were rendered homeless , and many were deprived of their means of livelihood . The Mississippi flood was not the result of some sudden catastrophe such as a tidal wave , or the sudden activity of a dormant volcano . The Miss- issiPpi flood of 1927 is simply another manifesta- tjorl of a condition which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture the magnitude of which will make the present one pale ' tit ? insignificance . Of course , the immediate need of the hour was relief for the sufferers from the flood . The second most pressing need is rehabilita- , " o : farmers must be reestablished on their farms , 4,111 ( 1 towns and villages reconstructed . But after these steps have been taken , the important ques --  tion of flood prevention must be seriously undertaken by the federal government . Before this should ue undertaken , a clear conception of the conditions Which cause the floods must be realized . Out of the maze of conflicting suggestions made For flood control on the Mississippi , four methods c'ay be segregated as worthy of serious considera- lOu . These are : ( r ) The construction of bigger and better levees ; ( 2 ) the construction of spillways so as to relieve the main stream in time of flood ; ( 3 ) the construction of reservoirs for holding the waters on the upper reaches of the tributaries ; ( 4 ) the reforestation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prevent a too rapid run-off during the early spring , resulting from the thawing snow and the early spring rains , The school for the control of the river by levees has perhaps the strongest following and most eminent support . The Mississippi River Commission , in 1879 , soon after its organization , announced its support of this theory of control in the following statement : " An alluvial stream using a channel of its own formation , when confined between levees , would bore out a channel large enough to accommodate any flood that it might be called to carry . " On this basis , for more than fifty years the Mississippi River Commission have been constructing levees along the Mississippi , at very great expense . And the flood of the spring of 1927 is the largest and most disastrous in history ! And yet , Secretary Hoover and Brigadier General Jadwin , in a recent report , say that " levees are the practical , feasible , and economical means of affording flood protection for the valley as a whole , " and the army engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them , and upon a few spillways . The establishment of reservoirs on the headwaters of the various streams does not seem to offer any basis for hope of control . The magnitude of the reservoirs needed would be so large , and the value of the land which would be submerged so great , as to prevent their construction . None of these three methods of control takes into consideration the fundamental cause of the flood condition . Nor is the deforestation of the upper reaches of the various streams in the Mississippi drainage area alone the cause of the serious floods of the past fifty years . The lower valley of the Mississippi was being settled from about 1810 until 1850 . In the early days of the settlement , floods like last spring 's are not recorded . It is true that the De Soto party , in 1543 , encountered the Mississippi at the flood stage , and after De Sow 's death and bUrial in the Mississippi , the remainder of the party had difficulty in continuing their exploration , until the floods subsided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . Floods also occurred in 1874 , 1876 , 1882 , 1890 , 1896 , 1897 , 1903 , 1912 , 1913 , and 1922 . During the flood of 1882 , the Mississippi rose to 14.9 feet at New Orleans . In 1922 , it rose to 21.3 feet . ( These figures are heights above the Gulf level . ) In 1927 , the flood stage reached the highest level recorded . According to estimates of engineers on the ground , it would have gone to twenty-four feet had the levee below the city not been dynamited . According to best available information , the floods of the Mississippi are increasing in frequency and intensity . What is the cause of this condition ? There must be , some factor or factors which are contributing to the frequency of the floods . Has there been a series of unusual wet seasons ? Is the flood condition because the wooded areas of the upper valley have been denuded of their timber and thus are not able to retain the flood waters so easily ? Or is there some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ever-increasing menace of the flooded regions ? In order to devise a sound method of flood control , it is necessary to have a clear conception of the conditions which have brought about the floods of recent years . Wherein are conditions in the Mississippi drainage area different from what they were 125 years ago ? Are the floods of recent years due entirely to the destruction of the forests on the upper reaches of the tributaries of the Mississippi River ? And , if so , must we wait for protection against future floods thirty to fifty years for trees to grow , even after a policy of reforestation has been established ? Will reforestation of the area where the forests have been destroyed solve the problem ? Much of the area drained by the Mississippi never had forests of any kind . There is no accurate statistical information regarding the amount of land originally in forest and , grass on the Mississippi and its tributaries . In his report on the lands of the arid region in 1879 Major J. W. Powell recommended that the lands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mineral . This was one of the duties assigned to the Geological Survey when it was established in 1879 ; but the appropriations made to the survey were so meager that this was never carried out . Secretary Ballinger repeated Powell 's recommendations in 1907 , and the recommendation was again made by the National Conservation Congress in 1908 , but , so far , this information has not been made available . The Mississippi drainage basin , however , includes all the prairies and the Great Plains regions where forests were non-existent . It is true that the western slopes of the Alleghanies on the headwaters of the Ohio were forested . In the flood of 1927 , however , the Ohio River played no part , as it did not reach the flood stage . Deforestation alone , therefore , can not account for the flood situation . There is a single condition effective over the whole drainage area of the Mississippi which is vitally different now from what existed 125 years ago , and is fundamentally the basic cause contributing to the flood situation on the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now largely under cultivation , whereas then it was under sod . For , example , in Iowa and Illinois , 85 percent of the entire area is now improved farm land . As a result , soil erosion is taking place at an alarming rate . When white men first visited the drainage basin of the Mississippi , the entire land area was covered either with trees or grass . The brush of the forests , and the roots of the trees and grass , held the sod firmly in place and formed an ideal absorption medium for the snows of winter and rains of spring and summer . The waters from the melting snows and rains of spring were absorbed , and only slowlY found their way into the streams . The decay of the accumulated grass roots of the centuries created the black soil of the prairies . When the white man occupied this area , the forest was cut down and the sod was broken up by the plow . The rich , black , absorptive soil which had taken eons of ages to create began slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now rapid and destructive . The entire top soil is now gone from hundreds of thousands of acres of what was formerly good farm land . The lesson of the recent Mississippi flood is not bigger and better levees . The important lesson which should be realized is that the faulty system of agriculture in the Mississippi drainage basin , does not permit the soils to hold the rainfall as 01 yore , but lets the soil slip slowly away to the sea ; What is urgently needed is a full realization 01 this condition and the establishment of a system of agriculture which will prevent a rapid run-off vvben it rains and also save the soil for future use . It is , perhaps , difficult for the layman to realize that the soil is so easily lost by erosion . In fact , many believe with one writer that " The soil is the one indestructible , immutable asset that the nation possesses . It is the one resource that can not be exhausted , that can not be used up . " The soil , from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil , varying in depth from a few inches to a foot , which has taken ages of time " / , ? , create from the disintegrated rock . Beneath this life-giving soil is the subsoil , which is only slow , " converted into soil , and only at the expense of th ? 11 ' sands of years ' time . dy Since the floods on the Mississippi are ' direr related to the erosion of the soil on the uPPer . reaches of the river , it is of the utmost importance to consider methods of prevention of soil erosion as a means of adequate flood control . Soil ' erosion is of two kinds : gully erosion , which is local , ens , livi observed and spectacular , ; and sheet erosion , Oleic is insidious and widely distributed . Whenever f rains on cultivated soils , there is danger of loss o the soil by erosion . The prevailing practice of ec to growing in the Mississippi Valley has as much ill do with the floods of the river as all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corn-belt soil has been removed by erosion within the past one hundred years . On side hills , the run-off may be prevented and the soil saved , by a system of terracing . Terracing is simply the construction of ridges of soil following the contour of the land so as to check the flow of water . Contour plowing also is of value in this connection . When the plow furrow follows the contour of the land , conditions are not favcrable for the formation of rivulets which later . may develop into gullies . Terracing and contour cultivation are devices which have been practised for centuries in older countries where the problem of soil erosion had to be met . They have proved to be of only temporary value and doubtful expediency . These devices for checking soil erosion and destructive floods have been practised for centuries by the cultivators in China , India and South America , and the result has largely been a failure . People who practised these methods of checking soil erosion in South America thousands of years ago are now missing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the United States , as our land became worn out , we have solved the problem by moving on to a new area . But new land is no longer available , and the recurring damage from flood brings us face to face with the problem of preventing soil erosion , which must now be solved if we are to survive as a nation . The problem of worn-out lands iS not a minor one , nor is it concerned only with the actual loss of fertility of the soil . It means , in reality , the actual disappearance of the soil itself by gully and sheet erosion . There is not much definite information regarding the amount of land which was once cultivated in this region , but which is now waste land . Shaler says on this point , " In the state of Kentucky , which has been occupied by our people for less than one hundred and fifty years , and has not been , to any Considerable extent , tilled for more than a century , something like a tenth of its tillable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at least , . a thirtieth part of it can not be brought back to its original fertility in any foreseeable time . " Chamhedine says that " the 1,000,000,000 or more tons of richest soil matter annually carried into the sea by our rivers is the nation 's loss . " The National Conservation Congress , on the basis of estimates from 30,000 farms , calculates that 16,597 square miles of farm land have been ? a , bandoned in the United States due to soil erosion . area is equal to the entire cultivated area of -. , tigland . The run-off from it is now very abundant and takes place quickly . Deep gullies now prevail over large areas which were formerly good farm l Sheet erosion is even now very active in the L0I1Paratively level corn-belt soil , and is promoted Y the finely divided clay soil and the clean cultivation practised in corn culture . What can be done about it ? In a state of nature , soil erosion was checked and the danger from flood reduced by growth of trees and prairie grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked , forests must be reestablished where they grew before , and our agricultural practice in the drainage basin must be changed so as to grow more sod-producing crops . Corn is the great staple cattle feed of the United States . Over 90 percent of the corn produced is used for feeding cattle . Must we give up the production of corn , and consequently , the production of beef-cattle and hogs , which is the basis of American agriculture ? The practice of growing corn on much of the land in the corn belt must be abandoned , both as a means of saving the soil and also as a measure of flood control on the river itself . Except as the destruction of a tradition dear to the hearts of many people , this will not produce a serious situation at all , for there are available substitute crops which will not only conserve the soil itself and actually increase its production capacity , but also produce feed that will maintain a greater number of livestock per acre . The crops are alfalfa and sweet clover . Alfalfa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet clover is an excellent pasture crop and , more than any other crop opens up the soil , makes it porous and thus increases its capacity to hold water . These crops are thoroughly established in the Far West and their value fully appreciated , but they are not yet extensively grown in the corn belt . Alfalfa-for hay and sweet clover for pasture will save the soil , prevent a too rapid run-off , and thus check floods and also produce the necessary livestock needed by the American people . Alfalfa hay will furnish more feed per acre for livestock than will corn . The ten-year average yield of corn in Illinois , for example , is thirty-five bushels per acre , or 2,100 pounds of feed . The ten-year average yield of alfalfa hay is two and nine-tenths tons per acre , or 5,800 pounds of feed . The feed-produced by an acre of alfalfa will support two and one-half times the number of livestock supported by an acre of corn . These crops can be established within one year 's time , and we need not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is the case with the reestablishment of a forest . Without the substitution of alfalfa and sweet clover for corn , we shall , in the very near future , have neither the livestock nor the soil , but only the ever-present danger of disastrous floods . The Mississippi-flood problem , is not an isolated incident characteristic of the American continent . The problem produced by the Mississippi is analogous to that which has confronted the people of China for thousands of years , in connection with the control of the flood waters of the Yellow River , the . Hwang-ho , well named " China 's Sorrow . For at least forty centuries , the Chinese have been trying to control the Hwang-ho as we are now trying to control the Mississippi . They , also , cut down the forests and cultivated the soil on the upper reaches of the river . When the rains came , the soils washed away . Rills became rivulets and rivulets became streams which produced gullies , and the soil moved out into the Yellow Sea via the Gulf of Pe-Chih-li . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , but also to the clean cultivation of the soil for the production of human food . The type of soil along the Hwang-ho is loess , a wind-formed soil , thousands of feet in depth , easily susceptible to water erosion . Hundreds of square miles of land once farmed in the interior of China , on the head-waters of the Hwang-ho , is now a desolate waste which produces neither forest , grass nor food . The alluvial plain at the mouth of the Hwang-ho is built out for hundreds of miles by soil from the interior . New farms were constructed on the alluvial plain as it rose from the sea through the thousands of years of time . The Chinese have , from time immemorial , built levees on the banks of the Hwang-ho , as we are now doing on the Mississippi , in an effort to control the flood water . They attempted to control the meandering of the river over the alluvial plains by confining the river to " a channel of its own formation , " as the Mississippi River Commission commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher and higher throughout the centuries . The river bed , however , rises about one foot a hundred years , due to the deposition of the silt which it carries . The bottom of the Hwang-ho is now about twenty feet above the level of the surrounding country . The river is really running on a ridge . When the levee breaks , as it does in time of floods , the terror , suffering and desolation in the plains are inconceivable . There is no question but that this condition on the Hwang-ho is an important cause contributing to the periodic famines which occur in China . Does not the experience of the Chinese with the Hwang-ho convey to us a warning and a lesson ? In America we have put a check on the wanton destruction of the forests . We have built levees as the Chinese have done . But our agricultural practice in the corn belt has not changed , as it must do if the Mississippi River is not to be a constant menace to the people of the entire Valley , and become for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations , the people of the lower Valley of the Mississippi have fought and suffered , buoyed up by the hope that , when the levee system was finished , all would be well and they would be safe . In the light of four thousand years ' experience of the Chinese on the Yellow River , this feeling is r1. -t justified . Levees and spillways must be used . But reforestation and a decided change in the agricultural practice in the corn-belt area must take place before safety for all may be obtained .
