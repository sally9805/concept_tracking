txt Considerable part of the recent buying of International Paper common is said to be for the account of Canadian interests who are buying the stock to be taken out of the market . The stock made a new high on this upward swing Thursday , selling at 82% a few minutes before the close , 91/4 points below the record high for the year . Canadians have watched the stocks of local paper companies on the Montreal Stock Exchange mount skyward in a boom of stocks of this character which has been on since the first of the year . Current high prices for the Canadian issues which are prohibitive in many instances to the small investor have diverted much of the buying from across the border to the stocks of International Paper . Everything considered , the current year should be a good one for International Paper from the viewpoint of earnings . Output of newsprint for the entire year has been contracted for in advance at prices which are adjustable quarterly by agreement . Price now in effect is $115 a ton while for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton for the first quarter . Interests in the trade would not be surprised if an . other advance is agreed upon for the last quarter . Admitting that the advanced quotations are justified by higher costs of operations , a portion of the advance can reasonably be expected to be reflected in current earnings . Many of the smaller newsprint companies are receiving as high as $200 a ton . Prices received by International Paper Co. this year are probably as low as any of the larger producers and all its print paper output is disposed of under contract . It is not believed likely at this time that any new financing will be done . While the matter was discussed a short while ago and a short term note issue of approximutely $10,000,000 spoken of , the poor condition of the market for new securities is believed to have disposed of the plan , at least for the present . The financing of the new mill at Three Rivers , Quebec . so far has been done from current earnings . Bank loans continue at a high figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first unit of the new mill at Three Rivers , Quebec , is expected to be ready for operation about November 1 next with an initial output of 80 tons of sulphite pulp . This will be a favorable factor as it will permit the use of wood from Canadian crown lands to some extent in which the large investment made years ago has been lying idle since 1910 . The sulphite for the present will be shipped to this country and manufactured into newsprint . When the mill has been entirely completed , about the last of 1921 , it will have an output of 200 tons of newsprint . Last year 's annual report was a disappointment in many quarters . Net earnings after preferred dividends amounted to $2,621,494 or at the rate of $13.24 a share on the $19,803,920 common stock outstanding . This compares with net of $3,652,577 available for the common stock in 1918 or $18.47 a share . Unofficial estimates of earnings for the current year are that they will at least equal those of 1918 . Working capital at the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1918 though higher costs of operations made necessary the larger amount used in conducting business . For instance , inventory at the end of 1919 was carried at $23,713,388 against $21,397,000 in 1918 and $12,762,000 in 1917 . This year , International Paper should reap some of the benefits of the accumulations of asssets and the conservative policy which it has pursued through many lean years when competition was extremely keen and paper was being manufactured and sold in some instances at prices which left negligible margins of profit .
