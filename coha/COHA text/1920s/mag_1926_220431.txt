Walter Hagen always smiles for the camera . When he talks to his caddy , when he sits down to lunch , when he strolls in the wake of his drives , his face relaxes into large curves of good nature . Thus he looked when he arrived , half an hour late , at the St. George 's Hill Club , Weybridge , England , to play the second half of a match with Abe Mitchell for a prize of 500. * He was at that point four holes behind . <P> He won the second hole when Mitchell bunkered an iron shot . He won the fourth hole when Mitchell hooked a drive . He won the fifth and sixth holes with faultless golf , the tenth with a birdie . After that he was never behind again . Mitchell , quite obviously , was stewing in his own juice . Perspiration poured into his eyes ; he had his caddy fetch a towel from the clubhouse , complained that he could not hold his clubs . To remedy the last evil he donned a chamois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man who plays golf without a coat might as well play without trousers , he kept his tweed jacket on . Hagen 's silk shirt invited breezes . He smiled . At the seventy-first tee he lay on the ground for a brief rest , then rose , sent a perfect drive down the fairway . Mitchell sliced his iron shot . Hagen , standing blandly by , watched him make a hopeless try for recovery , then holed his own putt and turned to oblige the camera men . He had won , at 2 up and 1 to go , the ( unofficial ) professional championship of the world . <P> * The largest official stake ever offered for a professional golf match .
