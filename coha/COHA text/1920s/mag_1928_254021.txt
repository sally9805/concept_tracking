Selfridge 's ( London department store ) last week formally opened a new department where Britishers might buy for $32 , and as casually as they buy hardware , the wherewithal to put together a television receiving set . Shaggy-haired John L. Baird , inventor of the apparatus , was there ; promised to broadcast television programs each night at midnight , and warned that the sets would receive only blurred silhouettes .
