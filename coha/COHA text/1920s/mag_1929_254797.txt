The French cruiser Tourville steamed westward across the Atlantic last week bearing home the body of Myron Timothy Herrick , late U. S. Ambassador to France . Manhattan prepared to receive it with solemn honors , in which France 's dead Foch was to share . In Ohio waited a grave . <P> Meanwhile discussion of a successor to Mr. Herrick 's high diplomatic post began . Four names emerged : Frank Billings Kellogg , John Joseph Pershing , Alvan Tufts Fuller , Frederick Henry Prince . President Hoover was faced with the necessity also of finding a new man to represent the U. S. at the court of St. James 's . His purpose was to fit a smooth-working team into London and Paris . For the London post only one name really loomed : Charles Gates Dawes . <P> Mr. Kellogg denied that he would take a diplomatic post after four years as Secretary of State . A special act of Congress would be necessary to make General Pershing an Ambassador for the statutes now prohibiting a military man , active or retired , to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militate against the chances which onetime Governor Fuller of Massachusetts has of going to Paris where the " radical " tide often runs strong . <P> Mr. Prince , buyer and seller of railroads , with his 70-room Prides Crossing , Mass. , home , is amply rich for the French ambassadorship . He already spends eight months of each year at his homes in Paris and Pau . His son , Norman , was one of the founders of France 's Lafayette Escadrille . <P> Observers expected no appointment until after Mr. Herrick 's interment.
