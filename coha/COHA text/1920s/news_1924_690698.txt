txt To understand the answer which Dr. FOSDICK made yesterday to the committee of the New York Presbytery , one must recall what went before . He is a Baptist clergyman who for some years has been acting as associate minister in a Presbyterian church . There was no offense in this , and probably no notice would have been taken of it had not Dr. FOSDICK beoome known as a man of liberal views in theology . They were not made prominent in his preaching , which had been of such power as to draw great throngs to hear him , but the fact was seized upon by ektreme conservatives in the Presbyterian Church to move against Dr. FOSDICK . They first thought of something like a trial for heresy , but as he was - sustained- by the great majority of the ministers and elders of the New York Presbytery , that course teemed hardly feasible . Accordingly , the point was made by the General Assembly that the continued employment of a Baptist minister in a Presbyterian church was " irregular , " and- that Dr. FosDICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Church must give him up as an associate minister . To the case as thus put to him , Dr. ' FOSDICK now makes a clear and conclusive reply . He ' would have no objections to complying with the request of the General Assembly on denominational grounds , as he is a great believer in church unity , and would have inter-denominational exchanges and fellowship greatly extended , instead of being restricted . But he is unwilling to commit himself ' to anything which would look like a " closed shop " in the church . Moreover , he does not feel.in Conscience that he could assent to the ancient creed which Presbyterian ministers are required to accept for " substance of doctrine , " especially since to do so would expose him to the unhappy interpretation of stretching his principles a little in order to keep his position . ? The result will be , of course , that he will give up his associate ministry in the First Presbyterian Church , though he may still be invited from time to time to peach there . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " FOSDICK , but upon the Presbyterian Church . It will have convicted itself in the . eyes o'f4he lay public not only of a- certain denominational narrowness , hut of the folly of giving up the services of a preacher whose good report has filled the whole city , become known throughout the entire country and reached the knowledge of the churches in . England . Such a voice as that of Dr. FosindICS ' is in no danger of being silenced by any technical ecclesiastical veto . ? He has but to speak , anywhere , and People ' drill flock to heanhim . Without artifice in the.pulpit , , or the slightest trick of ministerial ' sensationalism ; he has moved thousands thy the quality of - his thought and the depth and sincerity of his religious emotions ; When a-ehurch , no , iiiatter ; of- what denomination , has at its ; dispOini such a preacher of spiritual power , in a time of dominant Materialism ; . it iis so stupid - as to ' be ainiost wicked ' to let him go . It seen yery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit . ** Dr. FOsincK need not think or abandoning his great following or his high mission . If not in one pulpit , then eventually in another , his exceptional . voF , ation for the . ministry will , no doubt , be exemplified so long as ' strength and life do not fail him .
