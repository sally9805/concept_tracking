The special Ofes'aeuter , and the .. foreznir of the JorY , W. ; ' Percival , used all but a few of the twenty minutes of the session in exchanging verbal hot shots .

Among those reporting for service was Mrs. Jane Joliffe of Bernardsville , N. J. , the only woman member .

" But , " persisted the prosecutor , " I desire to Aake a statement in courtesy to the Grand Jury and ' to explain why they are here with no work to do . and I will read the statement I made to the newspapers . " Foreman Snyder was firm . " No. " he insisted , " you will not . We do n't want any statement . " The determined foreman was matched by a determined prosecutor . Insists on Making Statement . " I will make a statement , " said Mr. Simpson , " explaining to the Grand Jury that I did not call them here . When I found the thing could not be finished in one day , as they desired , I Instructed that they be instructed they would not be needed today but on a subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I " We do not care for any statement from you , " said Mr. Snyder . " But you are going to get one , " was the retort . " I order you to leave the room , " said the foreman . " You are not the whole Grand Jury , " replied the Senator ; " you are one member of it , and I wo n't leave the room until I make a statement in just tice to the State . " " But you will leave the room . " " I decline to leave the room . " The dialogue might have gone on indefinitely and unyieldingly had not some diplomat suggested a way out . The name of this Grand Juror , unfortunately , was not reported , but his suggestion , " I move that the special prosecutor be given the privilege of the floor , " was carried . The foreman did not vote . " Gbntlemen. " said Senator Simpson , " I have explained to you that your calling together today was no desire of mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time . You are called here and are in session . The newspapers have printed in large type , evidently inspired by some one , that I ' was to be indicted in this case . " I think you can put your time to good advantage ny making inquiry now . I am here . I will waive immunity and will be put under oath if you desire ; you can ask me any questions you desire . . The investigators are here ; you can call them here , they are within reach by telephone , and you can then proceed to indict me or any person you like for any crime ' which you say nas ' deep committed in the prosecution of this case . You should not wait until after the trial of the defendants indicted for murder . That would be unjust to them . " If you think a crime has been committed in this prosecution it is not only your right , bet your duty to Immediately find indictments . You have the Judge here to instruct you . He is within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any information you like in your proposed inquiry which has been so widely heralded in the newspapers last night . " At this point ' a . Grand Juror broke in . He said : " We are not responsible for what was published . " Regrets Published Reports . " I regret the wrong position that the majority of this Grand Jury has ' been placed in by published reports , " said Senator Simpson , " that they were to act without me and act without evidence . I think it puts them in ail wrong light . " " Who said that ? " demanded Foreman Snyder . " You did , " the Senator informed him . " You are a liar . " " You are a gentleman . " This created a stir . Down at one end of the room a Grand Juror arose . " Mr. Foreman , " he said , " I think this is entirely uncalled for . You are only the - foreman of this Grand Jury and make tie look like a lot of children by the statements you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are only une of twenty-three . " " But , " Mr. Synder reminded him , " 1 am the foreman . " The Special Prosecutor took up the burden again . ' ? You had no right to put the Grand Jury in a false position , " he said , " as if they were going.to act without evidence and decide the case against the interest of the State in the matterthen before you , without knowing what the evidence was . " " I never gave out the interview , " Mr. Snyder asserted . THE NEw YORK Tines man apologized today to me for having printed it , but 1 think you should be excluded from the room . " No Apology Was Made . The reporter who , Mr. Snyder said , had " apologized " to him confronted him in the corridors of the court house after the session and asked why he had said an apology had been tent. : red him . The foreman replied that I he had so interpreted a conversation he had had on Monday night with the reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been offered , and that the interview as ' printed was correct in every detail . Asked to point out in any part of the interview how he had been misquoted , the foreman asserted he had not saki that " the Gram : Jury would meet without Senator Simpson . " The reporter insisted that the foreman nau made that statement and two other reporters , who had interviewed him separately , but with only a brief interval between all of the interviews , asserted that he had said the same thing to them . The encounter ended with the foreman still insisting that he had received an " apology " and that he had been misquoted . Row in Jury Room Continues . After Mr. Snyder had informed Senator Simpson in the Grand Jury meeting that he had been " misquoted , " the Senator took np the foreman 's order that he be excluded from the room . " It is not necessary to excliide me from the room , " he said , " I told you what my position was . All this stuff about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lot of propaganda , which I believe certain persons interested In this case have spread through the kind offices of a member of this Grand Jury , and it is all a bluff from him to try and indict me ; When you indict me. do n't leave out the Attorney General , because he is my boss , and you might also include the Governor , because he has followed my investigation from the beginning , and approved it . " Another Grand Juror broke into the proceedings . " I do n't think we should get heated up about this thing , " he said . " If there is no evidence to be presented , we ought to adjourn . " " We ought to go into executive session , " said Mr. Snyder . " As you have no use for me , " said the Senator , " and ? do n't want to call me as a witness in your investigation I will regretfully take my leave of this body . " Mrs. Joliffe then addressed Senator Simpson . " I was met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home by reporters , who treated me very courteously , and I told them that I was going to ask the Special Prosecutor if he had said that this Grand Jury was ' fixed . ' " " No , madam , " said the Senator , " I did n't say anything of the kind . What I said was in the formal statement published in this morning 's papers . Now , gentlemen , if you have no further use for me I beg you will allow me to withdraw . " Soon after Senator Simpson left the Grand Jury room he was followed by Francis L. Bergen , Somerset Prosecutor of the Pleas , who had maintained neutrality through the war of words . The next to leave the room was Irving Schwed , Clerk of the Grand Jury . He was asked to leave . Senator Simpson said that in his legal experience he had never heard before of the clerk being requested to leave . Calls it " Cat and Dog " Fight . Senator Simpson waited at the court house for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fight had been ' staged in the Grand Jury roam . " Theattitude of the Grand Jury here may affect the murder defendants , " he said , " I am very sorry for them ; they were not responsible . It is a great shame . The Grand Jury intended to meet today to find no indictments and to hear no witnesses . They wanted to leave me ' holding the bag . ' I guess they are holding the sack , now . " The Senator said that although he had planned to go before the Grand Jury on Friday , his trip to Somerville had taken so much time from his work that he would be unable to go before the Grand Jury until after the trial , which starts next Wednesday . " It Is now up to Senator Simpson , " said Mr. Snyder . " We must wait for him , " The Senator said he had heard that in the executive session that followed his exit from the Grand Jury room there had been talk of an effort to have him " committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about this .
