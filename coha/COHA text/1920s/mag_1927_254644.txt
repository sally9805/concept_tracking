It is half a century since a newspaper could be called , with any degree of accuracy , a " rag . " The newspaper files of any large library prove this . Editions aged anywhere from 5 to 50 years are yellowed , brittle , flimsy to the touch . They are printed on wood-pulp paper which ages swiftly . But where editions containing accounts of the Battle of the Marne have already become illegible , editions narrating the Battle of Gettysburg , though handled far longer , remain strong and unfaded . They are on paper made from rags . <P> Last week the New York Times , expense notwithstanding , began to print a special limited edition daily on 100% rag paper , advertisements , obituaries , rotogravure and all - for the benefit of file-keepers . Considering the completeness and authority of the Times and the aid to future historians promised by its new edition , friends of the Times were more than ever inclined to call it , with unwonted accuracy , " grand old rag .
