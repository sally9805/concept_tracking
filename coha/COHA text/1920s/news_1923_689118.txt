txt A new possibility This Was and another utility of " Paging " the radio was disNew Style . closed at Boston this week when it became desirable for a young man who was away on his honeymoon to return home at once . His mother had been taken desperately and was pathetically eager to see him , perhaps for the last time . All that was known about the young couple was that they were I " somewhere ta New Zineand , " tar , j after the manner of their kind , they had veiled In deep secrecy the destination of their nuptial journey . They went away in an automobile and purposed to do all their traveling in it , stopping wherever fancy decided and staying there only as long as they pleased . With no fixed address , even in their own minds , the prompt finding of the honeymooners would have been , until recently , impossible . Now it could he done simply and easily , and was . Nothing more was required than the " broadcasting " of a : message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached without delay the secluded inn at Lost River , N. H. ; where he happened to be , not because it was sent there , but because it was sent out of Boston in every direction . This is " paging " of a sort not even imaginable a few years ago , and obviously in the same way practically anybody in the more civilized parts of the world who wants or is willing to be found can be told without much loss of time that somebody desires to see him . Such calls will reach the far expanses of the ocean as well as of the land , for there are few of either , nowadays , that do not contain at least one instrument for receiving radio dispatches . And before long , probably , the paging message can be an audible summons ? one of spoken words , directly understandable and with the speaker 's voice recognizable by the receiver . Then will the once all-conquering element of distance receive a stunning blow and give up the fight . Already it is possiAnybody Now ble to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody . larger fraction of the earth 's inhabitants than commonly is realized . Probably there are not more than 1,000,000 , if as many , of the 100 , - 000,000-plus people in the United States who can not be summoned to a telephone , their own or that of somebody else willing in cease of need to take the trouble to serve a neighbor . In some cases it might take an hour , or even a day , to " get " the person wanted " on the wire . " It would cost money if the distance approached the transcontinental , but the price would not be prohibitive when a serious emergency ' was to be met or important business was to be done . There seems to be no present probability that the radio wholly will replace or diminish materially the use of either the telegraphy or the telephony that is done over wires , but radio certainly will supplement both to an extent constantly broadening as the years go on . The prospect is not wholly pleasant to those who cherish the privileges and rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , from their fellow men and women  --  but on the whole the balance is in favor of progressdand change . That is fortunate , for neither can be prevented , and we must make the best of both . Staten en t s by Their Words union leaders that Have they will , . or may , Significance if necessary . " conscript " or " draft " bricklayers for work on the city 's new schoolhouses probably are not to be taken as exactly descriptive of what the speakers have in mind . Behind a conscription or a draft , as known in time of war , there is always compulsion . The orders issued must be obeyed under serious penalties for resistance or refusal . And the bricklayers can not be made to work on schoolhouses or elsewhere unless they choose to do so , and whether one of them will obey who is told to quit a job where be le getting big wages and go to one where he will get less  --  that remains to be seen . Even the suggestion , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure the carrying out by union members of a contract made in the exercise of the discretion and power entrusted to those officials is of much significance . The terms offered by the city-involved agreements relating to the future as well as to immediate rates of wages . There was " consideration " on both sides , and there were formal promises , authoritatively signed . Only a misguided magnifying of the dollar in band can explain the failure of the bricklayers to keep the contract , and the realization of this fact by the union officials may lead to highly interesting developments . While they can not conscript or draft , they can make recalcitrance expensive . We all have Contradicts heard so much and a Common so often about the . ion heterogeneity of our Impress population that It is somewhat startling to note that In his introduction to Lord SnAw 's book , " The Law of the Kinsmen , " Chief Justice and ex-president TAirr declares that instead of being of many kinds we are to a remarkable degree of only one . This peculiarity , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had , to make " a progress from one end of the country to the ether , " for in such a journey " the language , the appearance , the dress , the humor , the manners , the bearing are the same , with only local variations that it takes an expert to detect . " If that is what most impressed the Chief Justice in the course of the travels he was so fond of making while President , then of course it exists : but perhaps something of the homogeneity he saw was due to the feet that Americans of the more recent date  --  the members of " colonies " and dwellers in Little this , that and the other  --  are not those whom the maker of the " proggress " is likely to meet . The truth may be that we are homogeneous in some ways and heterogeneous in others , and which of the two we are to be called depends on the point of view .
