txt Automobile passenger stage revenue in California far exceeds the earnings of common carrier freight motor truck lines , according to figures gathered by the California Railroad Commission and believed by its accountants to be the most comprehensive survey of the motor transportation situation yet made in any state . Out of a combined revenue from passengers , freight , express and other sources of $14,831,179 for 1921 , passenger earnings totaled $7,991,312 and freight 83.408,152 . Accurancy is not claimed for these figures , as the motor transportation business has not been conducted systematically , and the railroad commission accountants found that many reports were merely ' estimates , while others were filled with such mistakes as charging new equipment to operating expense instead of capital account . Nevertheless the figures are reasonably reliable . - Twenty-three stage lines showed gross earnings over $50,000 , one company taking in over $1,000,000 and three others over $250,000 . Total revenue for the 23 lines was $5,544,515 , expenses $5,462,750 , net $81,7 ( 35 . These cornr.anies-reported an investment equipment of $2,588 ; 124 .

Though they apparently showed a greater net return than the stage lines , a large proportion of these truck lines are of comparatively recent origin and only one of them had a gross ievenue of over $200,000 , while the stages have a history of steady growth and consolidation , a few of them now dominating the passenger business in the state . The largest stage line is the Motor Transit Co. , which operates a network of routes out of Los Angeles . Its gross revenue was $1,618,893 , while the California Transit Co. dominating the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys , took in $834,295 . As a uniform system of accounting has been provided by the railroad commission by which ' all hooks for 1922 must be kept , it is expected the 1922 reports will give a fairly accurate idea of the profitableness of public utility motor transportation . The commission is empowered to regulate the service of the motor carriers and has control over their rates and their issues of stock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
