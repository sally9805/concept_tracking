In Manhattan , the American Guardian Association , founded in the Philippines in 1921 by Governor General Wood for the care of half-breeds ( offspring of Filipmo-U . S. unions ) , opened offices , issued an appeal* for a fund of $2,000,000 . Some 6,000 American residents of the Philippines are members of the Association , and the campaign for funds is sponsored by General Wood , William Howard Taft , W. Cameron Forbes ( former Governor General ) , General James G. Harbord , General Hugh E. Scott , Martin Egan ( of J. P. Morgan &; Co . ) . The appeal for 1,800 needy mestizo children , as they are called , said : " These children certainly are worth saving . Generally of a high-strung , nervous temperament , and rather emotional , their blood characteristics appear very prominently . They have initiative and imagination , which are wholly lacking in the native . You never mistake them . Their light hair , blue eyes , and clean-cut American features are too evident . The girls , , i if educated , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They boys , if properly brought up , should become leaders of the Filipino people . <P> " As General Wood affirms , this situation is the one black blot on American prestige in the Orient . . . stories of little girls confined in chicken coops because they would not accede to the demands of their masters ; stories of girls traded to Chinamen for pigs . <P> " It is unfortunately true that the majority of the Filipino women who have consorted with American men have been of the tao , or peasant class . Unable by the hardest kind of drudgery to earn more than 50 cents a day , or a single Philippine peso , many of these abandoned or widowed women have taken other partners , or , as is often the case , have drifted into immorality . In such conditions the boys soon are kicked out to shift for themselves , while the girls are farmed out , or ' loaned , ' to friends or relatives .
