THE WOMEN AT THE PUMP - Knut Hamsun-Translated from the Norwegian by Arthur G. Chater-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> Daily the women gather at the pump to fetch water-and to discuss the myriad affairs of the small town , for in a town where only Blacksmith Carlsen and the Postmaster are religious , there is plenty to discuss . The parson may be busy enough christening and confirming , but like as not the christened child has no right to the name , the confirmed is no longer the virgin she should be . There was always a new suspicious twist in the affairs of the carpenter , the fishermen , the doctor , the pompous Consul . And Oliver , swashbuckling sailor returned legless from a storm at sea , would no doubt lose his sweetheart to the steady carpenter . But Petra married Oliver in spite of the gossip , and bore five children . Of course the brown-eyed boys might belong to Consul Johnsen , wealthy shipper , and the youngest was no doubt fathered by the lynx-eyed Lawyer-but the Doctor , who fostered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-honored grudge against both shipper and lawyer . So Oliver continued squabbling , capitalizing his crippled state , trespassing on distant islands for illicit loot-birds ' eggs and eiderdown which he smuggled on stormy nights to transient English sailors . " Small things and great occur , a tooth falls out of the jaw , a man out of the ranks , a sparrow to the ground . " <P> To Knut Hamsun , life rings true not so much in cataclysmic passions-love , hate , pride-as in lesser foibles , jealousies , spite , prevarication , occasional kindness . His meticulous record of pettiness is intense in its authenticity , disheartening in its cumulative drabness .
