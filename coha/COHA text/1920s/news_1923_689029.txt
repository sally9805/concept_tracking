txt Adams in Boston News Bureau " Pithy Personalities " says : The bankers who ' offered $25,000,000 Austrian bonds to the American investing public pinned a good part of their faith in the successful outcome of the plan for rehabilitating Austria on the personality of Dr. Zimmerman was formerly burgomaster of Rotterdam , Holland , a much more important poiition than American ideas of burgomasters derived from the " Pied Piper of Hamelin " would indicate . He is distinguished throughout Europe as a banker and economist . The Commissioner General of Austria will see to it that the scheduled reforms in the administration of the government are carried out . He will receive taxes pledged under the new loan for the benefit of the bondholders . Bankers who have met him declare that Dr. Zimmerman is " hard-boiled " enough to insure strict adherence on the part of Austria to the straight and narrow path she has undertaken to tread . During his first six months on the job Dr. Zimmerman 's efforts have been notably successful . TAMMANY NOW MORGAN 'S NEIGHBOR The new home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right opposite the town home of J. Pierpont Morgan , at Thirty-seventh Street and Madison Avenue , in the exclusive Murray Hill district . The Democrats paid $287,000 for the residence of Captain Joseph De Lamar on the northeast corner of the intersecting streets , acquiring a desirable spot for their future club house and at the same time completing a very profitable deal . In the early nineties , the club bought a site on Fifth Avenue just below St. Patrick 's Cathedral for $175,000 . The next year an attractive offer was made but the vision of Richard Croker and Jefferson M. Levy and others prevailed and the property Was kept . Recently the club received $1,010,000 for the site and after paying cash for the Madison Avenue place had something like $700,000 in the treasury . A club with such a treasury , as one of the directors remarked , is a fit neighbor for J. P. Morgan . GRABOW . NORTH SHORE BONIPAGE The New Ocean House of Swampscott , Mass. , is more and more becoming the Mecca of conventlonites . Its growth , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the Poland Springs House and the Mount Washington among the important New England hostelries , makes some of its financial figures of interest . This year it will do a gross business , compressed incl. - dentally into a little over three months , of over $400,000 , against $30,000 in its first year , 1901 . It covers today 19 acres against a bare three acres 22 years ago and its properties are worth 1,800,000 against $36,000 at the out set . The man who made the Ocean House such a success and who is still the cheif stockholder and manager is E. R. Grabow , who has been actively identified with the hotel business for 80 years , or since he was chief cashier of the Auditorium at Chicago at the age of 17 . Grabow is perhaps better known as the head of the passenger traffic department of United Fruit Co. , with which he has been since 1904.
