Andrew J. Volstead , once an inconspicuous Minnesota lawyer , has never deeply regretted the fame that came to him when he tagged his name upon the National Prohibition Act . It was a nuisance , of course , when intoxicated traveling salesmen called Mr. Volstead up in the middle of the night to curse him , and it was not altogether pleasant to feel that a large portion of his fellow countrymen regard him as a wizened fanatic . But Mr. Volstead has surmounted these drawbacks by <P> 1 ) concealing his telephone number ; and <P> 2 ) shrugging his shoulders and remembering all the good people who admire his Act . <P> Wesley Livsey Jones of Washington , the senatorial sire of the Five &; Ten Act , doubtless never gave a thought to the publicity he would come in for . But last week he made it clear he resented joining Mr. Volstead 's category . Emphatically he protested : " There is no Jones law ! " By this he meant , hairsplitting , that his measure , increasing prohibition penalties to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment to the Volstead Act and should therefore be anonymous . <P> But the distinction was too fine . An " Act to amend " is still an " Act , " a law . And so , although " Five &; Ten " was rapidly replacing " Jones Law " as the measure 's name , Senator Jones tried to escape his misery by calling in company . He pointed out that the measure had had a co-author in the House of Representatives , Congressman Gale H. Stalker of New York , who was being deprived of his share of the credit . In fact the Stalker Bill , he said , had been introduced nine days before the Jones Bill . Insisted Mr. Jones : " I hope the proper term will be used in referring to this . . . legislation and it will be known as the Jones-Stalker . ... " <P> A large , loose-knit man born 65 years ago in Bethany , Ill. , Senator Jones has never taken a drink ( that he knows of ) , has never smoked tobacco , has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . His range of legislative interest has by no means been confined to prohibition . No smooth speaker , never brilliant , his name is nevertheless upon the latest Merchant Marine Act ( Jones-White ) under which eleven great Shipping Board vessels were recently sold ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . All day every day during Senate sessions he can be found in his aisle seat , behind an embankment of papers and books , hard at work . No hail-fellow-well-met , he is not on easy , congenial terms with the average handshaking , backslapping Senators . His Republican colleagues preferred Indiana 's easy-going Watson to him as Republican leader to succeed Charles Curtis . <P> Senator Jones 's unhappiness over the Five &; Ten Act was increased last week when New York 's volunteer committee of lawyers to defend Five &; Ten victims unearthed and republished a statement made by Senator Jones in 1921 on the Senate floor . He had said : <P> " An objection is made to the Prohibition Law that it infringes the personal liberties of the individual . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty in a republic ! "
