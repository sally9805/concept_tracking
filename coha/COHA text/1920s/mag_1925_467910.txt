A LADY on one occasion asked mewhy I did not write a play . " I am sure , Mr. Jerome , " she said with a bright en ? couraging smile , " that you could write a play . " I told her I had written nine ; that six of them had been produced ; that three of them had been successful both in England and America ; that one of them was still running at the Comedy Theater and approaching its two-hundredth night . Her eyebrows went up in amazement . " Dear me , " she said , " you do sur ? prise me . " George R. Sims told me that he once dined some friends at the Savoy . Over the coffee he asked them if they would like to go to a theater and they said they would . He took them to a play of his own . For some reason which Sims could not explain they did not like it . At the end of the first act one of them , turning to him , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it so ? " " Well , now you come to mention it , perhaps it is ? a trifle , " agreed Sims . " Let 's go on to the Empire , " sug ? gested another . The proposal was carried nem . con. and , leaving their programs behind them , the party rose and made their way out of the theater noisily and cheerfully , fol ? lowed by Sims walking soberly . " It used to annoy me , " added Sims , " that not one theater-goer in a hundred ever takes the trouble to read the au ? thor 's name . That evening I was glad of it . " " Barbara " was my first play . I am informed that nowadays managers read plays by unknown authors . In my young days they did n't . I read it to Rose Norreys one evening at her little fiat in Chelsea Gardens and , good com ? rade that she was , she took it herself to Charles Hawtrey and stood over him until he had finished it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fol ? lowing Tuesday at twelve o'clock noon ? he underlined " noon . " He was running " The Private Secretary " at the Globe . I got there twenty minutes early and walked up and down Hollywell Street until I heard Big Ben strike twelve . The stage doorkeeper said Mr. Hawtrey was n't in . I said I would wait . The doorkeeper ? a kindly soul , I wish I could remember his name ? put me a chair by the fire and gave me a thumbed copy of The Talisman . He said that , speaking for himself , he considered it the best of all Scott 's novels . Hawtrey turned lip at a quarter past three . The stage door ? keeper introduced us and explained things . " I 'm so sorry , " said Hawtrey . " I thought it was Monday . " His first wife told me that the night before their wedding his best man had ( unknown to Hawtrey ) put his watch on an hour and a quarter , with the result that he got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be known as " the late Mr. Charles . " But he was always so charming about it that one generally forgave him . He told me that he liked my little play immensely . There was only one fault he had to find : it was too short . I record the fact as being the only known instance in the history of the stage of a manager suggesting to an author that his play was not long enough . I prom ? ised to write in an extra scene . " My brother George will see you about terms , " he concluded as we shook hands . " He will want you to sell it out ? right . Take my tip and do n't do it . It 's just the sort of thing to catch on with the amateurs . " The " Producer " had not then ar ? rived . He was an American invention . The stage manager , together with the prompter and the author , used just to worry it out . I have never been able myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first , and for straightforward work is still among the best . If anything he is too painstaking . His method at rehearsal is to play all the parts himself , leaving the actor to copy him . On a certain occasion he had been coaching Gertrude Kingston , after this manner , for about a fortnight ; and then one morning , taking her aside , he asked her how she liked her part . " What part ? " asked Gertrude Kings ? ton . " What part ? " repeated Boucicault astonished . " Why your part ? the Countess . " " Oh , that , " answered Miss Kingston , " I thought you were playing that . " I take it Du Maurier 's dictum really sums up the matter : That a play that is worth producing produces itself . " Barbara " ran , on and off , for years and amateurs still play it . Following Charles Hawtrey 's advice I had refused to sell it outright , though his brother George went up to a hundred pounds and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play which I adapted from the French of Francois Coppee , was chiefly remarkable for in ? troducing Allan Aynesworth to the Lon ? don stage . He played Sandro , the lover I see that I describe him in the script as " a fine dashing good-looking young fel ? low . " Aynesworth was all that , right enough ; but on the first night he got stage fright . I was watching from the wings . I could see him getting more and more nervous and when he came to his big speech his memory snapped . I had prided myself upon that speech . I had done my best to put Coppee 's poetry into English blank verse . It was all about music and the sunrise and Heaven and Love ? ( some two pages of it alto ? gether . I could have forgiven him for forgetting it and drying up but , to my horror , he went on . He had it fixed in his mind that until the old man returned home he had to stand in the center of the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , here and there , were mine ; most of it his own ; a good deal of it verses and quotations that , I take it , he had learned at his mother 's knee . I shouted to Stuart Dawson , who was playing the old man , to go on and stop him . But he would finish and threw such fervor into the last few laps that at the end he received a fine round of applause . " Sorry I forgot the exact lines , " he said to me as he came off . " But I was determined not to let you down . " " Woodbarrow Farm " was my first full-sized play . Gertrude Kingston pro ? duced it at a matinee , playing herself the " Adventuress . " The trial matinee was a useful institution . I think it a pity it has dropped out . The manager would lend the theater in return for an option on the play ; and the leading parts could generally be arranged for on a like under ? standing . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play could be put before the public and judged : in the only way a. play can be judged ? through the test tube of an audience . Three out of four , in spite of friendly stalls , were seen to be no good ; the fourth won the prize . Bernard Partridge was the hero of " Woodbarrow Farm . " Conway had been cast for the part originally . That was another sad story . He had made his name as Romeo to Adelaide Neilson 's Juliet : the most Shakespearian Juliet I have ever seen , though Phyllis Neilson-Terry some years ago ran her close . It was plain before rehearsals were a week old that poor Conway would have to be replaced ; and the grim task of break ing it to him fell upon me . I called upon him early in the morning at the Ade1phi Hotel . He was standing with his back Lo me when I entered the room , leaning his head against the mantel ? piece . " I know what you 've come for , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought I 'd pulled myself together . I must have another try later on . " There is no catch in being the one to put an actor out of his part . Every ? body tries to shift the job on to somebody else . There was a young actress , I remember , at Terry 's Theater . She had been cast for a rattling good part on an unwise friend 's recommendation , and had agreed to rehearse on approval . It was her first London engagement . She was no good and we all of us agreed that the Producer was the fit and proper person to handle the situation . The Producer flatly refused ; and as we still worried him he gave us his reason . " I had to do it once , some years ago now , " he said . " She was an angelic-looking little creature . We had donethe usual damn silly trick of just choos ? ing her because of her appearance . She was n't bad , but she had n't the experi ? ence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She took it quite nicely . I went round to see her in the evening . ' She had a bed-sitting-room in a street off the King 's Road , Chelsea . We sat and chatted , afterwards , about the British drama in general , and she made me a cup of coffee . I flattered myself I had got out of it cheaply . She drowned herself that night walked clown the steps by Battersea Bridge into the river . This child reminds me of her . Somebody else will have to tell her . " Nobody did . We let her play the part . She was n't good . Dan Frohman took the play for America . He wrote me that he was stay ing at the Hotel Vic toria and would call to see me . We were living then in Alpha Place . My wife thought it would be an artful plan to lunch him well first and talk business with him afterwards . He accepted our invitation . We felt we had him in our hands . It was a gorgeous lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in French , I saw to the cocktails myself , and after there was Ch ? teau Lafitte and champagne . I can still see my wife 's face when Frohman in his grave emphatic way explained that his digestion did not allow him to lunch : but might he have a few of the greens and some dry toast with a glass of Apollinaris . But he smoked a cigar with me afterwards and gave me good terms for the play . The brothers Frohman , Charles and Dan , were good men to do business with . Their word was their bond . Charles used to say that no contract was ever drawn that a clever man could not get out of if he wanted to . Towards the end I never bothered him to sign any ? thing . We would fix the terms over a cigar , and shake hands . He was a natural-born sentimentalist ( most Jews are ) . He spent a good deal of his time when in England at Marlow where now stands a memorial to him . I had a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent a cottage at Bisham , near the Abbey . On a sunny afternoon one often found Charles sitting on his own grave in Marlow Churchyard ? or rather on the spot he hoped would one day be his grave : a pleasant six-foot ? into-four of English soil under the great willow that overhangs the river . He was still in negotiation for it the last time that I talked to him there . He went down in the Lusitania the year following . Frohman never pretended to know what the public wanted , and had a con ? tempt for anyone who did . " I 'll tell you what a play is going to do after I 've seen the second night 's returns , " he would say . " Some people will tell you before : but they 're mostly fools . " First-night receptions tell nothing ; first-nighters are a race apart . Like the Greeks they hanker after a new thing . The general public , on the other hand , are faithful to their old loves . I met Arthur Shirley one afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pro ? duced that evening at Drury Lane . " Feeling cheerful ? " I asked him . " Tolerably , " - be told me , " there are three rattling good situations in it . " " Capital , " I said , " you think they will go all right ? " " Well they ought to , " he answered , " they always have . " I wrote " The MacHaggis " in collabo ? ration with Eden Phillpotts . Penley ac ? cepted it but fell ill and handed the partover to Weeden Grussmith . Our heroine shocked the critics ? she rode a bicycle : it was unwomanly then to ride a bicycle . There were so many things in those days that were unwomanly to do ; it must have been quite difficult to be a woman and remain so day after day . She smoked a cigarette . The Devil must have been in us . Up till then only the adventuress had ever smoked a cigar ? ette . In the last act she said " damn " ; she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daily Telegraph . Once before , it is true , a lady ( Mrs. Huntley I think ) had said " damn " upon the stage but that was in a trans ? lation from the French . No one dreamed the day would come when Mrs. Pat Campbell would say " bloody . " But it is an age of progress , we are told . One blushes at the thought of what they may say next . She cost me a friend , that heroine of ours . By chance we christened the hussy Ewretta ; and it happened to be the name of an actress friend of mine , Ewretta Lawrence . She would n't believe we had n't done it with malice prepense . She never spoke to me again , for which I am sorry . It is al ? ways with fear and trembling that one chooses names for one 's less immaculate characters . During the run of Pinero 's " Mrs. Ebbsmith , " a real Mrs. Ebb-smith committed suicide . She thought that Pinero had been told her story and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The MacHaggis . " It was doing well when Penley suddenly closed the theater . His illness , it turned out , was mental . One of the things I best remember in " The MacHaggis " was Reeves Smith 's performance of a cheerful idiot . He was a delightful actor . He went to America soon after and they never let him come back . I met him there when on a lecturing tour . He was playing with Nazimova . I went behind to see him . " Forgive me , " I said , as soon as his dresser had left the room , " hut are n't you making him rather too noisy ? " They were playing Ibsen ? " The Master Builder , " I think . " Great heavens , " he answered . " You do n't think it 's my idea , do you ? It 's the new method over here . Everybody has to shout at the top of his voice ex ? cept the Star . ' How quiet and natural she is , ' they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillette invented it . " Alla Nazimova was drawing all New York . I found her somewhat changed from the quiet simple girl who with her husband ( they spelled the name " Nazi ? mof " then ) had knocked at our door in London with a letter of introduction from friends of ours in Russia . They had got themselves into trouble with the political police and had had to cut and run with barely time to pack a handbag . She spoke German but he spoke only Russian . They looked little more than boy and girl ; and he in his way was as beautiful as she was . That first evening we taught him an English sentence . He had said it in Russian , his eyes fixed on my wife . Alla translated it into Ger ? man , and then we told him the English for it , which was : " You remind me of my first love . " He repeated it till he had it perfect ; and subsequently quite a number of women mentioned to me casu ? ally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaffed him about it . He maintained it was not humbug . All beautiful women reminded him of his first . love . But his last love ! there was no one like her , and kneeling he kissed Alla Nazimof 's hand . He was rather a lovable , childish person . I took them to Tree and we fixed up a benefit performance for them at the Haymarket ; afterwards I got Frohman interested and he fathered them into America . For some reason the boy went back to Russia and was killed in a pogrom . The first person she asked me about when I saw her in New York was " Madame Needles , " as she had always called a small fox terrier of ours . They had been great friends and had played hunt the slipper " together . Madame Needles would go outside the room while Madame Na.zimof would hide one of her shoes and then open the door . Only once Needles failed to find it , and that was when Alla had sprinkled scent upon it . Another play Phillpotts and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard Partridge was to have played an up-to-date journalist who knew every ? thing and was not ashamed of it : an amusing fellow and Partridge would have played him to perfection . Alas and alack , I listened to advice . The author who listens to advice is lost . During the sec ? ond rehearsal your manager draws you aside . He has been talking the play over with his mother-in-law . It seems that she likes it immensely . She has only one suggestion to make ? or rather , two . He propounds them at some length . You explain that the adoptionof either would necessitate the rewriting of the piece . " Well , better do that , my dear boy , " he answers , " than have a failure . I 'm only advising you for your own good . " The producer does not agree with the manager 's mother-in-law . His advice is : " cut the other woman out altogether . Lighten the play and save a salary . " He slips his arm through yours . " If it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinues in a friendly undertone , " I dare-say you 're right . Unfortunately , we 've got to consider the great B. P. Now I 've had twenty years ' experience . . . " Later on the solicitor to the syndicate drops in and watches a rehearsal . He stumbles over the eat and reaches the stage . He has thought of an altera ? tion that may save the play . The next afternoon the stage doorkeeper stops you on your way out ; he also has been thinking the play over with the idea of helping you . They all know what the public want and how to give it to them : it is everybody 's secret except the au ? thor 's . I once overheard a producer talking to a friend concerning one of Barrie 's plays . " It was all no good , " he was saying . " Ile would n't take my advice . Of course the piece was successful ? in a. way , I admit . But think what it might have been . " Over the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young at producing and 1 listened to George Hawtrey . He meant well . He was a dear fellow in many respects . He always did mean well . He had discovered a genius made by the Creator on purpose to play our journalist . Partridge was my friend , he would not stand in the way of my mak ? ing my fortune ? of my making Phill pott 's fortune ? of my making every ? body 's fortune . To cut a sad story short , I put it to Partridge and of course he agreed . But he never forgave me , and I have always felt ashamed of my ? self for having done it . I wrote three plays for Marie Tem ? pest , two of which she never played in and the third she wished she had n't . It was her own fault : she wanted a serious play and I gave her one . She loved it . when I read it to her ? " Esther Cast-ways " was the name of it . She was magnificent in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course the swells would n't have it . She had made a groove for herself and her public were determined she should keep it . We ought to have known that , all of us . I did n't get on with her at rehearsals . I wore a red suit which I rather fancied , myself , but somehow it maddened her ; and I was obstinate and would n't change it , though she offered to buy it from me that she might burn it . A pity Marie Tempest ever got into that groove . She was a great actress pinned down to frocks and frivolity . Lillah McCarthy gave me an insight into female psychology when she told me that the first thing she did with a new part was to dress it .. She could not imagine how the woman would think and feel till she had visual ? ized the clothes she should wear . Then she began to understand the woman , working from the clothes inwards . I can understand because the Stranger in The Passing of the Third Floor Back " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , passing down a foggy street , pausing every now and then to glance up at a door . I did not see his face . It was his clothes that worried me . There was nothing out of the way about them . I could not make out why it was they seemed remarkable . I lost him at a corner , where the fog hung thick , and found myself wondering what he would have looked like if he had turned round and I had seen his face . I could not get him out of my mind , wan ? dering about the winter streets , and gradually he grew out of those curious clothes of his . " Miss Hobbs " ( or the " Kissing of Kate , " to give the play its original title ) , produced by Charles Frohman in Amer ? ica with Annie Russell as Kate and won ? derful old Mrs. Gilbert as Auntie , was my first real money-making success ifa gentleman may mention such detail . She has been a good child to me , God bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was living in Dresden at the time and the Kaiser sent me his con ? gratulations through an official of the Saxon Court , who brought it to me in a big envelope : so he could n't have been all bad . How the coming of the Great War was kept from us common people may be instanced by the production of my play " The Great Gamble " at the Haymarket six months before the guns went off . The scene was laid in Ger ? many . One of our chief characters was a dear old German Professor . German students in white caps sang German folk songs and drank lager beer . We had incidental music , specially written , in the German style . The hero had been edu cated in Germany and the heroine 's mother 's co-respondent was an Austrian . For a solid month we rehearsed that play without a suspicion that the Chan ? celleries of Europe were one and all making their secret preparations to ren ? der it a failure . Rehearsals are trying periods . Every ? body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . The question whether the actor should take three steps to the right , and pause with his left hand on the back of chair , center , before propos ? ing to the heroine ; or whether he should do it from the hearthrug , with his left elbow on the mantelpiece , may threaten the friendship of a lifetime . The author wants him to do it from the hearthrug ? is convinced that from there and there only can he convey to the heroine the depth and sincerity of his passion . The producer is positive that a true gentle ? man would walk round the top of the table and do it from behind a chair . The actor comes to the rescue . He " feels " he can do it only from the left-hand bottom corner of the table . " Oh , well , if you feel as strongly about it as all that , my dear boy , " says the producer , " that ends it . It 's you who 've got to play the part . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's right . It does seem to come better from there . " The rehearsal proceeds . Five minutes later the argument whether a father would naturally curse his child before or after she has taken off her hat provides a new crisis . I wrote " The Passing of the Third Floor Back " for David Warfield . I worked it out first as a short story . IL was John Murray , the publisher , who put the idea into my head of making it into a play ; and when I saw Warfield in " The Music Master " it seemed to me he was just the actor to play it . He would not have had the dignity and compelling force of Forbes-Robertson . Ile would have made the character win rather through tenderness and appeal . I was on a lecturing tour in America and had my agent , Miss Marbury , put me into touch with Warfield 's manager , Belaseo . It was in a Pullman car be ? tween Washington and New York that I sketched out the idea and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public would receive it but I thought I could do it without giving offence . Belasco agreed to trust me and on my return to England I got to work upon it . It an easy play to write : one rather than think it . I was living in a lonely part of the Chiltern Hills with great open spaces all around me , and that helped ; and at last it was finished . I had arranged to return to America to produce " Sylvia of the Letters , " a play I had written for Grace George ; and I took " The Passing " with me . I read it to Warfield and Belasco late one night at Belasco 's theater in New York . We had the house to ourselves and after ? wards we adjourned to Warfield 's club for supper . It was about three o'clock in the morning and the only thing we could get was cold beef and pickles . They were both tremendously impressed and we found ourselves talking in whis ? pers . I fancy Belasco got nervous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Miss Mar ? bury 's office , and he asked me to see Percy Anderson , the artist , when I got back to England and get him to make sketches for the characters . It was while he was drawing them , in his studio at Folkestone , that one morning Forbes-Robertson ( who had a house there ) dropped in upon him . Forbes was greatly interested in the sketches and Anderson showed him the play . Forbes-Robertson wrote me telling me of this , saying that if by any chance ar ? rangements between myself and Belasco fell through would I come and talk to him . His letter arrived a day after I had had one from Belasco , making it clear that he did not want , if possible , to be bound to his contract ; so for answer I called upon Forbes-Robertson in Bed ? ford Square and read the play to him and his wife . He too was nervous , but Gertrude Elliott swept all doubts aside and ended the matter . We got together as perfect a east as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Bookmaker , Ian Robertson as the Major , Edward Sass as the Jew , Agnes Thomas as Mrs. Sharpe , and Haidee Wright as the Painted Lady were all wonderful ; and Gertrude Elliott played the Slavey . I was afraid at first that her beauty and grace would hamper her ; but she over ? came these drawbacks and , even at re ? hearsal , invested the little slut with a spirituality that at times transfigured her . " We must have someone supremely beautiful for the part of Vivien , " said Forbes-Robertson . " There are six wo ? men in the play ; four of them have to be middle-aged and my wife has to dis ? guise herself . It 's our only chance . " I thought of Alice Crawford . Time was pressing and we sent her a wire . She had just left for a ball at the Piccadilly Hotel . " You must go to the ball , " said Forbes . I went as I was in a blue-serge suit , brown boots , and a collar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I made a sensation in the ballroom . I gathered that the people round about took me for a policeman inunnecessary plain clothes ; hut . I spotted Alice Crawford and beckoned her out ? side . A gentleman came up and asked if he could be of any use ? I take it the idea of bail was in his mind . We produced the play at Harrogate . The audience there mistook it for a farce . It was by the author of Three Men in a Boat , so they had been told . That evening the Robertsons and my ? self partook of a melancholy supper . In London on the first night the cur ? tain fell to dead silence which lasted so long that everybody thought the play must be a failure , and my wife began to cry . And then suddenly the cheering came and my wife dried her eyes . I was not present myself . I have shirked my own first nights ever since a play of mine was produced by Willard at the Garrick ? I thought the applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The argument is that if an author is willing to be applauded he must not object to being hissed . It may be logic but it is n't sense : as well say that because a man does not mind being patted on the back he ought not to object to being kicked . I remember the first night of one of Jones 's plays . There was a difference of opinion and Jones very properly did not appear . In the street I overheard some critics from the gallery talking : " Why did n't he come out , " said one , " and take his punishment like a man ? " Forbes-Robertson was doubtful about taking the play to America . It was his sister-in-law , Maxine Elliott , who in ? sisted . It was at her theater in New York that he opened . Mathieson Lang took it East . In China a most respectable Mandarin came round to see him afterwards and thanked him . " Had I been intending to do this night an evil deed , " he said , " / could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it off until to-morrow . "
