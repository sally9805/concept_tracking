Though they lack a legal status until Congress meets , the members of the Flood Control Committee of the House of Representatives gathered last week in Washington to begin drafting national legislation . The committee 's chairman , Representative Frank R. Reid of Illinois , declared at the outset that nothing but flood control would be undertaken , that party politics would be kept out . <P> Army engineers had not yet completed their survey and report on the Mississippi Basin , upon which the committee 's flood control bill must largely be based . So the committee heard witnesses and suggestions . The first hearing made it plain why Chairman Reid had called his meeting early . <P> Eleven special trains rumbled into Washington . Out poured some 2,000 politicians from Middle America . From North Dakota came Governor Arthur Gustav Sorlie . From New Orleans came enormously rotund Mayor Arthur J. O'Keefe . Governor Len Small of Illinois was there and Senators James Enos Watson of Indiana and Pat Harrison of Mississippi . There were business boosters from St. Louis , Vicksburg , Natchez , Baton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quincy . There were a policemen 's octet , a quartet of Pullman porters , an Italian band dressed as sailors . One and all wore huge bullseye badges inscribed " America First , " " Farm Relief , " " Inland Waterways to Double Exports , " " National Flood Control to Prevent Disasters . " Singing , grinning , shouting , backslapping , this horde converged upon the Mayflower Hotel in an uproarious phalanx around their loudly lumbering leader , Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill " ) Thompson of Chicago . <P> After calling on President Coolidge ( see p. 7 ) , Mayor Thompson strode into the caucus room of the House office building , where the Flood Control Committee waited . Representative Reid seemed impressed by his fellow Illinoisian and introduced him to the committee as " the man who knows more about the Mississippi Flood than any other man . " ( Cheers . ) " No man has done more for flood control than William Hale Thompson , " said Chairman Reid . ( More cheers . ) <P> Mayor Thompson then shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. is the only agency to handle flood control . " You ca n't bust a thousand banks in the Mississippi without putting the rent signs on Bill Thompson 's town , and that goes for every other town , " he shouted . <P> Other speakers tried to add to Mayor Thompson 's testimony about the flood . They were there , as he had shouted , " to crystallize sentiment . " But Chairman Reid 's " hearing " resolved itself into little more than roos-ter-boostering for Mayor Thompson . <P> Said enormous Mayor O'Keefe of New Orleans : " ' Big Bill ' will go down in history with Lincoln and Roosevelt ! " <P> Said onetime ( 1910-13 ) Senator Leroy Percy of Mississippi : " Big Bill Thompson . . . has made some enemies , but he 'll never make an enemy in the Mississippi Valley . "
