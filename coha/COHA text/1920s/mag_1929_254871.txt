( See front cover ) <P> A Senate clerk stepped inside the House Chamber last week and announced in a loud voice : " A quorum of the Senate is assembled and the Senate is ready to proceed to business . " The House membership was instantly convulsed with merriment . Sarcastic laughter rang to the glassed ceiling . Congressmen guffawed wildly , stamped their feet in derision , mockingly applauded . The juxtaposition of the words " Senate " and " business " even brought a smile to the bland face of Speaker Nicholas Longworth as he sat in his high presiding chair with the ornate mace of office fastened to the wall at his right . It was a fine professional joke . <P> Like his 434 colleagues in the House , Speaker Longworth was thoroughly cognizant of the Senate 's recent fumblings and gropings with the tariff . Even he had spoken critically of what parliamentary practice required him to refer to as " another body . " With his two trusted Lieutenants ( Floorleader John Quillan Tilson , Rules Chairman Bertrand H. Snell ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative despatch . <P> The public 's jibes and jeers at the Senate 's summer saunter through the tariff were enough to account for the Speaker 's state of mind . What perhaps amused him most , what certainly incensed the Senate most , was the frequent charge that , like Nero , the Senate had fiddled while U. S. business burned ( TIME , Dec. 2 ) . Like many another , the Speaker had observed the Neronic figure of Senate Leader Watson , helpless to extinguish the spreading blaze of Senate insurgency . <P> To amuse himself and guests often Speaker Longworth plays the violin , plays it well . But he would not fiddle at a fire . House Joint Resolution No. 133 gave the Speaker a splendid chance to contrast with the Senate 's sloth his own House 's prized efficiency . H. J. Res. 133 was the measure providing the 1% income tax reduction called for by President Hoover ( TIME , Dec. 9 ) . The Ways &; Means Committee had given it a favorable report in 30 minutes . For its discussion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the debate he did not have to listen , because he turned the chair over to Representative Sloan of Nebraska during the bill 's consideration in the Committee of the whole . Opposition to tax reduction came principally from Representatives Rankin of Mississippi , Ramseyer of Iowa , who argued heatedly but vainly for application of the surplus to public debt reduction . <P> When Speaker Longworth resumed his chair , there was no roll call on H. J. Res. 133 , only a rising vote . With his gavel handle the Speaker went through the motions of counting while a sharp-eyed clerk took the actual tally , whispered the result up to him for announcements : 282 to 17 . Tax reduction had been approved by the House four days after its introduction-a new record . <P> But there was more work to do and Speaker Longworth allowed the House no dalliance . Promptly taken up and considered was the first of the appropriation bills , $283,189,000 for the Interior Department .                  @ @ @
