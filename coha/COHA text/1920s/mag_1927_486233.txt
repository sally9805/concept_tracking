NONE CAN SAY how long six men in a water-tight compartment of submarine S-4 can withstand the horrors of dark and cold and the desperate fight for air . As we go to press , hundreds of men above them are working as they never worked before , diving into icy water , buffeted by wind and cold , employing every device known to science to help their comrades fast in the grip of the sea . And the sea waits . The sea can always wait ; it is secure , strong , without conscience or justice . It is a force that men have wrestled with for thousands of years ; if occasionally men seem to win in the unequal struggle , the sea has only to stretch out a finger , to breathe - in its sleep  --  and the victory is turned to defeat . At no time do man and the resources of modern science seem so helpless as in a battle with the sea . If we could speak to the six trapped in the ship , we could say only : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is idle to say : " Courage=and hurry ! " The sea is waiting . T HE " HOLIDAYS " ARE HERE once more . Christmas has come back to a world of coal strikes and million-dollar incomes , of salt pork at ten cents a pound and turkeyat sixty , of trips to Cuba in order properly to observe the season by obeisance to Bacchus and of midnight carols over the radio , in which millions of persons are asked to join . ChristmaS comes to tables laden with every sort of eatable and drinkable and to a bare hoard on which charity has spread a meager meal ; winter stars will shine on Soviet Russia on Christmas night , on a boy king of Rumania , on England struggling with the problems of a dole and a diminished Eastern trade , on a prosperous America  --  where if there are those who will go hungry they will have the decency to hide the fact in a land of plenty . Mussolini , in Italy , will pay his duty to the Queen of Heaven ; missionaries in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow men and women who have never heard of her . President Coolidge will keep Christmas , and Mr. William Randolph Hearst , and Mr. and Mrs. Blumberg in - the Bronx and Mrs. Vere de Vere on Park Avenue and the customers at Mr. Zero 's Tub will receive an extra-sized piece of pie and the national- bird will be a burnt offering from one end of this country to all the others . Men will worship a baby born in a stable , they will recall an ancient festival far more than two millennia old , they will take advantage of an opportunity to eat more than is good for them , they will hang glass balls on a young evergreen cut from the living forest , and separate children fighting over Christmas toys . In that section of the world described as " Christian " hardly a person but will pay tribute to Christmas with hand or heart or breath . A mad world . Merry Christmas to it ! m USSOLINI HAS FORBIDDEN officers in uniform to dance the Black Bottom ; Mussolini has decreed that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them must be abolished ; Mussolini has ordered that half of all the music played in public places in Italy must be Italian  --  including concert halls , movie houses , and dance halls . Mussolini has finally demanded that both officials and private individuals refrain from sending him Christmas gifts or greetings . It is with the greatest good-will , therefore , with singing hearts and happy voices , that we do not wish Mussolini a , Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ! Nor are we sending our best wishes for the Christmas season to the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company of Manchester , New Hampshire . A 10 per cent reduction in wages has been decided on by that organization , to affect everyone in the shop from the highest official to those at the very bottom . For the latter , 10 per cent is a considerable slice lopped off their weekly stipend , and the compensatory reduction of 10 per cent in rent for the company 's tenements by no means equalizes matters . However , reductions in wages do occur , particularly among textile workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the reduction itself , as of the extraordinary lack of imagination on the part of the officials who considered it necessary . It goes into effect on December 24 . ' December 24 is Christmas Eve . J UST AS TWO ARE NEEDED to make a quarrel , - so two are necessary to effect a peace . At the conference called by Secretary of- Labor Davis to consider the coal situation , representatives of the miners were present in full force  --  and representatives of the operators were largely absent . The principal operators in the Pennsylvania , Ohio , and West Virginia bituminous coal-fields failed to appear at the conference . The conference went on without them and , as might have been predicted , failed to reach any definite decision . Various expedients were suggested , among them the appointment of a " czar " for the industry  --  a Will Hays of the mines or possibly Old King Cole himself . But nothing really happened . The Secretary , according to the New York Times , " followed the usual methods of mediation , meeting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union separately . " We submit that no business was ever settled with the participants calling each other names in adjoining rooms . Secretary Davis is quoted as saying that if public opinion should be aroused - the Government could " compel action for the national good , however distasteful that action may temporarily be to the parties immediately affected . " But the operators knew that public opinion is asleep , that the miners in their tent colonies are cold and hungry , and that this Administration prefers talking to taking action . H OSPITALS IN COLORADO are demanding payment for miners , victims of the machine-guns of the State militia ; meetings are ; forbidden ; peaceful picketing is prohibited . Frank Palmer of the miners ' relief committee has been arrested , although no charge has been preferred against him , and a friend telegraphs The Nation that Palmer can not write in jail the second article on the Colorado strike which we had been expecting from him . A Pittsburgh university professor reports that 72475 miners near that city are living in barracks  --  some of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Colorado has its shivering tent colonies . It is a grim Christmas for the miners . A few friends have sent them Christmas gifts through the Emergency Committee for Miners Relief , 156 Fifth Avenue , New York City , and we cordially commend the committee to the attention of readers who have Christmas spirit and Christmas pennies to spare . H ENRY L. STIMSON has been named to fill Leonard Wood 's vacant post as Governor General of the Philippines . Mr. Stimson was a close friend of Governor Wood 's ; he proved his executive ability as Secretary of War under President Taft ; he showed another kind of ability when President Coolidge sent him to settle the mess in Nicaragua . There at least he grappled with the facts with both arms . He established a kind of peace , although he did it by maintaining a beaten President in office and buying off the bulk of the Liberal army . The Marine Corps , left in power , still has tough problems to solve . The Filipinos can hardly be treated as cavalierly , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to do so . He is no political featherweight , but a lawyer of high standing whose record has at times approached statesmanship . At one time he advocated a program of giving the Filipinos parliamentary responsibility , hoping , apparently , to prepare them for a status similar to that of Canada within the British Empire . If he still holds to that view he will find a light task ahead of him . The Filipinos are not  --  not yet , at any rate  --  antiAmerican , but they resented , as any people would resent , General Wood 's attempt to thrust them back into less freedom than they had attained and enjoyed . O KLAHOMA 'S DOGFIGHT has stopped for the Christmas holidays . That is sensible , but it is doubtful whether the holiday spirit will affect the spirit of the contestants . The House of Representatives , meeting after midnight in a hotel bedroom , has preferred charges against the Governor , and the Senate has convened as a court of impeachment to hear them . The Governor has withdrawn the militia whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he has not yet indicated any intention of replying to the indictment . To the original charges of maladministration has been added in public the allegation which has been whispered from the beginning  --  improper relations with his competent confidential secretary , Mrs. 0 . 0 . Hammonds . Readers of The Nation will recall Aldrich Blake 's illuminating discussion of her astrology and politics in our issue of September 14 . The legal right of a legislature to call itself into session is a matter for the courts to decide ; but the layman would expect a governor who believed that he had done his duty to court rather than oppose investigation of his official acts . N ATIONALIST CHINA has broken off relations with Soviet Russia , while the conservatives of the North continue doing business as usual . The obvious explanation of this ironic fact is that Russian trade is an important part of the business of North China , while the consulates in the South have little trade to attend to and become inevitably centers of propaganda . But there is more than this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiang Kai-shek from his voluntary exile in an effort to win new strength  --  is at Nanking , within gunfire of the Western battleships , and it is within gassing distance of that center of all that is poisonous in China , Shanghai . It can not exist in that area without the good-will of the British and other foreigners who control the Yangtze , and its expulsion of the Russians is in part an effort to win such good-will . It is also in part an expression of class differences within the Kuomintang , the Nationalist Party . In its youth that party succeeded in combining Chinese capitalists with Chinese labor and peasants . Today the gulf is deep between them , and the alliance of generals and bankers which has won control of the party organization is willing to go to any length to suppress proletarian movements among their fellow-countrymen . Scott Nearing 's article , elsewhere in this issue , tells the past of the story . The present chapter is being written in blood at Canton . In suppressing an attempt by labor forces to overthrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the battle was over  --  among them sixty women whose revolutionary crime was that they had bobbed hair . s TUDENTS ON THE LOOSE are never a pleasant sight . When they stop shows or throw chinaware they are a pest ; when , as in Rumania , they engage in anti-Semitic and anti-Hungarian riots in which numerous , victims are killed and many others badly injured they become a national menace . At a recent Rumanian national congress in Oradia Mare , a frontier town , student delegates from Bucharest killed at least four persons and wounded about forty , and at the same time looted newspaper offices , shops , and the residence of the local rabbi , who was beaten into insensibility . On the way back to the university the student group continued its depredations on property and its attacks on Jews and Hungarians and injured an American citizen . Local police made little if any effort to stop the raiders , and not until several days later did the Rumanian Government admit that the riots had really been the work of Rumanians . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had threatened - to withdraw credits from Rumanian industry as a result of the student excesses , the Government decided to act . When the student delegates returned to Bucharest several hundred of them were arrested ; a court martial for thirty-three of them has already begun ; and delinquent police officials have been replaced . It is impassible to say how effective these punitive measures will be . Students who live in a country where government authority rests in the hands of a tyrannical few will not easily learn tolerance . D ARKER GILBERT 'S third report as Agent General of Reparations is an optimistic document . He notes that while there were two million unemployed in Germany last January there are less than half a million today . The cost of living is rising , but an economist may regard that as an indication of a growing internal market . Virtually half the 1927 reparations payments were made in cash , as against two-thirds paid in kind last year . Mr. Gilbert still sees a need for caution and for administrative reform , but he credits the- Government with good-will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , and that commercial loans have a secondary security ; and he makes one pregnant remark , suggesting that there will be no final solution " until Germany has been given a definite task to perform on her own responsibility , without foreign supervision and without transfer protection . " In other words , lie wants the total of reparations finally fixed , and the responsibility for payment left entirely upon Germany 's shoulders . He wants to abolish his own job and eliminate all suggestion of coercion . The French take this hint mildly , because they see in another phrase a suggestion that - concurrently the whole question of inter-Allied debts should be reopened . T HE FLOOD-STRICKEN STATES of the Lower Mississippi Valley can find little consolation in the statement of President Coolidge that they are expected to bear part of the cost of future flood control . Adequate flood control will cost at least $200,000,000 . Should the local communities be asked to pay &third; of the total cost , their share would amount to approximately $67,000,000 . To demand this vast sum from virtually bankrupt communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that State and local taxes have had to he remitted  --  is plainly to demand the impossible . On this score the United States Chamber of Commerce has taken issue with the President , advocating that the federal-government assume the whole cost of controlling the Mississippi . The additional confusion which President Coolidge creates by connecting flood control with Western land reclamation is plainly due to a complete misunderstanding of the fundamentals of the situation . - I A READER IN MINNESOTA , Viggo Justesen , notes our commendation of William B. Munro for his protest against " bawling at the voters , " and writes to suggest a law making voting necessary under pain of losing the franchise . He proposes a constitutional amendment like this : Every qualified voter in a democracy has the duty of - suffrage placed upon him when he accepts the privilege . If he shirks his duty he shall also be denied the privilege . If he fails to avail himself of his opportunity the opportunity Shall be taken from him . For his first failure to vote his rights shall be revoked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the third , eight years , etc. - - Our correspondent thinks that with such legislation the electors who do not vote  --  reaching up to 50 per cent  --  would do so . Of these non-voters he says : Many of them fail to vote now merely because they feel they do not have time to become informed on political matters and consequently they will not cast an uninformed vote . That they will always vote wisely is highly improbable , but they are at least open to conviction . . . . There are enough of them to change the entire government if they saw fit . They could defeat Coolidge , and if shown him as he is , they would . Australia recently passed a law under which a qualified elector who fails to vote is fined $10 . In consequence the vote in 1925 was 90 per cent of the possible total instead of 60 per cent as in the last previous election . But we are unaware of any effect other than a larger number of ballots . C OMPULSORY VOTING , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States as little , we believe , as " bawling at the voters . " Indeed it is merely turning from persuasion to force . Our correspondent says of the 50 per cent- of non-voters : " They could defeat Coolidge , and if shown him as he is , they would . " But what is there in any kind of compulsory voting that would reveal Coolidge ' " as he is " ? Such a revelation , if profound enough to be important , would also disclose our political system as it is ; it would lay bare the deceptions and futilities of both of our major parties . When we plead to " get out the- issues " we have in mind such a revelation , such a revaluation , of our political problems and possibilities . It is our contention that no substantial progress is to be expected from either the Republican or the Democratic Party as now constituted . Their platforms are equally evasive of realities and their candidates are alike indifferent to the welfare of the majority- of the people . An exceptional candidate here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party and tends only to preserve the beliefs of the public in an outworn system . Our two major parties have degenerated into window-dressing for the control of the country by a privileged minority . The average man sees this more clearly than he is sometimes believed to do . But either he thinks himself powerless to effect any change or else he prefers to take a gambler 's chance for one of the big prizes instead of working to establish a more just system for all . In either case why go to the polls ? Hope lies , not in persuasion or compUlsion , but in more understanding , more courage , and more humanity . H ENRY NOEL BRAILSFORD , who is on his way to the United States , is an odd recruit in the army of English lecturers . He despises bunk ; he does not soft-soap his own empire ; he dares to criticize his own party . His editorship of the New Leader made it a force in international thinking in three continents ; and his realistic analysis of post-war Europe has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does itself honor in inviting him to lecture to its students . What Mr. Brailsford has to say of British labor , of the disrepute and future of democracy , of Europe 's role in Asia and America 's in Europe , will be worth hearing .
