txt The Department of Exercise Agriculture , always in interested in Kitchen . labor-the saving devices and methods of efficiency on the farm and in the home , has discovered that , J. housewife walks a lquarter of a mile when she bakes a lemon pie . One obliging woman wore a pedometer in the course of her travels while compounding the pastry . If it was good pie , that does not seem too far to walk for it ; but if suggestions for snugger kitchen arrangements are followed it could be reduced greatly . The department estimates that a cook who has her table , stove , sink and cupboards arranged in the best order could save a mile and a half on her daily kitchen mileage . Outside of large cities , where kitchens are still rooms , it is possible to take a morning constitutional while getting breakfast . In some New York kitchens the cook would be put to it to take more than one step in any direction . These tiny " cubbies " have slight relation to the wide , sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . They are laboratories , equipped for heating up the contents of tin cans . The stove is their smallest article of furniture , and the icebox is the largest . Architects as well as the housewives are interested in the department 's suggestion for convenience in the kitchen . If they can make it ' small , compact , handy as a ship 's galley , the housekeeper will be able to take more inspiring strolls than the walk between the drainboard and the china closet . In the current Congratulations Independent , Axon the THUR POUND rime Wave . surC veys what he calls " The Sunny Side of Crime . " Contrasting the bloodlessness of the general strike in England with the murderous violence of many minor strikes here , the decrease of English drunkenness , prostitution , burglary and manslaughter with our well-known crime wave , he still sees cause for national self-congratulation . When England was expanding industrially and imperially , corruption and crime were rampant as with us . " JACK Submit ! ) and Lord Om were acorns off the same lusty oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a piece with their low industrial efficiency and their ' coal subsidy , with their widespread preference for a socialistic " consumers ' society " over an individualistic " producers ' society " ; while our lawlessness is the seamy side of vigor and initiative . " I would gladly risk spasmodic outbreaks of crime for the sake of getting superior energy , more work , more taxable wealth . The bandit is as much a part of our social picture as the dole is of theirs . " In this view there is as much of truth as of paradox . Few on either side of the water would see in it ground for optimism . It is based on the assumption that nations , like individuals , are subject to the laws of growth and decay . Modern biology has taught us that if only the racial stock be kept vigorous there is no reason why nations and civilizations should not advance as steadily as , for example , the breed of domestic animals . England , like Greece , has de , clined through sending her most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of population by intelligence . But that is a question with which the world has as yet shown no disposition to grapple . Louts PASTEUR stands at the head of the panel of twelve world heroes of all times selected by a group of approximately 7,000 children in 560 schools of various nations . American schools were about one-third of the whole number , and four American names appeared among the honored twelve ? WASHINGTON , FRANKLIN , LINCOLN and W000sow Muer/ . First place for PASTEUR is explained by the solid vote presumably cast for him in France . There he has long enjoyed an easy primacy in newspaper and other popular ballotings over NAPOLEON and even over JOAN . The Maid of Orleans and GEORGE WASHINGTON are the only two names on the list associated with war , but they obviously are not of the conqueror type . The contest was conducted by the National Council for the Prevention of War among a selected group of children , a dozen to a school . Expressly or by implication , the questionnaire may have laid stress on heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would account for Great Britain being represented by FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE , DAVID LININGSTONE and GEORGE STEPHENSON . It would almost account for LINCOLN leading WASHINGTON among the American candidates and securing second place on the list after PASTEUR . It does not follow that history will now be rewritten on the basis of this latest poll , but at least one excellent result should be to make men like PASTEUR , ' like the inventor of the railroad and the great African explorer more vividly present to non-voting school children . If we must have propaganda , this is of the proper sort . Although the Making Change French are hayin ing their troubles with paper Modern China . money , French shopkeepers are not yet exposed to the trials of the shopkeepers of Peking since the troops of Wu and CHANG displaced those of the Christian General FENG . The new soldiers , who apparently are neither well clothed nor disciplined , are plentifully supplied with paper money of their own . This is nothing new in China , as the separate provinces and large cities have had their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate neighborhood . The novelty lies in the method of using the money . A soldier in need of " good money " ? i.e. , money issued by the Peking banks  --  will go into a store with a depreciated bill and will make a purchase of a few cents . In return ha demands change in the valid local currency . The shopkeeper , faced with an armed man known to have the ways of a bandit , usually makes no resistance . He pays the soldier , and writes it down on his books as a contribution to the war . But he immediately tells his neighbors , and all the shops In the street will soon be closed , or will display only articles that soldiers do not want . Reports from Peking indicate that the number of heavy stone figures offered for sale in the curiosity shops has greatly increased since the undisciplined troops have entered the city . Most of them are so heavy that the soldiers do not wish to be bothered with carrying them away . This arrangement apparently satisfies soldiers and storekeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eyes of the Chinese is one of the most important things in life .
