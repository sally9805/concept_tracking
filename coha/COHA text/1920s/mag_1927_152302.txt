Most potent of the puffs that blew corpulent William Hale Thompson into the mayoralty of Chicago last April was his loud cry : " Americanism ! " Once in office , the Mayor announced a crusade against School Superintendent William McAndrew , imported three years before from New York City because his recognized ability was needed to improve Chicago 's educational system . Mr. McAndrew had vexed the Mayor . He had interfered with the easy-going manner of awarding contracts for school buildings . He had taught that the U. S. Army retreated before the advance of the British on Washington , D. C. , in the War of 1812 . Roared Mayor Thompson : " I will run that whiskered pro-British stool pigeon of King George out of town ! " To do that His Honor replaced the members of the Board of Education with citizens upon whom he could rely . Soon the Board suspended Mr. McAndrew . <P> Eleven members constitute the Board . Six of them , a majority , could vote the superintendent out of office . Last week it appeared as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would vote Mr. McAndrew out . The trial seemed but a protracted formality . But it was of interest , outside the courtroom because this was the first time a superintendent of schools had ever been tried in Chicago . The charges were insubordination ( refusing to replace teachers who worked in the executive offices and sometimes substituted in the classroom , with civil service clerks ) and unpatriotism . Evidence adduced to prove the latter charge : " He refused to recommend to the School Board that the school children be permitted to donate small amounts of money for the purpose of reconditioning-the famous American battleship Old Ironsides . . . . He recommended history text books which contained pro-British propaganda and which omitted the name and exploits of many foreign and native-born heroes of the American Revolutionary War . " There were other charges-insolence , poisoning the minds of U. S. children against the government , etc . <P> Through a long afternoon filled with soporific technicalities that occasionally snorted into colorful blasphemy , the whiskered " stool pigeon of King George " tilted far back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Gump , Minerva Gump , etc. , etc . Above the edge of the newspaper , courtroom idlers could see Mr. McAndrew 's iron grey hair . Occasionally he put the newspaper down and chuckled . Then the idlers noted his white whiskers well tinged with red , his high color , his eyebrows that laid a direct black line across his forehead . <P> Superintendent McAndrew might avoid dull afternoons in court by simply resigning . This he refused to do . Said he : " They 'll fire me all right . But they 'll have to stage a burlesque show to do it ! "
