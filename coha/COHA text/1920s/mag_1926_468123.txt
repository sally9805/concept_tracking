THAT P. T. Barnum , whom America is accustomed to think of only as a showman , was generously endowed with a remarkable and manysided ability which would have made him dominant in any line of endeavor in which he chose to exert it is nowhere more clearly shown than in his record as a member of the Connecticut Legislature . This interesting episode occurred during a sort of interim in his career : a time with no great projects on hand and when , for the moment , he was able to drift comfortably with the current , concerned only with the routine affairs of his many and varied interests . The early days of struggle and hardship were far enough in the past to be merely a more or less interesting memory , along with the discovery of his showman 's ability , the experience with Joke Heth , travels with Signor Vivalla , and other , similar beginnings . It was something more than a score of years before , with only promises and a reputation for character and ability , that he had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few less since he had spent those interesting and eventful seasons in England and on the Continent with Tom Thumb , becoming the friend and acquaintance of notables and persons of accomplishment and distinction wherever he went . Fifteen years had elapsed since he had been the means of bringing the celebrated singer Jenny Lind to this country and creating one of the greatest sensations of his period , yet in 1865 when the simple entry , " P. T. Barnum , Showman . 55 , " was made in the membership list of the General Assembly of his state , there were still five years which must pass before he would begin his twenty years ' experience as a circus proprietor and inseparably identify his name with that business and " The Greatest Show on Earth . " It was a striking figure and personality sure to attract attention in any gathering , this showman with a world-wide reputation , just at the prime of life , who went up to Hartford from the shores of Long Island Sound in the spring of 1865 to share in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as mentally , with the type of head and shock of hair made familiar by Sumner and Webster portraits ; a person whose keen intellect and varied knowledge were valuable assets in the deliberations of any body of men , but who , in spite of repeated opportunities , had not hitherto allowed himself to be drawn into public office . Any handicap due to his lack of political experience was more than offset by his broad knowledge of human nature , his extensive experience on the lecture platform , his long familiarity with large affairs , his ability to approach a problem and think it straight through in a simple , sane manner , and his large sense of humor . Add to this his boldness and the fact that his viewpoint was essentially modern ? so much so that his stand and speeches on matters which came before him were wholly in line with present-day thought ? and one begins to realize why , from the first day , he was the outstanding figure of the session . To understand thoroughly his changed attitude toward taking part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , mistaken judgments , and terrible bitterness ? happily forgotten now ? which the long and weary years of Civil War had nurtured , the indefinite and disturbing rumors which filled the air , and the almost fanatical zeal with which the people of the North sought to improve the condition of the negroes . In his younger days Barnum had been a Jacksonian Democrat and an enthusiastic one , though with acute misgivings after the Kansas strifes of 1854 , but clinging to the party until secession threatened in 1860 , when he joined the Republicans . From the first breaking out of the war he eagerly supported the Union cause . Too old to enlist , he sent four substitutes in his place , contributed largely toward the support of agencies for the comfort and care of the men at the front , and in addition was an active member of the local " Wide-Awakes " and the Bridgeport " Prudential Committee . " Just as the southwestern portion of Connecticut was infested with Tories during the Revolution , so , during the Civil War , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among these was a son-in-law of Barnum who had been nominated as a candidate to the State Senate much to the annoyance of his famous father-in-law . One of the principal matters to come up in the Legislature was the question of ratifying the Amendment to the United States Constitution abolishing slavery . Barnum has said , and it was currently reported at the time , that the determining factors in his decision to go to the legislature were the fear that his son-in-law would he elected and vote against ratification and the hope that his own vote for it would , in a measure , save the reputation of the family . Although Barnum was Bridgeport 's most prominent citizen , it was as a representative of the town of Fairfield that he went to the Legislature , owing to thevicious Connecticut system , which still holds , of apportioning representation by towns instead of population ; in 1865 the boundary line between the towns of Bridgeport and Fairfield passed through the city of Bridgeport not far from its center , and Barnum lived just over the Fairfield side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any political excitement or campaign . He was nominated on the 24th of March . A local paper commenting on his candidacy the next day , said it was a " capital nomination " and observed that " those who have the good fortune to serve in the coming Legislature with Mr. Barnum will remember him as one of the most agreeable companions , while they will find that he will do every duty of a legislator in A No. 1 style . " A few days later the same sheet in discussing the son-in-law 's political chances said , " the indications at present are that the young man will hardly be permitted to occupy one of the mahogany seats in the Senate chamber this season . P. T. has got a sure thing but David 's chance is a leetie unsartain , ' so the people say . " This prediction proved correct , for when the ballots were counted on April 3rd , Barnum had a nice majority while the son-in-law was thoroughly defeated . II Connecticut polities , and often the best interests of the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads , a condition which had existed for some time and has not yet been entirely eradicated . But in contrast to the single ownership of to-day , Connecticut railroads were then the property of several independent companies which combined with , and against , one another to control legislation and secure to themselves many advantages . The evil was obvious , open , and scornful of any opposition . The Legislature convened a month after election . Barnum , like many of the older members , went to Hartford the night before it convened and , although he had never taken part in the process of legislation which proceeds in public on the floor of the House , or in the more subtle and sometimes more effective , but altogether private processes which precede these , he was , nevertheless , too accustomed to 1 sensing situations to be altogether at a disadvantage . He had not been many hours in the capital town before he detected the movements of wires which were setting the stage for the election of a speaker the next day . Two candidates were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convinced that one of them was being supported by a combination of railroad interests . Seeing in this " no promise of good to the community at large , " and believing a railroad company , like fire , " a good servant but a bad master , " lie talked the matter over with a few friends and decided to make an effort to defeat the railroad " ring " in caucus . He had never seen either of 1 the candidates and had no purpose of his own to serve in the matter except to oppose the influence of the railroads over legislation , a sinister domination of which he must have been well aware . How astute was his management of the ' affair can be judged by the fact that at a caucus , held later that night , in a controversy over the speakership , which a CI New Haven paper the next day spoke of as " quite animated , " he succeeded in defeating the railroad candidate and electing his rival . Surprise would be : , altogether too mild a term to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Barnum said that they had " had their own way in every legislature since the first railroad was laid down in Connecticut and to be beaten , fairly startled them " ; and no one familiar with the history of Connecticut 's railroads and legislatures can question the accuracy of the statement . Barnum 's advance to a leading position in the House was rapid . He had defeated the railroads in a most important move the night before the session opened ; he had persuaded the successful candidate for speaker to resist the tremendous pressure which was brought to bear on him by both parties and to displace the man whom the railroads had kept as chairman of the Railroad Committee for a number of years ; and , foreseeing a long contest with the railroad interests , he had refused the chairmanship of several important committees and accepted that of Agriculture which would demand but little of his time . The amateur was making progress . Of the major matters which were to come before this session of the Legislature that of ratifying the Federal Amendment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members and of the public generally . It was the first matter of any consequence to be taken up after the organization of the House . The bitterness caused by the war had grown even more bitter since the election in April because of the assassination and death of President Lincoln . The sentiment in favor of ratification was more determined than ever and there was little open opposition . The terse formal report of the action in the House , which most of the papers published the next day in fine print , read as follows : Mr. Welch called up the resolution ratifying the Constitutional Amendment . Mr. Barnum advocated its passage . The resolution was unanimously passed with great applause . But if thus disappeared the matter of the Federal Amendment with no voice raised against it , not so a proposal to strike the word " white " from the suffrage clause of the State Constitution . Opposition to this was real and determined ; and when the resolution came to a vote , with only three absent , the supporters of the measure bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The debate was impassioned on both sides . Barnum remained silent until several of the opposition had spoken , and then in a speech which shows his ability as a legislative debater he defended the resolution . Assuring the Speaker that he would not notice at any length the " declamation " of the " gentleman from Milford " because he had heard nothing from him " approaching to the dignity of argument , " and declaring that he agreed that the white man " sacredly cherished " the right of suffrage and for that reason wanted to see it extended to every " moral and educated man in the state regardless of color , " he went on to score his opponent for seeming to be determined to " always keep the negro a vessel of dishonor " while the Republican party proposed to " give him the opportunity of expanding his faculties and elevating himself to true manhood . " Then turning toward the " gentleman from Milford , " Barnum observed : " He says he hates , and abhors , and despises demagogism . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible evidence of that fact by the abandonment of slavery by his party as the mere trick and trap of the demagogue . " Referring to the Milford man 's assertion that negroes did not go to school in that town and he had found only two colored children among all the white pupils , Barnum commented that it was probably because it " was unsafe for a colored child to venture into a white school where the political opinion prevails which elected the gentleman from Milford . " A fear that the negroes , if given the suffrage , would continue to demand more and more until white boys would be marrying colored girls had been expressed by the Milford representative , and Barnum , seizing upon the statement , raised a laugh by declaring : I perfectly agree with the gentleman in his tastes . I should not like to have my children marry with ncgroes , but the gentleman may remember that when his sons propose to marry with negroes the black girls may have a word to say in objection to such a proposition . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored women may not be found sympathetic . Having thus , with a few keen thrusts , destroyed with ridicule the effect of his opponent 's speech , he suddenly became serious and eloquent , stressing the thankfulness he had felt for , and praising the " wisdom " of the " gentlemen of the opposition " in bowing to the " logic of events " a few days previously and not opposing the ratification of the National Amendment . Again he wanted to appeal to the " wisdom and loyalty " of his " Democratic friends , " he said , and explained that he used this term because he was , and always had been , an " out and out Democrat , " defining his democracy as a belief in " the greatest good of the greatest number ; for equal and exact justice to all men , and submission to the will of the majority . " Then driving directly at the meat of the resolution , he reminded the Democrats of the House that the whole matter resolved itself into the simple question of whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide the question of colored suffrage . " You may have your own ideas , " he told the opposition , " or be in doubt upon this subject , but surely no true Democrat will dare refuse permission to our fellow citizens to decide the question , " and he assured them that he was " amazed " that men " calling themselves Democrats " should oppose granting such a " democratic measure . " This appeal was followed by some analysis of the policy of giving the vote to the negro , and in doing so Barnum laid down the following maxim , more pertinent to-day , if anything , than it was sixty years ago , and applying not only to the negro but every other race as well . We can not ( he said ) afford to carry passengers and have them live under our government with no real interest in its perpetuity . Every man must he a joint owner . The best inhabitants of any town are the householders . The only safe inhabitants of a free country are educated citizens who vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , he assailed its authors . " Do they insist , " he asked , " that the negro is a beast ? " If that were the position they took , then he must admit that they were right in their reasoning that the negro could develop no inventive faculties or genius for the arts , " for , " he declared with biting sarcasm , " although the elephant may be taught to plow or the dog to carry your market basket by his teeth , you can not teach him to shave notes , to speculate on gold , or even to vote the falsely-called ' Democratic ticket , ' and certainly there is plenty of proof that very little more than instinct is necessary for the last operation . " Then harking back to the time when Connecticut had revised her constitution , he boldly and bluntly charged his native state with a sordid act . Pointing to New York as being a city where principal was studied much more than principle , and aldermen robbed by the tens of thousands , he said it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaveholders for the sake of South Carolina cotton ; and Connecticut was willing to eat her share of Southern dirt for her share of Southern trade . A treaty of political alliance was formed between Northern demagogues and Southern manstealers , and when the South Carolina whip was cracked , and the Connecticut brethren were informed in 1818 that the interests of Southern slavery demanded that no colored persons should be admitted as voters , the Northern lick-spittlers inserted the word " white " in our State Constitution . No other 1 New England state so demeaned herself , and now Connecticut Democrats are simply asked to permit the citizens of this state to express their opinion in regard to reinstating the colored man where our Revolutionary sires placed him under the Constitution . Once more turning to the statements I of the opposition , he noted its expressions of great love for white blood and wondered if it would be willing to let a mulatto vote half the time , a quadroon three-fourths , and an octoroon seven-eighths of the time . " If not , why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Democrats to prove their loyalty , their love of the Union and the people , and their democracy , of which they " spoke so flippantly , " by letting their " masters , the people , speak . " He assured his hearers that he was " no politician " but had gone to the Legislature solely for the honor of voting for the two amendments : one for driving slavery out of the country and the other to allow men of education to vote regardless of the color of their skins . He declared that being able to support those two measures was all the " glory " he asked " legislative wise " and that all he desired was to do what was right and prevent what was wrong . " I care nothing for any sect or party , as such , " he asserted , " I have no axes to grind , no logs to roll , no favors to ask . I believe in no expediency not predicated on justice , for in all things ? politics as well as everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whoever the men were who made up the membership of the House , whatever their political belief , they must have formed a new opinion of the showman as he stood there and said to them in closing : Certainly in the light of the great American spirit of liberty and equal rights which is sweeping over this country , and making the thrones of tyrants totter in the old world , no party can afford to carry slavery , either of body or mind . Knock off your manacles and let the man go free . Take down the blinds from his intellect and let in the light of education and Christian culture . When this is done you have developed a man . Give him the responsibility of a man , and the self-respect of a man , by granting him the right of suffrage . The two questions which had lured Barnum to the Legislature being satisfactorily out of the way , his interest was aroused by the mass of other measures and matters which , having been pushed aside for several years by war problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in motion several bills of his own . Connecticut at the time was enjoying the luxury of two capitals , and among the first things which Barnum did was to offer a resolution appointing a committee to " take into consideration the subject of one capital and one State House . " This resolution passed , but another recommending Hartford as the capital city , and one inviting cities and towns in the state to make proposals for building a new State House were tabled . The logic , the satire , and the plain speech of the gentleman from Fairfield , together with his readiness at any time to cross his rapier with any member on any measure , must have been a terrible and continuing nightmare to those members long accustomed to " putting things over " in the " regular way . " One day an act of incorporation was before the House , and Barnum attacked the many indiscriminate special charters being granted by the State . In defending his position he said : I know something of the way in which these things have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was represented to me as exceedingly prosperous with about half a million dollars of clear profit on hand. * I was thus induced to invest ; and it turned out that the concern was really about half a million dollars in debt -- and it cost me about half a million to get out of it . Now if any one says he has anything to do with clocks I shall strike . I only wanted to show how some of these things are managed . To a man accustomed to pushing matters along , the easy-going methods of the Legislature were irritating ; and when , toward the end of a week , a motion was made that adjournment be until Tuesday , Barnum was instantly on his feet with a motion that the House meet on Mondays and work the week through until Saturday noon , declaring that by so doing with a regular morning and *A reference to his unfortunate connection with the Jerome Clock Company of New Haven.afternoon session , the Legislature could finish its entire business in three weeks . The Barnum motion won , but soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until fall ; and again the member from Fairfield held the House to its job , declaring that he was for having Saturday and Sunday sessions if necessary to finish the work . Then in a few days came a bill to amend the State Constitution so the Legislature would meet in January instead of May . This change was urged on the ground that in the winter the members would have more leisure to attend to the business of legislation . The beauties of the winter season for legislation , " Mr. Barnum said in attacking the measure , " can be seen at Albany , where the lobbyists , having leisure at that time , are thicker than they are here , though they have invaded us here like the lice and frogs of Egypt ; but make this change and the lobby agents would be thicker than the mosquitoes in Stratford ? would be greater suckers ' and present longer ' bills . ' " Iv An interesting sidelight on the possibilities included in the operation of Connecticut laws and justice in 1865 is furnished by the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a matter which occasioned a long and bitter debate in the House and which gave Barnum an opportunity to have a large part in freeing a woman from what he termed a " systematized attempt to crucify a poor woman by technicalities . " The facts as brought out in the debate were as follows : A woman of good family had been stricken with typhoid fever when twenty-one and left in an emaciated and feeble condition from which she did not recover . She lived single until she was fifty-four when a man by the name of Sherwood , a bankrupt , who knew that she had been left ten thousand dollars by her people , persuaded her to marry him . When she refused to give him her money be succeeded on some sort of plea in getting an order from the Court directing her to do so ; and as she persisted in her refusal he had her sent to the Fairfield County jail and locked in a cell for contempt of court . There she stayed for six months . The Superior Court interfered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned again . Meanwhile the woman had applied for a divorce and carried her case to the Superior Court , which had refused to grant it . A bill had , therefore , been set in motion to grant her a divorce by special act of the Legislature . This bill the husband was opposing in an effort to keep the woman in jail until she gave him her money , even if it were the rest of her life . In some way he had been able to secure so much support that the majority report of the Committee on the bill was for him and against the woman . Although the couple lived in Fairfield , Barnum had no personal knowledge of the matter until Sherwood 's counsel called upon him to upbraid him for taking no interest in the case . Barnum listened to the lawyer , was convinced that there was something wrong about the affair , and the next day carefully investigated the whole thing for himself . The woman 's plea was opposed by some of the members on the ground that they must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce bill would interfere with power belonging to the Court , and by a third group who tried to have the matter referred to a special committee . But in the end the speeches of Barnum and his associates made their impression , and the divorce was granted by an overwhelming vote . A Bridgeport paper in its account of the case said : Mr. Barnum then showed how she was deceived , abused , sent to jail for months , etc. , for the sake of getting possession of her money . He spoke very eloquently on the subject , and the case as he exhibited it presented a vast amount of total depravity andbrutality in the character of the man Sherwood . The passage of the resolution will release the injured woman and give her rights which she can not obtain from the courts unless she sacrifices her property . V From the first it was evident that the railroad lobby was to be Barnum 's special quarry while in the Legislature and all through the long session he relentlessly fought it and its employers . Only those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they existed in Connecticut have controlled its Legislature and with the farreaching and daring methods which they have employed to accomplish their purpose can fully appreciate the amount of character and ability it took to stand up and openly defy them and expose their schemes as Barnum did in the early summer of 1865 . At first there were minor skirmishes ; such as a resolution of the gentleman from Harwinton ordering the Railroad Commissioners to report information which they seemed to be withholding touching the real condition of the road . Mr. Barnum was doubtful : I am not sure but here is a " contraband in the fence , " but I am in favor of an overhauling of the subject and would favor the resolution . Let them give us all the light they can . Let us hear how many accidents have occurred ; whether there was a narrow escape from one the other day at Norwalk bridge where they have but a single track and where the meeting trains came within ten feet of smashing one another . Let us have what light we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of these commissioners is in the employ of the same road . A few days later he appeared before the Railroad Committee in favor of certain bills and protests against the " tremendous influence " that was brought to bear on the Legislature by the railroad interests and their scores of paid attorneys , especially insisting on the immediate discharge of the State Railroad Commissioner , who had " hired himself " to the New York and New Haven Railroad as clerk in their office at a salary of one thousand five hundred dollars per year . So matters moved along with frequent small shots until the important railroad bill of the session came up , a bill which among other things had nicely concealed in it a scheme to raise commutation rates . Barnum at once loaded it with amendments and then , after waiting for its sponsor to defend it , he made a long speech attacking the railroads in the boldest and most caustic manner and with a wealth of information which must have caused enthusiasm among his friends and chagrin and anger among his opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to differ with the gentleman from New Haven for I esteem him a most honorable gentleman , one who desires to do exactly right by everybody , a man of sound judgment and unclouded intellect . Indeed , I am unable to account for the very objectionable bill under consideration , if it was written by him , except on the hypothesis that for this once , in the language of scripture , " too much learning bath made him mad . " Admitting that the railroads were a vast and increasing interest with great sums of money invested , he argued that when they declared annual dividends of " twelve to twenty per cent , " the public had interests as well , and the owners could not expect all the benefits . Instead of the railroad bill , " tied up with red tape and stowed away in the circumlocution office , " he urged his amendment which simply provided that the railroad should not make " fish of one and flesh of another . " " Increase your way fares as much as you please , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty , or a hundred per cent , but increase your commutation in just the same ratio . That is all we ask . " Waving in his hand a letter signed by hundreds of commuters living along the line of the New Haven road , who feared that an increase in commutationrates would depreciate their real estate , Barnum declared that it was the business of the Legislature to remove that fear by compelling the railroad to increase commutation rates only in the same ratio that it did way fares , and added to the discomfort of the railroad men by observing : " We ! mow they dare not charge five dollars fare from New Haven to New York , for steamboats would successfully compete with them , but all they dare increase their way fares we are willing they may in the same ratio increase prices of commutations . " He quoted Captain Brooks , of Bridgeport , as testifying before a railroad committee that the first president of the New Haven road had told him that the road 's plan was to induce thousands by low commutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years to raise the prices so high that not even steamboats could compete . This , Barnum declared , was still the intention of the road . " And , Mr. Speaker , " he said , " they have done meaner things than this . They have taken one of the railroad commissioners who swore to do justice between the people and the railroads , and have employed this railroad commissioner as a private clerk in their office in New Haven ! What is this but packing a jury ? And yet they want to leave all decisions to their clerks , the railroad commissioners . " Such refreshing truth and boldness were something entirely new in Connecticut 's Legislature , especially in regard to railroad matters , and must have had a most disturbing effect upon some of the listeners . Nevertheless , Barnum proceeded to attack the road 's lobby . Its paid attorneys , he said , were invading the Legislature worse than the lice and frogs of Egypt that crawled and hopped into the bed-chambers and kneading troughs of Pharaoh 's people . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State House stairs and even in their seats in this hall . One of these paid agents confessed , very reluctantly , under oath before the railroad committee that although in the pay of the New York and New Haven Railroad he tried to pack the railroad committee by getting a particular friend appointed chairman and that although he failed in that , he still succeeded in getting him on the committee . Yes , Mr. Speaker , and he did not even blush when he made this confession . I blush for him . Warning his hearers that men , either individually or collectively , would abuse power if allowed to possess it long without restraint , he cited the control which the Camden and Amboy railroad had over the Legislature of New Jersey , pointed out how railroad monopolies in New York and Pennsylvania had swayed the legislatures of those states , and insisted that the same unprincipled power was log-rolling and ax-grinding in the Connecticut Legislature , following his charge with the statement , " I own thousands of dollars ' worth of railroad stock and am no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it is no pleasant task to encounter the foul emissaries of corrupt incorporators I am determined to stay the plague and I call on honest legislators to join me in the good work . " It was a call that many a representative who heard it , however much his conscience might approve , had little stomach for accepting . Expressing regret for errors made or offense given in the heat of debate , he accused the railroad directors of having poured the " poison of personal slander " into the ears of various members of the House . Railroad sycophants , " he said , " go whining about asking members ' if Barnum has talked to them . ' But Barnum ' has no private ' talk ' about legislative affairs . What I say in one place I say here , openly , and am ready to proclaim it from the house-top . ' I am for justice and public right against sneaking hypocrisy , log-rolling , and axgrinding , and I know the noble and honest members of this assembly will go with me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , he deliberately withdrew his opposition and allowed it to pass . This was a bit of legislative strategy on the Showman 's part , based on a belief that the bill would never get through the Senate , a belief justified by the action of that body , which did not cast a single vote for it . This procedure cleared the way for a bill of his own which soon followed and which the New Haven road did everything in its power to defeat . This bill provided : No railroad company , which has had a system of commutation fares in force for more than four years , shall abolish , alter or modify the same , except for the regulation of prices charged for such commutation ; and such price shall , in no case , be raised to an extent that shall alter the ratio between such commutation and the rates then charged for way fare , on the railroad of such company . Barnum spent hours and days working to get support for his bill . It began to look as though it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House went over to the side of the railroad and , in spite of most patient and careful explanations of the importance of the measure , numbers of the members from the country districts did the same . Finally Barnum was assured that the bill would pass in the Senate if he could get it through the House , and he decided to make the attempt . The 13th of July was set as the time for closing debate on the measure and putting it to vote . When the time came there was much excitement around the capitol and all the passages leading to the room in which the House held its sessions were crowded with railroad lobbyists . There was more or less speechmaking on both sides , and then Barnum rose to defend his bill . It is a fascinating mental picture one forms of the moment ? the handsome and famous Showman , in full vigor , standing by his desk in the dingy old capitol building and defiantly accusing members before him , and the great and powerful companies whose interests they were serving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he emphasized the points at issue ; showed how the railroad had induced commuters to settle in Connecticut and an increase in the value of real estate had followed ; set forth the commuters ' rights in the matter ; ridiculed the idea that the road could not continue to carry them as it had done ; referred to the room they were in , " crowded with railroad lobbyists , " as an " admonition to all honest legislators " that it was " unsafe " to let the railroads alone to do as they pleased . There was a pause while every eye was fixed on the speaker and every ear in the room was strained to catch his words as he gathered himself to spring the sensation which was to drive home his argument . " These railroad gentleman , " he said after a moment or two , " absolutely deny any intention of raising the fares of commuters . But now , Mr. Speaker , I am going to expose their duplicity . I have had detectives on their track ; for men who plot against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof that they did , and do , intend to spring their trap upon the unprotected commuters . " Drawing from his pocket a couple of telegrams , one from New York and the other from Bridgeport , he read that the Directors of the New Haven Railroad the day before had held a secret meeting in New York and voted a twenty per cent raise in commutation rates in order to prevent the blocking of their plans if Barnum 's bill became law . Dropping the telegrams on his desk and addressing the Chair , he said : Now , Mr. Speaker , I know that these despatches are true ; I see a director of the New York and New Haven Railroad sitting in this hall ; I know that he knows they are true . If he will go before the Railroad Committee and make oath that he do n't know that such a meeting took place yesterday for exactly this purpose , I will forfeit and pay one thousand dollars to the families of poor soldiers in this city . In consideration of this attempt to forestall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bill now under consideration by adding after the word " ratio , " thewords , " as it existed on the first day of July , 1865 . " In this way we shall cut off any action which these sleek gentlemen may have taken yesterday . It is now evident that they have set a trap for this Legislature and I propose that we spring the trap and see if we can not catch these wily railroad directors in it . Then taking advantage of the opposition 's astonishment and the dramatic moment which he had created , he called out : " Mr. Speaker , I move the previous question . " The bill and its amendment passed with a rush . The showman had beaten the railroads in their own stronghold . VI A few days later the session adjourned . It had been the longest one held in Connecticut up to that time and one of the most important . With its close Barnum had planned to end his legislative experience ; but one of the directors of the New Haven road lived in Fairfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never go to the Legislature again . Such a challenge could not be ignored . Barnum was nominated and in spite of all the director 's influence and exertions was elected , and went back to Hartford at the opening of . the 1866 session . In contrast to the previous one , little of major importance came before it , and Barnum was content to let matters take their course except when he had an opportunity to prod the railroad interests . One such was furnished by a bill which sought to enable the Shore Line road to bridge the Connecticut River . This was opposed by the Hartford road . In speaking on the measure Barnum said : Desperate efforts have been made for the last few weeks by a large lobby to prevent this bridge being built and I am surprised that if the only interest to be affected is that of navigation such efforts should be made . The trouble is that the Hartford railroad is going to be affected . It is railroad against railroad . The navigation which is to be affected is the navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are imaginary . The arguments against the bridge are all old-fogey ones . The great cry on the question is that Hartford will be affected . Yes , it is Hartford . The State had better have been called the State of Hartford and the town of Connecticut . I like Hartford . I like to see them hang together . I would not like to see but a few of them hanged separate . I believe , as Cushing said , the iron horse is a democrat . I believe it is a democrat which will cross this river and that too on a bridge . There are legislators here who last night had speeches on their tongues in favor of this bridge who are now going to speak against it . Hartford has come down and shown them three golden visions and their conversions have been more sudden than St. Paul 's . The great bridge on which the Shore Line trains cross the Connecticut is proof of the soundness of his judgment , but it remained for another legislature to give the permission for its building . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 180 and 1866 or of one in 1879 which he attended , to inject a note of humor into the day 's work or to poke a bit of good-natured fun at associates who took themselves too seriously . In a discussion of a proposition to meet in the winter he observed that any body of men who met in winter in the State House then in use would never meet again . " They would be frozen to death . Whether that would be a loss or not is a question . " One day he interrupted proceedings with remarks about his fondness for catering to public curiosity , and then as the members were beginning to wonder what it was all about , explained that he saw a United States Senator in the hall and he thought his associates would like to hear from him . The speaker declared a recess and the Senator made a speech . A dull debate on taxing the property of educational , religious , and benevolent institutions was dragging along when Barnum rose in his place and solemnly offered the following amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being an acknowledged public educator , shall be entitled to the same exemptions from taxation that are extended to other moral and religious institutions . " After the roars of laughter had subsided he said if the bill were to pass he wanted his amendment adopted because he was entitled to be classed with all conspicuously great moral establishments . He would , however , withdraw the amendment . A bill of his to prevent slaughterhouses within a hundred rods of a highway shows present-day views of sanitation ; his idea of vicious methods of competition and his sense of fair play are evident in a bill to oblige railroads to transport rails and ties for one another ; and that he was constantly thinking fifty years ahead of this time is shown by his introduction of a bill in 1879 to do away with capital punishment . Barnum 's record as a legislator was one of definite accomplishment such as no man need be ashamed of . It is doubtful if a fairer analysis of his service could be made than the following which appeared in a Connecticut paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Barnum went to the Legislature wholly unaccustomed to that kind of business ; and although he had to cope with those who added to knowledge , capacity , and legal acumen , entire familiarity with the routine of legislation , yet following his ideas of right , regardless of what plans those ideas might interfere with , he soon became such a power in the House and gained the confidence of the members by his common sense views and able elucidation of them , that he has come out victor in several of the strongest contests in the House . The people of Connecticut are under great obligations to him for breaking down the railroad combinations which have so long infested the Legislature and sought in various ways to control it . When the members of the House return to their homes it will be with more exalted ideas of P. T. Barnum and his character for frankness , intelligence , and uprightness than they felt before seeing him when they had nothing to judge him by except his much abused reputation as a showman .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
