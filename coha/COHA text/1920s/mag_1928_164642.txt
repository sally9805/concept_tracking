An eight-oared crew was to be selected to represent the U. S. at the Olympic Games . Canada had already picked the Argonaut Rowing Club of Toronto . The U. S. problem was to find out whether undefeated California or undefeated Yale could be defeated . They met on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia to decide . California took the lead at the start . It was a small lead-one-half a length-sometimes it grew to three-quarters of a length , but never did anybody see any open water between the shells of California and Yale . They were going along at a high beat of about 40 strokes a minute ; yet the two crews seemed tied together , side-by-side , by a rubber band that would stretch just a little . A short race ( 2,000 metres ) , it was soon to end . Coxswain Stewart of Yale pulled out his red handkerchief , which told the eight boys facing him that they would have to sprint like mad . But they had been sprinting all along , and so had California . The rubber band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . . . . It was decided ; the eight boys and Coxswain Blessing from California ( University of ) will represent the U. S. at the Olympic Games. * <P> Two conclusions were drawn from the Olympic track and field trials at Cambridge , Mass. : 1 ) the U. S. team is of sufficient strength to outscore its opponents in the Olympics ; 2 ) many of the ablest performers on the team have their homes in California . <P> There is 18-year-old Frank Wykoff of Glendale High School in southern California , who defeated all comers in the 100-metre trials and four times equalled the Olympic record ( 10 ? seconds ) . Charles Paddock , whose amateur status is being investigated , was too slow to qualify in the 100-metre dash , but he finished second to Charles Borah , also of California , in the 200-metre finals and made the team . <P> Other Californians who qualified are Lee Barnes in the pole vault , Robert King in the high jump , Clarence Houser in the discus throw , Levi Casey in the hop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken in the trials : Edward Hamm of Georgia Tech broad-jumped 25 feet , 11 ? inches ; Lloyd Hahn of the Boston A. C. ran 800-metres in 1 minute , 51 seconds . <P> <P> *A Yale crew was victorious at the Olympic Games , four years ago .
