Triumphantly passed by the Chamber , 450 to 22 and by the Senate 256 to 3 last week , was a bill , fixing the value of one paper franc at 65.5 milligrams of gold , 900/1,000ths fine . <P> Persons without milligrams of gold , but prepared to offer dollars , will now receive 25 francs , 52 centimes-no more , no less-for every dollar that they care to sell . <P> Thus , Prime Minister Raymond Poincare , the great War President of France , puts the last cap on a monumental achievement . When he took office 23 months ago , the franc had lost 9/10 of its pre-War value ( 5 francs to $1 ) . By soundest generalship , some retrenchments , and chiefly by the sheer confidence-inspiring power of his personality , M. Poincare caused the franc to double in value without resorting to a foreign loan ( TIME , January 3 , 1927 ) . That value has been kept stable de facto for 18 months ; and now it becomes the approximate stabilized value de jure . For the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in relatively large blocs . This will be followed by a new gold coinage and soon almost every French peasant will again jingle gold in his sock . The gold bullion prelude to gold coins is well precedented since the same procedure was followed when Great Britain put the pound back in gold ( TIME , May 18 , 1925 ) .
