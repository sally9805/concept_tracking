Edward W. Bok 's offer of $100,000 to the person or organization offering a practical plan for world peace took immediate hold on the imagination . Before the policy committee appointed by Mr. Bok ( TIME , July 9 ) could draw up the rules of the contest , several hundred plans had been submitted . The committee , whose headquarters are at 342 Madison Avenue , Manhattan , announced that all these plans would be returned to their originators until the conditions of submission had been drawn up and published . <P> Meanwhile Mr. Bok deposited $100,000 in securities with the Garvin Trust Company of Philadelphia . Also , the Policy Committee has invited the cooperation of several organizations , who will broadcast the conditions of the contest and , when finally a plan is selected , will have their members vote for or against the chosen plan , as a test of public sentiment . <P> The plans submitted immediately after the contest was announced were chiefly of the ready-made variety ; i. e. , plans which people with specific cure-alls for the world 's ills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made public none of the plans , but some of the authors of plans were not so modest . <P> Among the plans published were 1 ) to buy peace by having the Government cancel its debts and make foreign loans on condition that the favored governments destroy all war materials , 2 ) to deprive Congress of power to raise funds for war , to abolish the Army and Navy , and to make it illegal for any nation to prepare , declare or carry on warfare , 3 ) to make public property of " oil , minerals , trade and territory " which changed hands in the late war ( this plan was proposed editorially by The New York Call ( Labor ) , which added : " We will never get this through the heads of the Senators , but we hope to have it understood by the masses in time .
