On July 14 , 1789 , the Bastille fell and almost each year for 135 years the French have celebrated the event , for to them it symbolized Liberty . <P> This year , throughout France , the usual delirious festivities were held . At Paris the people danced upon the pavements and at night the sky was lit with fireworks . <P> President Doumergue drove from the Palais d'Elyses to the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs Elyses . Here , in the presence of the Ministers , he deposited a wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Poilu , instead of attending the usual military revue . <P> The records of la mairie d'Aigues-Vives ( Mayor 's office in small village in the Department of Arige ) aver that M. Doumergue was christened Pierre-Paul-Henri-Gaston . His family have apparently been Calvinists ( Protestants ) since the 16th Century , when the Picardian Jean Calvin caused a commotion by publishing his Institutio Christianae religionis . <P> M. Gaston is a bachelor , a fact which caused his sister to remark : " Gaston will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry . He always said that our mother and I were enough and that my children were as his ; but they do n't bear the name of Doumergue , and for such a long , long time there have been Doumergues in this house !

Gaston is a devotee . <P> Accident more than anything placed the erstwhile President of the Senate in the Presidential Chair ; but something worth while caused him to rise from a village school boy , from an obscure lawyer , to un homme d ' tat and a respected Senator . In Indo-China as Magistrate , in Algeria as Justice of the Peace , as Minister at various times of the Colonies , of Commerce , of Education , or of Foreign Affairs , his low , slow and simple voice never failed to impress men . He speaks with a certain ardor that compels , and with a knowledge of his subject that only brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sympathigue , which says much for his character . In appearance he resembles a jovial and prosperous farmer ; his features are hardly handsome , for , like his Premier , he is inclined to corpulency and is below medium height . But his iron-grey hair , his penetrating eyes and his smiling countenance go far to give him I'air distingu . Of him his intimates say : " He is the President of the French Republic , but he is also the most simple and modest of its citizens . " <P> In politics , he is what may conveniently be termed a moderate radical , and thereby represents a traditional policy of he Midi ( Southern France ) . For many years he has represented Nimes ( Department of the Gard ) first as Dput and then as Snateur . In a recent speech to " les enfants du Gard , " thanking them for their support , M. Gaston said :
