One night last week a man was standing in front of a drug store in Lyons , Ga . It was twilight , and this man , of middle age , strongly built , in a dark suit with a soft hat pulled over one eye , delayed a minute on the pavement in front of the drug store , smoking a cigar and looking at nothing at all , perhaps , but the dusk rising out of the ground , or perhaps at three touring cars , filled with men , which drew up across the street . The men got out of the cars . They knocked down the man with the cigar . There was no commotion . They threw him into the back seat of one of the cars and drove away . <P> Jellybeans+ who observed this incident from the window of the drug store , discussed it with a bantering uneasiness . They knew the man-Wimberly E. Brown , an attorney . He had assisted at the prosecution of five men , allegedly members of a hooded gang who shot one Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stolen some syrup . Attorney Brown did his best to have the men convicted of murder . They were all acquitted . Nobody in Toombs County cared to change shoes with Attorney Brown after that . Something would happen to him , sure , and what interested the jellybeans was merely the question of whether the men in the touring cars were the same men who murdered Willie Wilson . The murderers of Wilson were said to have been Klansmen , but whereas the men in the cars had flour bags over their heads and " K. K. K. " painted on their chests , everyone knew that that was not the Klan uniform . <P> The jellybeans waited . After about an hour there was a roar down the road and the cars reappeared . Nearing the drug store , one of them slowed down ; a door opened , and the man they had taken away fell out onto the pavement . He was alive but he could not talk . His wrists were bitten where a rope had held them ; his coat was gone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forked red ridges left by a flogging . <P> " Mobs with heads covered with flour sacks shall not rule Georgia . . . . If the regular processes of the courts fail to curb these outrages I will declare martial law . . . . $1,000 for the first conviction . " Thus Gov . Clifford M. Walker when he heard of the flogging of Mr. Brown . <P> To say that such hooded mobs rule Georgia is an exaggeration . To say that they rule Toombs County is almost true . For many months that county has been haunted by a horror . Nathan Bedford Forrest , Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia , called the flogging of Lawyer Brown " an unspeakable outrage , " said that the perpetrators were " imitation Klansmen . " Well schooled to their role , the floggers could hardly have been told from authentic members . Recent reports tell of the following knockings on the doors of lonely houses in Toombs County :                 @ @ @ @
