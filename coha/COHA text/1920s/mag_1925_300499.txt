At Dublin , correspondents and cinema-cameramen roosted throughout the week near the Dil Eireann , obstreperous lower House of the Irish Free State Parliament . The hours fled breathlessly because a certain bland clause in the Free State Constitution provides that every Irish M. P. must take an oath of allegiance to King George-which has caused Eamonn de Valera and 38 other elected Republican deputies to absent themselves from the Dil in protest . Last week they were expected to appear at any moment . Rumor had it that they would force their way into the Dil without taking the oath . News-mongers chuckled at the thought of filing lurid three-column despatches . <P> The motive power behind all these rumors was a document signed at London ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) by the representatives of Great Britain , Ulster and the Irish Free State . It provides that the boundary between northern and southern Ireland shall remain as at present , and that Britain shall relinquish all claims upon the Free State for payment of Ireland 's part of the British War debt . The agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons and the Ulster Chamber . It awaited only the ratification of the Dil before becoming operative . Why then , so much clamor ? Simply because the Irish Republicans have fought long and fiercely to bring back " the lost Catholic provinces of Ulster " into the Free State . Should the present boundary and territorial status quo be recognized as permanent by the Dil , these aspirations would go glimmering . Hot-head De Valera cried : " Shall our sympathizers in Ulster be surrendered as helots to their enemies ? Shall we stomach a dishonorable peace because the Free State is to be a little pampered in respect to her debts by England ? " <P> Eventually the stomaching was accomplished . The De Valerists , threatened by President Cosgrave of the Irish Free State with the dissolution of the Dil if they attempted strong-arm politics , continued to " abstain " and the measure eventually passed 71 to 20 . <P> Throughout the Empire the keenest relief was expressed on every hand . Premier Baldwin declared : " Had there been no settlement of the boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resulted . " Replying to those who carped at England 's virtually " buying peace " by relinquishing her claims upon the Free State , he cried : " Where does the interest of Great Britain lie ! Does it lie in keeping the South of Ireland poor and trying to squeeze a debt out of her ? As a matter of pure business the interest of this country lies in a prosperous and peaceful Ireland . " <P> Since the Irish Free State is admittedly too poor ever to pay the undetermined hundreds of millions of pounds which it might eventually have been adjudged to owe the Empire , Mr. Baldwin 's logic was widely considered irrefutable . President Cosgrave spoke of the agreement as marking " a turning point in Irish history " and likely to strengthen the Free State 's unstable credit . Sir James Craig , Premier of Ulster , went so far as to propose that the Ulster border police be disbanded as a definite fruition of the present accord .               @ @ @ @ @ @
