One of the few really consistently able southern political despots is Senator Furnifold M. Simmons , North Carolina 's " machine " boss and senior minority member of the Senate Committee on Finance . Last week he announced that the Democrats would demand a tax cut of $560,000,000 in the autumn final session of the 69th Congress . Said the Senator : <P> " Certain circumstances connected with the last reduction aroused suspicion that the Administration , supposedly for political reasons , had deliberately planned two separate reductions : a small one for use in the bi-election campaign this year and a bigger one to become effective immediately preceding the Presidential campaign and election of 1928 . However that may be , with an actual and estimated surplus of $562,000,000 available for reduction at the coming session of Congress it is difficult to discover any good reason for withholding and postponing that reduction for a full year , except to promote the ambition of Republican Presidential aspirants and to provide political capital for the Republican Party .
