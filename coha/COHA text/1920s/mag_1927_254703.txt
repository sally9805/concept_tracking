When term classes ended last week for students of Holy Cross , Jesuit college at Worcester , Mass. , a gentle-faced German student hastened to the train that would start him toward Germany . He was Anton Lang II , second son of the able Christus of the Passion Players of Oberammergau ( see p. 19 ) .
