One M. Fiquet , brisk pater familias and councilor of the Folie-Mricourt precinct of the Department of the Seine , suddenly became alarmed lest Parisian schoolchildren had not enough time to consume the formidable French mid-day meal . So he appealed to the Prefect of the Seine , M. Juillard , grizzled repository of safety and welfare . <P> The paternal prefect immediately ordered a referendum of the worried families of the 260,000 schoolchildren of Paris . The present school-hours are 8:30 to 11:30 a. m. and 1 to 4 p. m . Was the hour and a half lunch-hour satisfactory to the mama and papa or little Jacques or Suzanne ? Where papa was a workman he said " Mais non ! " He came home at 12 . Why should his children come home half an hour earlier ? The working classes voted solidly for a 12 to 2 lunch-hour , giving papa a chance to see his child and the child a chance to eat and digest the daily pot-au-feu , broth with huge chunks of sour Parisian bread . A strong minority voted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote at all . Teachers became alarmed lest they should be required to work more than their statutory six hours a day . There were present all the ingredients of a seething , insoluble , good French row . <P> Were MM . Fiquet and Juillard perplexed ? Pas de tout . Fiquet had an inspiration-a zoning system . Let the children of the poor eat with their families from 12 to 2 . Let the children of the middle-classes eat from 11:30 to 1:30 . Sensible , intricate , flexible , the system to be evolved will pay obeisance to the chief gods of the French bureaucracy : omnipresent paternalism , involved elaboration of red tape , with a strong substratum of invaluable commonsense .
