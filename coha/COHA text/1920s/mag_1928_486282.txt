Why is Mr. Kellogg building dreadnaughts and cruisers ? He says : " Thou shalt not kill , " but he also says : " Fill your waist-belt with knives and pistols so as to be ready to kill . " T HUS SPOKE DAVID LLOYD GEORGE at the opening of a remarkable " peace campaign " initiated by the Liberal Party in England on October 8 . Mr. Lloyd George added that the nations of the world were heading straight for war , not because any one wanted it , but because no one had the courage to stop the runaway horses of the chariot of war . Unless , he continued , nations soon definitely and finally committed themselves to peaceful means of settling disputes , " God alone can save the world from a more terrible war than has ever been seem " Unquestionably true , but it is again the so-called statesmen , and not God or the nations , that are drifting into war ; the people are powerless . The very day that Lloyd George spoke Mussolini ridiculed the Kellogg peace pact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " he said , " that the whole world is again arming itself . The number of bayonets and cannon is constantly increasing , yet everybody speaks of peace . " He is himself one of the greatest menaces to peace and , of course , preaches the bad Rooseveltian doctrine of speaking softly ? when not roughly  --  and of carrying a big stick . A S FOR OUR AMERICAN RELATIONS with England , they are getting worse . Field Marshal Sir William Robertson has made a speech pointing out that we are drifting into the same situation as were Germany and England prior to the war and declaring that our actions are " disquieting . " Washington replies to this that the Government regards such speeches as " deliberate English propaganda " to hamper our building program and " about the last straw so far as official patience here is concerned . " ( New York Herald Tribune , December 7 . ) In France $80,000 has just been voted from the secret funds for special aviation purposes , only Socialists and Communists dissenting . Every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the war-making power , and that war is more threatening . How shocking it is , therefore , that the Federal Council of Churches , which has just elected that admirable social statesman Bishop Francis J. McConnell as its presiding officer , could not vote at its sixth quadrennial session on December 7 that there should be complete " renunciation of war and the refusal of the church of Christ as an institution to be used as an instrument or an agency in support of war . " Some delegates suggested the inevitable " defensive-war " red herring , with the result that the whole matter was referred to the new quadrennial session in 1932 ! By that time hell may be firmly established on earth and the need for any churches ended . It was Lloyd George who on July 28 , 1922 , correctly declared that if the " churches of Christ throughout England and America allow that another war to fructify , they had better close their doors . The next war . . . will be a war on civilization itself . " And the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M EANWHILE THE PRESIDENT has suddenly thrown his influence openly into the scale on behalf of the fifteen new cruisers and the Kellogg pact . The " official spokesman " has been discarded . Mr. Coolidge himself told the press of Mr. Kellogg 's testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , although such testimony is usually considered confidential . He is also the source of the news that he has received thousands of letters on behalf of the Kellogg pact . It is now being claimed in Washington that the fifteen cruisers are merely replacements of ships more than twenty years old and that if built we shall still have less limitation of fleets . The number of protests against the cruiser plan is not announced by the President , but there is every reason to believe that they are very numerous , especially from men in pulpits . In Washington journalistic circles opinion is divided , but there is a growing feeling that nothing will come out of this dying Congress except the appropriation bills . This would be remarkable because there is no real opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The general attitude is that a vote for it is like a vote for the Ten Commandments , perfectly proper and in no wise affecting the existing status of the world . N OT ONLY THE LIBERAL PRESS but conservative papers like the London Express have now turned against the policy of Austen Chamberlain in making Great Britain merely an echo of France 's wishes in regard to reparations and disarmament . Says the Expi ess : " If he continues to maintain that reparations and evacuation are indissolubly linked , and that we can not leave the Rhineland until all the terms of the Treaty of Versailles have been carried out to the letter , then he will not be speaking for Britain , and the outside world should know it . " The Manchester Guardian naturally demands to know whether the protocol with its definite promise of evacuation in the event of good faith is to be treated as a " scrap of paper . " " Narrow legalistic hair-splitting will not suffice , " it declares . " The fact remains that the former Allies are morally bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the present policy of England and France is a direct negation of the spirit of Locarno and that every day the troops stay in Germany the more difficult they make the task of the German Government in carrying out the reparations program ; indeed , their presence endangers a continuance of Dr. Stresemann in office and strengthens the reactionary and nationalistic forces within the Reich . As we go to press it appears as if there might he a promise of partial evacuation in 1929 . But that is not adequate . Good faith , honesty , and a respect for the integrity of the Treaty of Versailles , as well as self-interest in the matter of reparations , all dictate immediate and complete withdrawal . The pretense that any further coercion of Germany is needed is as false as it is preposterous . N BOLIVIA 'S CAPITAL , the name of which  --  in English 1 ? is Peace , they are shouting War . At this writing the popular outburst in La Paz has all the makings of the stupidest kind of nationalistic conflict . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of which overwrought young men are clamoring for the high privilege of wallowing in the mud , getting lousy , and finally rotting into carrion on a " field of glory . " The cause of the madness is a disputed boundary line between Bolivia and Paraguay The contested boundary , of which there are still a number in Latin America , did n't matter until oil  --  that most inflammable product  --  was found in the neighborhood . Then both countries sent troops into the region , and never in history has such action had any but one result  --  a clash . There is no use in trying to apportion the blame  --  both sides were as culpable in letting their respective forces come together as if they had unleashed two bulldogs in the same enclosure . But after the set-to Paraguay sensibly offered to arbitrate the dispute under the Gondra Convention ; Bolivia , talking of " wounded honor , " began to demur . It is sincerely to be hoped that Bolivia may be otherwise persuaded . War at any time is foolish and tragic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip " of Mr. Hoover , and coincident with the sessions of the Pan-American arbitration conference in Washington a conflict would be not only the depth of stupidity but also the height of irony . We wish success to the committee on conciliation headed by Mr. Hughes . N INE HUNDRED THOUSAND British miners are on the verge of starvation . And this is not even front-page news in our press . We enlarge our headlines for spectacular and dramatic disasters at sea ; but for the time-worn conflict of labor and capital , the dreary round of strike and starve or work and starve only a little less , we have no longer any but the most casual notice . Charity has made only a small dent in the misery in South Wales and Durham ; subsistence doles prolong lives that are such only in that breath remains in wasted bodies . The Government 's plan to revive depressed industries , of which coal is one , will take a long time to take effect if it ever does . A scheme of cultivating 10,000 vegetable gardens to raise food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . They are as ever-present as distress among the miners . And in the face of an approaching winter the South Wales colhery owners have offered a wage reduction of $.25 a shift-121/2 per cent . In two years the mine owners have lost nearly ? 5,500,000 . If they at least have enough to eat and clothes to cover them , they , too , have their difficulties . The trouble is not with individual owners or a particular strike , but with the coal industry as a whole . Not only the miners but the industry itself is starving to death  --  as slowly and surely as the bitter Welsh winter approaches . Where is King Coal ? Who or what can save him ? The miners say higher wages ; the owners say lower wages ; the " public " says conferences But the patient continues to weaken . T HE SENATORS who are fighting against the confirmamation of Roy 0 . West as Secretary of the Interior will have the good-will of every believer in clean government . A sinner may become an archbishop in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we doubt whether a faithful attorney for Samuel Insull can become a good Secretary of the Interior . Mr. West was for thirty years the henchman of the very magnates who are now fighting for the private ownership and exploitation of the natural resources which a Secretary of the Interior is supposed to protect He admitted on the witness stand that he owned large blocks of utilities stocks and handled a goodly share of Samuel Insull 's political " appropriations . " Apparently lie believes that his own case before the Senate is hopeless , for he is brazenly defying decent public sentiment . The case of the Insull interests and Cumberland Falls came before the Federal Power Commission on the very day that Mr. West 's appointment was sent to the Senate . Cumberland Falls , known as " the Niagara of the South , " is located in eastern Kentucky and is one of twenty power sites in that State which Insull 's Middle Western Utilities Company is trying to capture . Although Mr West has admitted ownership of a large block of stock in this Middle Western Utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Federal Power Commission in his capacity as ex-officio member when the Insull case came up . Such loyalty to his former employers , we trust , will result in Mr. West 's being returned by the Senate to the bosom of the Republican Party of Chicago . W E CAN NOT LET PASS without comment the recent retirement of E. A. Stewart , associate professor of agricultural engineering at the University of Minnesota , to become president of the Northwestern Public Utilities Company , with main offices in Minneapolis . For our readers may see in the incident a striking example of the law of cause and effect , or a pretty version of the old story of Virtue Rewarded . While a member of the faculty of a great State university Professor Stewart took from utility companies pay for his time and expenses in attending various power conferences . For going to the World Power Conference in Switzerland , for instance , he received $500 a month for two months and $485 toward his expenses . A couple of years ago he visited Ontario and made an unfavorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hydro-Electric Power Commission charged that although errors and misstatements were called to Professor Stewart 's attention before the report was published , no corrections were made . Last winter when the Ontario report was quoted by the Portland Press Herald the Evening News of the same city wrote to Professor Stewart for confirmation of the figures . Instead of a simple reply Professor Stewart offered to go to Maine to deliver a series of addresses in order to give the people " the proper information along this line . " When S. S. Wyer published through the Smithsonian Institution a partisan attack on the Ontario power development our hero wrote to the author : " Hallelujah , thine the glory . Hallelujah , amen ! " We congratulate the University of Minnesota and Professor Stewart on his change of job . He has earned it . C HRISTMAS WILL BRING FREEDOM for Eugene Barnett , one of the eight men sentenced to life imprisonment after the raid of American Legion members on the hall of the Industrial Workers of the World in Centralia , Washington , in 1919 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant Barnett 's request for a parole gives hope that the other victims of the Centralia hysteria will soon be released . One member of the American Legion , Captain E. P. Coll of Hoquiam , Washington , is certainly doing his best to compensate for the Centralia injustice . In an open letter to his fellow-Legionnaires he says : The I. W. W. in Centralia , Washington , who fired upon the men that were attempting to raid the I. W W. headquarters were fully justified in their act . . . . As in the famous Dreyfus case in France , so in the State of Washington , a great wrong has been done and the innocent party has suffered . . .. As a Legionnaire I wish to prevent the shrine of the American Legion from becoming the shame of the . American Legion . Meanwhile there are many other men in American prisons because they have taken an aggressive part in the labor struggle , and the Christmas season is an appropriate time to remember them .

A LTHOUGH PAXTON HIBBEN died while he was still a young man , his life held more of the life of the world in its compass than most long spans of years . His early experience in the diplomatic service led him into Russia  --  and later to Mexico , Holland , Chile , and other countries . From 1915 to 1917 he was a war correspondent in Europe . When America entered the war Hibben served in the field artillery and gained the rank of captain . He worked with the Near East Relief from 1920 to 1922 , was attached to the military mission in Armenia , and finally took charge of the American Committee for the Relief of Russian Children . His intense sympathy for Russia and his passionate belief that the Soviet Government should be recognized by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attempted to cancel his commission as captain in the Officers ' Reserve Corps . Hibben fought the case through the hearings before a courtof inquiry , and his commission was subsequently renewed . He also took part in the battle for justice for Sacco and Vanzetti . Recently , in addition to his public work , Paxton Hibben had been chiefly engaged with biographical writing . His outspoken life of Henry Ward Beecher , published in 1927 , caused a hot controversy ; at the time of his death he was deep in work on a closely documented book on William Jennings Bryan . A man with so many varied interests and self-imposed tasks , with such passion and eager intensity and unresting activity must necessarily wear his resources thin . His loss is a heavy one for everyone who knew and loved him and for those movements for human freedom which had come to count so surely upon his valor and fiery enthusiasm . E LLERY SEDGWICK must have known that his sensa- tional publication in the Atlantic Monthly of letters and memoranda supposedly written by Abraham Lincoln would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case or do more than attempt to weigh the effect of conflicting testimony ; but at this point in the discussion the group of experts who have risen up to call the letters forgeries seems to us impressive , while Mr. Sedgwick 's replies have appeared ineffective by comparison . This proves nothing except , perhaps , that the editor of the Atlantic proceeded unwisely when he began publication of the documents without consulting all the available authorities ; and also when he failed to mention Worthington Ford 's preliminary judgment that the letters were fakes . So good a pilot as Ellery Sedgwick should not have set sail on such precarious seas without taking every precaution ' I IQUOR IS GOING TO COST MORE in 1929 , though there is no reason to believe that it will be any scarcer . The House has just voted , for dry-law enforcement , the largest appropriation in the history of the " noble experiment " ? $32,000,000 to be spent by the same men who thus far have not really tried to enforce it . This means that the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietors will have to pay more and probably larger fees to keep the agents satisfied . This means that the customer will have to pay more for his drinks . Perhaps , if we make larger appropriations and appoint more agents every year , the cost of liquor may become so high that the drinking population will be reduced to the prohibition agents who get their drinks free . But by that time , granted our Republican prosperity endures , the majority of citizens will be prohibition agents and we shall have to begin all over again . Meanwhile recent Speakeasiana indicate that the show , which has already run nine years , is getting funnier every season . A speakeasy in New York City has just been closed  --  for violating the Board of Health rules concerning ventilation . In another establishment at three o'clock each morning the proprietor goes the rounds telling his patrons that it is closing time . When there are protests he says firmly : " The place closes at three o'clock . I got ta obey the curfew law . " And he does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of running a restaurant without a license . " It is n't a restaurant , Judge , " said he . " It 's only a speakeasy . I do n't need a license for that . " But the health officer who had arrested him said the place looked like a restaurant and Glowka was fined $5 . May we now look to see the development of a distinctive speakeasy architecture to guard against raids ?
