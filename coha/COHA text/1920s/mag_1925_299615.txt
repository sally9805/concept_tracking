In Chicago , there dwells a renowned professor named Albert Abraham Michelson . A member of the faculty of the University of Chicago , he has made many a valuable contribution to Science . Born at Strelno , Germany , a son of Samuel Michelson and Rosalie Przlubska , he is a brother of Charles Michelson ( rabidly Democratic chief of The New York World 's Washington Bureau ) and of Miriam Michelson ( author ) . But he graduated from the Naval Academy at Annapolis when these two were still on the Pacific coast , in swaddling clothes . <P> Albert became an instructor in physics at the Naval Academy , and then continued his studies at Heidelberg . Soon afterward he began to acquire the reputation that won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1907 and distinctions and degrees without number . He was , for example , the first to measure the diameter of distant stars . <P> Yet in the course of many years , he had not given a public lecture . Last week , the President and Trustees of Chicago University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre and prevailed upon him to address a large audience consisting mainly of sponsors of the University . <P> He began with fundamentals , comprehensible to the lay mind , explaining wave-motion by slides and motion pictures of a number of experiments . He showed the properties of water waves and similar mechanical waves . He showed the properties of sound waves . From these , he went on to show the properties of the different but analogous waves of light . All this was to demonstrate the principle on which one of his great inventions-which he has labored 40 years in perfecting-is based . <P> This instrument is a device for taking very delicate measurements of the speed of light rays . Two rays are used for comparison . It works roughly on the principle that , if two sets of waves are produced and the crest of one is timed to come in the trough of another , the appearance of waves is destroyed . In the case of light , this means a dark place or shadow . When the light rays are received upon a given surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves . Using this device in Southern California , last year , experiments were made by Prof. Michelson which measured the speed of light-now given as 186,000 miles a second-with a possible error of only 20 miles per second . A light and the interferometer were placed on one peak . A mirror was placed on a peak 20 miles distant . By receiving rays direct from the light next to it and rays which had travelled 40 miles ( from the light to the distant mirror and back ) , the interferometer showed the light fringes and dark lines of interference from which the speed of light was calculated . <P> Then Prof. Michelson proceeded to describe an experiment which has been in progress for some months on a prairie just west of Chicago ( TIME , Aug. 11 ) . There a rectangle of 12-inch pipe , almost a mile in perimeter , was laid down . Its greater dimension extends from east to west . This pipe was sealed and the air exhausted . Mirrors were placed in the corners so that a beam of light would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc light was placed , the beams of which , split by mirrors , were reflected around the rectangle in opposite directions .
