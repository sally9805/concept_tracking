Maine , famed national political bellwether , last week chose , without instructing , its 15 delegates to the Republican convention . The 15 met straightway and telegraphed their support , " loyal , " " unswerving , " to Candidate Hoover . <P> Michigan followed with a primary giving Mr. Hoover the preference votes of its 33 Republican delegates .

We must have in his successor , through the Republican Party , an assurance of continuity , stability and national progression . " <P> In Manhattan , the New York Herald Tribune , outstanding G. O.
