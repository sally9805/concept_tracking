Atlantic , Azara , Elena , Guienerve , Zodiac . Pleasant names . They belong to big racing schooners .

They were racing for the King Alfonso cup . <P> Elena was the favorite . Guienerve was the largest . Atlantic had won the last ocean race in 1925 . A radio from Elena said that she was sailing beam to beam with the Atlantic . Passengers on liners peered at the horizon hoping to see a sail full of wind and salty adventure .
