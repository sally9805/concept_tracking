Every day in Manhattan hundreds of Interborough Rapid Transit subways charge through the warm odorous gloom underneath the streets . Uptown they soar to daylight on elevated tracks , downtown they dip beneath the east river to Brooklyn . I. R. T. advertisements say that 1,000,000 people ride them daily . Each ride costs a nickel . I. R. T. potentates have long claimed that the nickel fare is not enough to meet expenses . <P> They wanted a 7 fare . So sure were they that a 7 fare would some day become effective that last week they had in readiness millions of 7 slugs to be distributed among subway-riding Manhattanites , Brooklynites . <P> But last week the U. S. Supreme Court , which had been probing into I. R. T. affairs , opined ( Justices Willis Van Devanter , George Sutherland , Pierce Butler dissenting ) that the 7 fare was unnecessary . <P> To Mayor James John Walker the decision brought political joy because he had championed the nickel fare . To Lawyer Charles Evans Hughes it brought legal melancholy because he had drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I. R. T. stocks dropped 20 points in about the time that it takes a subway train to rush from Manhattan to Brooklyn . <P> The I. R. T. case had been in court more than a year . Last year a Federal Court upheld the 7 fare but it was never put into effect ( TIME , May 14 ) . Last week 's Supreme Court decision , although it overturned the first decision , left the case still open and in the hands of New York 's Transit Commission for final decision . The commission , however , favors nickels.
