Gang War . Whatever may be Willard Mack 's inadequacies as a playwright , there are seldom , in his opera , those fearful stretches , common in the works of the worst dramatists , in which nothing is happening and nothing seems likely to . His plays are always full of motion and noise which carry with them a crude but undeniable demand for attention . Gang War deals with the adventures of a beer king who is engaged in guerrilla fighting with members of a rival bootlegging concession . Also , he has two frails , of whom one gets quickly killed . So does the beer king and many another . In the last act one gang drops bombs on the other from an airplane , filling the theatre with smoke and confusion . The action-of which there is plenty-is largely laid in the beer king 's den , a place of small tables , gats , a periscope , and other gangish claptrap . Here , in a moment of solicitous passion , one of the beer king 's favorites whispered to a hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was true . <P> Relations . One 's cousins , aunts , uncles , nephew 's are one 's relatives ; with them one has relations , pleasant or otherwise . Edward Clark , the author of a homely little play , understands neither this nor a great many other things , such as how to be funny and how to be interesting when writing for the stage . The relatives with whom his drama concerns itself are Jewish and unfriendly . Old Wolfe Michaels , who is the kin they love to touch , decides that they , the other offshoots of his stock , are worthless . So does David Lubin , his elegant nephew who arrives from Australia . The clan has become decadent and these two are about to go bankrupt , for some reason , when word arrives that another and hitherto forgotten relative has died in the Antipodes , leaving them a fortune . Thus convinced that blood is a bit thicker than water , the supposedly comic relatives shake hands all around and the play is over . <P> The Big Pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Come Out of the Kitchen , Only 38 ) and George Middleton ( The House of a Thousand Candles , Potty with a Past ) , husband of Fola La Follette ( pioneer Lucy Stoner , daughter of the late Senator " Fighting Bob " La Follette ) . Their goal was anti-rakish , antiseptic fun , and they achieved it . The heroine is a mid-western lass who hungers for romance and esthetics . In Venice she tumbles for an insolvent Frenchman whose family dates back to Charlemagne , who would innately prefer Santa Maria della Salute to the First Methodist . Her rubber-company father , distressed , arranges to remove the cultured Gaul to Ohio , hoping Daughter will be disillusioned by his Old World fragrance among robustuous U. S. odors . Chameleon Pierre turns Babbitt , nearly estranges the girl while ingratiating himself with her father , ultimately wins her with a recrudescence of Gallic passion when his success is dramatically jeopardized by an American rival . The farce is spotted with easy gags , is occasionally deft , never hysterical . Kenneth MacKenna as Pierre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of it , provide an evening of contented chuckling .
