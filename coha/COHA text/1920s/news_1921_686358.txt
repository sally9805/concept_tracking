txt Leading breweries in the metropolitan district announced yesterday that they were ready to supply the legitimate trade with all of the real beer required for medicinal purposes , under a decision of former Attorney General Palmer . All that was needed to start -- the movement of , beer to the drug stores was the issuancd of permits . Brewers said that they- expected these permits to be available within a few days . Ali of the breweries have been making beer , but virtually all of them have been careful to reduce the alcoholic content to the requirements of the Volstead act . A few brewers have not been so careful , laccording to Boston prohibition enforcement agents , who said that they had been able to buy real beer in some restaurants . The bottles bore no labels and the agents were unable to trace the brewers . " It is the most cheerful news in a business way I have heard in five years , " said Colonel Jacob Ruppert . " We are ready on a moment 's notice to put out real beer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . He said that there was a great public demand for beer , and expressed the opinion that the Anti-Saloon League would not be able to secure a modification of the ruling . " It is a fact , " he said , " that beer formerly was generally prescribed by physicians . Since prohibition went into effect I have been approached by a number of physicians who appealed to me for beer on the ground that it was absolutely necessary for the welfare of their patients . I was not in position to help them . " The property of the brewers will be made more valuable by the ruling and employment given to a large number of former workers , said Colonel Ruppert . The sale of one-half of 1 per cent , beer has been about one-third of that when real beer was legitimate . Colonel Rup-. pert believed that the breweries would be enabled to operate on something like the old schedules . Dry Agent Skeptical . Federal Prohibition Director Charles R. O'Connor said that physicians probably would be restricted in prescribing beer , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Connor gad , had adopted a regulation limiting physicians to one book of 100 blanks every ninety days . This action was taken , he said , because one physician in Chicago wrote 7,000 prescriptions for liquor , none for less than a pint , in the course of a few weeks . There are 4,500 physicians in this city who have the privilege of writing prescriptions for alcoholic liquors , the largest number since prohibition went into effect . " The opinion , " said Mr. O'Connor , " is not of such sweeping effect as might at first appear , as in thirty-nine States the laws prohibit physicians from the writing of prescriptions . " " In our judgment the late Attorney General Palmer 's ruling in behalf of the brewers as medicine men , " said William H. Anderson , State Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League , " will not bring back beer for beverage purposes as the brewers hope will be the result of this entering wedge , but will ultimately result not only in withdrawing legal sanction of the beer and wine leaks on alleged- medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even alcoholic spirits for medicinal purposes . " Since whisky and brandy have been kicked out of the United States Pharmacopoeia as medicines there is a growing sentiment that the law should not permit their being prescribed for medical use except in the form of alcohol as a part of some compound remedy which is sufficiently medicated to negative the probability of use for beverage purposes . " The lawlessness of the liquor traffic - has simply made the people of the American nation as a whole more determined to see that prohibition has a fair chance at enforcement , and if necessary they will insist that the law shall be . changed on disputed points so as to remove the possibility of doubt and the danger of construction favorable to the liquor interests . " Sees Enforcement Harder . The enforcement of the prohibition law will be made harder through the manufacture and sale of real beer , according to United States Attorney Leroy W. Ross of Brooklyn . The new ruling , Mr. Ross said , would leave a chance for leaks at the breweries , " just as up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest leaks of whisky took place . " Government agents have discovered a shortage of 107,000 gallons of liquor , valued at more- than 5,000,000 , according to the present wholesale bootleg prices , in the Government bonded warehouse operated by Edmond J. La Brecque at 110 Front Street , Newark , it became known yesterday . It was announced in Trenton that the Federal Grand Jury had returned an indictment against La- Brecque . He was arrested some weeks ago and released on bail . He has been directed to appear in Trenton today . and it was said that he would be required to furnish $50,000 bail . Oscar C. Friedrich Jr . of 308 Washington Street , Newark , in whose saloon at Branford and Halsey Streets the La Brecque scheme was alleged to have been planned . was arrested last night . In default of $50,000 bail Friedrich was committed to Eseex County Jail and will be taken to Trenton today .

Coe also told of conversations with La Brecque relative to the sale of whisky and of liberal commission being offered : Harry E. Sands . a special agent . was sent to Newark from Washington .

Internal Revenue Agent George E. Golding refused to obey the order of the Commissioner , and a motion was made to punish him for contempt of court . Judge Garvin reserved decision on the motion . Fifteen cases of whisky and liquors on board the American freighter Mary , which docked in Williamsburg yesterday , were seized by customs officers .
