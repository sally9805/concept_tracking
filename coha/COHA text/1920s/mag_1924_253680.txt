The funeral ceremonies of Calvin Coolidge Jr . were as simple as could be arranged for the son of a President . The coffin lay in the East Room of the White House , covered with pink and white roses and guarded by a small detachment of Marines . Services , consisting of hymns and a few passages from the Scriptures , were read in the presence of those members of the official group who remained in Washington . Less intimate friends were permitted to assemble on the north lawn during the service . <P> That evening a special train , carrying the body , left with Mr. and Mrs. Coolidge , John Coolidge , their other son , the members of the Cabinet ( except Messrs . Hoover , in California , and Mellon , abroad ) , Mr. and Mrs. Frank W. Stearns , the President 's Secretaries and aides . At Northampton the next morning , church services were held . Colonel Coolidge and Mrs. Andrew Goodhue , grandparents of the dead boy , joined the funeral party there . Services were equally simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one-half hour 's duration . <P> Again the party took the train and proceeded to Ludlow , Vt. , from whence a funeral procession of automobiles went twelve miles overland along the narrow hill roads to Plymouth . A grave had been dug in the little cemetery , only a few hundred yards from the Coolidge homestead . It lay on a tree-covered knoll . The services were very brief-less than 15 minutes in length . The little Marine Guard saluted , as the bugler sounded taps . <P> Throughout the trying ceremonies the President and Mrs. Coolidge preserved great self-control . Only at the grave , she wept a little , softly . Several members of the Cabinet-Mr . Hughes , Mr. Weeks , Mr. New-appeared deeply moved . C. Bascom Slemp wept . After the interment , the Coolidges retired to the Coolidge home . Colonel Coolidge was persuaded to accompany the President back to Washington . Mr. Coolidge called his son John to the doorway and marked his height upon the doorframe with the legend " J.C . 1924 . " On the same frame were other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with various years . To these the President added another mark : " C.C. 1924 , if alive . " <P> At 6:15 in the evening the party again boarded its special train and left for Washington . <P> On account of his son 's funeral , the President was able to hold very few conferences , and those only of the briefest and most pressing kind . <P> Over the week end the Coolidges cruised on the Mayflower , without guests except for the Stearns ' and Mrs. Arthur Capper , wife of the Senator from Kansas . <P> Because of the death of Calvin Jr . the ceremony of informing the President of his nomination was postponed from the proposed date , July 24 , to August 14.
