Time and again and again , a wizened little old man flung himself feverishly , but feebly , upon a young Hebrew desperado at the Velodrome , Manhattan . Thus assaulted , the desperado angrily smashed the old man back and down , with crushing blows on the face . At length the ancient , blood-smeared and sick , staggered weakly away . <P> The quarrel was over a purse-and the world 's bantamweight boxing championship . The desperado was Abie Goldstein , " Harlem assassin , " titleholder , whose boxing on this occasion was now brilliantly clever , now dismally stupid . The little old man was Charley Ledoux , of France , aged 32 , bantamweight champion of Europe , who had come to America a third time ( " and last , " said he ) with titular intentions . <P> ... <P> Between rounds , towel-flappers and sponge-squeezers sprang through the ropes to revive , rehearten Little Old Man Ledoux . Over these loomed a being , tall , statuesque , godlike . <P> " Who , " whispered the nudging spectators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorgeous Orchid Man ? " <P> Carpentier it was indeed , old friend of Little Old Man Ledoux . They have the same manager , Descamps ; the same trainer , Gus Wilson ; the same training quarters ( for the present ) , the Jack Curley estate , at Great Neck , L. I. In 1909 , when the " Gorgeous Orchid Man " was a bantamweight , Ledoux fought Carpentier ( unsuccessfully ) . <P> ... <P> Stepping into a sumptuous motor after Ledoux ' fight , the " G. O. M. " was wafted back to Great Neck to continue his training for Gene Tunney and the American light-heavyweight title on July 24 . Callers continued plentiful . They dropped in to scrutinize , criticize , ogle , or just greet . The rustle of skirts was heard almost continuously . Conversation was reported as running along social , theatrical , bootlegging lines . Georges took his exercises regularly , strenuously , but gave the impression that they were work . <P> At Red Bank , N. , J. , sport writers discovered a different scene . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by admiring natives , Tunney raced through his work , flew at sparring partners chosen for their speed , appeared to be glorying in every exercise . Critics had said he lacked the " killer instinct . " He belied the criticism . Experts had said his left hand would be his greatest asset . He gave promise of justifying the prediction . After the workouts , talk was of golf and real estate , Mr. Tunney 's avocations.
