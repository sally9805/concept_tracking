txt At Paris the French Government has made it clear by repeated declarations that disarmament must , in its judgment , make the journey from London to Geneva . Whatever agreement may be reached at the naval conference in England , France believes that it should be passed on to the Disarmament Commission of the League of Nations . Otherwise it will not become final or effective . Otherwise it can not be brought into the whole scheme of limitation of armaments , which must embrace land forces , and strength in the air , as well as navies . It does not yet appear whether the French Government has communicated its views direct to London or Washington . But our State Department is fully aware of them from publication in the press , and doubtless from its own diplomatic ? advices . At all events , Secretary STIMSON is reported to be giving careful study to what the position of this country should be when the question is formally brought up at London , as it undoubtedly will be . It should not be thought of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not cause Prime Minister MACDONALD either surprise or uneasiness . . In his address to the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva on Sept. 3 last , he distinctly foreshadowed such a course as the French now intimate will be necessary . Mr. MACDONALD , It is true , laid great stress upon his negotiations with the United States , but explicitly declared that they were not intended to be exclusive , and that if an Anglo-American agreement was finally reached it would be the wish . of both countries to " throw it into the world as a healing and helpful lead to the rest . " Moreover , touching the question in its entirety , Mr. MACDONALD made it plain where he thought the ultimate power and decision must be found when he said : " This League must " bend itself to solve this problem of " disarmament . " Indeed , the joint statement issued in . Washington by President HOOVER and Mr. MACDONALD left little doubt of their plans or their hopes . Whether a three-Power treaty shall result at London , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nations in their attitude toward military armament . As the League of Nations is now their great and chosen agency of international action , the strange thing would be , not that they want to bring this vastly important matter under its consideration , but that anybody should have supposed they would not . Our government need feel no embarrassment in going to Geneva . It would not be like going to Canossa . We have gone to Geneva more than once in the interest of disarmament . If we can go next time with a treaty for naval reduction in our hands , we shall be more than welcome , and be ? in the way of helping to bring about larger results than were attained on previous occasions . In any event , it is not at all probable that the Washington Administration , after a couple of months of cordial and face-to-face exchanges at London , will feel that it is compelled to resort to the old half-hearted and awkward " absent treatment " of Geneva .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
