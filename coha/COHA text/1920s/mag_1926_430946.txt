GREASE-SMEARED and weary , hut smiling , Miss Gertrude Ederle waded dripping from the dark and chilly Straits of Dover one evening recently , and walked into the ruddy glare of the driftwood fires burning in her honor on the beach at King , - ton ? the first woman to swine the English Channel . This lunar-shouldered and stouthearted American girl had good reason to smile . She had done more than win the high honor of being the first of her sex to swim the twenty-onemile stretch of current-wracked and storm-swept salt water that up to then had defeated all but five of the many powerful male swimmers who had challenged its might ; more than set a new record of 14 hours 31 minute &; for the natatorial passage from Cape GrisNez in France to the English coast . For the first time in sport history a woman had out-done man 's best in a task demanding to the full the qualities of speed , stamina , skill , and red , raw courage . Within a few weeks another woman , Mrs. Clemington Corson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children , struggled through the breakers beneath the white Dover cliffs and strode up the beach the second woman to swim the Charnel . Her time for the crossing was an hour slower than Miss Ederle 's , yet it surpassed by an hour the record of Sebastian Tiraboschi , fastest of the male Channel swimmers up to that time . More than one man rubbed his eves dazedly . Woman , having made good her invasion of many other fields of endeavor once wholly masculine , now was competing against man on equal terms in sport ? and beating him at the hardest of his own games ! The male 's world-old boast of physical.superiority seemed to have become decidedly shaky . AND then , forty-eight hours after the news of Mrs. Corson 's feat was broadcast to the world , the Channel was conquered again , this time by a man , Ernst Vierkoetter , of Germany , in the fastest time ever , 12 hours , 43 minutesan hour and forty-eight minutes better than " Trudy " Ederle had done . Less than two weeks later another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time by one hour and thirtyeight minutes ? or three hours and twentysix minutes faster than Miss Ederle 's . Which was as it should be , for , despite male fears and feminine achievement , man remains supreme in sports , and , in the opinion of many experts well qualified to judge , will remain supreme in sports for many generations ? probably forever . Why ?  | Although it is only in the last few years that the doings of women sport stars have been featured in our newspapers , there is nothing new in women 's participation in some of the highly competitive athletic sports . Our first women 's national tennis championship was held almost forty years ago . Our first women 's national golf championship was played back in 1895 . In 1904 Miss May Sutton found it possible to play really highclass tennis even while handicapped by a voluminous duck skirt that flapped about her ankles and a shirt waist with wide sleeves . Women proved their love for sport by engaging in it while wearing the clothes they had to wear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if WHILE uncomfortable ? in the " sport " clothes of the early years of the current century , speed swimming and track and field athletics , the two other branches of sport in which the woman of today has shown the most interest and the greatest ability , were next to impossible . No girl could run fast or swim fast while hampered in every movement by the clinging folds of useless cloth demanded by a convention of false modesty . It was not until the dawn of the present " jazz " age disclosed the startling fact that girls have legs like other people that woman discarded the senseless athletic clothing that had hampered her , and began to make real progress in sports . That progress has been startlingly rapid , but in every sport there still remains a big gap'between the best performances of men and the best performances of women . And in the opinion of most sport experts , women athletes will never be able to close that gap . It is in swimming that women have ap proached most close ly to the masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard in some swims in open water . But in the shorter events the men lead by a good margin . Miss Mariechen Wehselau 's women 's world record for 100 yards is 1 minute 3 seconds ; Johnny Weissmuller 's men 's world record is 52 2/5 seconds. - Miss Ederle 's record for 150 yards is 1 minute 45 seconds ; Weissmiuller 's record is 1 minute 27 2/5 seconds . T Oti IS DE B. HANDLEY is conB sidered to be the world 's greatest authority on swimming . As volunteer coach of the Women 's Swimming Asso ciation of New York he developed c rtrude Ederle and many other record breaking girl swimmers . I asked him if women ever would be as fast as men in the water . " No , " said Mr. Handley , " they will not- . There are biological differences that make it impossible . A woman 's bodily conformation causes too great resistance to her progress through the water . Even the extremely thin woman is handicapped heavily by this fundamental bodily difference . At present there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and the fastest woman swimmer . Possibly some woman sometime will be able to lessen that difference , but no woman speed swimmer ever will be able to equal the records of men . " " That being so , " I asked , " how do you account for Miss Ederle 's remarkable time for the Channel swim ? " " At the time she made the swim , " he said , " Gertrude Ederle was the fastest swimmer , man or woman , who ever had attempted to swim the Channel . Men of Weissmuller 's type are much faster than she is , but they lack endurance for so long a swim . Women have one great advantage over most men for distance swimming ? they have more fatty tissue on their bodies , and this fatty tissue increases their buoyancy , increases their endurance , and protects them from cold . Good women swimmers are being developed all the time . But the fastest of them never can hope to be as fast as the fastest men . Man will hold on to his present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one widely popular sport in which women and men could meet on an equal footing , for in golf skill is of much greater value than strength . Yet in golf the gap between the best women and the best men is as wide as in other sports . Speaking of her match with Miss Joyce Wethered in the Btitish women 's championship last year , Miss Glenna Collett , our national champion in 1922 and again in 1925 , remarked that Miss Wethered " is as perfect a golfer as a woman can be with the handicap of being a woman . " Asked if she thought that a woman golfer ever would be able to beat a man , she countered by replying : " I 'd hate to be able to beat a man ! " Miss Collett is known as " the girl who can drive like a man . " She can , in fact , drive a longer ball than most men ? she averages about 200 yards off the teebut her drives stop fifty or sixty yards short of the  | mighty wallops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why good men golfers beat good women golfers ? their superior driving ability , the result of greater strength and usually of better timing , makes it possible for them to get closer to the green with their first shots . But . it is not only in driving that men golfers are superior . They have more finality ? more finishing punch ? tlian women . Their short game is better . Women golfers ? with a few outstanding exceptions , of whom Miss Collett is one ? do not hit their approach shots with the same confidence as do the male stars . And , strangely , in putting , a golfing art that requires no strength at all but . much delicacy of touch , gentle woman is completely outclassed by blundering , heavyfisted man ! QUITE possibly women labor under a temperamental handicap on the links . Golf is a game that demands many decisions , and decisions which when once made must be acted on with confidence . Women never have been remarkable for the ability to make up their minds quickly , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account to some extent for the undisputed fact that men can beat women playing golf . Outshining all the other colorful personalities who have adorned our sport pages and illustrated supplements during the last eight years is Mlle. Suzanne Lenglen , greatest of woman tennis players . Suzanne has been no blushing violet of the fields of sport . Possessed of the stormy temperament of the conventional prima donna , coupled with the publicity sense of a high-priced press agent , she has kept herself before the eyes of the world . Sp ( ed of foot unusual in a woman , sound strokes , and a fine tennis brain kept her the almost undisputed queen of the amateur courts until , a few weeks ago , she startled the tennis world with the announcement that she had become a professional , and was going to tour America under the management of Mr. Charles Pyle . MLLE . LEN GLEN is the world 's best woman tennis player , but she is a long , long way limn being the best tennis player in the world . Big Bill Tilden is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking his sweater off . Little Bill Johnston and a dozen other male stars undoubtedly could dispose of her quite as handily . She has been beaten , in more or less friendly matches , by several third-class men players . There probably are at least two hundred men in various parts of the world who could beat her . Women 's tennis has been much overrated . Action pictures of woman stars in play give the impression that their game is as fast as the men 's game . It is n't anything like as fast . Mlle. Lenglen has a certain degree of speed of foot , but little speed of stroke . p She wins her matches against other women by being able to reach their best shots and send them back safely : most of her points are won on her opponent " errors . A man of Tilden 's caliber would put so much speed on the ball that she could do nothing with it even when she reached it , which would be seldom . Miss Helen Wills , our ex-champion. gets good pace on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably set for them , but she is painfully slow of foot . Any of the really good men players could rip her game to pieces by forcing her to run after the ball . One explanation of men 's ability to beat women in tennis is that usually men are taller and heavier than women . But that explanation becomes no explanation at all when we think of Bill- Johnston No taller , and considerably lighter than Miss Wills , her fellow Californian can hit a forehand drive as hard as any man , and a lot harder than any woman ; in tennis . MEN tennis players beat women tennis players because the men have greater speed of foot , more endurance , greater hitting power , and ? nine times out of ten ? greater tactical ability . Can you imagine any woman ever being able to play the sort of tennis that " Red " McLoughlin played to defeat the great Norman Brookes by the score of 17 ? 15 , 6 ? 3 , 6 ? 3 in the Davis Cup matches of 1914 ? During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went storming in to the net behind every service and behind almost every ground stroke . No woman who ever lived could have stood that strain . Women 's interest in track and field athletics is , to a great extent , a post-war development . For some years a few girls ' schools and colleges had encouraged this branch of sport , but it was not until 1922 that the Amateur Athletic Union took over the government of the sport , and open competition became common . WHILE they have made great progress in the spiked-shoe game , their best efforts still are a long way behind the efforts of second-rate male athletes . The women 's world record for 100 yards is 11 seconds , made by Miss Fanny Rosenfeldt of Toronto last year . Almost any boy high school runner can equal that mark . The women 's record for ' 220 yards is 27 4/5 seconds , 7 seconds slower than the men 's . The women 's record for the running broad jump is 18 feet , the men 's record is 25 feet 10% inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 38 feet 3% inches ; twenty years ago the gigantic Ralph Rose tossed that weight 67 feet 7 inches . The men 's official discus weighs 4 pounds 6% ounces . Jim Duncan threw it 156 feet 13 s inches to make the present record . The women 's official discus weighs pounds 12% ounces . At this year 's championships Miss Lillian Copeland set a new record with a throw of 101 feet 1 inch .  | George Vreeland , chairman of the athletic committee of the Prudential Insurance Company Athletic Association of Newark , New Jersey , has , as a volunteer coach , trained many successful girl athletes , among them Miss Hazel Kirk , joint holder of the record for the 60-yard hurdles . I asked him if women track athletes ever would become as good as men athletes . " I DO N'T think that there is a chance of it , " he said . " Girl runners have improved greatly in the last few years , and they will continue to improve , but I doubt if they ever will develop the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how untrained girls run on the street ? almost waddle . It is astonishing how quickly they get over that when they put on spiked shoes ? how they learn to stride right out like a man . " Competitive temperament ? Yes , they have every bit as much as men . And they 're every bit as good sports . They like to win , of course , but the track game soon teaches them how to lose gracefully . There is an exception now and then ? but I 've seen one or two men athletes who were n't good losers ! " Women have to be trained rather more carefully than men ? they ca n't stand as much work , and must be brought along more slowly . " ASKED Mr. Vreeland if any outstanding girl athlete had been developed in the United States . " Probably the best all-around girl athlete we have developed in America is Miss Helen Filkey , of Chicago . In the 1925 national women 's championships in Pasadena she won three events ? the 100 yards , the running broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done even . better than that , but no girl athlete is permitted to compete in more than three events in one day . " Just how much women will be able to improve their track records is a matter for guessing . In the 100 yards , for example , a second has been clipped off since 1922 . But the next second will be harder . I doubt if any woman ever will run the hundred in ten seconds flat . In fact , I doubt if a woman ever gets under 10 2/5 seconds . " Men , it seems , are able to beat women in sports just because they are men , endowed by nature with superior qualities of speed , strength , and stamina !  |
