It was n't the Dean 's fault , that much was certain . A tourist told the sexton and the sexton told the Dean and the Dean told the Chapter ; somebody even told the King . Everybody shook their heads and said it could not be so , but when they went to look , there was the fact staring them in the face . The London Times got hold of the story , started a restoration fund that netted 33,000 in three days . In Park Lane , in Mile End Road , in Billingsgate , in the counties , what a buzz . " Falling down . . . , " people said amazed . " Falling down . . . , " they said ominously . " St. Paul 's Cathedral is falling down . " <P> The brow of Dean Inge , never very jocund at best , was painfully overcast . Still , as has been said , they could n't blame him for it . His attitude in the crisis could only be one of prayerful anxiety . He consulted engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome , weighing from 40,000 to 60,000 tons , rests upon eight piers which , though they appear imposingly massive , are in reality no more than stone pipes bolstered with rubble . The weight of the dome has made every one of them shift or crack . That the Cathedral 's solidity could be amply restored by the simple method of grouting . To grout is to force behind the stone facings liquid cement which , oozing through the broken rubble , would petrify it into a rigid mass capable of sustaining any weight . That grouting would do no more good than grouching , for the piers themselves rested on a weak foundation which delved little below the crypt . The only way to keep St. Paul 's from replacing London Bridge in the famed nursery rhyme was to remove the dome and deepen the foundation . In short , some said one thing , some another . The Dean was rather confused than relieved . <P> However , since somebody must be blamed , the architects , engineers agreed on a name , a revered name , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern architecture , none other than the name of the builder of St. Paul 's . Everyone , perhaps including the Dean himself , seized eagerly upon this suggestion . Even a diminutive and far from prominent member of the famed St. Paul 's choristers got hold of the idea and made a rhyme about it which he passed around at choir practice behind the cover of a fat hymnbook . It seemed very funny because everyone was supposed to be so solemn . <P> Christopher Wren he took a gumshoe , <P> Christopher Wren he took a stick , Put them in St. Paul 's Cathedral <P> Covered ' em over quick and slick . <P> Now St. Paul 's is busting open Because of Wren , Rickety Wren . <P> Gumshoe , stick , crack , crick- <P> Who 's to build it up again ?
