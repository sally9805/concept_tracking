txt The Yankees are loyal to their conquerors , but by a close vote .

Pipgras , Lazzeri , Lary , and Durocher thought the Cubs would be able to bring the title back to the National league , while Durst , Pennock , Moore , Byrd , Paschal , Koenig , and Dickey all favored the men of the Mack team to defend the American league 's superiority , established so thoroughly by the Yanks themselves the last two falls . Wells , Zachary , and Shawkey called the whole thing a toss-up . Hoyt and Combs would not commit themselves because they had n't seen the Cubs in action . Babe Ruth would have been glad to talk , but he must save his picking for his syndicate . . " I like the Cubs , " said Pipgras frankly , " because of their right handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hander with a cross fire . " On the next stool Wiley Moore begged to differ with him . " Hdw do You figure that way , - Pip ? Gosh darn it , those Athletics are playing the best ball right now ! The Giant left handers are stopping the Cubs . And Grove 's a : better pitcher than Bill Walker , is n't he ? " " I know , but ?

But if Simmons and Foxx start crashing into Guy lush 's fast one ? " " I 've never seen the Cubs , etther , " drawled Ben Paschal , " but . I kind of like the Athletics . " " I do n't believe the Cubs will come even close to beating Earnshaw , " said Durst . " And I think Grove will come through now . Did , you know that Tommy Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , stood the Cubs on their-heads in the city series last fall ? In an extra inning game  --  I think it went twelve innings , something like that  --  he struck out fifteen of ? the Cubs . And the next time he pitched he fanned nine . The Cubs can be stopped . " Koenig is just as sure as Durst . " The A. 's have better pitching and a better punch . I 've listened to a lot of talk about the Cubs punishing left handers .
