Hoch soil er leben , Hock soil er leben , Hoch soil er leben . Dreimal Hoch ! <P> So chanted the assembled guests and banged till the glasses rattled . It was the 80th birthday , last week , of Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , Wartime commander of Germany 's Navy , until 1916 . The little mountain inn at Feldafing , Bavaria , on the shores of the Wurm See was crowded with Prussian Generals and Bavarian Princes . Perspiring waiters , imported from Munich , rushed to and from the kitchen bearing caviar , Rhine salmon , venison-in all 50 mountainous courses of food for the distinguished guests . <P> Every few moments the guests sprang up , raised brimming glasses toward the white oriflamme of the Admiral 's forked beard , and downed a deep health to the man whose famed policy of " sea-frightfulness " brought the U.S. into the War . Smiling pinkly behind his white whiskers , the Grand Admiral toped in response to each toast , declared at last to correspondents with perfect poise and pontifical gravity : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remains in Germany the germ of something that will get us out of the slough . "
