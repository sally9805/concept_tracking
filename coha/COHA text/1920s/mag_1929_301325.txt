A half-day nearer the North are Pinehurst , Camden , Asheville , Aiken , Augusta , where the Southeast begins . One can take ship from Boston to Charleston or from New York to Miami or Savannah . Southbound golfers often head for the places where their favorite professionals hold forth . At Pinehurst are Donald and Alec Ross ; at Augusta , Dave and Alec Ogilvie ; at Belleair , Alex Smith .

Jock Hutchison is still a fixture at Nassau in the offshore Bahamas . <P> The pheasants and wild turkeys slain last week by President Coolidge at Sapeloe ( see page 9 ) were a luxurious but not misleading sample of what the Southeast offers to gunners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild-fowling in the Carolinas-duck , geese , brant-is a sport of moderate temperatures , unlike the cold-blown shooting of northern rivers and bays .
