txt American business today argued before the Ways and Means Committee of the House in favor of a substantial reduction in the corporation income tax , its views being presented by representatives of a number of trade associations . Declaring that the major railroads of the United States paid more than $1,000,000 daily in taxes last year , the Association of Railway Executives today urged the committee to relieve the carriers of some of this burden by reducing the corporation tax to as near as possible 10 per cent. , or two points lower than the figure urged by Secretary Mellon . Government taxes on tbd Class 1 railroads rose from $4,870,000 in 1911 to $109,817,494 in 1926 , or an increase of not less than 2,155 per cent . Alfred P. Thom , general counsel , and C. S. Duncan , economist of the association , informed the committee . Total taxes , including those paid State and local governments , rose from $98,950,000 to $388,922,000 , in the same period , an increase of 293 per cent. , Mr. Duncan said , who added that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total in 1911 , it now took 28 per cent . " The $109,000,000-odd was taxed at the present rate of 131. per cent. , but if the rate had been 10 per cent. , the tax would have been 881.346,000 , or a lightening of ** on the carriers ' tax burden , " he said . " For the last seven years the ' railroads have had to pay more in taxes , except possibly in 1921 and 1926 , than they were able to pay in dividends to stockholders . " When Mr. Duncan estimated a cut to 10 per cent . as meaning a revenue loss of $315,000,000 , Representative Chindblom commented that this would exceed by $90,000,000 Secretary Mellon 's suggested total tax reduction of $225,000,000 . " Although there have been underestimates by the Treasury in the past , the railroads are not asking for a definite rate , but for a figure as nearly approaching 10 per cent . as existing conditions will permit , " Mr. Duncan replied . Backed by Other Industries . Support for the railroads ' attitude was given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobacco Association , National Wholesale Druggists ' Association and American Manufacturers of Toilet Articles , all of whom urged a 10 per cent . rate . Without mentioning specific figures , the National Coal Association and the Illinois Chamber of Commerce pleaded for as low a rate as possible . The position of these organizations was explained by H. L. Gandy of the National Coal Association , who said : " It should not be forgotten that when the Government takes 131/2 cents out of every dollar of net profit realized by a corporation , the real sufferer is the individual who owns stock . The more of its net profit the corporation hands to the Government , the less it has to distribute as dividends to stockholders . " Prediction that the Ways and Means Committee would report a bill calling for a total tax reduction certainly as high as $300,000,000 , and perhaps $325,000,000 , was made by ' committee members . Sentiment for repeal of automobile and theatre admission taxes appears to be gaining strength , despite Mr. Mellon 's opposition .

In 1911 , the percentage of taxes to total earnings was 3.6 per cent. , but in 1926 , Mr. Duncan said , " taxes took 6.1 cents out of every dollar earned . " " In 1911 , " he continued , " it required thirteen days ' revenue for Class 1 roads to earn taxes , but in 1926 it took twenty-two days . Taxes paid in 1911 were $270,211 daily , but in 1926 these roads paid more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in 1925 corporations were taxed 54 cents out of each dollar earned , Mr. Duncan said the railroads were penalized in that year $1.06 for every dollar of dividends . He gave this table of tax payments since 1920 : 1920 $272,961,452 1024 .... 4240,336 .

He contrasted the set ratio of 5.50 to 5.75 per cent . with these actual earnings as follows : 1920 , 0.09 per cent. ; 1921 , 2.91 ; 1922 , 3.64 ; 1923 , 4.42 ; 1924 , 4.32 ; 1925 , 4.75 ; 1926 , 4.99 . Declaring the roads had done everything possible to improve their services and operate economically , he said : " We feel that we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , with clean hands . " Debt Reduction Program Attacked . ' The Treasury 's program of applying large amounts to public debt reduction was attacked by Frank G. Wisner of the National Association of Lumber Manufacturers . " Reductions in the debt , " he said , " have been made far in excess of the payments contemplated by the Sinking Fund act , We feel that the time has come when the Government should cease to collect from citizens and business taxes exceeding the amount needed to conduct its business for the regular and orderly retirement of the debt . We believe that such success might better be allowed to go to the millions of stockholders in the way of increased dividends and through them into the general channels of trade , to consumers at lower prices , or be used by the corporations in replacement of equipment and business expansion , increased employment or retirement of indebtedness . " A brief filed by the National Cigar Leaf Tobacco Association by W. L. Crounse asked for a substantial cut in the $28,000 to $60,000 surtax brackets . Arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " The majority of those paying individual income taxes are assessed at the minimum normal rate of 11/2 per cent. , yet this large class of taxpayers is assessed at 133 , E per cent . on income received as corporation dividends . There is a difference of not less than 12 per cent . between stockholders and individuals operating as unincorporated business  --  a glaring discrimination . " A brief submitted by Mr. Crounse for the wholesale druggists took a like attitude , stressing the assertion that small stockholders constituted a large part of the trade . He presented for the toilet manufacturers a brief to the effect that the Government would gain the same revenue from a 10 per cent . rate on the $1,000,000 annual profit of this trade as from 131,6 per cent. , the difference being due to increased management costs . Illinois Chamber 's Requests . P. W. Pinkerton of Chicago said the Illinois Chamber of Commerce desired further tax reduction , particularly of the corporation levy . He urged elimination of the capital-andgains provision and that capital gains should not be taxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital losses . lie wished to make dividends taxable , whether earnings or surplus accrued to the corporation . He suggested omission of the 50 per cent . penalty on incorporation to avoid the surtax , saying this was impossible of enforcement . Jules Englander of New York , appearing for the Consumers ' Cooperative Organizations , asked tax exemption for his association , which , he said , included 1,700 organizations , with 700,000 members .

Houston , the new Territorial Delegate in Congress from Hawaii , asked the committee to adjust the law so that insular officers would not be taxed on salaries received from Territorial sources . The Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Representative Lea of California opposed the Mellon idea of permitting corporations with $25,000 or less income and not more than ten stockholders to file as partnerships . He said this would discriminate against corporations having more than ten stockholders . He wanted the benefit based solely on income . N. W.
