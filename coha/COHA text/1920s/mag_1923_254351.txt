No action on the current immigration bill will be taken by the 67th Congress . <P> The bill would admit annually 2% of the number of naturalized aliens here in 1890 , instead of the present quota of 3% , based on the 1910 census . It would exclude Japanese and low-caste Hindus . <P> Labor wants immigration cut to a minimum . So-called " Big Business " wants immigration increased . Both agree , however , that it is well to incorporate in the bill the " year 1890 " proviso . That would increase the influx of hardy , industrious northern Europeans and would diminish the number of southern Europeans .
