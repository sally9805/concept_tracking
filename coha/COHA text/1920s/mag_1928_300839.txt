Every now and then , what the newspapers call an " epidemic " breaks out in the U.S. One season it will be influenza ; another season , student suicides ; another season , inventions for television or color cinema . This month , gambling scandals were the national " epidemic . " <P> In New York , the opening of another horse-racing season at Saratoga Springs brought forth free-spending crowds , who entered the resort 's perennial gambling rooms , which then were viewed with loud alarm by political opponents of Governor Smith , who thereupon equally loudly demanded that the Gambling be stopped , together with the Vice that was reported in conjunction . A Manhattan newspaper ( Evening Post ) soon reported more Gambling and Vice in another New York county ( Suffolk ) . It described a discreet , highly expensive casino on an island near Montauk Point , L.I . The games were said to be " fourth largest in the U.S. , " smaller only than the games at three unnamed places in Florida . The casino , named the Montauk Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island 's cool tip , promptly closed its doors , much to the regret of summer-bored Wealth and Fashion at nearby Southampton . The Evening Post ( Republican ) reported that the club had had to close down once before this summer-when it was ordered investigated by Governor Smith , who had heard about it during the week he spent at nearby Hampton Bays ( TIME , Aug. 13 ) . The hotel syndicate , among whose directors are Vice President George Le Bontellier of the Long Island R. R. and Motorman Walter Chrysler , demanded that the Evening Post prove that it had seen what it said it saw . <P> In New Jersey , possibly as a sympathetic reaction from the New York excitement , the Rev. Marna S. Poulson , Anti-Salooner , announced that Newark was " wide open , " especially as to gambling in Newark 's Chinatown . <P> In Louisiana , St. Bernard Parish , a riverside neighborhood below New Orleans , was the scene of shooting , clubbing , screaming , money-grabbing , hacking with axes , punitive bonfires . Huey P. Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana , had been busying himself with whirlwind reforms in various departments of the State , when he heard that two St. Bernard gambling houses had dared to reopen despite his warning . He issued and personally taxied with an order to the Adjutant General to call out a raiding party of the National Guard . The offending establishments , facing each other in the same street , were the Jai-Alai* Fronton and the Arabi Clubs . The guardsmen approached . A lookout fired a shot of warning . The guardsmen entered , clubs swinging . Soon the gambling paraphernalia was ablaze , illuminating a fine antigambling chapter in Governor Long 's precocious record .
