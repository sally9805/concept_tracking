A play called The Ladder opened in Boston this week . It closed in Manhattan last sennight , having run 107 weeks , costing its " angel , " Edgar B. Davis , an estimated 10% of his estimated $15,000,000 oil fortune . As everyone knows , * the play concerns the theosophical doctrine of reincarnation , to which Millionaire-Angel Davis sincerely , munificently subscribes . It meandered between four theatres , was rewritten many times , + had a period of " revision " during which the public was admitted free . Frequently Millionaire-Angel Davis gave bonuses of $20-gold pieces , paid well the cast , the author , J. Frank Davis ( no blood relation of Edgar B. Davis ) , onetime newscribe , gave bonuses to the underworked ushers . <P> <P> * Except Jack Kearns , whilom manager of Pugilist Jack Dempsey , who , knowing nothing of the theatre , was persuaded by a friend to buy two tickets for the show a fortnight ago , was one of an audience of 20 persons , was laughed at for his ignorance by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broun said it should be given frequent change of title , such as The Ladder of August 24 , The Ladder of August 27 , 5:30 p. m. , after the manner of Scandals of 1924 , Follies of 1922.
