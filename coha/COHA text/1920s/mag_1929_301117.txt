Morgan , Carnegie , Astor , Mellon- <P> Every U. S. schoolboy knows the names of dozens of U. S. financiers who have been spectacular in their successes , but for brilliant colossal failures the palm must go to Britain . Boston had its Ponzi , who failed in 1920 for about $3,000,000 . The agile Jay Gould sold $5,000,000 worth of fraudulent stock in the Erie Railroad . But in 1892 Britain 's Jabez Spencer Balfour wiped out $50,000,000 with his disastrous Liberator Building Society . In 1896 , $7,500,000 worth of other peoples money vanished in the hands of London 's plausible Ernest Terah Hooley . In 1900 one Whitaker Wright , suave swindler , organized London &; Globe Finance Corp. , lost ten million dollars a year for three years , swallowed poison in court and died in the dock . In 1910 the great Charing Cross Bank failed , under the able mismanagement of Alfred William Carpenter , for $8,500,000 . In 1922 the British Gerald Lee Bevan sank his City Equitable Fire Insurance Co. to the tune of $10,000,000 and went to jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he borrowed $125,000 from an expansive , sharp-eyed little man who owned the only mansion in London with a roof-garden swimming pool , Clarence Charles Hatry . <P> Last week the nonpareil of All Failures , Clarence Hatry , stood before the preliminary investigating committee in London 's Guildhall charged with forgery and fraud . Reporters and financial gossipers crowded the room to hear famed Accountant Sir Gilbert Garnsey tell just how much money Swindler Hatry did lose , to try to learn what became of the money . <P> The outline career of the nonpareil Hatry is simple . Beginning life as an insurance clerk he put in four busy war years profiteering . In some curious manner , three successive bankruptcies left him successively richer . At the beginning of the year investors flocked to the following Hatry group : General Securities Ltd.

Suddenly the London Stock Exchange committee suspended all shares of the Hatry group from listing on ' change . Followed the crash ( TIME , Oct. 21 ) . Investors were estimated to have lost anywhere from $30,000,000 to $100,000,000 . Clarence Hatry , who lived in a state of Hollywood magnificence and once owned the Westward , largest yacht in British water , was hauled off to jail , charged with the more definite crime of obtaining a million dollar loan on forged bearer scrip certificates of City of Wakefield 4% stock . <P> In court last week Accountant Sir Gilbert Garnsey , who has buried his patrician nose in the books of the Hatry companies for many weeks , announced that the six principal companies had liabilities of more than $143,000,000 . There were some assets , but apparently $67,500,000 was irretrievably lost , an all time record for British failures . <P> " Unsecured creditors are likely to receive very little , " said Sir Gilbert in measured tones , " while there will certainly be nothing at all for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice shaken with emotion :
