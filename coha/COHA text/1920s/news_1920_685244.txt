txt The one Issue which can make the American Legion stick together is the soldiers ' bonus . The veterans have been told to remain out of politics ? that is , not to seek public office on the qualification of having been to war  --  and the present policy of the legion is not to seek to be a factor in campaigns . The organization ? was founded upon some healthy generalities concerning Americanism . The generalities were praiseworthy and we think they represent the sentiment of the men , but they will not keep the organization together . It will be kept together if it is working for thmething the men want . Mayor Thompson , an antl-soldier , anti-war ( antitbe war that was not wars in general ) , home staying politician , controls Chicago through an , organi : zation the members of which : - get something for being with him . If they did no ' : ' , get anything they would not be with him . They get It and stink together to get more  --  Jobs of various sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact anti solid because the men in the unions through them get better pay and better working conditions ; If the men did not get anything they would ' not be in union . The G. A. it grew into political power and controlled the country for about thirty years or more because the civil war veterans through their organization and its political power got peneions . Sett-interest governs most of the actions of men and it forms the basis of their association together , whether they associate in the Association of Commerce , the Yardmen 's union , or the Beau Brummel Pleasure and Athletic club . . The cement in the American Legion is the bonus . We tried to get the.legion interested In universal training , but the benefits of that were too remote and the benefits of the boims too intimate . Some citizens who are neither lean nor war itwarred aredismayed , saying that the soldiers ' demand for the bonus is a tarnish on their patriotism . They seem to think that Prplts are the prerogatives of pacifism and that it is patriotic to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpatriotic to fight the war in Prance and ask fdr money if alive to ask for it when back home . Morally the soldier bonus needs no Justification . The services the veterans gave can not be compensated in money . The expediency of the bonus fs another matter . When It was a question of it or universal service we thought the legion ought to be for universal service and give up the bonus . Congress would not establish ' the service . It will give the bonus . All the ' soldiers have to do is to ask for it persistently enough . They will get it . Congress proposes to pay only the enlisted men and not the officers . If the officers stand for that they are idiots . Congress endeavors to operate on the fiction that the . officers were aristocrats and rolled . out of money into war and out of war back into money . In military matters congress is sublimity in asininity and hypocrisy . The officer. : were volunteers , who went in early and did their beSt to fit themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college or Just finishing college and ready to take up their professions . They Last opportunities , time , and money . They bought their uniforms and had heavy personal expenses . If the officers of the American Legion allow congress to proceed on the theory that an officer Is not a soldier , is a gilded aristocrat , and deserves eo consideration they will hurt any army the il'nited States may try to raise . If there is a bonus the officers should be in it . Should there be a bonus ? If the question is merely whether there shalt be a bonus or nothing , we say yes for the bonus : It will keep the American Legion alive and its members together . If they eta ! : together until they have a. working cohesion they can make their influence felt in American politics , which needs such an influence . It the legion disintegrates and the soldiers do not exercise any collective energy and vigor and influence , the politics of the United States will remain in the control of pacifists , stay at homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , politicians such as Thompson et al. , who are against soldiers , and groups of semi-aliens who have no more real interest in the United States than they have in Liberia . The soldiers say they do not like the trend of American governme4 policies . They- will never correct it by taking strikers ' places in engine cabs , chasing I. W. W. 's up side streets and getting out as a constabulary es ? ery time there is a local disturbance . That is what the pacifists and peace profiteering people think the legion Is for . It will evaporate f it has no other .... weft for remaining in existence . : : , ine of the mew complain that their beer was i .. ken away from them while they were abroad . They will not get their beer back by complaining . 0T h two , . re are thirty-five ex-service men In the New Vei : asserrloy. : ... ) f them tw sate drys , Six do not n , . iress an opinion , and twenty-six are in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair reflex of , oilier opinion , but it will never get political effectiveness unless the service men try for it through an organisation which has for its reason in existence the self-interest of the men . They - nay see that their self-interest demands universal Training . If they do we shall get that . The people now running polities in this country are running it for their own advarttage . They ar4 . tfraid of the soldiers . They were/not in the war . They profited by staying at home . Rather than have them run the country for the next generation we 'll take the soldier control and hope that it will he wise . The bonus will keep the legion in existence and It will grow strong . We think that if the veterans were wise they would not ask for a cash payment , but we know they will . If each man got $500 most of it would ha gone in a short time . Every man knows that . Some of them would make wise use of it and receive a permanent benefit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be merry , " and the ex-service men are young . The insurance proposed as an alternative would be wiser than a cash bonus . There are other wiser Inane , but if the men demand the money they will get it . If they get it we hope it strengthens the legion and makes it a political power for the good of the country . We are rather sick of the brand of political management obtained from groups which had nothing to do with the war except possibly retard American efforts . Men who were good enough Americans to fight are good enough to have something co say In American politics and policies .
