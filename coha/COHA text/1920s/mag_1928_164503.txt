Even a savage knows that the world is a place of magic ; he wonders what huge invisible hand draws the sun down into darkness , with what inaudible , dark charm a man is taken , suddenly and forever , out of the world , into an unreal place . This last trick puzzles even people who know just how all the others are accomplished . When someone dies whom they have known , they may go to witch-doctors called mediums who pretend that by saying hocus-pocus or by going into a trance , they can make dead people say things to people who are living . This is false magic ; humbler fellows who are content to imitate the mysteries of life and death with 52 cards , a white handkerchief and a tailcoat , are annoyed by such lying fakers ; they delight in demonstrating their absurdity . Famed Harry Houdini did it before he died . Famed Joseph Dunninger does it now , the same way , by wagering that he can duplicate the miracles of any supernaturalist by using the mechanics of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediums who nibbled at his bets , Conjurer Dunninger performed his stunts for benefit of press . Trussed up in a leather harness , his hands encased in mittens that were sewn to his sleeves , tied to a chair by a rope of which the knots were sealed with wax , concealing no instruments , he was placed behind a curtain . In front of the curtain was a table on which were placed a pail of hot paraffin , a bucket of water , a pencil and a sheet of paper with three names for identification . When the room was darkened , Conjurer Dunninger caused the paper to be snatched away and returned it with this phrase inscribed upon it : " A word from Houdini . " Then there protruded from the curtain a " spirit hand " which the magician later admitted to be a paraffin sheath . Conjurer Dunninger said he would make the ghost of Houdini come ; at this a spectre mewed at the newsmongers .

They said that Famed Conjurer Dunninger was the legitimate successor to Harry Houdini . One man who had watched the exhibition of miracles was disgusted by them . He was Charles E. Davenport , the manager of Nino Pecoraro , a medium who had issued a challenge to Dunninger for a " phenomena producing " contest . After watching the things which Dunninger did , Davenport withdrew his challenge because Mr. Pecoraro was alleged not to be in the right psychic condition . <P> For Mr. Dunninger , psychic condition meant nothing . In a biographical sketch which he contributed to Science and Invention Magazine the publication which sponsored his most recent strange doings , he calmly remarked : " Good ' patter ' speeches well studied , and a smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
