txt When Representative ISAAC- SIEGEL of New York returned about a year ago from California , where the House Committee on Immigration had : been , holdi-ng hearings upon the Japanese question , he declared that politicians who sought public office were most active in the anti-Japanese agitation in that State . They had aroused bitten feeling by their tirades . " In the shops at Turlock , " sail Mr. SIEGEL , " were signs , ' No Japanese " trade wanted . ' As there ' is a law " " that barbers can not refuse to shave " customers , the barbers post notices : " ' Shave  --  Japanese $10 , Whites ? 25 " Cents . ' " It is from Turlock that Japanese field laborers , brought into the district to pick ' fruit at . 16 cents a crate , were driven by a mob a few ' days ago . The Japanese complain that they were roughly handled . " The incident , " says Consul General YADA at San Francisco , . " was the most de " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . California since I be " came Consul General here . " There was a similar " deportation " of Japanese crate-fillers at Livingston , Merced County , last week . As a fruit crop is now being gathered in California , other manifestations of hostility to Japanese laborers ' may he expected . The mob at Turlock ' was discriminating , for it ? did not meddle with leaseholders . Their rights could be easily established in the courts . Laborers hired to harvest the fruj.t crop are nomads and therefore easier game . It is significant that the Industrial Woxkers of the World are held responsible for the outrage upon peaceful Japanese at Turlock , who were roused at night , herded into motor cars , ' and taken five miles out of town.with.warnings not to return . The I. W. W. is not a popular organization in California , and it is to be suspected that ' in this case it was the line of least resistance . Turlock 's reputation for liberal treatment of the Japanese is distinctly bad . The community does not rant them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are more of these demonstrations of racial antagonism , which are particularly embarrassing to the Federal Government rat a time when Japan is invited to a conference to discuss not only limitation of armaments but Pacifip questions ( Japan might be inclined to r-gard the treatment of her subjects in coastal California as such a question ) , it will be because the police power of California is indifferent and inert . It is to be noted that Consul General YADA expects " the Amer/ ican Government " to protect Japanese in this country , " for in our country , " he says , " the Japanese Government protects Americans . " He evidently did not have the State of California in mind . The treaty with Japan . provides , that ' ? the subjects or " citizens of the high contracting par " ties shall receive , in the territories " of the other , the most constant " protection and security of their " persons ' and property .

The State Government has all the power necessary , to keep the peace at Tur- ' lock or anywhere ' else , and to protect the Japanese , leaseholders or laborers , in their rights .
