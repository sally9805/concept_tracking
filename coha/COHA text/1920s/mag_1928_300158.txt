Britain . The Lady Beauchamp revealed , last week , that on election eve David Lloyd George , shrewd , intuitive , said to her : " The chances that Mr. Hoover will be elected are 50 to 1 in his favor . " <P> London 's press of course chronicled President-elect Hoover 's triumph with felicitations and urbanity , but also dug up the old and rusty hatchet which Secretary Hoover flung at the British rubber monopoly ( TIME , April 16 ) . Even the impeccably well-bred London Times printed a distinctly savage cable from its Washington correspondent : <P> " The clock has been set back , no man can tell how far ! If the United States is to be the gainer by the result ef the election , it will be because Mr. Hoover is strong enough to rise above some of the forces which have helped to elect him . . . . He will have need of all his strength and all his independence of mind-of all those qualities , in short , which even his admirers have vainly sought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faith which has been placed in him . . . . <P> For him , the American way , whether it be political , social or religious , is better than any other way , and in its essence different and superior . His is a conception of America romanticized by long residence abroad . " <P> Polite and typical was the comment of the Daily Mail , London's. newspaper of world 's largest circulation : " The British people will tender their respectful congratulations to Mr. Hoover , the new President of the United States . ... He has traveled or practised his profession in many parts of our Empire , including Burma and Australia . " <P> Butler John Dunn , who buttled for Engineer &; Mrs. Hoover in England 14 years ago , soothingly observed at London last week : " Every Christmas , Mr. &; Mrs. Hoover used to give a party to all their servants and to the children , and Mr. Hoover used to dress up as Father Christmas and distribute lovely prizes from the Christmas tree to the children . <P> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Mrs. Hoover used to have several dozen eggs boiled hard and painted different colors . On Easter Saturday night they used to creep secretly into the garden and hide the eggs in various places . Next morning all the children , including their own two boys , had to find the eggs and a prize was awarded to the one who found most , although as an actual fact every child got a prize . They used to call the game ' hunting the rabbit 's egg . ' " <P> Said Labor 's Daily Herald : " Why should the average American kill a Republican Government to make way for a Democratic Government when the difference between them is negligible ? Smith 's defeat is at bottom the judgment of the American electorate upon the unreality of American politics . The people just do n't care . Only 50 per cent of the electorate trouble to go to the polls , and of these the majority choose to keep Dum in office rather than bother to change to Dee . " <P> France , Spain , Italy . Wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover . <P> Paris semi-official Journal des Debats gloomed : " We see small hope that he will cancel our debts or greatly reduce them . <P> " Yet Hoover who contributed so much to save the starving populations of Belgium and northern France will not be blind to the lot of Europe .
