President Hernando Siles of Bolivia took step after step toward war , last week , while his Foreign Minister , Tomas Manuel Elio , kept the cables hot with peace talk . <P> Seor Elio found innumerable polite reasons why Bolivia should not avail herself of offers of mediation made by 1 ) the Pan-American conference on arbitration and conciliation at Washington ; 2 ) the council of the League of Nations sitting at Lugano , Switzerland ; 3 ) the permanent Pan-American conciliation commission at Montevideo ; 4 ) King Alfonso XIII of Spain ; 5 ) Pope Pius XI ; 6 ) President Irigoyen of Argentine ; 7 ) President Machado of Cuba . <P> Finally , however , Bolivia did accept the " good offices " of the Pan-American Conference for an investigation of the origin of the conflict . <P> But this was after Paraguay had cabled to the League Council : <P> " Paraguay does not refuse any conciliation procedure for the settlement of her dispute with Bolivia . " <P> It was also after President Hernando Siles of Bolivia had harangued : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war must come , I swear to march to the front myself . " <P> When the President learned that-although war had not been declared-Bolivian soldiers had captured Paraguayan Fort Boqueron , he cried from a balcony of the presidential palace , " in taking the fort our soldiers gave a splendid example of Bolivian patriotism . Viva the army ; viva the commander of our forces in the Chaco ; viva Bolivia . " <P> The President of Paraguay , Dr. Jose P. Guggiari , was born in Lugano , Switzerland , where the council of the League of Nations was in session last week . President Guggiari harangued no mobs . With Swiss calm he called Congress into extraordinary session , proceeded quietly with mobilization . The excited members of his cabinet urged that every able bodied man or boy between 18 and 28 be called to the colors . The President said , " Not yet . " <P> The highly technical position taken by the Bolivian foreign office is that the HONOR OF BOLIVIA demands that Paraguayan blood be spilled , because Paraguayan TROOPS ATTACKED BOLIVIANS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gran Chaco , a wild and wooded region of over 100,000 square miles . <P> From the first the Paraguayans have contended that it was their troops who were attacked by Bolivians ; and the Paraguay charg d ' affaires at La Paz , Bolivia , immediately suggested neutral investigation of whatever had occurred in Gran Chaco . The reply of the Bolivian government was to break off relations with Paraguay last fortnight , and to send more Bolivian soldiers last week into Gran Chaco , where at least 200 humans met death in circumstances impossible to ascertain .
