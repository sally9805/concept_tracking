Misshapen and frayed as a badly done potato pancake , the old horned toad that lugubriously blinked in the Eastland , Tex. , drugstore window last week proved all the lies that Texans had ever told of Nature 's antics in their state . The reptile had lived for 31 years in the sealed hollow of the local courthouse cornerstone . So averred honest men who had just dug it out , and one remembered having planned to put a horned toad in the stone at its laying 31 years ago . The idea then , and even now , in Texas is that a horned toad can live 100 years without food , water , air or company . At such a legend scientists scoff . <P> A horned toad is not a toad , nor a frog . It is a lizard , a reptile , which through the ages has developed a broad , squat , warty body . It looks like a batrachian , save for its short , sharp tail . Horned toads run ; they do not hop . They breathe by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regular toads can breathe through the skin . Horned toads ( i.e. lizards ) are of a higher form of life than are batrachians . <P> And that is why scientists , save for Dr. William Temple Hornaday , for 30 years director of the New York Zoological Garden , disbelieved the story of the Eastland horned toad . It might have lived , the questioned authorities say , one , two or even five years within the sealing of the stone , but never a human generation . <P> Against this array and fortified with an amusing non-sequitur , Naturalist Hornaday went with his story : <P> " It is possible . I recall an incident in my own experience which seems to confirm it . I was in Ceylon , digging for elephant bones and tusks in sand which was packed so hard it had almost the consistency of rock . So far as could be observed that layer of sand had been lying there a thousand years . In this impermeable mass about two feet beneath the surface , we uncovered a frog sic , sic which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickaxes and was lifted out alive . Its stomach was full of water which it ejected and then hopped away . " <P> That was a very brave story for Dr. Hornaday to revive and it gave narrative confidence to a plain &; ordinary Texan , one George Henkel , Dallas taxidermist . Said he without winking , thinking or drinking : <P> " I know more about horned toads , I reckon , than any man in Texas , both inside and out . I have mounted everything from a humming bird to a Texas steer with horns eight feet long from tip to tip . <P> " Thirty years ago I opened an office at Waco , when horned toads were so plentiful that boys were selling them for five cents each . I conceived the idea of mounting a few of the larger specimens and using them for pen racks . <P> " When I got hold of a big bull horned toad one day I saturated a rag with chloroform and held it under his nose long enough to have killed a bulldog . <P> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , it reared up on its hind legs and wanted to fight me . <P> " I put him in a cigar box and saturated cotton with a teacupful of chloroform and put that in there with him , and then placed a pound weight on the box lid . The next morning Mr. Toad was gone . He had pulled a Houdini during the night and disappeared . <P> " A horned toad is nothing more than a little alligator that 's been stepped on and mashed flat , and like his forbears that hibernate for months or years at a time , does not bother about the lapse of time .
