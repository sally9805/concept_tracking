txt Managers of national , State and local Political organ izat. ; , . os who have recently flocked forward with announcements that they intended to make a " radio campaign " are doomed to some disappointment , according ' to opinions expressed yesterday in the offices of the big broadcasting , companies . Discussion of the subject was precipitated by announcements in yesterday 's newspapers from William M. Butler , Republican National Chairman . that President Coolidge would make few public appearances during the campaign , but devote his speech-making largely to the microphone . " That makes it unanimous , " said one broadcasting manager . ' ' Now they 've all said they 're going to do it , The demand is , going to exceed the facilities by far , and some of them are going to be disappointed . We have not Only Presidential candidates and the national campaign to handle , but we have State campaigns and others of a more local nature . It simply can not , be done . Radio men in , touch with the various national committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their officials know ' almost nothing about the practical problems involved . It devolves upon us to straighten out the tangle . They announce they are going to broadcast , but it is we wkio will have to deliver the goods . " It was learned yesterday that so far no definite arrangements have been made by any of the national committees for broadcasting . The subject is being actively considered , however , by the radio men , who realize the unprecedented problem they have to face . First Radio Campaign . They pointed out yesterday that a national campaign by radio is a complete novelty . There never has be , one before . There are no rules . The rules will have to be made up as they go along . Nor are there any data on hand as a result of past experience to serve , as ' a guide to what may be needed . The whole question will have to be studied from the ground up . An official of one of the largest concerns that broadcasts , who is known for the broad viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , consented yesterday to discuss the subject for ' publication provided his name was not used nor his company identified . - Radio prdvides an important utility for employment in the forthcoming campaign , " this man said , " and of course we want to make It available to the greatest possible extent . But the fact remains that the demands all the political managers have expressed would , swamp us if we attempted to fill them . They can not be filled as they stand . What we are faced with , therefore , is the necessity of adjusting the existing facilities to give the utmost possible service . " This being a national campaign of course the national committees are talking about broadcasting the speeches of their candidates ' all over the country . ' They are faced with disappOintment right there , for that can not be done except in very limited instances . " The trouble seems to be , that the political managers believe broadcasting to San Francisco is as simple as getting a through telephone wire there . Those who know radio know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In broadcasting on a national scale , we will have to fall back on the land wires of the American Telephone and ' Telegraph Company as a basis . These wires will receive the speeches from the microphone , wherever It is set up , and take-them to the cities from which they are to be broadcast , whereupon the local stations in those cities will put them on the air . In other words , the main wire channel is limited to what the American Telephone and Telegraph Company can provide . It has a service to maintain , and can not throw overboard everything to give right of way to broadcasting . So we come upon a limitation there . " It is not generally considered likely that the newly developed system of short wave retransmission can play any important part in broadcasting Presidential speeches across the continent . This has been , demonstrated with some success , but is still on an experimental basis . The difficulty is that all atmospheric disturbances are transmited along with the sound waves , whereas the land wires deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " The ' broadcasting of the two National Conventions extended the country 's facilities about as far as they would go , and they were based on the , capacity of the A. T. &; T. wires . At first the telephone company thought it was up against an almost impossible problem . Then its long lines department got busy and worked out a. scheme . Finally the company went to the National Committee with a list of twelve cities to which It could deliver the convention proceedings . It told the ' National Committee to choose its cities and make the arrangements with local broadcasters , and when this was done the handling ' began , with-most excellent results . ' The national- campaign will be far more complicated . There will be not only , She Republican &nd".,,,Democratic; - Parties to attend to one at a time , but they will both want facilities at the same time and there will be the La Follette party and perhaps others . Advises Local Field Units . " One of the first steps the radio men will take will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme as far as possible into local units . A speech which is aimed , for instance , at the industrial centres of the East would have little application to the campaign that will be made among the farm sections of the West . " It should , therefore , be confined to the local stations of the East . Arguments addressed to the farm issues , similarly , should be localized in that region . Where the broadcasting can be confined to one locality the problem will be greatly simplified . The overland transmission problem , which is the greatest , will be eliminated . It then becomes a question of how much politi- , cal stuff each local station will want ' to include in its programs . Often these speeches can be made direct from the studio  --  exclusively a radio problem . " Of course , a certain number of speeches by President Coolidge , John W. Davis and La Follette can be broadcast from coast to coast . But there will have to be a limit somewhere . " The question of expense enters into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conventions was about $10,000 for six days . This was borne by the broadcasters and not charged to the National Committees , for the former felt it was interesting material which the public wanted and they could handle It as part of their regular expense of putting out programs . Problem of Expense . " It is a question whether the broadcasters will feel the same way about the campaign . They will undoubtedly be willing to transmit a certain number of speeches by the leading candidates at their own expense . But if the thing keeps up they will ' probably feel the expense should be borne by the National Committees . For this will be a service from which the parties will benefit and , as they- pay for other means of campaign publicity , the broadcasters will probably feel they should nay for this . " There is a-question  --  whether the campaign managers understand as well as the radio men that too much broadcasting will not help their cause . We know what people will listen in on and we know they ' will not listen indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept within reasonable bounds , the public will tire of it as soon as the novelty wears off . It will then be a question for the broadcasters to settle individually whether they will clog their programs with material they know their hearers will not follow . The station that does too much of that will suffer . " We shall be absolutely non-partisans in our attitude . The radio industry ' gave as good ' service to the Republican as to the Democratic national convention , and vice versa . We also offered to transmit the proceedings of the La Follette convention at Cleveland . One of the New York stations has on its program shortly an address by the Socialist-Labor Party candidate for Governor of New York . The industry as a whole believes that the air should be free to all within reasonable limitations , and that It is up to the people to decide on the merits of the individual speakers and their viewpoints . They make the final disposition , not we . " And that brings up another new question involved in this flret national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broadcasting stations have been very chary about letting speakers broadcast controversial matters of opinion . The difficulties in that are obvious . As soon as any one side of any question is presented , there are bound to be a certain number of people who will complain that the station is seconding propaganda . Hard on the Spellbinder , " During the forthcoming campaign the studio restrictions in* that regard will have to be let down to a considerable extent . It is obvious that a Republican campaign speech Is not going to be devoted to the ' merits of the Democratic party , nor that the Democratic orators are going to spend much time extolling the virtues of their opponents . How and where can the line be drawn in fairness ? We do n't know now . That Is one of fife things we shall have to learn about as we go along , as we shall have to learn a good many other things in this unprecedented situation . " If the campaign managers will take the advice of those of us who have studied the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air long-winded political speeches . I have no hesitancy In saying that the ordinary poLitifta speech , as we have known it for years to be delivered from platforms in political campaigns , will not go at all with radio audiences . They will tune out in the middle of it and get some station that fs sending jazz or a symphony concert . " The politicians should realize they are facing apt entirely new situation , absolutely uhique in the history of American politics , and change their methods to meet it . No longer are their orators addressing crowds of their own followers . When a political speech goes on the air in this campaign it will be going to the homes of Republicans . Democrats , Progressives , Radicals , Socialists and all the brands there are . " The methods should be changed to meet this situation .. The old-time political speeches will not fill the bill . Broader viewpoints must be adopted . Rather than broadcasting speeches of a partisan nature , the campaigners should send out meetings and debates and addressee by those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they run the risk that before they , are half through their audience will have melted away . It can be done with a twist of the wrist . And the speaker will never know it . So they had bet watch out . " trk
