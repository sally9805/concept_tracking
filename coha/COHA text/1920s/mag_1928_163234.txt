Two decrees of major import were issued , last week , under the imperious aegis of paunchy , florid Dictator Don Miguel Primo de Rivera , Marquis de Estella . The first almost quadruples Spain 's usual appropriation for naval construction and brings the sum available for this purpose in 1928 up to 600,000,000 pesetas ( $100,200,000 ) . The second establishes the manufacture of paper as a State monopoly , thus strengthening the direct control over Spanish newspapers already exercised by the present Dictature.
