Tillie the Toiler ( Marion Davies , Matt Moore ) . According to Subtitle-Writer Ralph H. Spence , Tillie is the sort who wears two pairs of garters , " one to hold up her stockings and one to hold up traffic . " The minx sets her cap for her wealthy employer , Pennington Fish . To land him she toys with the firm 's general manager , Benjamin Franklin Whipple , a fop , declaring as she proceeds that she " will catch the rich Mr. Fish by using Whipple as the worm . " In due time , however , all this diabolism is put aside in favor of wholesome matrimony with a sober leading man , thus proving yet again that cinema is sound at the core , even though occasionally amusing . <P> <P> The Tender Hour ( Ben Lyon , Billie Dove ) . Those who have never seen Elinor Glyn 's Three Weeks , or read Beverly of Graustark , or thrilled to The Rover Boys , or breathed the fragrance of a 5- &-10c; perfume counter , may get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. hero who fights off the Grand Duke Sergeivitch and all his villainous fellows in order that the creamy , soft heroine may snuggle under his bold wing . <P> <P> The Whirlwind of Youth ( Lois Moran ) . He who runs amuck amongst women is considered the sweetest catch . In this film , evolved pleasantly enough from A. Hamilton Gibb 's novel , Soundings , the cocky Lothario finds that a glance from Nancy ( Lois Moran ) plumbs depths of emotion hitherto unknown and strangely captivating . Most of this goes on in Flanders Fields where he is a soldier and she an ambulance driver ; where one may sigh for a battered village and smile at pompous officers . <P> <P> The Heart of Salome ( Alma Rubens ) . How was dapper Monte Carrol , U. S. hero touring France , to realize that the entrancing Helene was not the sweet , good country lass she appeared to be in the shady bowers of Bretagne but really first assistant crook to Count Boris Zanko , Parisian archcriminal ? When he discovers the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritated , embarks upon revenge , thereby providing a Salome motif . Her weapon will be Count Boris , best swordsman in France . The thoroughgoing depravity of this fellow may best be understood when it is explained that he is Russian . In the end , however , love conquers all .
