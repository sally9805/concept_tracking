txt High Treasury officials share the opinion voiced by Internal Revenue Collectors throughout the United States . as set forth in THE New YORK TIMES this morni.i , g , that no particular benefit is derived by the Government from the Publication of income tax lists . They assert that it has not had the effect of increasing revenue from delinquents who might otherwise evade payment , that the data made available for publication are of no particular value and that it is an added expense to the Federal Government to make the necessary arrangements for throwing open the lists to public inspection so that they may be examined without confusion , without damage to the original records of the . Government and without permitting access to other income tax data which it is a violation of the law to publish . Secretary Mellon is not in Washington , hut It is well known , as was pointed out by other Treasury officials today , that the Secretary of the Treasury is in full accOrd.With . th ? . Views of President Coolidge on the subject . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision of the income tax law . He said so publicly when Congress met last Winter and is expected to ' renew his recommendation for repeal in his forthcoming annual message to Congress . Quote Coolidge and Mellon . In his last annual message on Dec. 8 , 1924 , President Coolidge stated his views as follows : " Every ' one desires a reduction of taxes , and there is a great preponderance of sentiment in favor of taxation reform . When I approved the present tax law I stated publicly that I did so in spite of certain provisions which I believed unwise and harmful . One of the most glaring of these was the making public of the amounts assessed against different income tax payers . Although that damage has now been done , I believe its continuation to be detrimental to the public welfare and bound to decrease public revenues , so that it ought to be repealed . " Secretary Mellon also recommended the repeal of the publicity in his last annual report Treasury officials today pointed to that report as representing the attitude of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Revenue act of 1924 added to the requirement that the names and addresses of all taxpayers be open to public inspection the additional requirement that the amount of tax paid by each be also open to inspection . At the same time Congress specifically reenacted Section 3167. which penalizes the printing or publication of any part of a return . No attempt was made to reconcile these two sections . Whatever the law may be . the printing has been done and we can now view , in the light of actual experience , the undesirability of the publicity provision . " Aside from the question of the unnecessary violation of the right of privacy which should be insured to all citizens in the spirit of the Fifth amendment to the Constitution , it would be interesting to know what good n ill be accomplished by the provision . The Treasury has every means of access to the complete returns and all books and papers of each of these taxpayers . Says Taxpayers Are Hurt . " Publicity Is wholly unnecessary from an administrative standpoint . Publicity serves one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those having some ulterior motive information which is of value to them solely to the extent it is detrimental to the taxpayer. ? They gain by the taxpayer being hurt . " It is difficult to imagine any one thing which would be a greater spur to the efforts of all taxpayers to avoid a taxable income than the threat that the amount they pay will be pilloried . ITo the direct monetary value of saving payment of an Inherently high tax is added the incentive , in many cases much stronger , of preserving business privacy . " Immediately upon the recent publication of this information opened to the public , the newspapers reported a stimulation in the market for tax-exempt securities . We may promptly expect renewed use of the many means of tax avoidance . With the consequent decrease in the productivity of the income tax . The provision should be repealed . " Will Renew Repeal Fight . Secretary Mellon will renew this recommendation in his coming annual report . When the income tax publicity provision was proposed in Congress it was argued by some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional revenue for . the Government by making it possible for its agents more easily to round up delinquents who were evading the making of returns as required by law . Treasury officials asserted today that they are unable to Point to a single case in which a taxdodger has been run down or uncovered as a result of publication of the tax lists . On the contrary , the Treasury , it was stated , is at all times locating delinquents and their names are being added to the tax lists and tax payments demanded of them wholly independent of the publicp.tion of income tax lists . As a matter of fact , - it was stated , - agents of the department during : July-alone discovered that 13,217 persons had neglected to file returns or their , income on March 15 , 1925 . It was further stated that taxes totaling $674.420 had been collected against these delinquents . The names of these persons do not alsoear in the income tax lists opened for publication . The lists which were opened yesterday included compilations made by the Collector 's office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did not include , therefore , the names of those delinquents rounded up in the July campaign against delinquency . These names , it was stated , will be opened to inspection about Oct. 1 , after being added to tile lists which were opened for examination yesterday . These delinquents are in all parts of Ithe country . It was stated at the Treasury that 1,207 of them are in the New York districts . from whom a total of $25,000 in delinquent taxes were being collected . There were sixty-five in Detroit . from whom $112,000 was collected ; 585 In Philadelphia , from whom $31,000 was collected ; 527 in Pittsburgh , from whom $5.537 was collected , and 146 in the Maryland district , whose tax delinquencies amounted to $18,422 . The round-up of delinquents and tax ' dodgers proceeds month by month . That of August has just been completed , but the report of collections from delinquents this month has not been finished , although their names will also be added to the list thrown open to inspection , probably about Nov. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , have no fixed place of business and refrain from filing income tax returns because they are afraid it would disclose the nature of their illegal business . Considerable sums have been collected from bootlegging delinquents , some of whom are now serving terms in Federal penitentiaries . ATTACKS TAX PUBLICITY . J. H. Tregoe Would Give Out Names of Prosperous Who Do n't Pay . J. H. Tregoe , executive manager of the National Association of Credit Men , in a statement yesterday , said that he could not see any good , economic or social , accomplished through the publication of the amounts of taxes paid to the Government . " Whether publishing income tax returns is a good thing or not , " he said , " it seems to me that more real good would result from publishing the name of prosperous citiZeits who pay no 1ncome tax . The divulging of the amount and character of one 's income for purposes of taxation should be regarded as a confidential transaction . This information , 0.8%1 see the situation , should not be open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the newspapers in printing the information . because it certainly is news , and the courts have decided that the press is within its rights in publishing it . I feel , however , that the discontinuance of thts publicity Should be provided for in whatever taxation measure is adopted in the nest Congress . "
