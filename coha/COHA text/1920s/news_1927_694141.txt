txt Among the reasons given for the failure of the American delegation at the Geneva Naval Conference to carry its point is the fact that it approached its task in a spirit of overconfidence . This does not mean that its particular case had not been thoroughly studied . The work done by both political and technical advisers was thorough . But there seemed to be a belief , almost childish in its innocence , that whatever the Americans asked the British and the Japanese would be only too glad to grant . Our Government was as far as possible from making positive demands . It put forward only suggestions and requests . But somehow the thing was done with the air of not expecting a negative answer , and being unwilling to take a " no " even if one were forthcoming at first . This attitude , which was not in the least intended to be overbearing or offensive , was plainly a puzzle to the other nations represented at Geneva . Both French and English correspondents referred to it as en instance of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that nothing could be refused to it . This , of course , was not born of the idea that America is too powerful to be opposed , but that she is always so sweetly reasonable that others must see that she is right and be happy to go along with her . In this connection the Geneva correspondent of The London Times referred to the rumor that if the naval agreement failed there might be a revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance . He casually mentioned that this had been " aban " doned at the behest of the United " States . " The reference was to the Washington Conference of 1921-22 . But even before it met , there is evidence to show that the British Government had made up its mind to abandon it , or to merge it in some larger agreement covering interests in the Pacific and the 4ar East . There were reasons of Em- pire for such a change . It was obvious to the British Government that anti-Japanese feeling was nearly as strong in Western Canada as it was on our Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of any trouble which would tend to make the Anglo-Japanese alliance operative the Imperial Government was aware that it could not count upon the sympathy or active support of its most powerful Dominions . Accordingly , the British delegates went to the Washington Conference quite prepared to give up the Anglo-Japanese alliance for the sake of a broader and better understanding in relation to both naval armaments and the large concerns of the Pacific and the Orient . It should be added that the Japanese statesmen met the situation in a. large way and were ready to do their part in the final settlement , because it looked to stability and peace , where before there had been friction and increasing danger of hostility . The thing was done certainly not at the " behest " of the United States . To get rid of the Anglo-Japanese alliance was undoubtedly a source of pleasure and of relief to our Government , but its part in bringing about the happy result was cooperation , not command .               @ @ @ @ @ @
