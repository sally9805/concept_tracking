No man in the U. S. holds as many honorary degrees as G. 0 . P. Nominee Herbert Clark Hoover . He has received them from 30 colleges and universities ; 19 of them are the monumental degree of LL . D. But at 1928 commencements , Mr. Hoover 's list was not increased ; he was too busy for Kudos . It was Paul Louis Charles Claudel who led all the rest this year . As poet , dramatist , philosopher , Roman Catholic almost mystic in his zeal , distinguished visitor to the U. S. with the portfolio of French Ambassador , he is a fitting candidate for honorary degrees . He received four of them at June commencement exercises-from Columbia , Princeton , Yale , University of Delaware . <P> Herewith are some of the recipients of kudos at the later commencements : * <P> Smith College <P> Louise Pound , 56 , famed tennis &; golf player , professor ( University of Nebraska ) , author , sister of Dean Roscoe Pound of Harvard Law school L.
