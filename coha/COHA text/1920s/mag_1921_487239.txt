system even for adults . In the meanwhile it is something to have modified it for the children as far as organizations like the Gerry Society have been able to do so . The children 's home carries the process a step further . Its aim is not merely to care for and protect the child until the courts have taken action , but to take hold of and edu  --  cate him afterward ; its hope is to deinstitutionalize the care of " the most unpromising child " ? to surround him with an environment so human , so normal , so hopeful that he will grow up with those qualities inbred . In the back of Mr. Heckscher 's mind  --  although , modestly , he only hints at it in conversation  --  is undoubtedly the hope- that the children 's home may inaugurate as great and far-spreading a change in method as did the Gerry Society ; that it , too , may prove not merely an organization but a movement . That is why the building has been erected on Fifth Avenue opposite Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheaper and , for its own purposes , perhaps better site . " It is intended not so much as a model home , " says Mr. Heckscher , " as a demonstration of an unfilled need in modern society . It is built in the hope that others will follow . " In the Driftway T HE Drifter has lately received a suggestion in regard to The Nation from a reader who has been camping in California . The word " reader " is used advisedly , rather than subscriber or newsstand purchaser , because of knowl  --  edge that the person in question never buys anything more expensive than the Saturday Evening Post and reads The Nation only when the Drifter or some other friend , solicitous for his mental welfare , sends him a free copy . Nevertheless , and perhaps all the more , the idea may have merit . As explained in a letter to the Drifter , it is this : I have a suggestion for the improvement of The Nation which you might put up to the editors . At present it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from page 364 to page 385 and , just as you are finding out what is the matter with Harding , your eye travels to the next page and you find out what is wrong with Turgeniev or Ibsen . The change I suggest is one of technical make-up and need not necessarily affect the editorial policy at all . I am sure that it would greatly increase the weekly 's circulation among liberal readers who do not have the jack to buy table-cloths and are therefore delicately shaded with pink if not downright red . T HESE are sad days for steamships . With the fall- ing off of world commerce and the diminished demand for cargo space since the end of the European War , many a fine new ship is rusting her hull away swinging idly at anchor or made fast to a lonely dock . And if this be true of fine new ships , what must be the fate of the older ones ? Alas , they are passing into ignominious oblivion or ex  --  periencing an even more bitter fate . A few weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sector given over almost wholly to rough , shapeless , square-ended cargo vessels when his eye caught a graceful bow  --  sprit protruding over the dock . The rare sight of a steam  --  ship with an old-fashioned clipper bow sent the Drifter hurrying to the spot , where he read on the hull the name New York . Could it be the old New York , the once famous ship of the American Line ? The clipper bow and the hand  --  some lines said , yes ; but instead of the well-remembered black funnels with white rings , the smoke stacks were blue , with a strange device at the top and the mystic letters " P. N. C. " T HE Drifter strolled over to a knot of sailors for infor  --  mation . Sure enough , it was the old liner , not so many years ago one of the crack passenger vessels of the Western Ocean . The New York and her sister ship , the Philadelphia ( n  --  e City of Paris ) , were among the first steamships of modern type to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years since in the North River near the foot of Fulton Street , and carried many a brilliant company to and from Southampton . When the Drifter found the New York the other day she was owned by the Polish Navigation Com  --  pany and employed on an obscure route to the Baltic Sea . " P. N. C. ? Pay No Crew , " said one of the sailors , pointing disgustedly toward the mystic letters on the funnels . " She was to have sailed the other day , but they would n't let her . You 'll find her cabin door plastered with attachments . " A few days later the Drifter noticed in the newspapers that the New York had been sold for debt . THE DRIFTER Correspondence The American Legion ? A Defense To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : May I be permitted to comment on your article in the issue of November 23 , The American Legion at Play ? And first , may I state that I vote with those soldiers who wish to see Eugene V. Debs released ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nation has used as its bases for opinion a letter from Mr. John W. Gunn and quotations from the Kansas City Post and the St. Joseph Gazette . From these it states that " militarism shoved , strutted , and staggered " through the streets ; that the parade was a " very belligerent display of the new patriotism " ; that " many of the paraders were 100 per cent intoxicated " ; and from these The Nation draws the verdict that " the assembly was a medley of rum , rowdyism , and riot . " I am afraid I do not make this interpretation . But suppose there could not be two opinions ; suppose it were true that the assembly was a medley of rum , rowdyism , and riot , surely the blame should not rest chiefly on the soldiers . It is the duty Of the city authorities to enforce prohibition . If tap-s were turned on , where should one expect liquor to flow except down the throats that were there ? Remember , too , that these throats did not belong entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had never belonged to the army were not always mere onlookers . It is unfortunate that the emphasis or massing of the article in The Nation makes it appear that it is the soldiers who should bear the brunt of whatever criticism can be made in regard to the convention in Kansas City . On a question of fact ? I am afraid Mr. Gunn did not view the parade which he calls a " belligerent display " with the eyes of the average spectator , nor did he realize the spirit of the soldiers . To them that parade was a review ; their greatest . They were passing before five distinguished com  --  manders for whom they had , at the lowest , respect , and , at the highest , hero-worship . Is it likely that the officers would per  --  mit " many paraders , 100 per cent intoxicated " ? As I sat in the stand from which the generals reviewed the men , and in the front row , I should have been near enough to see drunken men . But the soldiers marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France where we sent them . But to come to interpretation merely : the average spectator in tolerant , generous Kansas City took , I am convinced , the point of view that , all things considered , the disorder was less than might have been expected . It is always well , in judging a deed , to consider how bad a man it takes to do it . The col- lege boy who steals watermelons when on a country " hike " with rollicking companions is not by intention a thief . A reunion of college boys can make a good deal of disturbance in a city . I believe the majority of those who looked on in Kansas City regarded the soldiers much as they would have regarded a class of college boys many times multiplied ; they would have chosen the word " horseplay " rather than " rowdyism . " Mr. Gunn says , disapprovingly , that the soldiers hurled waste cans in front of passing automobiles ; they did , but at the rate at which auto  --  mobiles were obliged to crawl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crapshooters did " cavort " even , on the streets  --  a revival , that , of the overseas diversion . But there seemed nothing heinous about all this to practically all of the civilians . Is it not significant of the temper and con  --  duct of soldiers and civilians that , despite the inordinate crowds , not a single accident took place in the downtown streets ? Touching even that riot in the Hotel Baltimore on the last day ? could not that , too , be put in terms of college boy excess ? Have there not been many cases of college boys drinking and dicing , rounded up by the police ? Has not the fighting that followed changed from the jocular to the , angry , with painful results ? One is only trying to explain , not to look at this thing as a stern moralist who wants to make a point rather than to understand . For any excess , these soldiers have an excuse no college group could have  --  these men who went through so much at our bidding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For those who were not overseas , it takes deep under  --  standing , based on unusual imagination and sympathy , to realize the suffering our soldiers endured . If I may speak per  --  sonally , I thought by 1915 that I had penetrated that suffering ; but not till I had been overseas , and under fire something like two hundred times , did I realize how costly war is to body and soul . I have penetrated but a little way , though I have seen many a soldier , blue with cold , lying in mud , with only one blanket ; though I have seen men killed within a few feet of me ; though I have often taken the last messages of men dying in agony , who asked me to tell their mothers or wives that they went without pain . These men who came home have endured physical and spiritual agony that they can not express . Perhaps they returned expecting too much of life and of their fellow Americans . Hundreds of them lie forgotten in hospitals ; hun  --  dreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the able-bodied are not so far along in their careers as they would be if they had not gone overseas . Then came a chance for a great reunion ; each soldier would meet old comrades who had gone through what he had . They came , and hospitable Kansas City indulged them . Is it surprising that there should have been excesses ? The world is surely sick of war and of " a peace from war which is more like disease than the war itself . " But there remains to the soldiers who fought for us our debt of justice , of understanding  --  and surely , at long intervals , our tolerance for his overflowing at reunions . Ithaca , N. 17 , November 26 MAUDE RADFORD WARREN Tut ! Tut ! To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : It appears that The Nation . likes its little joke . It an  --  nounces another Poetry Contest , We took the last one seriously until the prize " poem " was published , After we had read that sample of literary jazz , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begetter had been the so-called comic supplements of the Sunday papers , we saw the joke . Now we , are wondering how many lovers of poetry will " bite " this time . Also what kind of a freak will wear the ribbon . The distin  --  guished judges might fool us by awarding the prize to a real poem , if any such are submitted . Washington , D. C. , November 28 P. R. B.Against Birth Control TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Most of the birth controllers may be men and women who really want to develop a better human race and who think that birth control is the way to accomplish that result . But they have chosen the wrong method . Birth control is unnatural and morally degenerating . The race can not be improved by degenerating the improvers . It is quite impossible that highly developed spiritual qualities should exist in a person who is a slave to desire . Continence , except for reproduction only , is necessary to higher unfoIdinent , When there are good reasons why children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not birth control Milwaukee , Wisconsin , November 18 JOHN M. WORK To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In your issue of November 2 you stated : " Those who oppose birth control on religious or other grounds have the un  --  questioned right to refuse to practice it and to preach against it , but they have not the right to attempt to incorporate their beliefs and prejudices in the law of the land and to impose them on others . " If you mean to imply that the law of the land should make no attempt to uphold any standard of sexual mor  --  ality by subjecting violations of it to penalty , your position is of course entirely logical . If , however , you uphold on moral grounds laws against obscene literature , houses of prostitution , adultery , and similar statutes , it is somewhat difficult to see why those opposed to the practice of prevention of conception on moral grounds have no right to incorporate their beliefs in the law of the land , Cleveland , Ohio , November 5 L. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE NATION : SIR : It gave me grim amusement to read in a newspaper , a few days ago , that story about Admiral Beatty 's cap . The admiral does not wear it cocked to one side just to appear swag  --  ger , they tell us , but because he has a peculiar lump on one side of his head  --  an old lump so painful still that he can not bear on it the weight of a cap . An excellent reason : no man should torture himself . But , I thought , what would ' happen to the enlisted man , the " gob " of the British or American navy , who wanted to wear his cap on one side for a similar reason ? I can hear the sweet tones of a petty officer : " Hey , you - Pull yer hat down straight ! W'ere dya think y'are ; home ? " Nevertheless , in review we looked like " a fine body of men , Admiral , a fine body of men ! " Bloomfield , N. J. , November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE NATION : SIR : A serious Chinese danger has arisen at this Washing  --  ton Conference . It is the proposal to transfer to American soil the foreign post offices about to be banished from China , plus a separate Chinese one . It is planned to give to these foreign post offices all the rights and privileges now enjoyed by them in China including , of course , the free and unhampered trans  --  mission of whiskey and opium . Now against this proposal , popular as it may be with some , we wish to protest . We believe that there is such a growing improvement in our ser  --  vice as to make untrue the allegations of foreigners here that mails are so inefficient and unreliable as to- make necessary foreign intervention arranged as in China . In proof of this improvement let us cite the fact that one of us mailed his weekly letter to The Nation in the train mail - box at the Union Station here on Sunday night and that it - arrived safely in New York on Tuesday afternoon At four o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may - trust the post-office stamp - upon it . Again , a manuscript mailed by you in New York to us has safely arrived here after being only thirteen days on the road  --  during which period it , too , seems to have - visited only one other city , Richmond , Virginia . Does not this denote , progress ? Moreover , the Baltimore Sun this week printed a triumphant news story to - the effect that it now takes only twenty-four hours for a letter to go the forty miles from Washington to Baltimore . As we write , a friend from Boston tells us that his father receives letters at his office which take only twenty-four hours to reach him from his home eleven miles out in the suburbs . Now we submit that on this showing any talk of the necessity of foreign , and particularly a Chinese post office , on our soil is absurd . No second-hand foreign post office for us . OSWALD GARRISON VILLARD , NATHANIEL FIEFFER , Washington Correspondents of The Nation Washington , D. C. , December 1 Beauty and the Artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the able reviewer of - Mr . Sherwood Anderson 's " The Triumph of the Egg , " in The Nation for November 23 , take a little for granted ? His account of Ma .. Anderson 's tern  --  iperamental and artistic ? background seems to rest upon - the fol  --  lowing statements or implications : that beauty and certain other desirable things are not to be found in our , common life ; that accordingly only commonplace ? people who exist at low levels of : s-nsibility can find happiness in this life , or even endure it with equanimity ; that souls of a certain fineness , on the contrary , Are necessarily depressed and disillusioned by - the fatal lack of ' beauty , and  --  if very fine  --  apparently are driven toward suicide or madness . Are these facts , or the reviewer 's assumptions ? To my way of thinking , your reviewer has given superfluous support to an artistic and philosophic claim of which we - have already heard far too much . I mean the grandiloquent and cheeky claim of " pessimism " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being the last proof of a fine soul 's exquisiteness that it can find beauty in the life about it , I should have sup  --  posed that the discovery of beauty was the first service of an artist . Lest I there touch upon matters of which I know nothing , I will merely affirm , in , contradiction of the reviewer , that I have in my acquaintance a number of sensitive and fine  --  souled people who do , in fact , find in the common life about them , and disclose in the conduct of their own human relation  --  ships , abundant beauty ; and who can and do take delight in such beauty , with an enjoyment , I boldly aver , not a whit less aesthetic or sophisticated than the despondency of Mr. Anderson . What is to be done with these people ? Your reviewer says : " There are levels of insensibility that are literally unimaginable to Mr. Anderson and his - kind . " That is true , indeed ; yet how reassuring it would be to see the two-halved truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibility that are literally unimaginable to  --  artists of such  --  and-such a temperament . For that also , I take it , is true , and as things go nowadays even more important . New York , November 22 HENRY SYDNOR HARRISON Alright to the Point To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I received a copy of your paper and would state that it is alright for people who are accustomed to thinking forwards . Your paper is an honor to your country . Toronto , November 29 L. KNIGHTBooks Casanova Passes I T is , curiously , true of - each - separate age that it creates an individual wholly characteristic of his time ; and no epoch was more faithfully ? served than the eighteenth century in Casanova . He - was , - in every aspect , the eighteenth - century  --  in his rascality , at once magnificent and trivial ; his shallow , pre  --  tentious - learning ; his gabbling - metaphysics shrewdly turned to practical use ; and , notably , in the sterile ardor of his passion . His memoirs , only now , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long while have been the European founda  --  tion of all reflections and studies in the wide range of years he commanded . The temper of imaginative English letters , however , has been persistently indifferent to that period : Mr. Compton ' Mackenzie surveyed the English scene at Bath ; Mr. Cabell has gazed on it both in England and France ; and Mrs. Wharton , in " The Valley of Decision , " indicated a great deal  --  drawn largely from Casanova . But an indication is not a record , a hint is.but at best an admission of subservience ; and that is helpless in the face , the patched and painted face , of an age of perverse frank  --  ness . The reason is clear : It is impossible within the sobriety , the stupidity , really , of English taste to manage any transcription of the spirit of the seventeen hundreds . Europe , and particularly Arthur Schnitz  --  ler , is under no such heavy responsibility to the ubiquitous and perennially young person ; consequently " Casanova 's Homecom  --  ing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its publisher , has a certain unique value . To ' anyone at all familiar with the ' implications of the - word cicisboo , who knows something of the Society of Arcadians , to whom the Gozzis and Cimarosa and Lancret are not wholly strange , Schnitzler 's novel of a great Italian adventurer in petto will be both significant and entertaining . It is an exceptionally happy subject for its author , since it offers him , at its zenith , a scene to the ? tattered ends of which in the , present he has been long addressed . Mantua , a country place , and , at the end , Venice , are the for  --  mal settings through which Casanova , over fifty , fading but not faded , passes ; but , appropriately , he ? is mostly seen in a garden , an Italian garden without flowers , a walled space with an emerald sod , cypress and cedars , and a stained marble fa  --  ade . There , in a net of intrigue , of gambling and a duel , he waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . The intrigue is successful , the duel an extravaganza finished with a thrust of lithe steel , and Casanova posts rapidly to the coast . The figures about him are as inevitable as their surroundings : the complacent woman of the inn ; the bucolic friend with his sly wife ; the fat abbate ; the spiteful marchese and the dragoon , young and handsome , in his house ; and , specially , the lovely blue-stocking , Marcolina , educated by a professor of mathe  --  matics , and scornful in her - learned support of the sage of Ferney . The table for gambling is set , in the cool of evening , on the lawn , illuminated by the light falling from a door ; the gold slips and glitters=it was Casanova who asserted that gambling debts should not be paid in ringing coin  --  and the Chevalier , an appropriated title , follows in his thoughts the seductive body of Marcolina . Casanova discourses on a Gracious Supreme Council , the Cabala , his forthcoming polemic against atheists , his adventures of heart and wit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanguine and weary ; two states of mind reflected by the two suits , one a show of em  --  broidered gray satin , Spanish lace , and cherry silk , and the other shabby and travel-worn , to which he is reduced .
