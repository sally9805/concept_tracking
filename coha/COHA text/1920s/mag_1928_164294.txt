Bearing a letter whose preciousness she was too young to comprehend fully , a young Italian lyric soprano reached last week the rocky island of Manhattan , having left for at least one year the no less rocky peninsula of San Francisco , at the other edge of the continent . <P> Her letter : " A week ago tonight I heard you all sing and I had an experience which I never had before , for the young women and the young men who took the first and second prizes were the very ones that I had marked . Can it be that I am developing into a musical critic ? <P> " Please accept my congratulations . In many ways I should prefer that you take second prize rather than first , had you been my daughter . <P> " The whole program was most interesting and creditable . May I present my best wishes for your progress during the year of training which you have deservedly won ? " <P> The recipient of that letter was Emilia Da Prato , 20 , daughter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and $2,000 in cash prize offered for good radio voices by the Atwater Kent ( radio ) Foundation of Philadelphia . <P> The writer of the letter was Grace Goodhue Coolidge , first lady .
