No swimmer was ever more photographed than Mrs. Lotty Moore Schoemmel , fat water-woman . Last week her sister , Mrs. Grace Moore Shaw , told why : <P> " She was brought from obscurity by clever publicity . . . . She thought more of a story or a picture than making a swim . I had to spend money on her to make her think she was being pursued by reporters , found it next to impossible to get my publicity-crazed sister into the water to train unless it was to the accompaniment of the click of camera shutters . She was so spoiled . ... I spent money for private photographers . This was necessary as we were so far from Los Angeles that newspapermen came out rarely . ... I want her to pay the $800 I spent on her . . . . "
