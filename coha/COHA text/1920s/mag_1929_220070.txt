If you are a Dutchman from Utrecht , and you read something in the Utrechtsch Provinciaal en Stedelijk Dagblad , you know it must be true . Last week this leading provincial newspaper of the Netherlands shocked the rich burghers of quaint old Utrecht-and shocked Europe-by chargin , that a most nefarious secret military agreement was entered into on July 7 , 1927 , by France and Belgium ( with Great Britain sitting in ) and is still in force . <P> Disquieting to all Europeans was Dagblad 's assertion that Belgium stands committed to mobilize a minimum of 600,000 men , and France a minimum of 1,200,000 for immediate joint action to repel aggression against either state by Germany , Italy or Spain . Such an agreement-declared by Dagblad to run for 25 years-might indeed stir profound uneasiness . But worse still , according to Dagblad , the General Staffs of France and Belgium plan to seize the offensive , in any future war with Germany , by advancing their troops across the Dutch province of Limburg . Thus Limburg would be " violated , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken last week , than it was declared by Foreign Office statesmen in Brussels and Paris to have been " entirely falsified . " This , however , did not satisfy Queen Wilhelmina 's large , stiff-necked , smugly garbed Foreign Minister , Jonkheer Beelaerts Van Bloklund ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) , long since nicknamed by correspondents " Blunt Beelaerts . " From London , where he chanced to be last week , the Jonkheer instructed Her Majesty 's diplomatic representatives in France and Belgium to demand official confirmation or denial of Dagblad 's charges . Rarely has a news " scare story " been taken so seriously by a phlegmatic minister of the Dutch Crown . <P> Presently the Foreign Minister of King Albert of the Belgians-M . Paul Hymans - declared in the Belgian Chamber of Deputies with empressement : <P> " The alleged military agreement is a lie and an audacious falsehood ! It was the work of a criminal ! " A similar disclaimer was soon issued by French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand . None the less the responsible Dutch press of Rotterdam , Amsterdam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken by Amsterdam 's potent Socialist daily Volk . After graphically prophesying the " Violation of Limburg " by English troops , its editor sarcastically observed : " And this is the same England which in 1914 declared war because of the violation of Belgium 's neutrality ! "
