Whether because he wished to make sure that his friends among the contractors should continue to receive school-building contracts , or because he wished to provide the imbecile proportion of Chicago 's population with a practical demonstration of his patriotic campaign cries , Mayor William Hale Thompson of Chicago last April arranged to have his school board oust William McAndrew , Superintendent of Schools , from office-after the Superintendent 's term had expired . The charge was insubordination ; the evidence in the form of certain history books in use at the public schools and alleged to contain " pro-British " propaganda . With William McAndrew out of office it became the business of the new Superintendent , William J. Bogan , to substitute other history books for the " pro-British " ones . This maneuvre was last week effected . <P> At a meeting of the School Board , J. Lewis Coath , its former president and the arch-enemy of William McAndrew , unexpectedly argued against the new textbooks . Soon voted down , he later confessed that his resistance had been due to a desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools were ruled : Modern History , by Hayes and Moon ; Founders of Freedom in America , by Corson and Cornish ; History of the American People , by Mc-Laughlin ; Story of Our Country , by West &; West ; School History of the United States , by Hart ; and An American History , by Muzzey . One other chronicle which had been criticized as an influence against childish patriotism was Gordy 's History of the United States ; from this was deleted a picture called " The Resplendent Red Coats " ; to it was added a portrait of George Washington . New history books , not " pro-British " ones , were named and the loud Mayor 's most noteworthy service to Chicago 's education was complete . <P> John Jerome Gorman , onetime ( 1921-23 and 1925-27 ) Congressman , and chief investigator of history books , wrote a letter to Mayor Thompson about it . " It is a notable victory in the face of tremendous odds , " he said . " To you belongs the credit . It . may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this victory . . . but when the permanent imperishable record is written for all time , history will proclaim , your achievements . "
