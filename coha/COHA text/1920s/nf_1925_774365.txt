txt  | " And a state may penalize utterances which openly advocate the overthrow of the representative and constitutional form of government of the United States and the several states , by violence or other unlawful means . " " By enacting the present statute the state has determined , through its legislative body , that utterances advocating the overthrow of organized government by force , violence and unlawful means , are so inimical to the general welfare and involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be penalized in the exercise of its police power . That determination must be given great weight . Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of the statute ... . Here the Court quotes from People v. Lloyd , 304 Ill. 23:1 " ... when the legislative body has determined generally , in the constitutional exercise of its discretion , that utterances of a certain kind involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be punished , the question whether any specific utterance coming within the prohibited class is likely , in and of itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to consideration . It is sufficient that the statute itself be constitutional and that the use of the language comes within its prohibition . " It is clear that the question in such cases is entirely different from that involved in those cases where the statute merely prohibits certain acts involving the danger of substantive evil , without any reference to language itself , and it is sought to apply its provisions to language used by the defendant for the purpose of bringing about the prohibited results . There , if it be contended that the statute can not be applied to the language used by the defendant because of its protection by the freedom of speech or press , it must necessarily be found , as an original question , without any previous determination by the legislative body , whether the specific language used involved such likelihood of bringing about the substantive evil as to deprive it of the constitutional protection . " It is evident that the decision sustaining the New York statute furnishes no warrant for the appellee 's contention that under a law general in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect of the intent of the actor , the standard of guilt may be made the " dangerous tendency " of his words . . . . I. The appellant had a constitutional right to address meetings and organize parties unless in so doing he violated some prohibition of a valid statute . The only prohibition he is said to have violated is that of ? 56 forbidding incitement or attempted incitement to insurrection by violence . If the evidence fails to show that he did so incite , then , as  | applied to him , the statute unreasonably limits freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and violates the Fourteenth Amendment . We are of opinion that the requisite proof is lacking ... . ... The only objectives appellant is proved to have urged are those having to do with unemployment and emergency relief which are void of criminality . His membership in the Communist party and his solicitation of a few members wholly fails to establish an attempt to incite others to insurrection . Indeed , so far as appears , he had but a single copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that copy he retained . The same may be said with respect to the other books and pamphlets , some of them of more innocent purport . In these circumstances , to make membership in the party and solicitation of members for that party a criminal offense , punishable by death , in the discretion of a jury , is an unwarranted invasion of the right of freedom of speech . 2 . The statute , as construed and applied in the appellant 's trial , does not furnish a sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt . The act does not prohibit incitement to violent interference with any given activity or operation of the state . By force of it , as construed , the judge and jury trying an alleged offender can not appraise the circumstances and character of the defendant 's utterances or activities as begetting a clear and present danger of forcible obstruction of a particular state function . Nor is any specified conduct or utterance of the accused made an offense ... . The statute , as construed and applied , amounts merely to a dragnet which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jury can be persuaded that he ought to have foreseen his words would have some effect in the future conduct of others . No reasonably ascertainable standard of guilt is prescribed . So vague and indeterminate are the boundaries thus set to the freedom of speech and assembly that the law necessarily violates the guarantees of liberty embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment . The judgment is reversed . . . . Justices Van Devanter , McReynolds , Sutherland , and Butler dissented .. The comment on Near v. Minnesota ( p. 85 ) makes it clear that beginning about 1925 the Supreme Court began to expand the meaning of the term " liberty " in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to  | include some of the rights , i.e. freedom of speech and press , guaranteed by the federal Bill of Rights . On the other hand , as far back as 1884 in Hurtado v. California , 110 U. S. 516 , the Court held that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require a grand jury indictment in a state court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the Court in case after case has been classifying the provisions of the Bill of Rights into those which are essential to due process of law and which thus bind the states through the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment , and those which are not essential to due process and which the states may therefore ignore . The opinion in the present case is important since it gives an official summary of this classification as far as it has gone . It also states clearly the principles upon which the classification rests . In another situation , and for a very different purpose , the Court felt called upon to classify the provisions of the federal Bill of Rights . In fixing the constitutional status of territories after the war with Spain , the Court held that in governing " unincorporated " territories , such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines , Congress was restricted only by those guarantees in the Bill of Rights which are basic and fundamental , and not by those which are merely " procedural " or " remedial , " such as the guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Porto Rico ( p. 348 ) . This classification is essentially the same as that in Palko v. Connecticut . Mr. Justice Cardozo delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : .. Appellant was indicted . . . for the crime of murder in the first degree . A jury found him guilty of murder in the second degree , and he was sentenced to confinement in the state prison for life . Thereafter the state of Connecticut , with the permission of the judge presiding at the trial , gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Errors . This it did pursuant to an act adopted in 1886 which is printed in the margin . . . . " Sec. 6494 . Appeals by the state in criminal cases . Appeals from the rulings and decisions of the superior court or of any criminal court of common pleas , upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases , may be taken by the state , with the permission of the presiding judge , to the Supreme Court of Errors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if made by the accused . " Upon such appeal , the Supreme Court of Errors reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial . . . . It found that there had been error of law to the prejudice of the state . . . . ... The defendant was brought to trial again . Before a jury was impaneled and also at later stages of the case he made the objection that the effect of the new trial was to place him twice in jeopardy for the same offense , and in so doing to violate the Fourteenth Amend- ment of the Constitution of the United States . Upon the overruling of the objection the trial proceeded . The jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree , and the court sentenced the defendant to the punishment of death . . . . The case is here upon appeal . 1 . The execution of the sentence will not deprive appellant of his life without the process of law assured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution . The argument for appellant is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fourteenth also . The Fifth Amendment , which is not directed to the states , but solely to the federal government , creates immunity from double jeopardy . No person shall be " subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . " The Fourteenth Amendment ordains , " nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . " To retry a defendant , though under one indictment and only one , subjects him , it is said , to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment , if the prosecution is one on behalf of the United States . From this the consequence is said to follow that there is a denial of life or liberty without due process of law , if the prosecution is one on behalf of the people of a state ... . We have said that in appellant 's view the Fourteenth Amendment is to be taken as embodying the prohibitions of the Fifth . His thesis is even broader . Whatever would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 to 8 ) if done by the federal government is now equally unlawful by force of the Fourteenth Amendment if done by a state . There is no such general rule . The Fifth Amendment provides , among other things , that no person shall be held to answer for-a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury . This Court has held that , in prosecutions by a state , presentment or indictment by a grand jury may give way to informations at the instance of a public officer . Hurtado v. California , 110 U.S. 516 . . . . The Fifth Amendment provides also that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . This Court has said that , in prosecutions by a state , the exemption will fail if the state elects to end it . Twining v. New Jersey , 211 U.S. 78 . . . . The Sixth Amendment calls for a jury trial in criminal cases and the Seventh for a jury trial in civil cases at common law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Court has ruled that consistently with those amendments trial by jury may be modified by a state or abolished altogether . Walker v. Sauvinet , 92 U. S. 9o ; Maxwell v. Dow , 176 U. S. 581 . . . . As to the Fourth Amendment , one should refer to Weeks v. United States , 232 U. S. 383 , 398 ,  | and as to other provisions of the Sixth , to West v. Louisiana , 194 U. S. 258 . On the other hand , the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may make it unlawful for a state to abridge by its statutes the freedom of speech which the First Amendment safeguards against encroachment by the Congress ( De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353 ; Herndon v. Lowry , 301 U.S. 242 ) or the like freedom of the press ( Grosjean v. American Press Co. 297 U.S. 233 ; Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ) , or the free exercise of religion ( Hamilton v. University of California , 293 U.S. 245 ; . . . Pierce V. Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of peaceable assembly , without which speech would be unduly trammeled ( De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353 ; Herndon v. Lowry , 301 U.S. 242 ) , or the right of one accused of crime to the benefit of counsel ( Powell v. Alabama , 287 U.S. 45 ) . In these and other situations immunities that are valid as against the federal government by force of the specific pledges of particular amendments have been found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty , and thus , through the Fourteenth Amendment , become valid as against the states . The line of division may seem to be wavering and broken if there is a hasty catalogue of the cases on the one side and the other . Reflection and analysis will induce a different view . There emerges the perception of a rationalizing principle which gives to discrete instances a proper order and coherence . The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance . Even so , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty . To abolish them is not to violate a " principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental . " . . . Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them . What is true of jury trials and indictments is true also , as the cases show , of the immunity from compulsory self-incrimination . . . . This too might be lost , and justice still be done . Indeed , today as in the past there are students of our penal system who look upon the immunity as a mischief rather than a benefit , and who would limit its scope or destroy it altogether . . . . The exclusion of these immunities and privileges from the privileges and immunities protected against the action of the states has not been arbitrary or casual . It has been dictated by a study and appreciation of the meaning , the essential implications , of liberty itself . We reach a different plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges and immunities that have been taken over from the earlier articles of the federal Bill of Rights and brought within the Fourteenth Amendment by a process of absorption . These in their ori- gin were effective against the federal government alone . If the Fourteenth Amendment has absorbed them , the process of absorption has had its source in the belief that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed . . . . This is true , for illustration , of freedom of thought and speech . Of that freedom one may say that it is the matrix , the indispensable condition , of nearly every other form of freedom . With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of that truth can be traced in our history , political and legal . So it has come about that the domain of liberty , withdrawn by the Fourteenth Amendment from encroachment by the states , has been enlarged by latter-day judgments to include liberty of the mind as well as liberty of action ... . Our survey of the cases serves , we think , to justify the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout its course , has been true for the most part to a unifying principle . On which side of the line the case made out by the appellant has appropriate location must be the next inquiry and the final one . Is that kind of double jeopardy to which the statute has subjected him a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it ? Does it violate those " fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions ? " . . . The answer surely must be " no . " What the answer would have to be if the state were permitted after a trial free from error to try the accused over again or to bring another case against him , we have no occasion to consider . We deal with the statute before us and no other . The state is not attempting to wear the accused out by a multitude of cases with accumulated trials . It asks no more than this , that the case against him shall go on until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial legal error . . . . This is not cruelty at all , nor even vexation in any immoderate degree . If the trial had been infected with error adverse to the accused , there might have been review at his instance , and as often as necessary to purge the vicious taint . A reciprocal privilege , subject at all times to the discretion of the presiding judge . . . , has now been granted to the state . There is here no seismic innovation . The edifice of justice stands , in its symmetry , to many , greater than before . 2 . The conviction of appellant is not in derogation of any privileges or immunities that belong to him as a citizen of the United States . . . . Maxwell v. Dow , supra , gives all the answer that is necessary . The judgment is affirmed . Mr. Justice Butler dissents.  | While the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require a state to accord a man a grand jury indictment or even a jury trial , it does require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court has never listed in one place all of the elements indispensable to such a fair trial . Separate cases , however , indicate what some of these elements are . In Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 ( 1932 ) , the first " Scottsboro case , " seven negroes convicted of rape and sentenced to death were held to be deprived of life and liberty without due process of law by being denied adequate assistance of counsel before and during trial . Such assistance is vital to a fair trial . The requirement was not met by the vague and ineffective suggestion of the trial judge that he " appointed all the members of the bar to represent them , " an arrangement which fell far short of insuring adequate legal defense . In Moore v. Dempsey , 261 U. S. 86 ( 1923 ) , five negroes were convicted in an Arkansas court of the murder of a white man and sentenced to death . The Court described the trial in these words : " The court and the neighborhood were thronged with an adverse crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the . desired result . The counsel did not venture to demand delay or a change of venue , to challenge a juryman , or to ask for separate trials . He had had no preliminary consultation with the accused , called no witnesses for the defense , although they could have been produced , and did not put the defendants on the stand . The trial lasted about three quarters of an hour , and in less than five minutes the jury brought in a verdict of murder in the first degree . According to the allegations and affidavits there never was a chance for the petitioners to be acquitted ; no juryman could have voted for an acquittal and continued to live in Phillips County , and if any prisoner , by any chance , had been acquitted by a jury , he could not have escaped the mob . " Under these conditions no trial in the true sense was possible and the defendants were denied due process of law . The Chambers case is not the first so-called " third degree " case in the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1936 ) , three negroes were convicted of murder and sentenced to death solely upon the basis of confessions extorted from them by brutality and physical torture of the most revolting sort . The Court held that the use of evidence so obtained was a denial of due process of law . In the present case it was not clearly settled whether the prisoners had been subjected to physical torture . It was admitted , however , that they were questioned , one by one , with no opportunity between grillings to obtain rest or sleep , for five days and nights . It was made clear to them by the sheriff and his aides that the questioning would cease only when they made " adequate " confessions . Did  | the use of the confessions thus secured deprive them of life or liberty without due process of law ? Mr. Justice Black delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : The grave question presented ... is whether proceedings in which confessions were utilized , and which culminated in sentences of death upon four young negro men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguard of that due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment ... . After one week 's constant denial of all guilt , petitioners " broke . " Just before sunrise , the state officials got something " worthwhile " from petitioners which the state 's attorney would " want " ; again he was called ; he came ; in the presence of those who had carried on and witnessed the all night questioning , he caused his questions and petitioners ' answers to be stenographically reported . These are the confessions utilized by the state to obtain the judgments upon which petitioners were sentenced to death . . . . When Chambers was tried , his conviction rested upon his confession and testimony of the other three confessors . The convict guard and the sheriff " were in the court room sitting down in a seat . " And from arrest until sentenced to death , petitioners were never ? either in jail or in court ? wholly removed from the constant observation , influence , custody and control of those whose persistent pressure brought about the sunrise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment have been fruitful sources of controversy in our constitutional history . However , in view of its historical setting and the wrongs which called it into being , the due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment ? just as that in the Fifth ? has led few to doubt that it was intended to guarantee procedural standards adequate and appropriate , then and thereafter , to protect , at all times , people charged with or suspected of crime by those holding positions of power and authority ... . The determination to preserve an accused 's right to procedural due process sprang in large part from knowledge of the historical truth that the rights and liberties of people accused of crime could not be safely entrusted to secret inquisitorial processes . The testimony of centuries , in governments of varying kinds over populations of different races and beliefs , stood as proof that physical and mental torture and coercion had brought about the tragically unjust sacrifices of some who were the noblest and most useful of their generations . The rack , the thumbscrew , the wheel , solitary confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of entrapment of the helpless or unpopular had left their wake of mutilated bodies and shattered minds  | along the way to the cross , the guillotine , the stake and the hangman 's noose . And they who have suffered most from secret and dictatorial proceedings have almost always been the poor , the ignorant , the numerically weak , the friendless , and the powerless . This requirement ? of conforming to fundamental standards of procedure in criminal trials ? was made operative against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . Where one of several accused had limped into the trial court as a result of admitted physical mistreatment inflicted to obtain confessions upon which a jury had returned a verdict of guilty of murder , this Court recently declared , Brown v. Mississippi 297 U. S. 278 , that " It would be difficult to conceive of methods more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to procure the confessions of these petitioners , and the use of the confessions thus obtained as the basis for conviction and sentence was a clear denial of due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict upon the issue of physical violence and mistreatment , but shows , without conflict , the dragnet methods of arrest on suspicion without warrant , and the protracted questioning and cross questioning of these ignorant young colored tenant farmers by state officers and other white citizens , in a fourth floor jail room , where as prisoners they were without friends , advisers or counselors , and under circumstances calculated to break the strongest nerves and the stoutest resistance . Just as our decision in Brown v. Mississippi was based upon the fact that the confessions were the result of compulsion , so in the present case , the admitted practices were such as to justify the statement that " The undisputed facts showed that compulsion was applied . " For five days petitioners were subjected to interrogations culminating in Saturday 's ( May loth ) all night examination . Over a period of five days they steadily refused to confess and disclaimed any guilt . The very circumstances surrounding their confinement and their questioning without any formal charges having been brought , were such as to fill petitioners with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community ; three were arrested in a one-room farm tenant house which was their home ; the haunting fear of mob violence was around them in an atmosphere charged with excitement and public indignation . From virtually the moment of their arrest until their eventual confessions , they never knew just when anyone would be called back to the fourth floor room , and there , surrounded by his accusers and others , interrogated by men who held their very lives ? so far as these ignorant petitioners could know ? in the balance . . . . To permit human lives to be forfeited upon confessions thus obtained would make of the constitutional requirement of due process of law a meaningless symbol .  | We are not impressed by the argument that law enforcement methods such as those under review are necessary to uphold our laws . The Constitution proscribes such lawless means irrespective of the end . And this argument flouts the basic principle that all people must stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every American court . Today , as in ages past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of some governments to punish manufactured crime dictatorially is the handmaid of tyranny . Under our constitutional system , courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless , weak , outnumbered , or because they are non-conforming victims of prejudice and public excitement . Due process of law , preserved for all by our Constitution , commands that no such practice as that disclosed by this record shall send any accused to his death . No higher duty , no more solemn responsibility , rests upon this Court , than that of translating into living law and maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned and inscribed for the benefit of every human being subject to our Constitution ? of whatever race , creed or persuasion . The supreme court of Florida was in error and its judgment is reversed . 294 U. S. 587 ; 79 L. Ed. 1074 ; 55 Sup . Ct . 579. 1935 . While the Fourteenth Amendment does not mention any race or class , it is well known that the primary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to secure to the newly freed negro full protection and equality in the enjoyment of civil and political rights . By an interesting series of judicial decisions , however , the negro today finds the Fourteenth Amendment a very much less ample and effective guarantee of equality than the legislative leaders of the reconstruction period intended it to be . First , as we have already seen , the decision of the Supreme Court in the Slaughterhouse Cases ( p. 40 ) robbed of all real meaning and utility the clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbidding the states to " make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States " ? a clause which more broadly construed might have proved the main bulwark of negro civil liberty . Secondly , by its decision in the Civil Rights Cases , 109 U. S. 3 ( 1883 ) , holding void the Civil Rights Act of 1875 , the Court made it clear that Congress in enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment could not penalize race discrimination directed against the negro by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietors of public con- veyances , hotels , restaurants , and places of amusement to refuse accommodations to any person on account of his race , color , or previous condition of servitude . The amendment forbids only undue racial discrimination when practised by the state itself . The doctrine that the Constitution does not protect the negro against discrimination practised by private individuals was sharply emphasized in the case of Corrigan v. Buckley , 271 U. S. 323 ( 1926 ) . Certain privately owned lands in the District of Columbia were sold with restrictive covenants in the deeds forbidding the sale or lease of the property to negroes . This agreement between buyer and seller forever to discriminate against negroes in the disposition of the property was held by the Supreme Court not to violate any rights which the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment might give the negro , since the action complained of was purely private and not in any sense governmental . We may assume that the same result would have been reached under the Fourteenth Amendment had the case arisen in a state instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case with that of Porter v. Barrett , 233 Michigan 373 ( 1925 ) , decided by the supreme court of Michigan . Here a covenant running with the land forbidding the sale of the property to " a colored person " was held void . In reaching its conclusion the Michigan court very properly cast aside the argument that the covenant violated the Fourteenth Amendment , but held that it imposed an undue restraint upon the alienation of the land , or the right of free transfer . There is a certain irony in the fact that the protection accorded the negroes against these restrictive covenants came to them as the result of a rule of real property law dating back to the reign of Edward I ( Statute of Quia Emptores , 18 Edw . I , 235 , 1290 ) rather than from the Fourteenth Amendment which was intended by its framers to be the palladium of negro liberty . A rather amusing result was reached in the Virginia case of Peoples Pleasure Park Co. v. Rohleder , ro9 Virginia 439 ( 1908 ) , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes was held not to prevent the sale of the property to a corporation composed exclusively of negroes . In Virginia a corporation does not have color but is an entity entirely distinct from the natural persons composing it . On the other hand the Fourteenth Amendment has protected the negro against discrimination in the matter of civil and legal rights . As far back as 188o the Court held that a negro was entitled to be tried by a jury from which negroes have not been excluded because of their race , Strauder v. West Virginia , too U. S. 303 . At the same time it was decided that the negro is not entitled to have any negroes on the jury . See Virginia v. Rives , 100 U. S. 313 ( 188o ) . The southern commonwealths adjusted themselves to these two judicial rules by the simple process of avoiding any open discrimination against negroes in the calling of grand or petit juries ; and yet no names of negroes found their way on to the jury lists and none were ever called for jury service . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case " was brought to the Supreme Court . In the case of Norris v. Alabama printed below ( the second " Scottsboro case " ) , the  | Court examined with care the procedure by which the juries which had indicted and tried the negroes had been chosen , found that negroes had been excluded from them because of their race , and held that their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had again been violated . A similar decision was reached later in Hollins v. Oklahoma , 295 U. S. 394 ( 1935 ) , in an almost identical case of a negro convicted in the state of Oklahoma . Whether the southern states will be able to devise some method of avoiding compliance with this judicial mandate that negroes be called for jury service on equal terms with whites remains to be seen . Escape from the requirement does not seem easy . Mr. Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : Petitioner , Clarence Norris is one of nine negro boys who were indicted in March , 1931 , in Jackson County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being brought to trial in that county eight were convicted . This Court reversed the judgments of conviction upon the ground that the defendants had been denied due process of law in that the trial court had failed in the light of the circumstances disclosed , and of the inability of the defendants at that time to obtain counsel , to make an effective appointment of counsel to aid them in preparing and presenting their defense . Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 . After the remand , a motion for change of venue was granted and the cases were transferred to Morgan County . Norris was brought to trial in November , 1933 . At the outset , a motion was made on his behalf to quash the indictment upon the ground of the exclusion of negroes from juries in Jackson County where the indictment was found . A motion was also made to quash the trial venire in Morgan County upon the ground of the exclusion of negroes from juries in that county . In relation to each county , the charge was of long continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on juries , solely because of their race and color , in violation of the Constitution of the United States . . . . The trial . . . proceeded and resulted in the conviction of Norris who was sentenced to death . On appeal , the supreme court of the state considered and decided the federal question which Norris had raised and affirmed the judgment . ... We granted a writ of certiorari . First . There is no controversy as to the constitutional principle involved . . . this Court thus stated the principle in Carter v. Texas , 177 U. S. 442 , 447 , in relation to exclusion from service on grand juries : " Whenever by any action of a state , whether through its legislature , through its courts , or through its executive or administrative officers , all persons of the African race are excluded , solely because of their  | race or color , from serving as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of the African race , the equal protection of the laws is denied to him , contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally applicable to a similar exclusion of negroes from service on petit juries . . . . And although the state statute defining the qualifications of jurors may be fair on its face , the constitutional provision affords protection against action of the state through its administrative officers in effecting the prohibited discrimination ... . The question is of the application of this established principle to the facts disclosed by the record . That the question is one of fact does not relieve us of the duty to determine whether in truth a federal right has been denied . When a federal right has been specially set up and claimed in a state court , it is our province to inquire not merely whether it was denied in express terms but also whether it was denied in substance and effect ... . Second . The evidence on the notion to quash the indictment . In 1930 , the total population of Jackson County , where the indictment was found , was 36,881 , of whom 2688 were negroes . The male population over twenty-one years of age numbered 8801 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurors were thus prescribed by the state statute . . . : " The jury commission shall place on the jury roll and in the jury box the names of all male citizens of the county who are generally reputed to be honest and intelligent men , and are esteemed in the community for their integrity , good character and sound judgment , but no person must be selected who is under twenty-one or over sixty-five years of age , or who is an habitual drunkard , or who , being afflicted with a permanent disease or physical weakness is unfit to discharge the duties of a juror , or who can not read English , or who has ever been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude . If a person can not read English and has all the other qualifications prescribed herein and is a freeholder or householder , his name may be placed on the jury roll and in the jury box . " .. . Defendant adduced evidence to support the charge of unconstitutional discrimination in the actual administration of the statute in Jackson County . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that " in a long number of years no negro had been called for jury service in that county . " It appeared that no negro had served on any grand or petit jury in that county within the memory of witnesses who had lived there all their lives . Testimony to that effect was given by men whose ages ran from fifty to seventy-six years . Their testimony was uncontradicted . It was supported by the testimony of officials . The  | clerk of the jury commission and the clerk of the circuit court had never known of a negro serving on a grand jury in Jackson County . The court reporter , who had not missed a session in that county in twenty-four years , and two jury commissioners testified to the same effect . One of the latter , who was a member of the commission which made up the jury roll for the grand jury which found the indictment , testified that he had " never known of a single instance where any negro sat on any grand or petit jury in the entire history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prima facie case of the denial of the equal protection which the Constitution guarantees . . . . The case thus made was supplemented by direct testimony that specified negroes , thirty or more in number , were qualified for jury service . Among these were negroes who were members of school boards , or trustees , of colored schools , and property owners and householders . It also appeared that negroes from that county had been called for jury service in the federal court . Several of those who were thus described as qualified were witnesses . While there was testimony which cast doubt upon the qualifications of some of the negroes who had been named , and there was also general testimony by the editor of a local newspaper who gave his opinion as to the lack of " sound judgment " of the " good negroes " in Jackson County , we think that the definite testimony as to the actual qualifications of individual negroes , which was not met by any testimony equally direct , showed that there were negroes in Jackson County qualified for jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground that even if it were assumed that there was no name of a negro on the jury roll , it was not established that race or color caused the omission . The court pointed out that the statute fixed a high standard of qualifications for jurors . . and that the jury commission was vested with a wide discretion . The court adverted to the fact that more white citizens possessing age qualifications had been omitted from the jury roll than the entire negro population of the county , and regarded the testimony as being to the effect that " the matter of race , color , politics , religion or fraternal affiliations " had not been discussed by the commission and had not entered into their consideration , and that no one had been excluded because of race or color . . . . We are of the opinion that the evidence required a different result from that reached in the state court . We think that the evidence that for a generation or longer no negro had been called for service on any jury in Jackson County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that according to the practice of the jury commission their  | names would normally appear on the preliminary list of male citizens of the requisite age but that no names of negroes were placed on the jury roll , and the testimony with respect to the lack of appropriate consideration of the qualifications of negroes , established the discrimination which the Constitution forbids . The motion to quash the indictment upon that ground should have been granted . Third . The evidence on the motion to quash the trial venire . The population of Morgan County , where the trial was had , was larger than that of Jackson County , and the proportion of negroes was much greater . The total population of Morgan County in 1930 was 46,176 , and of this number 8311 were negroes . Within the memory of witnesses , long resident there , no negro had ever served on a jury in that county or had been called for such service . Some of these witnesses were over fifty years of age and had always lived in Morgan County . Their testimony was not contradicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resided in the county for thirty years , and who had been in office for over four years , testified that during his official term approximately 2500 persons had been called for jury service and that not one of them was a negro ; that he did not recall " ever seeing any single person of the colored race serve on any jury in Morgan County . " There was abundant evidence that there were a large number of negroes in the county who were qualified for jury service . Men of intelligence , some of whom were college graduates , testified to long lists ( said to contain nearly 200 names ) of such qualified negroes , including many business men , owners of real property and householders . When defendant 's counsel proposed to call many additional witnesses in order to adduce further proof of qualifications of negroes for jury service , the trial judge limited the testimony , holding that the evidence was cumulative . We find no warrant for a conclusion that the names of any of the negroes as to whom this testimony was given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury rolls . No such names were identified . The evidence that for many years no negro had been called for jury service itself tended to show the absence of the names of negroes from the jury rolls , and the state made no effort to prove their presence . . . . For this long-continued , unvarying , and wholesale exclusion of negroes from jury service we find no justification consistent with the constitutional mandate . ... That showing as to the long-continued exclusion of negroes from jury service , and as to the many negroes qualified for that service , could not be met by mere generalities . If , in the presence of such  | testimony as defendant adduced , the mere general assertions by officials of their performance of duty were to be accepted as an adequate justification for the complete exclusion of negroes from jury service , the constitutional provision ? adopted with special reference to their protection ? would be but a vain and illusory requirement ... . We are concerned only with the federal question which we have discussed , and in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion ... . 305 U. S. 337 ; 83 L. Ed. 208 ; 59 Sup . Ct . 232. 1938 . It is the settled policy of the southern states to segregate by compulsion the negroes and whites in the use of the facilities of common carriers , hotels , restaurants , parks , places of amusement , and the like . Whatever the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment would have thought of this segregation , the Supreme Court has long since sustained its validity . In Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. 537 ( 1896 ) , it held that a Louisiana statute requiring railroads to " provide equal but separate accommodations for the white and colored races " did not constitute a denial of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment . Such a law is a proper exercise of the state 's police power aimed at the maintenance of peace and order . The Court dismissed the contention that " the enforced separation of the two races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and observed : " If this be so , it is not by reason of anything found in the act , but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it . " In Berea College v. Kentucky , 211 U. S. 45 ( 1908 ) , it was similarly held that the state could validly forbid a college , even though a private institution , to teach whites and blacks at the same time and place . Even clearer is the validity of the southern laws requiring the education of white and black children in separate tax-supported schools . In Buchanan v. Warley , 245 U. S. 6o ( 1917 ) , however , the Court held void an ordinance of Louisville , Kentucky , establishing exclusive residential zones for whites and blacks . This was not on the ground of denial of equal protection of the laws , but on the ground of deprivation of property without due process of law resulting from the depression of property values in the restricted zones . Segregation of whites and blacks is valid , however , only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The question of just what the Fourteenth Amendment requires in the way of equality has proved a difficult one . In McCabe v. Atchison , T. &; S. F. Ry . Co. , 235 U. S. 151 ( 1914 ) , an Oklahoma law was held not to accord equal accommodations to negroes  | and whites when it allowed railroads to haul sleeping , dining , and chair cars for the exclusive use of one race without at the same time providing them on demand for the use of the other race . In earlier cases the Court was very lenient in construing what " equality " requires in the segregated school systems of the south . In Cumming v. County Board of Education , 175 U. S. 528 ( 1899 ) , the Court found no denial of the equal protection of the laws in the failure of a county to provide a high school for sixty colored children , although a high school was maintained for white children . It seemed to the Court an adequate answer that the county did not have money enough to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice , 275 U. S. 78 ( 1927 ) , the Court held that a Chinese girl could validly be required to attend a school for colored children in a neighboring district , rather than be allowed to attend the nearby school for white children . Rough or substantial equality was all that the Fourteenth Amendment appeared to require . The rigid rule of equality enforced in the present case confronts the southern states with difficult and far-reaching problems . Will they provide separate professional schools in law , medicine , etc. , for negro students , or will they admit negroes to the professional schools now provided for white students ? The Court seems to leave them no third choice . Mr. Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : Petitioner Lloyd Gaines , a negro , was refused admission to the School of Law of the state university of Missouri . Asserting that this refusal constituted a denial by the state of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution , petitioner brought this action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit him ... . Petitioner is a citizen of Missouri . In August , 1935 , he was graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts at the Lincoln University , an institution maintained by the state of Missouri for the higher education of negroes . That university has no law school . Upon the filing of his application for admission to the law school of the University of Missouri , the registrar advised him to communicate with the president of Lincoln University and the latter directed petitioner 's attention to ? 9622 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri ( 1929 ) , providing as follows : " Sec. 9622 . May arrange for attendance at university of any adjacent state ? Tuition fees. ? Pending the full development of the Lincoln University , the board of curators shall have the authority to arrange for the attendance of negro residents of the state of Missouri at the university of any adjacent state to take any course or to study any subjects provided for at the state university of Missouri , and which are  | not taught at the Lincoln University and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided that whenever the board of curators deem it advisable they shall have the power to open any necessary school or department . Laws 1921 , p. 86 , ? 7 . " Petitioner was advised to apply to the state superintendent of schools for aid under that statute . It was , admitted on the trial that petitioner 's " work and credits at the Lincoln University would qualify him for admission to the School of Law of the University of Missouri if he were found otherwise eligible . " He was refused admission upon the ground that it was " contrary to the constitution , laws and public policy of the state to admit a negro as a student in the University of Missouri . " It appears that there are schools of law in connection with the state universities of four adjacent states , Kansas , Nebraska , Iowa and Illinois , where non-resident negroes are admitted ... . ... We must regard the question whether the provision for the legal education in other states of negroes resident in Missouri is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns . The state court stresses the advantages that are afforded by the law schools of the adjacent states , Kansas , Nebraska , Iowa and Illinois , which admit non-resident negroes ... . We think that these matters are beside the point . The basic consideration is not as to what sort of opportunities other states provide , or whether they are as good as those in Missouri , but as to what opportunities Missouri itself furnishes to white students and denies to negroes solely upon the ground of color . The admissibility of laws separating the races in the enjoyment of privileges afforded by the state rests wholly upon the quality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups within the state . The question here is not of a duty of the state to supply legal training , or of the quality of the training which it does supply , but of its duty when it provides such training to furnish it to the residents of the state upon the basis of an equality of right . By the operation of the laws of Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is denied to negroes by reason of their race . The white resident is afforded legal education within the state ; the negro resident having the same qualifications is refused it there and must go outside the state to obtain it . That is a denial of the equality of legal right to the enjoyment of the privilege which the state has set up , and the provision for the payment of tuition fees in another state does not remove the discrimination . The equal protection of the laws is " a pledge of the protection of equal laws . " . . . Manifestly , the obligation of the state to give the  | protection of equal laws can be performed only where its laws operate , that is , within its own jurisdiction . It is there that the equality of legal right must be maintained . . . . We find it impossible to conclude that what otherwise would be an unconstitutional discrimination , with respect to the legal right to the enjoyment of opportunities within the state , can be justified by requiring resort to opportunities elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but can not serve to validate it . Nor can we regard the fact that there is but a limited demand in Missouri for the legal education of negroes as excusing the discrimination in favor of whites ... . Here , petitioner 's right was a personal one . It was as an individual that he was entitled to the equal protection of the laws , and the state was bound to furnish him within its borders facilities for legal education substantially equal to those which the state there afforded for persons of the white race , whether or not other negroes sought the same opportunity . It is urged , however , that the provision for tuition outside the state is a temporary one , ? that it is intended to operate merely pending the establishment of a law department for negroes at Lincoln University . While in that sense the discrimination may be termed temporary , it may nevertheless continue for an indefinite period by reason of the discretion given to the curators of Lincoln University and the alternative of arranging for tuition in other states , as permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so long as the curators find it unnecessary and impracticable to provide facilities for the legal instruction of negroes within the state . In that view , we can not regard the discrimination as excused by what is called its temporary character ... . ... We are of the opinion that . . . petitioner was entitled to be admitted to the law school of the state university in the absence of other and proper provision for his legal training within the state . . . . In a separate opinion Mr. Justice McReynolds observed : ... The problem presented obviously is a difficult and highly practical one . A fair effort to solve it has been made by offering adequate opportunity for study when sought in good faith . The state should not be unduly hampered through theorization inadequately restrained by experience ... .  | Munn v. Illinois , 94 U. S. 113 ( 1877 ) , was the first of a famous group of cases usually called the " Granger Cases . " They were decided during the seventies and eighties and involved the new and important problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate the rates and service of railroads and other businesses affected with a public interest . The close of the Civil War ushered in a period of rapid railroad expansion . In the east , where industrial development tended to keep pace with the multiplication of transportation facilities , railroad building proved satisfactorily profitable . In the west , however , where new country was being opened up and population was sparse , the railroads had difficulty in paying dividends and frequently yielded to the temptation to indulge in stock-watering , questionable manipulation of credits , doubtful practices in respect to grants of lands , rebating , discrimination , and other objectionable practices . As against the desperate efforts of the railroads to make profits there existed a desire upon the part of the western farmer to enjoy adequate railroad facilities at reasonable rates in order to facilitate the movement of crops in sparsely settled communities , together with fierce resentment against the unfair or dishonest methods of which some of the roads were known to be guilty . Out of this conflict of interests grew the Granger Movement , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure through state legislation the remedies which they felt the evils of the existing transportation system demanded . Granger legislation began in Illinois in 1871 with the enactment of a statute , authorized by the new state constitution of 187o , which created a railroad and warehouse commission with supervisory power over the roads , forbade discrimination under severe penalties , and established maximum passenger and freight rates . Other states followed the lead taken by Illinois ; and soon the railroads found themselves subjected to a wide variety of restrictive and more or less burdensome laws , some of them vitally affecting their earning capacity . In the Granger cases the validity of these laws was presented to the Supreme Court . Munn v. Illinois did not relate to railroad rate legislation but dealt rather with the question of the validity of an Illinois statute providing for the fixing of maximum charges for the storage of grain in warehouses in Chicago and other places having not less than one hundred thousand population , " in which grain is stored in bulk , and in which the grain of different owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a manner that the identity of different lots or parcels can not be accurately preserved . " The case was argued before the Supreme Court by eminent lawyers , and the decision was awaited with wide-spread interest not only by the granges but by all those who had money invested in businesses  | which the states were seeking to regulate . Here , as in the Slaughterhouse Cases , an attempt was made to convince the Court that the legislation in question was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment . It was urged that it involved a deprivation of property without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection of the law . But here again the attempt failed . The Court decided that terminal grain elevators were businesses affected with a public interest sufficiently to enable the legislature to regulate the charges which they made , and then went on to point out that the Fourteenth Amendment provided no restriction upon burdensome or confiscatory rates . In cases where the legislature could regulate rates at all the degree of regulation was a matter of legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people must resort to the polls , not to the courts . " This somewhat startling proposition was not strictly called for by the facts of the Munn case and was in the nature of obiter dictum , since the limits imposed upon grain elevator charges had not been attacked before the Court as being confiscatory in character , but rather the right of the legislature to establish any rate at all had been challenged . It would have been wholly out of keeping with the judicial development of the Fourteenth Amendment if the Court had not retreated from the position taken in this dictum in Munn v. Illinois . As in the case of the police power of the state the Court , step by step , came to look upon the due process clause as imposing a judicially enforceable check upon unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the power of public utility regulation . In the case of C. M. &; St. P. Ry . Co. v. Minnesota , 134 U.S. 418 ( 1890 ) , the Court held that a railroad rate established by a state railroad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unless a way was provided whereby the question of reasonableness might be judicially determined there was a denial of due process of law . This doctrine was reaffirmed and extended in the case of Reagan v. Farmers ' Loan and Trust Co. , 154 U.S. 362 ( 1894 ) . A still further advance in the direction of complete judicial review of rate regulation was made in the celebrated case of Smyth v. Ames , 169 U. S. 466 , decided in 1898 . The railroad rate under review in this case had been established directly by the legislature itself and not by a commission , and it was strongly defended as being not unreasonable . The Supreme Court , in invalidating the rate , laid down in this decision the important principle that due process of law requires not merely a judicial review of the reasonableness of rates , as had been established in the earlier cases , but requires also that the rate established shall be such as will allow the railroad a fair return on a fair valuation of its investment . Whether the return from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the Court did not in this case define what it meant concretely by " fair . " In 1909 the Court threw some light upon this last point by holding in the case of Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Company , 212 U.S. 19 , that a rate was not confiscatory which allowed a return on the capital investment of six per cent , though it later held that the precise rate of return would depend on the inherent risks of the busi- ness and other relevant factors . Thus in United Railways &; Electric Co. v. West , 28o U.S. 234 ( 1930 ) , the Court said that the fares charged by a street railway company ought , in view of its precarious future , to be high enough to bring in a return of as much as seven and a half or eight per cent in order not to be confiscatory . From Munn v. Illinois , and cases following it , arose the doctrine that the government could regulate prices or control terms of service only of businesses which are " affected with a public interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected with a public interest was to deprive it of its liberty and property without due process of law . This doctrine seemed fair on its face and comported with the tradition of American individualism . But what is a business " affected with a public interest " ? This question the Court found great difficulty in answering , and with the passage of time it became clear that there was no single characteristic which would invariably distinguish a business so affected with a public interest . In Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court , 262 U. S. 522 ( 1923 ) , in an opinion holding that a meat-packing establishment is not a business affected with a public interest , Chief Justice Taft went on to say that such businesses fall into three categories . These are as follows : " ( t ) Those which are carried on under the authority of a public grant of privileges which either expressly or impliedly imposes the affirmative duty of rendering a public service demanded by any member of the public . Such are the railroads , other common carriers and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional , the public interest attaching to which , recognized from earliest times , has survived the period of arbitrary laws by Parliament or colonial legislatures for regulating all trades and callings . Such are those of the keepers of inns , cabs , and gristmills. . . . ( 3 ) Businesses which though not public at their inception may be fairly said to have risen to be such and have become subject in consequence to some government regulation . They have come to hold such a peculiar relation to the public that this is superimposed upon them . In the language of the cases , the owner by devoting his business to the public use , in effect grants the public an interest in that use and subjects himself to public regulation to the extent of that interest although the property continues to belong to the private owner and to be entitled to protection accordingly . " In 1927 the Court held in Tyson &; Bro. v. Banton , 273 U. S. 418 , that the business of selling theatre tickets was not so affected with a public interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law . To permit such price regulation , said Mr. Justice Sutherland , the business must be such " as to justify the conclusion that it has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby , in effect , granted to the public . " The same rule was followed the following year in Ribnik v. McBride , 277 U. S. 350 ( 1928 ) , which held that the business of operating an employment agency was not affected with a public interest sufficiently to permit state control of its rates . A similar result was reached in Williams v. Standard Oil Co. , 278 U. S. 235 ( 1929 ) , with respect to the regulation of the price of gaso- lene . In 1932 the Court held in New State Ice Company v. Liebmann , 285 U. S. 262 , that the business of selling ice in a city was not affected with a public interest so as to permit the state to require that those engaging in the business secure a license or permit from the corporation commission of the state . The continued application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce criticism , some of the sharpest of which came from the members of the Court itself . In a powerful dissenting opinion in Ribnik v. McBride , supra , Mr. Justice Stone declared : " Price regulation is within the state 's power whenever any combination of circumstances seriously curtails the regulative force of competition so that buyers or sellers are placed at such a disadvantage in the bargaining struggle that a legislature might reasonably anticipate serious consequences to the community as a whole . " And in his dissenting opinion in New State Ice Co. v. Licbmann , supra , Mr. Justice Brandeis struck out boldly with the assertion : " The notion of a distinct category of business affected with a public interest ' employing property devoted to a public use ' rests upon historical error . In my opinion , the true principle is that the state 's power extends to every regulation of any business reasonably required and appropriate for the public protection . I find in the due process clause no other limitation upon the character or the scope of regulation permissible . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below abandons entirely the concept of a business affected with a public interest as the constitutional criterion of price control . The milk business is admitted to be not so affected with a public interest . Price control is merely a phase of the police power of the state subject only to the limitations of due process of law upon arbitrary interference with liberty and property . Mr. Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : The legislature of New York established , by Chapter 158 of the Laws of 1933 , a Milk Control Board with power , among other things , to " fix minimum and maximum . . . retail prices to be charged by ... stores to consumers for consumption off the premises where sold . " The board fixed nine cents as the price to be charged by a store for a quart of milk . Nebbia , the proprietor of a grocery store in Rochester , sold two quarts and a five cent loaf of bread for eighteen cents ; and was convicted for violating the board 's order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equal protection clause and the due process clause ... . The question for decision is whether the federal Constitution prohibits a state from so fixing the selling price of milk . We first inquire as to the occasion for the legislation and its history . During 1932 the prices received by farmers for milk were much be- low the cost of production . The decline in prices during 1931 and 1932 was much greater than that of prices generally . The situation of the families of dairy producers had become desperate and called for state aid similar to that afforded the unemployed , if conditions should not improve . On March To , 1932 , the senate and assembly resolved " That a joint legislative committee is hereby created . . . to investigate the causes of the decline of the price of milk to producers and the resultant effect of the low prices upon the dairy industry .... " In part those conclusions of the committee are : Milk is an essential item of diet . It can not long be stored . It is an excellent medium for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and handling for human consumption which greatly increase the cost of the business . Failure of producers to receive a reasonable return for their labor and investment over an extended period threaten a relaxation of vigilance against contamination . The production and distribution of milk is a paramount industry of the state , and largely affects the health and prosperity of its people . Dairying yields fully one half of the total income from all farm products . Dairy farm investment amounts to approximately $1,000,000,000 . Curtailment or destruction of the dairy industry would cause a serious economic loss to the people of the state . In addition to the general price decline , other causes for the low price of milk include : a periodic increase in the number of cows and in milk production ; the prevalence of unfair and destructive trade practices in the distribution of milk , leading to a demoralization of prices in the metropolitan area and other markets ; and the failure of transportation and distribution charges to be reduced in proportion to the reduction in retail prices for milk and cream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to itself which call for special methods of control . Under the best practicable adjustment of supply to demand the industry must carry a surplus of about 20 per cent , because milk , an essential food , must be available as demanded by consumers every day in the year , and demand and supply vary from day to day and according to the season ; but milk is perishable and can not be stored . Close adjustment of supply to demand is hindered by several factors difficult to control . Thus surplus milk presents a serious problem , as the prices which can be realized for it for other uses are much less than those obtainable for milk sold for consumption in fluid form or as cream . A satisfactory stabilization of prices for fluid milk requires that the burden of surplus milk be shared equally by all producers and all distributors in the milk-shed . So long  | as the surplus burden is unequally distributed the pressure to market surplus milk in fluid form will be a serious disturbing factor . The fact that the larger distributors find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller distributors do not , leads to pricecutting and other forms of destructive competition . Smaller distributors , who take no responsibility for the surplus , by purchasing their milk at the blended prices ( i. e. , an average between the price paid the producer for milk for sale as fluid milk , and the lower surplus milk price paid by the larger organizations ) can undersell the larger distributors . Indulgence in this price-cutting often compels the larger dealer to cut the price , to his own and the producer 's detriment . Various remedies were suggested , amongst them united action by producers , the fixing of minimum prices for milk and cream by state authority , and the imposition of certain graded taxes on milk dealers proportioned so as to equalize the cost of milk and cream to all dealers and so remove the cause of price-cutting . The legislature adopted Chapter 158 creating a Milk Control Board with power to fix prices as a method of correcting the evils , which the report of the committee showed could not be expected to right themselves through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owing to the peculiar and uncontrollable factors affecting the industry ... . First . The appellant urges that the order of the Milk Control Board denies him the equal protection of the laws . It is shown that the order requires him , if he purchases his supply from a dealer , to pay eight cents per quart and five cents per pint , and to resell at not less than nine and six , whereas the same dealer may buy his supply from a farmer at lower prices and deliver milk to consumers at ten cents the quart and six cents the pint . We think the contention that the discrimination deprives the appellant of equal protection is not well founded . For aught that appears , the appellant purchased his supply of milk from a farmer as do distributors , or could have procured it from a farmer if he so desired . There is therefore no showing that the order placed him at a disadvantage , or in fact affected him adversely , and this alone is fatal to the claim of denial of equal protection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy from a distributor , the difference in the retail price he is required to charge his customers , from that prescribed for sales by distributors , is not on its face arbitrary or unreasonable , for there are obvious distinctions between the two sorts of merchants which may well justify a difference of treatment , if the legislature possesses the power to control the prices to be charged for fluid milk . . . . Second . The more serious question is whether in the light of the  | conditions disclosed , the price-regulation denied the appellant the due process secured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment ... . Under our form of government the use of property and the making of contracts arc normally matters of private and not of public concern . The general rule is that both shall be free of governmental interference . But neither property rights nor contract rights are absolute ; for government can not exist if the citizen may at will use his property to the detriment of his fellows , or exercise his freedom of contract to work them harm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public to regulate it in the common interest ... . The milk industry in New York has been the subject of longstanding and drastic regulation in the public interest . The legislative investigation of 1932 was persuasive of the fact that for this and other reasons unrestricted competition aggravated existing evils , and the normal law of supply and demand was insufficient to correct maladjustments detrimental to the community . The inquiry disclosed destructive and demoralizing competitive conditions and unfair trade practices which resulted in retail price-cutting and reduced the income of the farmer below the cost of production . We do not understand the appellant to deny that in these circumstances the legislature might reasonably consider further regulation and control desirable for protection of the industry and the consuming public . That body believed conditions could be improved by preventing destructive price-cutting by stores which , due to the flood of surplus milk , were able to buy at much lower prices than the larger distributors and to sell without incurring the delivery costs of the latter . In the order of which complaint is made the Milk Control Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a distributor to a consumer , and nine cents by a store to a consumer , thus recognizing the lower costs of the store , and endeavoring to establish a differential which would be just to both . In the light of the facts the order appears not to be unreasonable or arbitrary , or without relation to the purpose to prevent ruthless competition from destroying the wholesale price structure on which the farmer depends for his livelihood , and the community for an assured supply of milk . But we are told that because the laws essays to control prices it denies due process . Notwithstanding the admitted power to correct existing economic ills by appropriate regulation of business , even though an indirect result may be a restriction of the freedom of contract or a modification of charges for services or the price of commodities , the appellant urges that direct fixation of prices is a type of regulation absolutely forbidden . His position is that the Fourteenth Amendment requires us to hold the challenged statute void for this reason alone . The argument  | runs that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unconstitutional , save as applied to businesses affected with a public interest ; that a business so affected is one in which property is devoted to an enterprise of a sort which the public itself might appropriately undertake , or one whose owner relies on a public grant or franchise for the right to conduct the business , or in which he is bound to serve all who apply ; in short , such as is commonly called a public utility ; or a business in its nature a monopoly . The milk industry , it is said , possesses none of these characteristics , and , therefore , not being affected with a public interest , its charges may not be controlled by the state . Upon the soundness of this contention the appellant 's case against the statute depends . We may as well say at once that the dairy industry is not , in the accepted sense of the phrase , a public utility . We think the appellant is also right in asserting that there is in this case no suggestion of any monopoly or monopolistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business are in no way dependent upon public grants or franchises for the privilege of conducting their activities . But if , as must be conceded , the industry is subject to regulation in the public interest , what constitutional principle bars the state from correcting existing maladjustments by legislation touching prices ? We think there is no such principle . The due process clause makes no mention of sales or of prices any more than it speaks of business or contracts or buildings or other incidents of property . The thought seems nevertheless to have persisted that there is something peculiarly sacrosanct about the price one may charge for what he makes or sells , and that , however able to regulate other elements of manufacture or trade , with incidental effect upon price , the state is incapable of directly controlling the price itself . This view was negatived many years ago . Munn v. Illinois , 94 U. S. 113 . ... Here follows an analysis of the Munn case in which it is pointed out that the Court therein regarded the term " affected with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise of the police power . " It is clear that there is no closed class or category of businesses affected with a public interest , and the function of courts in the application of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is to determine in each case whether circumstances vindicate the challenged regulation as a reasonable exertion of governmental authority or condemn it as arbitrary or discriminatory . . . . The phrase " affected with a public interest " can , in the nature of things , mean no more than that an industry , for adequate reason , is subject to control for the public good . In several of the decisions of this Court wherein the expressions " affected with a  | public interest , " and " clothed with a public use , " have been brought forward as the criteria of the validity of price control , it has been admitted that they are not susceptible of definition and form an unsatisfactory test of the constitutionality of legislation directed at business practices or prices . These decisions must rest , finally , upon the basis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws were found arbitrary in their operation and effect . But there can be no doubt that upon proper occasion and by appropriate measures the state may regulate a business in any of its aspects , including the prices to be charged for the products or commodities it sells . So far as the requirement of due process is concerned , and in the absence of other constitutional restriction , a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare , and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose . The courts are without authority either to declare such policy , or , when it is declared by the legislature , to override it ... . ... The Constitution does not secure to anyone liberty to conduct his business in such fashion as to inflict injury upon the public at large , or upon any substantial group of the people . Price control , like any other form of regulation , is unconstitutional only if arbitrary , discriminatory , or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty . Tested by these considerations we find no basis in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for condemning the provisions of the Agriculture and Markets Law here drawn into question ... . Mr. Justice McReynolds dissented in an opinion concurred in by Justices Van Devanter , Sutherland , and Butler . LOCHNER v. NEW YORK 198 U. S. 45 ; 49 L. Ed. 937 ; 25 Sup . Ct . 539. 1905 . It has been pointed out in the discussion of the Slaughterhouse Cases ( p. 40 ) that the primary purpose lying back of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was to guarantee to the newly freed negro certain fundamental civil rights . To this end the provisions were inserted , along with others , that no state shall " deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . " So far as the negro is concerned these clauses have been of somewhat limited importance ; but by an interesting and unforeseen development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause , have furnished the tests by which the courts judge the validity of practically all of the social and economic legislation enacted by the states in the exercise of their police power ; they have imposed upon the Supreme Court the most persistent and difficult questions which that tribunal has had to face , and their application to social and economic reforms has subjected the Court to more bitter criticism in recent times than has any other phase of its work . Due process of law was not a new concept in our constitutional law ; however , it was not until the period before the Civil War that the due process clauses of the state constitutions had come tentatively to be construed as limitations upon the substance or content of legislation ; and when , in the Slaughterhouse Cases , Mr. Justice Miller stated that the due process clause did not restrict the police power of the state , he was merely giving it a long-standing and orthodox interpretation . This construction of the due process clause , however , was not destined to persist . The close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution marked by the enormous expansion of the interstate market through increased railroad facilities , the development of large-scale production carried on by huge accumulations of capital , and the development of a fairly well-defined labor class . Social and economic conditions of a new and complex nature sprang up , and these the legislatures of the various states attempted to deal with by statutes passed in the exercise of their police power . Some of these related to the control of the railroads and the establishment of the charges made by public utilities , others to the relations between laborer and employer , the latter now collectively designated as " capital . " Naturally , organized industry looked upon these legislative efforts to ameliorate such things as factory conditions and hours of labor as intolerable interferences with the employer 's private affairs . During the development of the situation just described the courts had been continuously besieged to depart , chiefly on behalf of capital , from the narrow construction of due process of law set forth in the Slaughterhouse Cases and to apply that clause as a broad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case argued before the Supreme Court in 1885 , San Mateo County v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co. , 116 U. S. 138 , Mr. Roscoe Conkling , who had been a member of the Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction which had drafted the Fourteenth Amendment , produced in court the unpublished journal of the committee in support of his contention that the amendment had not been originally intended by its framers for the exclusive protection of the negro race . As a result of the subtle pressure of such influences as these , together with the changes in personnel in the Supreme Court itself , that tribunal ultimately came to assume the position which many had felt it ought originally to have taken , and stood openly for the doctrine that the Fourteenth Amendment does impose judicially enforceable restrictions upon social legislation passed by the states . But what constitutes deprivation of life , liberty , or property without due process of law in such a connection ? This question the Court wisely  | declared it would not attempt to settle by the enunciation of any general doctrine but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decision . It is not possible , therefore , to define due process of law authoritatively beyond saying that it operates to prevent the enactment by the states of such measures as may be arbitrary and unreasonable in character , with what constitutes the test of " arbitrary " and " unreasonable " depending largely upon the opinion of the tribunal applying it . Every exercise of police power necessarily imposes restraint in some measure upon individual liberty or the free use of individual property ; and if it is to be justified it must be upon the ground that it is necessary for the protection of the public health , morals , safety , good order , or general welfare . In other words , the due process test concretely means this : if the court believes that the infringement of individual rights involved in the statute is warranted by the pressing nature of the social need it is established to promote , then the law does not violate due process of law ; but if it is not so warranted , then the due process clause is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the practical settlement of these problems the personal equation looms large , for what may seem arbitrary to one person may not seem so to another ; and this accounts for the fact that the Supreme Court at certain times and in certain cases has construed the due process clause in a way which is extremely difficult to reconcile with its decisions in other cases and at other times . It was entirely natural that in its early application of these principles the courts should react to the problems which arose in the light of the background of their training and the legal and economic philosophy prevalent at the time that training was received . This philosophy was individualistic in character ; and regulations of labor and other social conditions based upon the assumption that the state ought to intervene at the expense of the individual for the benefit of a particular group or class in economic society were looked upon with horror by the courts . The state courts were more unsympathetic to social reform than was the Supreme Court of the United States , and held void many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states have appealed these cases to the Supreme Court of the United States they might have obtained there a more liberal interpretation of due process ; but at that time ( and up to the passing of the Judiciary Act of 1914 ) there was no way for such a case to come before the Supreme Court . Even now the case can not be appealed if the law is held to violate the due process clause of the state constitution . This early individualistic interpretation by the courts of due process of law found finally a definite basis in the development during the eighties of the doctrine of " liberty of contract . " The first case turning upon this doctrine was decided by the supreme court of Pennsylvania in 1886 , Godcharles v. Wigeman , 113 Pa . State 431 , but the theory has since been generally incorporated into the doctrine of due process of law as applied by both state and federal courts . The concept of " liberty of contract " was  | both plausible and alluring . It asserted in substance that when two parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came together to make a contract which was not contrary to public policy , the legislature had no right to interfere and dictate the terms of the agreement . Of course such liberty of contract was not absolute , but the weight of opinion was that only the strongest public necessity afforded justification for its violation . The application of this doctrine to the problem of protective labor legislation produced , however , some very startling results , due in large measure to the naive assumption by the courts that the individual employee of a great industrial corporation possessed full liberty of contract and could dicker with his employer upon equal terms . Naturally , as time went on the courts found frequently that this vaunted liberty of contract was infringed by the laws regulating hours of labor , method and time of wage payment , employer 's liability , factory conditions , and similar matters . As has been said , most of these decisions now regarded as more or less reactionary were rendered by the state courts . They had been invalidating state social legislation for nearly twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lochner v. New York is interesting for two reasons : first because it is the earliest and one of the most important cases in which the Supreme Court invalidated a state law under the liberty of contract phase of the due process clause , and secondly because it contains Mr. Justice Holmes ' vigorous dissenting opinion upholding the validity of such reform laws . Lochner was convicted of violating a New York statute called the Labor Law , which provided that no employee should be " required or permitted to work in a biscuit , bread or cake bakery or confectionery establishment more than sixty hours in any one week , or more than ten hours in any one day unless for the purpose of making a shorter day on the last day of the week . " The legislature had proceeded upon the assumption that the conditions in the baking industry were such as to demand the intervention of the state in behalf of the employees . That such protection was reasonably necessary the majority of the Supreme Court did not agree , and accordingly held that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employer . Four justices dissented on the ground that there was sufficient support for the view of the legislature to make it a debatable question whether the law was arbitrary or not , and that when such was the case the courts should not override the legislative judgment . The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes has become almost a classic as a statement of the more liberal judicial attitude toward the question of the validity of social and economic legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment . The decision in the Lochner case was bitterly criticized . It was commonly asserted that it embodied a legal and economic philosophy which belonged to the middle of the nineteenth century . However , it was succeeded within a few years by a series of decisions upon somewhat similar questions which seemed to indicate that the Supreme Court had adopted a liberal point of view toward social legislation . Notable amongst these cases  | were Muller v. Oregon , 208 U. S. 412 ( 1908 ) , upholding the Oregon tenhour law for women , and Bunting v. Oregon , 243 U. S. 426 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to industrial employees generally . In these and several other cases the Supreme Court was aided by the rather unusual briefs filed in support of the statutes under review . These were prepared by Mr. Brandeis , before his appointment to the Supreme Court , and Professor Frankfurter of the Harvard Law School , aided by Miss Goldmark and Miss Dewson of the National Consumer 's League . They detailed the social and economic conditions which seemed to justify the legislation which had been enacted . These briefs constituted a new technique in the arguing of such cases and undoubtedly helped to convince the Court that the validity of social legislation under the due process clause must be determined , not merely by invoking abstract legal concepts , but by the fullest possible understanding of the social conditions and problems which the questioned statutes seek to control . Mr. Justice Peckham delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : ... The statute necessarily interferes with the right of contract between the employer and employees , concerning the number of hours in which the latter may labor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract in relation to his business is part of the liberty of the individual protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution . . . . Under that provision no state can deprive any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment , unless there are circumstances which exclude the right . There are , however , certain powers , existing in the sovereignty of each state in the Union , somewhat vaguely termed police powers , the exact description and limitation of which have not been attempted by the courts . Those powers , broadly stated , and without , at present , any attempt at a more specific limitation , relate to the safety , health , morals , and general welfare of the public . Both property and liberty are held on such reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the governing power of the state in the exercise of those powers , and with such conditions the Fourteenth Amendment was not designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to prevent the individual from making certain kinds of contracts , and in regard to them the federal Constitution offers no protection . If the contract be one which the state , in the legitimate exercise of its police power , has the right to prohibit , it is not prevented from prohibiting it by the Fourteenth Amendment . Contracts in violation of a statute , either of the federal or state government , or a contract to let one 's property for immoral purposes , or to do any  | other unlawful act , could obtain no protection from the federal Constitution , as coming under the liberty of person or of free contract . Therefore , when the state , by its legislature , in the assumed exercise of its police powers , has passed an act which seriously limits the right to labor or the right of contract in regard to their means of livelihood between persons who are sui juris ( both employer and employee ) , it becomes of great importance to determine which shall prevail , - the right of the individual to labor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state to prevent the individual from laboring , or from entering into any contract to labor , beyond a certain time prescribed by the state ... . It must , of course , be conceded that there is a limit to the valid exercise of the police power by the state . There is no dispute concerning this general proposition . Otherwise the Fourteenth Amendment would have no efficacy and the legislatures of the states would have unbounded power , and it would be enough to say that any piece of legislation was enacted to conserve the morals , the health , or the safety of the people ; such legislation would be valid , no matter how absolutely without foundation the claim might be . The claim of the police power would be a mere pretext , ? become another and delusive name for the supreme sovereignty of the state to be exercised free from constitutional restraint . This is not contended for . In every case that comes before this Court , therefore , where legislation of this character is concerned , and where the protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Is this a fair , reasonable , and appropriate exercise of the police power of the state , or is it an unreasonable , unnecessary , and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty , or to enter into those contracts in relation to labor which may seem to him appropriate or necessary for the support of himself and his family ? Of course the liberty of contract relating to labor includes both parties to it . The one has as much right to purchase as the other to sell labor . This is not a question of substituting the judgment of the court for that of the legislature . If the act be within the power of the state it is valid , although the judgment of the court might be totally opposed to the enactment of such a law . But the question would still remain : Is it within the police power of the state ? and that question must be answered by the court . The question whether this act is valid as a labor law , pure and simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reasonable ground for interfering with the liberty of person or the right of free contract , by determining the hours of labor , in the occupation of a baker . There is no contention that bakers as a class are not equal in intelligence and  | capacity to men in other trades or manual occupations , or that they are not able to assert their rights and care for themselves without the protecting arm of the state , interfering with their independence of judgment and of action . They are in no sense wards of the state . Viewed in the light of a purely labor law , with no reference whatever to the question of health , we think that a law like the one before us involves neither the safety , the morals , nor the welfare of the public , and that the interest of the public is not in the slightest degree affected by such an act . The law must be upheld , if at all , as a law pertaining to the health of the individual engaged in the occupation of a baker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those who are engaged in that occupation . Clean and wholesome bread does not depend upon whether the baker works but ten hours per day or only sixty hours a week . The limitation of the hours of labor does not come within the police power on that ground . It is a question of which of two powers or rights shall prevail , ? the power of the state to legislate or the right of the individual to liberty of person and freedom of contract . The mere assertion that the subject relates , though but in a remote degree , to the public health , does not necessarily render the enactment valid . The act must have a more direct relation , as a means to an end , and the end itself must be appropriate and legitimate , before an act can be held to be valid which interferes with the general right of an individual to be free in his person and in his power to contract in relation to his own labor ... . We think the limit of the police power has been reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our judgment , no reasonable foundation for holding this to be necessary or appropriate as a health law to safeguard the public health , or the health of the individuals who are following the trade of a baker . If this statute be valid , and if , therefore , a proper case is made out in which to deny the right of an individual , sui juris , as employer or employee , to make contracts for the labor of the latter under the protection of the provisions of the federal Constitution , there would seem to be no length to which legislation of this nature might not go . ... We think that there can be no fair doubt that the trade of a baker , in and of itself , is not an unhealthy one to that degree which would authorize the legislature to interfere with the right to labor , and with the right of free contract on the part of the individual , either as employer or employee . In looking through statistics regarding all trades and occupations , it may be true that the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some other trades , and is also vastly more healthy than still others . To the common understanding the trade of a baker has never  | been regarded as an unhealthy one . Very likely physicians would not recommend the exercise of that or of any other trade as a remedy for ill health . Some occupations are more healthy than others , but we think there are none which might not come under the power of the legislature to supervise and control the hours of working therein , if the mere fact that the occupation is not absolutely and perfectly healthy is to confer that right upon the legislative department of the government . It might be safely affirmed that almost all occupations more or less affect the health . There must be more than the mere fact of the possible existence of some small amount of unhealthiness to warrant legislative interference with liberty . It is unfortunately true that labor , even in any department , may possibly carry with it the seeds of unhealthiness . But are we all , on that account , at the mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a locksmith , a carpenter , a cabinetmaker , a dry goods clerk , a bank 's , a lawyer 's , or a physician 's clerk , or a clerk in almost any kind of business , would all come under the power of the legislature , on this assumption . No trade , no occupation , no mode of earning one 's living , could escape this all-pervading power , and the acts of the legislature in limiting the hours of labor in all employments would be valid , although such limitation might seriously cripple the ability of the laborer to support himself and his family . In our large cities there are many buildings into which the sun penetrates for but a short time in each day , and these buildings are occupied by people carrying on the business of bankers , brokers , lawyers , real estate , and many other kinds of business , aided by many clerks , messengers , and other employees . Upon the assumption of the validity of this act under review , it is not possible to say that an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from contracting to labor for their employers more than eight hours a day would be invalid . It might be said that it is unhealthy to work more than that number of hours in an apartment lighted by artificial light during the working hours of the day ; that the occupation of the bank clerk , the lawyer 's clerk , the real-estate clerk , or the broker 's clerk , in such offices is therefore unhealthy , and the legislature in its paternal wisdom must , therefore , have the right to legislate on the subject of and to limit the hours for such labor , and , if it exercises that power , and its validity be questioned , it is sufficient to say , it has reference to the public health ; it has reference to the health of the employees condemned to labor day after day in buildings where the sun never shines ; it is a health law , and therefore it is valid , and can not be questioned by the courts . It is also urged , pursuing the same line of argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its population should he strong and robust ,  | and therefore any legislation which may be said to tend to make people healthy must be valid as health laws , enacted under the police power . If this be a valid argument and a justification for this kind of legislation , it follows that the protection of the federal Constitution from undue interference with liberty of person and freedom of contract is visionary , wherever the law is sought to be justified as a valid exercise of the police power . Scarcely any law but might find shelter under such assumptions , and conduct , properly so called , as well as contract , would come under the restrictive sway of the legislature . Not only the hours of employees , but the hours of employers , could be regulated , and doctors , lawyers , scientists , all professional men , as well as athletes and artisans , could be forbidden to fatigue their brains and bodies by prolonged hours of exercise , lest the fighting strength of the state be impaired . We mention these extreme cases because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soundness of the views which uphold this law . On the contrary , we think that such a law as this , although passed in the assumed exercise of the police power , and as relating to the public health , or the health of the employees named , is not within that power , and is invalid . The act is not , within any fair meaning of the term , a health . law , but is an illegal interference with the rights of individuals , both employers and employees , to make contracts regarding labor upon such terms as they may think best , or which they may agree upon with the other parties to such contracts . Statutes of the nature of that under review , limiting the hours in which grown and intelligent men may labor to earn their living , are mere meddlesome interferences with the rights of the individual , and they are not saved from condemnation by the claim that they are passed in the exercise of the police power and upon the subject of the health of the individual whose rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reasonable in and of itself , to say that there is material danger to the public health , or to the health of the employees , if the hours of labor are not curtailed ... . It was further urged on the argument that restricting the hours of labor in the case of bakers was valid because it tended to cleanliness on the part of the workers , as a man was more apt to be cleanly when not overworked , and if cleanly then his " output " was also more like to be so . . . . The connection , if any exist , is too shadowy and thin to build any argument for the interference of the legislature . If the man works ten hours a day it is all right , but if ten and a half or eleven his health is in danger and his bread may be unhealthful , and , therefore , he shall not be permitted to do it . This , we think , is unreasonable and entirely arbitrary .  | ... It seems to us that the real object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the master and his employees ( all being men , sui juris ) , in a private business , not dangerous in any degree to morals , or in any real and substantial degree to the health of the employees . Under such circumstances the freedom of master and employee to contract with each other in relation to their employment , and in defining the same , can not be prohibited or interfered with , without violating the federal Constitution ... . Mr. Justice Harlan , with whom concurred Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Day , in dissenting said in part : ... I find it impossible , in view of common experience , to say that there is here no real or substantial relation between the means employed by the state and the end sought to be accomplished by its legislation ... . We judicially know that the question of the number of hours during which a workman should continuously labor has been , for a long period , and is yet , a subject of serious consideration among civilized peoples , and by those having special knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor in bakery and confectionery establishments in excess of eighteen hours each day . No one , I take it , could dispute the power of the state to enact such a statute . But the statute before us does not embrace extreme or exceptional cases . It may be said to occupy a middle ground in respect of the hours of labor . What is the true ground for the state to take between legitimate protection , by legislation , of the public health and liberty of contract is not a question easily solved , nor one in respect of which there is or can be absolute certainty . There are very few , if any , questions in political economy about which entire certainly may be predicated ... . I do not stop to consider whether any particular view of this economic question presents the sounder theory . What the precise facts are it may be difficult to say . It is enough for the determination of this case , and it is enough for this Court to know , that the question is one about which there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many reasons of a weighty , substantial character , based upon the experience of mankind , in support of the theory that , all things considered , more than ten hours steady work each day , from week to week , in a bakery or confectionery establishment , may endanger the health and shorten the lives of the workmen , thereby diminishing their physical and mental capacity to serve the state and to provide for those dependent upon them . If such reasons exist that ought to be the end of this case , for the  | state is not amenable to the judiciary , in respect of its legislative enactments , unless such enactments are plainly , palpably , beyond all question , inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States ... . Mr. justice Holmes in dissenting said : I regret sincerely that I am unable to agree with the judgment in this case , and I think it my duty to express my dissent . This case is decided upon an economic theory which a large part of the country does not entertain . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should desire to study it further and long before making up my mind . But I do not conceive that to be my duty , because I strongly believe that my agreement or disagreement has nothing to do with the right of a majority to embody their opinions in law . It is settled by various decisions of this Court that state constitutions and state laws may regulate life in many ways which we as legislators might think as injudicious or if you like as tyrannical as this , and which equally with this interfere with the liberty to contract . Sunday laws and usury laws are ancient examples . A more modern one is the prohibition of lotteries . The liberty of the citizen to do as he likes so long as he does not interfere with the liberty of others to do the same , which has been a shibboleth for some well-known writers , is interfered with by school laws , by the postoffice , by every state or municipal institution which takes his money for purposes thought desirable , whether he likes it or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Social Statics . The other day we sustained the Massachusetts vaccination law . Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U. S. 11 . United States and state statutes and decisions cutting down the liberty to contract by way of combination are familiar to this Court . Northern Securities Co. v. United States , 193 U. S. 197 . Two years ago we upheld the prohibition of sales of stock on margins or for future delivery in the constitution of California . Otis v. Parker , 187 U. S. 6o6 . The decision sustaining an eight-hour law for miners is still recent . Holden v. Hardy , 169 U. S. 366 . Some of these laws embody convictions or prejudices which judges are likely to share . Some may not . But a constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory , whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state or of laissez faire . It is made for people of fundamentally differing views , and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Constitution of the United States . General propositions do not decide concrete cases . The decision will  | depend on a judgment or intuition more subtle than any articulate major premise . But I think that the proposition just stated , if it is accepted , will carry us far toward the end . Every opinion tends to become a law . I think that the word " liberty " in the Fourteenth Amendment is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion , unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law . It does not need research to show that no such sweeping condemnation can be passed upon the statute before us . A reasonable man might think it a proper measure on the score of health . Men whom I certainly could not pronounce unreasonable would uphold it as a first instalment of a general regulation of the hours of work . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of inequality I think it unnecessary to discuss . . Does the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee to employers , as an essential part of their freedom of contract , the right to pay women and children starvation wages ? This was the constitutional issue raised by the enactment of minimum wage laws . The judicial struggle to settle that issue provides the most spectacular story in the entire history of due process of law . In no other series of cases is it made so abundantly clear that judicial answers to questions like these are governed by the " personal economic predilections " of the individual judges . In 1913 the state of Washington passed a law to provide minimum wages for women and children in industry . Its provisions appear on pages 139 f. below . Attacked under the due process clause the act was twice upheld by the supreme court of the state . In 1913 Oregon likewise passed a similar statute which was held valid by the supreme court of Oregon . This time attack on the act was carried to the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brief in defense of the act and when , in 1916 , he was appointed to the Supreme Court , Professor Frankfurter took his place and argued the case . With Mr. Justice Brandeis disqualified because of his earlier connection with the case , the Court , in Stettler v. O'Hara , 243 U. S. 629 ( 1917 ) , divided four-to-four and the decision of the Oregon court upholding the minimum wage law was accordingly affirmed . It was confidently assumed that the full Court would in due course follow the doctrines announced in the cases upholding restrictions upon the hours of labor of women and declare the minimum wage legislation constitutional . In 1923 , however , the Court , now substantially changed in per- sonnel , held invalid as a denial of due process of law the minimum wage law passed by Congress in 1918 for the District of Columbia . This was the case of Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , 261 U. S. 525 ( 1923 ) . The Court divided five-to-three . Again Mr. Justice Brandeis did not sit , this time because his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority opinion of Mr. Justice Sutherland reads like the opinion of the Court in the Lochner case , which it quotes at length with approval . There is no such connection between the wages women receive and their health , morals , or welfare as to justify destroying by law the freedom of contract of employers and the women who work for them . Nor does the act guarantee that the minimum wage fixed shall not exceed the fair value of the service for which it is paid . Chief Justice Taft and Mr. Justice Holmes wrote dissenting opinions . Mr. Justice Sanford concurred with the Chief Justice . In 1925 and in 1927 , the Court without opinion ruled that the Adkins case rendered invalid the state minimum wage laws of Arizona and Arkansas respectively . In 1933 New York passed a minimum wage law for women and children . Its framers sought to escape the ban of the Adkins decision by providing that the wages fixed should be based on the fair value of the labor paid for . The attempt failed . By a divided vote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially the same as the one in the Adkins case , and accordingly void under the authority of that case . In Morehead v. New York ex rel . Tipaldo , 298 U. S. 587 ( 1936 ) , the Supreme Court in a five-to-four decision held the New York statute invalid . In the majority opinion Mr. Justice Butler followed the view of the New York court that the statute was like the one held void in the Adkins case , but said in substance that any minimum wage law , regardless of its provisions , would be invalid as a denial of due process of law . In a separate dissenting opinion Mr. Justice Stone observed : " It is difficult to imagine any grounds , other than our own personal economic predilections , for saying that the contract of employment is any the less an appropriate subject of legislation than are scores of others , in dealing with which this Court has held that legislatures may curtail individual freedom in the public interest . " During all this time , the Washington statute of 1913 had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court 's docket when the New York case was decided . The case was argued on its merits . Five justices , Mr. Justice Roberts crossing over , overruled the Adkins case and upheld the Washington statute . Four justices dissented . Mr. Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : This case presents the question of the constitutional validity of the minimum wage law of the state of Washington . Passed in 1913 . . . . It provides : " Sec . I. The welfare of the state of Washington demands that women  | and minors be protected from conditions of labor which have a pernicious effect on their health and morals . The state of Washington therefore , exercising herein its police and sovereign power declares that inadequate wages and unsanitary conditions of labor exert such pernicious effect . " Sec. 2 . It shall be unlawful to employ women or minors in any industry or occupation within the state of Washington under conditions of labor detrimental to their health or morals ; and it shall be unlawful to employ women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages which are not adequate for their maintenance . " Sec. 3 . There is hereby created a commission to be known as the Industrial Welfare Commission ' for the state of Washington , to establish such standards of wages and conditions of labor for women and minors employed within the state of Washington , as shall be held hereunder to be reasonable and not detrimental to health and morals , and which shall be sufficient for the decent maintenance of women . " ... Further provisions outlined the procedure to be followed by the commission in fixing minimum wages in various occupations . The appellant conducts a hotel . The appellee Elsie Parrish was employed as a chambermaid and ( with her husband ) brought this suit to recover the difference between the wages paid her and the minimum wage fixed pursuant to the state law . The minimum wage was $14.50 per week of 48 hours . The appellant challenged the act as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States . The supreme court of the state , reversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the plaintiffs .... The appellant relies upon the decision of this Court in Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , 261 U. S. 525 , which held invalid the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act which was attacked under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment . . . . Here follows comment upon Morehead v. New York ex rel . Tipaldo , discussed above , and a review of the judicial history of minimum wage legislation . The principle which must control our decision is not in doubt . The constitutional provision invoked is the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governing the states , as the due process clause invoked in the Adkins case governed Congress . In each case the violation alleged by those attacking minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract . What is this freedom ? The Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract . It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law . In prohibiting that deprivation the Constitution does not recognize an abso- lute and uncontrollable liberty . Liberty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organization which requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health , safety , morals and welfare of the people . Liberty under the Constitution is thus necessarily subject to the restraints of due process , and regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community is due process . This essential limitation of liberty in general governs freedom of contract in particular . More than twenty-five years ago we set forth the applicable principle in these words , after referring to the cases where the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment had been broadly described : " But it was recognized in the cases cited , ' as in many others , that freedom of contract is a qualified and not an absolute right . There is no absolute freedom to do as one wills or to contract as one chooses . The guaranty of liberty does not withdraw from legislative supervision that wide department of activity which consists of the making of contracts , or deny to government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of arbitrary restraint , not immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the interests of the community . " Chicago , B. &; Q. R. Co. v. McGuire , 219 U. S. 549 This power under the Constitution to restrict freedom of contract has had many illustrations . That it may be exercised in the public interest with respect to contracts between employer and employee is undeniable . . . . The Court lists here numerous cases holding valid under the Fourteenth Amendment various types of protective labor legislation . The point that has been strongly stressed that adult employees should be deemed competent to make their own contracts was decisively met nearly forty years ago in Holden v. Hardy , 169 U.S. 366 , where we pointed out the inequality in the footing of the parties . We said : " The legislature has also recognized the fact , which the experience of legislators in many states has corroborated , that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not stand upon an equality , and that their interests are , to a certain extent , conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible from their employees , while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment , fairly exercised , would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength . In other words , the proprietors lay down the rules and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them . In such cases self-interest is often an unsafe guide , and the legislature may properly interpose its authority . " And we added that the fact " that both parties are of full age and  | competent to contract does not necessarily deprive the state of the power to interfere where the parties do not stand upon an equality , or where the public health demands that one party to the contract shall be protected against himself . " .. . It is manifest that this established principle is peculiarly applicable in relation to the employment of women in whose protection the state has a special interest . That phase of the subject received elaborate consideration in Muller v. Oregon ( 1908 ) 208 U. S. 412 , where the constitutional authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sustained . We emphasized the consideration that " woman 's physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence " and that her physical well being " becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race . " We emphasized the need of protecting women against oppression despite her possession of contractual rights . We said that " though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation , there is that in her disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion of those rights . She will still be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary to secure a real equality of right . " Hence she was " properly placed in a class by herself , and legislation designed for her protection may be sustained even when like legislation is not necessary for men and could not be sustained . " We concluded that the limitations which the statute there in question " placed upon her contractual powers , upon her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall labor " were " not imposed solely for her benefit , but also largely for the benefit of all . " . . . This array of precedents and the principles they applied were thought by the dissenting justices in the Adkins case to demand that the minimum wage statute be sustained . The validity of the distinction made by the Court between a minimum wage and a maximum of hours in limiting liberty of contract was especially challenged . 261 U. S. , p. 564 . That challenge persists and is without any satisfactory answer . As Chief Justice Taft observed : " In absolute freedom of contract the one term is as important as the other , for both enter equally into the consideration given and received ; a restriction as to one is not any greater in essence than the other , and is of the same kind . One is the multiplier and the other the multiplicand . " And Mr. Justice Holmes , while recognizing that " the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree , " could " perceive no difference in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with which we have any concern ,  | between the one case and the other . The bargain is equally affected whichever half you regulate . " .. . The minimum wage to be paid under the Washington statute is fixed after full consideration by representatives of employers , employees and the public . It may be assumed that the minimum wage is fixed in consideration of the services that are performed in the particular occupations under normal conditions . Provision is made for special licenses at less wages in the case of women who are incapable of full service . The statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Adkins case is pertinent : " This statute does not compel anybody to pay anything . It simply forbids employment at rates below those fixed as the minimum requirement of health and right living . It is safe to assume that women will not be employed at even the lowest wages allowed unless they earn them , or unless the employer 's business can sustain the burden . In short the law in its character and operation is like hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. , p. 570 . And Chief Justice Taft forcibly pointed out the consideration which is basic in a statute of this character : " Legislatures which adopt a requirement of maximum hours or minimum wages may be presumed to believe that when sweating employers are prevented from paying unduly low wages by positive law they will continue their business , abating that part of their profits , which were wrung from the necessities of their employees , and will concede the better terms required by the law ; and that while in individual cases hardship may result , the restriction will enure to the benefit of the general class of employees in whose interest the law is passed and so to that of the community at large . " Id . p. 563 . We think that the views thus expressed are sound and that the decision in the Adkins case was a departure from the true application of the principles governing the regulation by the state of the relation of employer and employed ... . With full recognition of the earnestness and vigor which characterize the prevailing opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconcile that ruling with these well-considered declarations . What can be closer to the public interest than the health of women and their protection from unscrupulous and overreaching employers ? And if the protection of women is a legitimate end of the exercise of state power , how can it be said that the requirement of the payment of a minimum wage fairly fixed in order to meet the very necessities of existence is not an admissible means to that end ? The legislature of the state was clearly entitled to consider the situation of women in employment , the fact that they are in the class receiving the least pay , that their bargain- ing power is relatively weak , and that they are the ready victims of those who would take advantage of their necessitous circumstances . The legislature was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the sweating system , " the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living thus making their very helplessness the occasion of a most injurious competition . The legislature had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an important aid in carrying out its policy of protection . The adoption of similar requirements by many states evidences a deepseated conviction both as to the presence of the evil and as to the means adapted to check it . Legislative response to that conviction can not be regarded as arbitrary or capricious and that is all we have to decide . Even if the wisdom of the policy be regarded as debatable and its effects uncertain , still the legislature is entitled to its judgment . There is an additional and compelling consideration which recent economic experience has brought into a strong light . The exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position with respect to bargaining power and are thus relatively defenceless against the denial of a living wage is not only detrimental to their health and well being but casts a direct burden for their support upon the community . What these workers lose in wages the taxpayers are called upon to pay . The bare cost of living must be met . We may take judicial notice of the unparalled demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still continue to an alarming extent despite the degree of economic recovery which has been achieved . It is unnecessary to cite official statistics to establish what is of common knowledge through the length and breadth of the land . While in the instant case no factual brief has been presented , there is no reason to doubt that the state of Washington has encountered the same social problem that is present elsewhere . The community is not bound to provide what is in effect a subsidy for unconscionable employers . The community may direct its law-making power to correct the abuse which springs from their selfish disregard of the public interest . The argument that the legislation in question constitutes an arbitrary discrimination , because it does not extend to men , is unavailing . This Court has frequently held that the legislative authority , acting within its proper field , is not bound to extend its regulation to all cases which it might possibly reach . The legislature " is free to recognize degrees of harm and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt , it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might  | have been applied . " There is no " doctrinaire requirement " that the legislation should be couched in all embracing terms ... . Our conclusion is that the case of Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , 261 U.S. 525 , should be , and it is , overruled . The judgment of the supreme court of the state of Washington is affirmed . Mr. Justice Sutherland dissented in an opinion in which Justices Van Devanter , McReynolds , and Butler concurred . DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE THE TRUSTEES OF DARTMOUTH COLLEGE v. WOODWARD 4 Wheaton 518 ; 4 L. Ed. 629. 1819 . When the framers of the Constitution forbade the states to pass laws impairing the obligation of contracts they had in mind the ordinary executory contracts between man and man , which during the " critical period " had so frequently been interfered with by the enactment of " stay laws , " legal tender laws , and other legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contract clause by the Supreme Court , however , was given in the case of Fletcher v. Peck , 6 Cranch 87 ( r8io ) , which did not relate to this sort of contract at all , but which involved the question whether an executed contract in the form of a legislative grant of land made by the state itself through its legislature could be later rescinded by the state . The Court held here that the grant of land , even though made under circumstances of the most scandalous corruption , is a contract within the meaning of the constitutional provision and can not be rescinded by the state after the land in question has passed into the hands of innocent purchasers . It is interesting to note that at the very end of his opinion in this case Chief Justice Marshall left the legal profession in some doubt as to the precise ground upon which he held the rescinding act to be void by saying : " The state of Georgia was restrained , either by general principles which are common to our free institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , from passing a law , " etc . This plainly suggests that the rescinding act might have been held void as an interference with vested rights . Of far greater significance was the Dartmouth College Case , in which the contract clause was given an even wider application . In 1769 Dartmouth College was chartered by the English Crown . The charter created a board of trustees with power to choose a president and to fill vacancies in its own membership . In 1779 the first president , dying , was succeeded by his son John Wheelock , who seems to have lacked the tact necessary for a good administrator . Difficulties between Wheelock and his trustees grew apace ,  | at first personal , then sectarian , and finally political . The Wheelock faction came to comprise the Presbyterian Republicans throughout the state , while the board of trustees drew their support from the Congregationalist Federalist group . In 1815 Wheelock was removed from the presidency of the college by the board . In 1816 the Republicans carried the state , electing the governor and a majority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of the college . The name of the institution was changed to Dartmouth University ; the trustees were increased from twelve to twenty-one and were to be appointed by the governor and council ; a body of twenty-five overseers was created , twenty-one of whom were to be appointed by the governor and council with a veto power on the acts of the trustees . The president was required to report annually to the governor on the management of the college , and the governor and council were empowered to " inspect " the college every five years and report to the legislature . Promptly the old trustees refused to be governed by the provisions of the law ; whereupon the new trustees ousted the old trustees from the college buildings , called themselves the new university , and elected Wheelock as the new university president . The old trustees , nothing daunted , gathered about them their sympathizers among the professors , hired rooms nearby , and continued to operate as the " college , " most of the students remaining loyal to the old regime . Woodward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , sided with the Wheelock faction and the new university and now refused to allow the " college " to have possession of the seal , records , and account books which were in his possession . The trustees of the old " college " thereupon brought an action of trover ( a proceeding to recover the value of property wrongfully withheld ) against Woodward , thus raising the general question of the constitutionality of the statute of 1816 reorganizing the college . The case was argued before the supreme court of New Hampshire in 1817 . Little reference was made to the contract clause . The state court decided against the college on the ground that the institution had become public in character and as such was subject to state control . The case was taken to the United States Supreme Court on a writ of error and was argued in 1818 . Webster , who was not yet at the height of his fame , represented the college and made an argument which has long been celebrated . He laid much more emphasis on the necessity of protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that the Court was divided in its opinion on the case at the close of the argument and that Marshall , who favored the college , postponed the decision until the next term and in the meantime won over his colleagues to his own position . At the opening of the next term of court the decision was handed down in favor of the college . The doctrine of this case , that a corporate charter is a contract which may not be impaired by legislative enactment , has been most bitterly criticized as making it possible for corrupt and ignorant legislatures irrevocably to grant away privileges and rights contrary to the public interest and wel- fare . There can be no doubt that it did create opportunities for legislative corruption . At the same time it put the public upon its guard with reference to corporate grants and it emphasized the importance of good faith at a time when public opinion seemed willing to sponsor interference with promises . In an economic sense the decision was of great importance in giving to those who invested money in corporate enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it thus encouraged the expansion of business enterprise in the fields of railroad construction , insurance , commerce , and industry . The doctrine of the Dartmouth College Case was somewhat softened by succeeding decisions of the Supreme Court . In the case of Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge , 1 r Peters 420 ( 1837 ) , it was held that the terms of a charter contract must be strictly construed and that no rights or privileges can be held granted away by the public by mere implication . In the case of Ogden the meaning of the contract clause consists not merely in the promise or agreement between the parties but also in the law applicable to the subject which is in existence when the contract is made . This rule makes it possible for the states to pass general laws reserving the right to amend or repeal corporate charters under certain circumstances . Mr. Chief Justice Marshall , in delivering the opinion of the Court , said in part : ... This Court can be insensible neither to the magnitude nor delicacy of this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined ; and the opinion of the highest law tribunal of a state is to be revised : an opinion which carries with it intrinsic evidence of the diligence , of the ability , and the integrity with which it was formed . On more than one occasion this Court has expressed the cautious circumspection with which it approaches the consideration of such questions ; and has declared that , in no doubtful case , would it pronounce a legislative act to be contrary to the Constitution . But the American people have said , in the Constitution of the United States , that " no State shall pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts . " In the same instrument they have also said , " that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution . " On the judges of this Court , then , is imposed the high and solemn duty of protecting , from even legislative violation , those contracts which the Constitution of our country has placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , this is a duty from which we dare not shrink . . . . It can require no argument to prove that the circumstances of this case constitute a contract . An application is made to the Crown for a  | charter to incorporate a religious and literary institution . In the application it is stated that large contributions have been made for the object , which will be conferred on the corporation as soon as it shall be created . The charter is granted , and on its faith the property is conveyed . Surely in this transaction every ingredient of a complete and legitimate contract is to be found . The points for consideration are , i . Is this contract protected by the Constitution of the United States ? 2 . Is it impaired by the acts under which the defendant holds ? i . On the first point it has been argued that the word " contract , " in its broadest sense , would comprehend the political relations between the government and its citizens , would extend to offices held within a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning civil institutions , which must change with circumstances , and be modified by ordinary legislation ; which deeply concern the public , and which , to preserve good government , the public judgment must control . That even marriage is a contract , and its obligations are affected by the laws respecting divorces . That the clause in the Constitution , if construed in its greatest latitude , would prohibit these laws . Taken in its broad , unlimited sense , the clause would be an unprofitable and vexatious interference with the internal concerns of a state , would unnecessarily and unwisely embarrass its legislation , and render immutable those civil institutions which are established for purposes of internal government , and which ; to subserve those purposes , ought to vary with varying circumstances . That as the framers of the Constitution could never have intended to insert in that instrument a provision so unnecessary , so mischievous , and so repugnant to its general spirit , the term " contract " must be understood in a more limited sense . That it must be understood as intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abuse of which had been extensively felt , and to restrain the legislature in future from violating the right to property . That anterior to the formation of the Constitution , a course of legislation had prevailed in many , if not in all , of the states , which weakened the confidence of man in man , and embarrassed all transactions between individuals , by dispensing with a faithful performance of engagements . To correct this mischief , by restraining the power which produced it , the state legislatures were forbidden " to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts , " that is , of contracts respecting property , under which some individual could claim a right to something beneficial to himself ; and that since the clause in the Constitution must in construction receive some limitation , it may be confined , and ought to be confined , to cases  | of this description ; to cases within the mischief it was intended to remedy . The general correctness of these observations can not be controverted . That the framers of the Constitution did not intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , adopted for internal government , and that the instrument they have given us is not to be so construed , may be admitted . The provision of the Constitution never has been understood to embrace other contracts than those which respect property or some object of value , and confer rights which may be asserted in a court of justice . It never has been understood to restrict the general right of the legislature to legislate on the subject of divorces . Those acts enable some tribunal , not to impair a marriage contract , but to liberate one of the parties because it has been broken by the other . When any state legislature shall pass an act annulling all marriage contracts , or allowing either party to annul it without the consent of the other , it will be time enough to inquire whether such an act be constitutional . The parties in this case differ less on general principles , less on the true construction of the Constitution in the abstract , than on the application of those principles to this case , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point on which the cause essentially depends . If the act of incorporation be a grant of political power , if it create a civil institution to be employed in the administration of the government , or if the funds of the college be public property , or if the state of New Hampshire , as a government , be alone interested in its transactions , the subject is one in which the legislature of the state may act according to its own judgment , unrestrained by any limitation of its power imposed by the Constitution of the United States . But if this be a private eleemosynary institution , endowed with a capacity to take property for objects unconnected with government , whose funds are bestowed by individuals on the faith of the charter ; if the donors have stipulated for the future disposition and management of those funds in the manner prescribed by themselves ; there may be more difficulty in the case , although neither the persons who have made these stipulations , nor those for whose benefit they were made , should be parties to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property may yet retain such an interest in the preservation of their own arrangements as to have a right to insist that those arrangements shall be held sacred . Or , if they have themselves disappeared , it becomes a subject of serious and anxious inquiry whether those whom they have legally empowered to represent them forever may not assert all the  | rights which they possessed while in being ; whether , if they be without personal representatives who may feel injured by a violation of the compact , the trustees be not so completely their representatives in the eye of the law as to stand in their place , not only as respects the government of the college , but also as respects the maintenance of the college charter . It becomes then the duty of the Court most seriously to examine this charter , and to ascertain its true character ... . In the course of his comment upon the charitable objects of the donors of Dartmouth College occurs Marshall 's classic description of a corporation : A corporation is an artificial being , invisible , intangible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere creature of law , it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it , either expressly or as incidental to its very existence . These are such as are supposed best calculated to effect the object for which it was created . Among the most important are immortality , and , if the expression may be allowed , individuality ; properties , by which a perpetual succession of many persons are considered as the same , and may act as a single individual . They enable a corporation to manage its own affairs , and to hold property without the perplexing intricacies , the hazardous and endless necessity , of perpetual conveyances for the purpose of transmitting it from hand to hand . It is chiefly for the purpose of clothing bodies of men in succession with these qualities and capacities that corporations were invented and are in use . By these means , a perpetual succession of individuals are capable of acting for the promotion of the particular object , like one immortal being ... . From this review of the charter , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of perpetuating the application of the bounty of the donors to the specified objects of that bounty ; that its trustees or governors were originally named by the founder , and invested with the power of perpetuating themselves ; that they are not public officers , nor is it a civil institution , participating in the administration of government ; but a charity school , or a seminary of education , incorporated for the preservation of its property , and the perpetual application of that property to the objects of its creation . . . . According to the theory of the British constitution , their Parliament is omnipotent . To annul corporate rights might give a shock to public opinion , which that government has chosen to avoid ; but its power is not questioned . Had Parliament , immediately after the emanation of this charter and the execution of those conveyances which fol- lowed it , annulled the instrument , so that the living donors would have witnessed the disappointment of their hopes , the perfidy of the transaction would have been universally acknowledged . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no interest in the property ; then , as now , those who might be students would have had no rights to be violated ; then , as now , it might be said that the trustees , in whom the rights of all were combined , possessed no private , individual , beneficial interest in the property confided to their protection . Yet the contract would at that time have been deemed sacred by all . What has since occurred to strip it of its inviolability ? Circumstances have not changed it . In reason , in justice , and in law , it is now what it was in 1769 . This is plainly a contract to which the donors , the trustees , and the Crown ( to whose rights and obligations New Hampshire succeeds ) were the original parties . It is a contract made on a valuable consideration . It is a contract for the security and disposition of property . It is a contract on the faith of which real and personal estate has been conveyed to the corporation . It is then a contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit also , unless the fact that the property is invested by the donors in trustees for the promotion of religion and education , for the benefit of persons who are perpetually changing , though the objects remain the same , shall create a particular exception , taking this case out of the prohibition contained in the Constitution . It is more than possible that the preservation of rights of this description was not particularly in view of the framers of the Constitution when the clause under consideration was introduced into that instrument . It is probable that interferences of more frequent recurrence , to which the temptation was stronger and of which the mischief was more extensive , constituted the great motive for imposing this restriction on the state legislatures . But although a particular and a rare case may not in itself be of sufficient magnitude to induce a rule , yet it must be governed by the rule , when established , unless some plain and strong reason for excluding it can be given . It is not enough to say that this particular case was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor of the American people when it was adopted . It is necessary to go farther , and to say that , had this particular case been suggested , the language would have been so varied as to exclude it , or it would have been made a special exception . The case , being within the words of the rule , must be within its operation likewise , unless there be something in the literal construction so obviously absurd , or mischievous , or repugnant to the general spirit of the instrument as to justify those who expound the Constitution in making it an exception . On what safe and intelligible ground can this exception stand ? There  | is no expression in the Constitution , no sentiment delivered by its contemporaneous expounders , which would justify us in making it . In the absence of all authority of this kind , is there , in the nature and reason of the case itself , that which would sustain a construction of the Constitution , not warranted by its words ? Are contracts of this description of a character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the provisions of the Constitution , as being unworthy of the attention of those who framed the instrument ? Or does public policy so imperiously demand their remaining exposed to legislative alteration , as to compel us , or rather permit us to say , that these words , which were introduced to give stability to contracts , and which in their plain import comprehend this contract , must yet be so construed , as to exclude it ? Almost all eleemosynary corporations , those which are created for the promotion of religion , of charity , or of education , are of the same character . The law of this case is the law of all ... . The opinion of the Court , after mature deliberation , is , that this is a contract , the obligation of which can not be impaired without violating the Constitution of the United States . This opinion appears to us to be equally supported by reason and by the former decisions of this Court . 2 . We next proceed to the inquiry whether its obligation has been impaired by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special verdict refers . From the review of this charter which has been taken it appears that the whole power of governing the college , of appointing and removing tutors , of fixing their salaries , of directing the course of study to be pursued by the students , and of filling up vacancies created in their own body , was vested in the trustees . On the part of the Crown it was expressly stipulated that this corporation , thus constituted , should continue forever ; and that the number of trustees should forever consist of twelve , and no more . By this contract the Crown was bound , and could have made no violent alteration in its essential terms without impairing its obligation . By the Revolution the duties as well as the powers of government devolved on the people of New Hampshire . It is admitted that among the latter was comprehended the transcendent power of Parliament , as well as that of the executive department . It is too clear to require the support of argument that all contracts and rights respecting property remained unchanged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by the charter to Dartmouth College were the same in the new that they had been in the old government . The power of the government was also the same . A repeal of this charter at any time prior to  | the adoption of the present Constitution of the United States would have been an extraordinary and unprecedented act of power , but one which could have been contested only by the restrictions upon the legislature to be found in the constitution of the state . But the Constitution of the United States has imposed this additional limitation , that the legislature of a state shall pass no act " impairing the obligation of contracts . " It has been already stated that the act " to amend the charter and enlarge and improve the corporation of Dartmouth College " increases the number of trustees to twenty-one , gives the appointment of the additional members to the executive of the state , and creates a board of overseers , to consist of twenty-five persons , of whom twenty-one are also appointed by the executive of New Hampshire , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trustees . On the effect of this law two opinions can not be entertained . Between acting directly and acting through the agency of trustees and overseers no essential difference is perceived . The whole power of governing the college is transformed from trustees appointed according to the will of the founder , expressed in the charter , to the executive of New Hampshire . The management and application of the funds of this eleemosynary institution , which are placed by the donors in the hands of trustees named in the charter , and empowered to perpetuate themselves , are placed by this act under the control of the government of the state . The will of the state is substituted for the will of the donors in every essential operation of the college . This is not an immaterial change . The founders of the college contracted , not merely for the perpetual application of the funds which they gave to the objects for which those funds were given ; they contracted also to secure that application by the constitution of the corporation . They contracted for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide , retain forever the government of the literary institution they had formed , in the hands of persons approved by themselves . This system is totally changed . The charter of 1769 exists no longer . It is reorganized ; and reorganized in such a manner as to convert a literary institution , molded according to the will of its founders and placed under the control of private literary men , into a machine entirely subservient to the will of government . This may be for the advantage of this college in particular , and may be for the advantage of literature in general ; but it is not according to the will of the donors , and is subversive of that contract on the faith of which their property was given . In the view which has been taken of this interesting case , the Court  | has confined itself to the rights possessed by the trustees , as the assignees and representatives of the donors and founders , for the benefit of religion and literature . Yet it is not clear that the trustees ought to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law may respect . In addition to their being the legal owners of the property , and to their having a freehold right in the powers confided to them , the charter itself countenances the idea that trustees may also be tutors with salaries . The first president was one of the original trustees ; and the charter provides , that in case of vacancy in that office , " the senior professor or tutor , being one of the trustees , shall exercise the office of president , until the trustees shall make choice of , and appoint a president . " According to the tenor of the charter , then , the trustees might , without impropriety , appoint a president and other professors from their own body . This is a power not entirely unconnected with an interest . Even if the proposition of the counsel for the defendant were sustained ; if it were admitted , that those contracts only are protected by the Constitution , a beneficial interest in which is vested in the party who appears in court to assert that interest ; yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College have no beneficial interest in themselves . But the Court has deemed it unnecessary to investigate this particular point , being of opinion , on general principles that in these private eleemosynary institutions , the body corporate , as possessing the whole legal and equitable interest , and completely representing the donors , for the purpose of executing the trust , has rights which are protected by the Constitution . It results from this opinion , that the acts of the legislature of New Hampshire , which are stated in the special verdict found in this cause , are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States ; and that the judgment on this special verdict ought to have been for the plaintiffs . The judgment of the state court must , therefore , be reversed . Mr. Justice Washington and Mr. Justice Story rendered separate concurring opinions . Mr. Justice Duvall dissented. 290 U. S. 398 ; 78 L. Ed. 413 ; 54 Sup . Ct . 231. 1934 . The spectacular character of the Roosevelt Administration 's recovery program has perhaps tended to obscure the fact that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the acute problems presented by the depression . One of the most pressing of these problems was the dire situation of the land or home owner facing a foreclosure of his mortgage . With taxes mounting and incomes diminishing , thousands faced the prospect of losing their property through no fault of their own , only to join the ranks of the unemployed living on public relief . If the national recovery program was to prove effective and the industry and agriculture of the country rehabilitated , many of these necessitous debtors might be put upon their feet again if temporary relief could be extended to them . It was to meet this peculiar emergency that the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Act of 1933 , typical of others , was enacted . Its provisions are set forth in the opinion printed below . The constitutional problems involved in extending this kind of relief to harassed debtors are not simple . Mortgages are contracts . As such they are entitled to the full protection of the provisions of the federal Constitution which forbids any state to make or pass any law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not justify forgetting the position of the creditor whose money has been tied up on the security of the mortgage . Any wholesale scaling down of the value of real estate mortgages , or prolonged delay in their payment , would imperil the investments of banks , insurance companies , and other financial institutions upon whose stability the income of millions of large and small investors depends . At the same time it is a long and well established rule of law that the police power of the state , one of the paramount powers of government , may not be contracted away . All private contracts are made subject to the legitimate and reasonable exercise of that paramount power . If , therefore , a way can be found through an exercise of the police power to afford the mortgage debtor relief from his precarious position , without destroying the value of the mortgage , that relief can be justified on the ground stated and no impairment of the mortgage contract can be claimed . The emergency conditions which prevailed in Minnesota were held by the Court in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exercise of the police power . While delay was afforded the debtor , the essential rights of the creditor were protected . In reading the opinion close study should be made of just what advantages were extended to the debtor and what sacrifices the creditor was obliged to make . In a long and eloquent dissenting opinion Mr. Justice Sutherland protested against what he regarded as an essential impairment of contract rights . There is a good deal of plausibility in his argument that the contract clause itself was written into the Constitution in order to protect contract rights against just such legislative efforts to extend relief to debtors as the present statute represents . But in its final evaluation of the relative values involved , the majority of the Court concluded that the widespread public necessity for affording the relief provided in the act outweighed the counterbalancing claims of the mortgage creditors .  | Mr. Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : Appellant contests the validity of Chapter 339 of the Laws of Minnesota of 1933 , p. 514 , approved April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as being repugnant to the contract clause ( Art . I , ? 10 ) and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment , of the federal Constitution . The statute was sustained by the supreme court of Minnesota , . . . and the case comes here on appeal . The act provides that , during the emergency declared to exist , relief may be had through authorized judicial proceedings with respect to foreclosures of mortgages , and execution sales , of real estate ; that sales may be postponed and periods of redemption may be extended . The act does not apply to mortgages subsequently made nor to those made previously which shall be extended for a period ending more than a year after the passage of the act . . . . The act is to remain in effect " only during the continuance of the emergency and in no event beyond May 1 , 1935 . " No extension of the period for redemption and no postponement of sale is to be allowed which would have the effect of extending the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with the provisions of Part one , ? 4 , authorizing the district court of the county to extend the period of redemption from foreclosure sales " for such additional time as the court may deem just and equitable , " subject to the above described limitation . The extension is to be made upon application to the court , on notice , for an order determining the reasonable value of the income on the property involved in the sale , or if it has no income , then the reasonable rental value of the property , and directing the mortgagor " to pay all or a reasonable part of such income or rental value , in or toward the payment of taxes , insurance , interest , mortgage . . . indebtedness at such times and in such manner " as shall be determined by the court .. . Invoking the relevant provision of the statute , appellees applied to the district court of Hennepin County for an order extending the period of redemption from a foreclosure sale . Their petition stated that they owned a lot in Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained a valid power of sale by advertisement and that by reason of their default the mortgage had been foreclosed and sold to appellant on May 2 , 1932 , for $3700.98 ; that appellant was the holder of the sheriff 's certificate of sale ; that because of the economic depression appellees had been unable to obtain a new loan or to redeem , and that unless the period of redemption were p 157 extended the property would be irretrievably lost ; and that the reasonable value of the property greatly exceeded the amount due on the mortgage including all liens , costs and expenses . ... The court found that the time to redeem would expire on May 2 , 1933 , under the laws of the state as they were in effect when the mortgage was made and when it was foreclosed ; that the reasonable value of the income on the property , and the reasonable rental value , was $40 a month ; that the bid made by appellant on the foreclosure sale , and the purchase price , were the full amount of the mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale ; that the reasonable present market value of the premises was $6000 ; and that the total amount of the purchase price , with taxes and insurance premiums subsequently paid by appellant , but exclusive of interest from the date of sale , was $4056.39 . The court also found that the property was situated in the closely built-up portions of Minneapolis ; that it had been improved by a two-car garage , together with a building two stories in height which was divided into fourteen rooms ; that the appellees , husband and wife , occupied the premises as their homestead , occupying three rooms and offering the remaining rooms for rental to others . The court entered its judgment extending the period of redemption to May 1 , 1935 , subject to the condition that the appellees should pay to the appellant $40 a month through the extended period from May 2 , 1933 , that is , that in each of the months of August , September , and October , 1933 , the payments should be $8o , in two instalments , and thereafter $40 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxes , insurance , interest , and mortgage indebtedness . It is this judgment , sustained by the supreme court of the state on the authority of its former opinion , which is here under review ... . In determining whether the provision for this temporary and conditional relief exceeds the power of the state by reason of the clause in the federal Constitution prohibiting impairment of the obligations of contracts , we must consider the relation of emergency to constitutional power , the historical setting of the contract clause , the development of the jurisprudence of this Court in the construction of that clause , and the principles of construction which we may consider to be established . Emergency does not create power . Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish the restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved . The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave emergency . Its grants of power to the federal government and its limitations of the power of the states were determined in the light of emergency and they are not altered by emergency . What power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | which have always been , and always will be , the subject of close examination under our constitutional system . While emergency does not create power , emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power . " Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived , nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed . " Wilson v. New , 243 U. S. 332 , 348 . The constitutional question presented in the light of an emergency is whether the power possessed embraces the particular exercise of it in response to particular conditions . Thus , the war power of the federal government is not created by the emergency of war , but it is a power given to meet that emergency . It is a power to wage war successfully , and thus it permits the harnessing of the entire energies of the people in a supreme cooperative effort to preserve the nation . But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties . When the provisions of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularized as not to admit of construction , no question is presented . Thus , emergency would not permit a state to have more than two Senators in the Congress , or permit the election of President by a general popular vote without regard to the number of electors to which the states are respectively entitled , or permit the states to " coin money " or " to make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts . " But where constitutional grants and limitations of power are set forth in general clauses , which afford a broad outline , the process of construction is essential to fill in the details . That is true of the contract clause ... . In the construction of the contract clause , the debates in the Constitutional Convention are of little aid . But the reasons which led to the adoption of that clause , and of the other prohibitions of section io of Article I , are not left in doubt and have frequently been described with eloquent emphasis . . . . There follows a brief historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the clause does not suffice to fix its precise scope . Nor does an examination of the details of prior legislation in the states yield criteria which can be considered controlling . To ascertain the scope of the constitutional prohibition we examine the course of judicial decisions in its application . These put it beyond question that the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula . . . . The inescapable problems of construction have been : What is a contract ? What are the obligations of contracts ? What constitutes impairment of these obligations ? What residuum of power is there still in the states in relation to the operation of contracts , to protect the vital interests of the community ? Questions of this character , " of no small nicety  | and intricacy , have vexed the legislative halls , as well as the judicial tribunals , with an uncounted variety and frequency of litigation and speculation . " . . . There follows an elaborate summary of the judicial interpretation of the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited those upon which appellant chiefly relies , is directly applicable to the question now before us in view of the conditions with which the Minnesota statute seeks to safeguard the interests of the mortgagee-purchaser during the extended period . And broad expressions contained in some of these opinions went beyond the requirements of the decision , and are not controlling ... . Not only is the constitutional provision qualified by the measure of control which the state retains over remedial processes , but the state also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people . It does not matter that legislation appropriate to that end " has the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effect . " . . . Not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties , but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order . The policy of protecting contracts against impairment presupposes the maintenance of a government by virtue of which contractual relations are worth while , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good order of society . This principle of harmonizing the constitutional prohibition with the necessary residuum of state power has had progressive recognition in the decisions of this Court . While the charters of private corporations constitute contracts , a grant of exclusive privilege is not to be implied as against the state . Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge , 11 Pet . 420 . And all contracts are subject to the right of eminent domain . West River Bridge v. Dix , 6 How . 507 . The reservation of this necessary authority of the state is deemed to be a part of the contract . In the case last cited , the Court answered the forcible challenge of the state 's power by the following statement of the controlling principle , ? a statement reiterated by this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Brewer , nearly fifty years later , in Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn , 166 U.S. 685 , 692 : " But into all contracts , whether made between states and individuals , or between individuals only , there enter conditions which arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are superinduced by the preexisting and higher authority of the laws of nature , of nations or of the community to which the parties belong ; they are always presumed , and must be presumed , to be known and recognized by all , are binding upon all , and need never , therefore , be carried into express stipulation , for this could add nothing to their force . Every contract is made in subordination to them , and  | must yield to their control , as conditions inherent and paramount , whereever a necessity for their execution shall occur . " The legislature can not " bargain away the public health or the public morals . " Thus , the constitutional provision against the impairment of contracts was held not to be violated by an amendment of the state constitution which put an end to a lottery theretofore authorized by the legislature . Stone v. Mississippi , ioi U. S. 814 , 819 . . . . The lottery was a valid enterprise when established under express state authority , but the legislature in the public interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been applied to the control by the state of the sale of intoxicating liquors . Beer Co. v. Massachusetts , 97 U. S. 25 , 32 , 33 . . . . The states retain adequate power to protect the public health against the maintenance of nuisances despite insistence upon existing contracts . Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park , 97 U. S. 659 , 667 . . . . Legislation to protect the public safety comes within the same category of reserved power ... . This principle has had recent and noteworthy application to the regulation of the use of public highways by common carriers and " contract carriers , " where the assertion of interference with existing contract rights has been without avail . . . . The argument is pressed that in the cases we have cited the obligation of contracts was affected only incidentally . This argument proceeds upon a misconception . The question is not whether the legislative action affects contracts incidentally , or directly or indirectly , but whether the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely to the point , is that the state power may be addressed directly to the prevention of the enforcement of contracts only when these are of a sort which the legislature in its discretion may denounce as being in themselves hostile to public morals , or public health , safety or welfare , or where the prohibition is merely of injurious practices ; that interference with the enforcement of other and valid contracts according to appropriate legal procedure , although the interference is temporary and for a public purpose , is not permissible . This is but to contend that in the latter case the end is not legitimate in the view that it can not be reconciled with a fair interpretation of the constitutional provision . Undoubtedly , whatever is reserved of state power must be consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation of that power . The reserved power can not be construed so as to destroy the limitation , nor is the limitation to be construed to destroy the reserved power in its essential aspects . They must be construed in harmony with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state  | to adopt as its policy the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means to enforce them . But it does not follow that conditions may not arise in which a temporary restraint of enforcement may be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the constitutional provision and thus be found to be within the range of the reserved power of the state to protect the vital interests of the community . It can not be maintained that the constitutional prohibition should be so construed as to prevent limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the enforcement of contracts if made necessary by a great public calamity such as fire , flood , or earthquake . See American Land Co. v. Zeiss , 219 U. S. 47 . The reservation of state power appropriate to such extraordinary conditions may be deemed to be as much a part of all contracts , as is the reservation of state power to protect the public interest in the other situations to which we have referred . And if state power exists to give temporary relief from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical causes such as fire , flood or earthquake , that power can not be said to be nonexistent when the urgent public need demanding such relief is produced by other and economic causes ... . It is manifest from this review of our decisions that there has been a growing appreciation of public needs and of the necessity of finding ground for a rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare . The settlement and consequent contraction of the public domain , the pressure of a constantly increasing density of population , the interrelation of the activities of our people and the complexity of our economic interests , have inevitably led to an increased use of the organization of society in order to protect the very bases of individual opportunity . Where , in earlier days , it was thought that only the concerns of individuals or of classes were involved , and that those of the state itself were touched only remotely , it has later been found that the fundamental interests of the state are directly affected ; and that the question is no longer merely that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the use of reasonable means to safeguard the economic structure upon which the good of all depends . It is no answer to say that this public need was not apprehended a century ago , or to insist that what the provision of the Constitution meant to the vision of that day it must mean to the vision of our time . If by the statement that what the Constitution meant at the time of its adoption it means to-day , it is intended to say that the great clauses of the Constitution must be confined to the interpretation which the framers , with the conditions and outlook of their time , would have placed upon them , the statement carries its own refutation .  | ... The vast body of law which has been developed was unknown to the fathers , but it is believed to have preserved the essential content and the spirit of the Constitution . With a growing recognition of public needs and the relation of individual right to public security , the Court has sought to prevent the perversion of the clause through its use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect their fundamental interests . This development is a growth from the seeds which the fathers planted ... . Applying the criteria established by our decisions we conclude : r . An emergency existed in Minnesota which furnished a proper occasion for the exercise of the reserved power of the state to protect the vital interests of the community ... . 2 . The legislation was addressed to a legitimate end , that is , the legislation was not for the mere advantage of particular individuals but for the protection of a basic interest of society . 3 . In view of the nature of the contracts in question ? mortgages of unquestionable validity ? the relief afforded and justified by the emergency , in order not to contravene the constitutional provision , could only be of a character appropriate to that emergency and could be granted only upon reasonable conditions . 4 . The conditions upon which the period of redemption is extended do not appear to be unreasonable . . . . Their reasonableness is discussed at some length . ... If it be determined , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute and utterly unqualified restriction of the state 's protective power , this legislation is clearly so reasonable as to be within the legislative competency. 5 . The legislation is temporary in operation . It is limited to the exigency which called it forth . While the postponement of the period of redemption from the foreclosure sale is to May 1 , 1935 , that period may be reduced by the order of the court under the statute , in case of a change in circumstances , and the operation of the statute itself could not validly outlast the emergency or be so extended as virtually to destroy the contracts . We are of the opinion that the Minnesota statute as here applied does not violate the contract clause of the federal Constitution . Whether the legislation is wise or unwise as a matter of policy is a question with which we are not concerned . What has been said on that point is also applicable to the contention presented under the due process clause . . . . Nor do we think that the statute denies to the appellant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statute makes can not be said to be an arbitrary one . . . . Mr. Justice Sutherland wrote a dissenting opinion in which Justices Van Devanter , Sutherland , and Butler concurred . Judgment affirmed . V. THE PRESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE POWER MISSISSIPPI v. JOHNSON 4 Wallace 475 ; 18 L. Ed. 437. 1857 . It would have been surprising indeed if , after the decision in the Milligan case ( p. 61 ) , an attempt had not been made to bring before the Supreme Court the question of the constitutionality of the military government established by Congress in the southern states . The attempt was boldly made in the form of a bill of equity which the state of Mississippi sought to file to enjoin President Johnson and the general in command of the military district of Mississippi and Arkansas from enforcing the acts of March 2 and March 25 , 1867 , commonly known as the Reconstruction Acts , upon the ground of their unconstitutionality . There was a good deal of popular criticism of the proceedings , which were looked upon as an effort upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom what they had lost on the battlefield , and the leaders in Congress awaited the decision of the Court with a good deal on anxiety in view of the well-founded rumor that at least five members of the Court regarded the Reconstruction Acts as unconstitutional . The Court avoided a dangerous clash with Congress , however , by deciding that it had no jurisdiction to control the acts of the President . This rule unquestionably embodies sound law and sound common sense . The Court may well have been aided in reaching its conclusions not only by the considerations set forth in the opinion but by the recollection that Chief Justice Marshall had subpoenaed President Jefferson at the time of the trial of Aaron Burr for treason , only to have his subpoena ignored ; and that in any actual conflict between a strong-minded chief executive and the Court the former occupies a highly strategic position which may well enable him to defy decrees of the latter with impunity . This immunity of the President from judicial control , however , is carefully safeguarded in the interests of private rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be recalled that in the case of Marbury v. Madison it was stated by the Court that the Secretary of State could be held subject to mandamus if the case was brought in a court having jurisdiction ; and in Kendall v. United States , 12 Peters 524 ( 1838 ) , the Postmaster General was mandamused to perform a duty imposed upon him by statute . Furthermore , while the President is himself immune from judicial control even with respect to the doing of unlawful acts , no agent or subordinate who attempts to carry out the President 's unlawful orders is protected . The court may not punish the chief executive who issues the order but it may  | punish the underling who obeys the order . In Little v. Barreme , 2 Cranch 170 ( 1804 ) , a naval commander was held liable in damages for injury to property which he inflicted in carrying out the provisions of a proclamation of President Adams ' which the Supreme Court held to be in excess of the President 's power . With the failure to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reconstruction Acts in the case of Mississippi v. Johnson , those interested immediately filed another bill to restrain Secretary of War Stanton and General Grant from enforcing the acts . In this way it was thought that the obstacle of the personal and official immunity of the President could be avoided . The Court , however , held that the issues involved were political rather than judicial in character and that the Court could not undertake to control the exercise by an executive officer of discretionary power . Georgia v. Stanton , 6 Wallace 5o ( 1867 ) . Mr. Chief Justice Chase delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : ... We shall limit our inquiry to the question . . . whether , in any case , the President of the United States may be required , by the process of this Court , to perform a purely ministerial act under a positive law , or may be held amenable , in any case , otherwise than by impeachment for crime . The single point which requires consideration is this ; Can the President be restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged to be unconstitutional ? It is assumed by the counsel for the state of Mississippi , that the President , in the execution of the Reconstruction Acts , is required to perform a mere ministerial duty . In this assumption there is , we think , a confounding of the terms ministerial and executive , which are by no means equivalent in import . A ministerial duty , the performance of which may , in proper cases , be required of the head of a department , by judicial process , is one in respect to which nothing is left to discretion . It is a simple , definite duty , arising under conditions admitted or proved to exist , and imposed by law .... Very different is the duty of the President in the exercise of the power to see that the laws are faithfully executed , and among these laws the acts named in the bill . By the first of these acts he is required to assign generals to command in the several military districts , and to detail sufficient military force to enable such officers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , other duties are imposed on the several commanding generals , and these duties must necessarily be performed under the supervision of the President as commander-in-chief .  | The duty thus imposed on the President is in no just sense ministerial . It is purely executive and political . An attempt on the part of the judicial department of the government to enforce the performance of such duties by the President might be justly characterized , in the language of Chief Justice Marshall , as " an absurd and excessive extravagance . " It is true that in the instance before us the interposition of the Court is not sought to enforce action by the Executive under constitutional legislation , but to restrain such action under legislation alleged to be unconstitutional . But we are unable to perceive that this circumstance takes the case out of the general principles which forbid judicial interference with the exercise of executive discretion . It was admitted in the argument that the application now made to us is without a precedent ; and this is of much weight against it . Had it been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , interpose , by injunction , to prevent the execution of an unconstitutional act of Congress , it can hardly be doubted that applications with that object would have been heretofore addressed to it . Occasions have not been wanting . The constitutionality of the act for the annexation of Texas was vehemently denied . It made important and permanent changes in the relative importance of states and sections , and was by many supposed to be pregnant with disastrous results to large interests in particular states . But no one seems to have thought of an application for an injunction against the execution of the act by the President . And yet it is difficult to perceive upon what principle the application now before us can be allowed and similar applications in that and other cases have been denied . The fact that no such application was ever before made in any case indicates the general judgment of the profession that no such application should be entertained . It will hardly be contended that Congress the courts ? ' can interpose , in any case , to restrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the right to judicial interposition to prevent such an enactment , when the purpose is evident and the execution of that purpose certain , be distinguished , in principle , from the right to such interposition against the execution of such a law by the President ? The Congress is the legislative department of the government ; the President is the executive department . Neither can be restrained in its action by the judicial department ; though the acts of both , when performed , are , in proper cases , subject to its cognizance .  | The impropriety of such interference will be clearly seen upon consideration of its possible consequences . Suppose the bill filed and the injunction prayed for allowed . If the President refuse obedience , it is needless to observe that the Court is without power to enforce its process . If , on the other hand , the President complies with the order of the Court and refuses to execute the acts of Congress , is it not clear that a collision may occur between the executive and legislative departments of the government ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such refusal ? And in that case could this Court interfere , in behalf of the President , thus endangered by compliance with its mandate , and restrain by injunction the Senate of the United States from sitting as a court of impeachment ? Would the strange spectacle be offered to the public world of an attempt by this Court to arrest proceedings in that court ? These questions answer themselves . It is true that a state may file an original bill in this Court . And it may be true , in some cases , that such a bill may be filed against the United States . But we are fully satisfied that this Court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties ; and that no such bill ought to be received by us . It has been suggested that the bill contains a prayer that , if the relief sought can not be had against Andrew Johnson , as President , it may be granted against Andrew Johnson as a citizen of Tennessee . But it is plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress by Andrew Johnson , is relief against its execution by the President . A bill praying an injunction against the execution of an act of Congress by the incumbent of the presidential office can not be received , whether it describes him as President or as a citizen of a state . The motion for leave to file the bill is , therefore , denied . 295 U. S. 602 ; 79 L. Ed. 1611 ; 55 Sup . Ct . 869. 1935 . While the Constitution indicates how federal executive officers shall be appointed , it is entirely silent as to their removal save by impeachment , a clumsy process applicable only to cases of grave misconduct . May the President remove his subordinates at will ? Or may Congress deny or limit his power to do so ? These are questions of great practical importance . Congresses and Presidents , from 1789 on , have guessed at the answers , and those guesses have often conflicted . The Supreme Court does not answer  | constitutional questions , however important , unless they squarely arise in actual litigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up which clearly involved the question of the President 's power of removal . It arose then only because the late Mr. Myers saw fit to sue the government in the Court of Claims for his salary . See Myers v. United States , 272 U. S. 52 ( 1926 ) . The facts in the case are as follows : In 1917 President Wilson appointed Myers to a first-class postmastership at Portland , Oregon , for a term of four years . He removed him from office in 1920 . A statute of 1876 , still in force , provided that " postmasters of the first , second , and third classes shall be appointed and may be removed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and shall hold their offices for four years unless sooner removed or suspended according to law . " The removal of Myers was not referred to the Senate for its consent . The President did not nominate a successor to Myers but made a recess appointment which the Senate never confirmed . This fact is important because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senatorial consent to Myers ' removal . He protested against his removal , refrained from accepting other remunerative employment , and when the four-year period for which he had been appointed expired he sued in the Court of Claims for the salary for about eighteen months of which his removal had deprived him . This amounted to $8,838.72 . His position was perfectly clear ; that is , his removal by the President without the consent of the Senate violated the act of 1876 . The case was first argued before the Supreme Court in December , 1924 . Recognizing its far-reaching importance the Court ordered a reargument in the spring of 1925 and invited Senator Pepper of Pennsylvania to file a brief as amicus curiae which would present the interests of the Senate in the controversy . The Court divided six-to-three in its decision . The majority opinion written by Chief Justice Taft occupies seventy-one pages in the official reports , while Justices McReynolds and Brandeis required sixty-one and fifty-six pages respectively to express their disagreement . These opinions , together with the briefs of counsel and the reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document ( Sen. Doc . 174 , 69th Cong . 2d Sess . ) . This is the first case in which the government through the Department of Justice has appeared in the Supreme Court to attack the constitutionality of an act of Cngress . The decision of the Court that Congress may not restrict the President 's power to remove officers appointed by him with senatorial consent is supported in Chief Justice Taft 's long opinion upon two main grounds . One of these is historical , i. e. , that the long-established practice of the government has been in accord with the Court 's decision ; the other is constitutional or inferential , i. e. , that the removal power is a part of the President 's broad grant of executive authority which under the doctrine of the separation of powers may not be restricted by Congress . The historical argument is built chiefly upon what the Chief Justice calls the " decision of 1789 . " This " decision " took the form of a vote or a series of votes in the  | First Congress upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally voted in the House that such a department be created under a secretary appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the . Senate and removable by the President . After debate this was amended in two ways . First , a clause was added clearly implying unrestricted removal power in the President alone by alluding to vacancies created in that way . Second , the clause granting the power of removal to the President was stricken out , on the ground that such a grant implied that without it the President would not have the power . The Senate concurred in these actions . By this " decision , " declares the Chief Justice , Congress recognized and established the exclusive and untrammeled power of the President to remove executive officers whom he appoints . There follows a mass of historical material , including the opinions of statesmen , tending to show that this has been the accepted theory of the removal power throughout our history , save in one or two instances when " heated political difference of opinion between the then President and the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in passage of the Tenure of Office Act of 1867 . These exceptions , however , are deemed to be outweighed by the force of almost continuous governmental practice . The constitutional argument advanced by the Chief Justice is much more important than the historical evidence just reviewed . It is clear that such power of removal as the President enjoys is an implied power . Implied from what ? Implied from the general grant of executive power in Article II , and the further injunction in the same article that the President " shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed . " By placing it on this broad ground the Court avoids the difficulties which would result from implying the removal power solely from the President 's power of appointment , although it is admitted that the power of appointing provides a supplementary and supporting basis for implying the power of removal . It is clear that this argument rests upon the conviction which Mr. Taft 's presidential experience undoubtedly confirmed and emphasized , that the President can not effectively and responsibly administer his office unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vital importance of the removal power to the independence of the President in the performance of his constitutional duties is emphasized at great length . By thus holding that the removal power is a necessary and inherent part of the broad executive power granted by the Constitution to the President it naturally follows that any attempt upon the part of Congress to limit or interfere with the removal power is a violation of the doctrine of the separation of powers . The dissenting opinions written by Justices Brandeis , McReynolds , and Holmes very persuasively attack both the historical and the constitutional arguments advanced by the Chief Justice . The decision in the Myers case was rightly viewed as of very great importance , although the immediate point involved , the removal of a postmaster , was of no broad interest . What did arouse much controversy and rather general concern was the sweeping dictum of the Chief Justice that  | the President 's unrestricted removal power extended not merely to his immediate executive subordinates but also to the members of the great independent commissions , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably also to the ComptrollerGeneral . These officers are appointed under the provisions of statutes conferring upon them duties with respect to which a high degree of independence and freedom from political control is deemed desirable . Congress has carefully specified the causes for which they may be removed with the intention that they be free from removals of a " political " nature . If the Taft theory with respect to them were to prevail , however , their independence from presidential control would be broken down . It was to be expected , therefore , that sooner or later the question whether the President 's unlimited removal power did actually extend to these independent commissions and officers would be presented to the Court on facts requiring a specific answer . This was done in the Rathbun case . It is interesting to note that in overruling Chief Justice Taft 's dictum and holding that the President 's removal power extends only to executive officers the Court invokes the same doctrine of the separation of powers which lies at the basis of the Myers decision . The separation of powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to remove executive officers appointed by him , but it also prevents him from removing officers who are not essentially executive and whose removal has been restricted by Congress . Mr. Justice Sutherland delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : Plaintiff brought suit in the Court of Claims against the United States to recover a sum of money alleged to be due the deceased for salary as a federal trade commissioner from October 8 , 1933 , when the President undertook to remove him from office , to the time of his death on February 14 , 1934 . The court below has certified to this Court two questions ... in respect of the power of the President to make the removal . The material facts which give rise to the question are as follows : William E. Humphrey , the decedent , on December 1o , 1931 , was nominated by President Hoover to succeed himself as a member of the Federal Trade Commission and was confirmed by the United States Senate . He was duly commissioned for a term of seven years expiring September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath of office , entered upon his duties . On July 25 , 1933 , President Roosevelt addressed a letter to the commissioner asking for his resignation , on the ground " that the aims and purposes of the Administration with respect to the work of the commission can be carried out most effectively with personnel of my own selection , " but disclaiming any reflection upon the commissioner personally or upon his services . The commissioner replied , asking time to  | consult his friends . After some further correspondence upon the subject , the President , on August 31 , 1933 , wrote the commissioner expressing the hope that the resignation would be forthcoming and saying : " You will , I know , realize that your mind and my mind do not go along together on either the policies or the administering of the Federal Trade Commission , and , frankly , I think it is best for the people of this country that I should have a full confidence . " The commissioner declined to resign , and on October 7 , 1933 , the President wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission . " Humphrey never acquiesced in this action , but continued thereafter to insist that he was still a member of the commission , entitled to perform its duties and receive the compensation provided by law at the rate of $io , 000 per annum . Upon these and other facts set forth in the certificate which we deem it unnecessary to recite , the following questions are certified : " 1 . Do the provisions of ? 1 of the Federal Trade Commission Act , stating that any commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency , neglect of duty or malfeasance in office , ' restrict or limit the power of the President to remove a commissioner except upon one or more of the causes named ? " If the foregoing question is answered in the affirmative , then " 2 . If the power of the President to remove a commissioner is restricted or limited as shown by the foregoing interrogatory and the answer made thereto , is such a restriction or limitation valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Trade Commission Act . . . creates a commission of five members to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , and Section 1 provides : " Not more than three of the commissioners shall be members of the same political party . The first commissioners appointed shall continue in office for terms of three , four , five , six and seven years , respectively , from the date of the taking effect of this act , the term of each to be designated by the President , but their successors shall be appointed for terms of seven years , except that any person chosen to fill a vacancy shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the commissioner whom he shall succeed . The commission shall choose a chairman from its own membership . No commissioner shall engage in any other business , vocation , or employment . Any commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency , neglect of duty , or malfeasance in office . " Section 5 of the act in part provides :  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawful . " The commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent persons , partnerships or corporations , except banks and common carriers subject to the acts to regulate commerce , from using unfair methods of competition in commerce . " In exercising this power the commission must issue a complaint stating its charges and giving notice of hearing upon a day to be fixed . A person , partnership or corporation proceeded against is given the right to appear at the time and place fixed and show cause why an order to cease and desist should not be issued . There is provision for intervention by others interested . If the commission finds the method of competition is one prohibited by the act it is directed to make a report in writing stating its findings as to the facts , and to issue and cause to be served a cease and desist order . If the order is disobeyed the commission may apply to the appropriate circuit court of appeals for its enforcement . This party subject to the order may seek and obtain a review in the circuit court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 6 , among other things , gives the commission wide powers of investigation in respect of certain corporations subject to the act , and in respect of other matters , upon which it must report to Congress with recommendations . Many such investigations have been made , and some have served as the basis of congressional legislation . Section 7 provides : " That in any suit in equity brought by or under the direction of the Attorney General , as provided in the anti-trust acts , the court may , upon the conclusion of the testimony therein if it shall be then of opinion that the complainant is entitled to relief , refer said suit to the commission , as a master in chancery , to ascertain and report an appropriate form of decree therein . The commission shall proceed upon such notice to the parties and under such rules of procedure as the court may prescribe and upon the coming in of such report such exceptions may be filed and such proceedings had in relation thereto as upon the report of a master in other equity causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whole or in part , and enter such decree as the nature of the case may in its judgment require . " I. The question first to be considered is whether , by the provisions of paragraph r of the Federal Trade Commission Act already quoted , the President 's power is limited to removal for the specific causes enumerated therein . ... The statute fixes a term of office in accordance with many precedents . The first commissioners appointed are to continue in office  | for terms of three , four , five , six and seven years , respectively ; and their successors are to be appointed for terms of seven years ? any commissioner being subject to removal by the President for inefficiency , neglect of duty or malfeasance in office . The words of the act are definite and unambiguous . The government says the phrase " continue in office " is of no legal significance , and moreover , applies only to the first commissioners . We think it has significance . It may be that , literally , its application is restricted as suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view contrary to that of the government as to the meaning of the entire requirement in respect of tenure ; for it is not easy to suppose that Congress intended to secure the first commissioners against removal except for the causes specified and deny like security to their successors . Putting this phrase aside , however , the fixing of a definite term subject to removal for cause , unless there be some countervailing provision or circumstance indicating the contrary , which here we are unable to find , is enough to establish the legislative intent that the term is not to be curtailed in the absence of such cause . But if the intention of Congress that no removal should be made during the specified term except for one or more of the enumerated causes were not clear it would be made clear by a consideration of the character of the commission and the legislative history which accompanied and preceded the passage of the act . The commission is to be nonpartisan ; and it must , from the very nature of its duties , act with entire impartiality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the law . Its duties are neither political nor executive , but predominantly quasi-legislative . Like the Interstate Commerce Commission , its members are called upon to exercise the trained judgment of a body of experts " appointed by law and enforced by experience . " .. . The legislative reports in both houses of Congress clearly reflect the view that a fixed term was necessary to the effective and fair administration of the law ... . The debates in both houses demonstrate that the prevailing view was that the commission was not to be " subject to anybody in the government but only to the people of the United States , " free from " political domination or control , " or the " probability or possibility of such a thing , " to be " separate and apart from any existing department of the government ? not subject to the orders of the President . " . . . Thus the language of the act , the legislative reports and the general purposes of the legislation as reflected by the debates , all combine to demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | shall gain experience by length of service ? a body which shall be independent of executive authority , except in its selection , and free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other official or any department of the government . To the accomplishment of these purposes it is clear that Congress was of opinion that length and certainty of tenure would vitally contribute . And to hold that , nevertheless , the members of the commission continue in office at the mere will of the President , might be to thwart , in large measure , the very ends which Congress sought to realize by definitely fixing the term of office . We conclude that the intent of the act is to limit the executive power of removal to the causes enumerated , the existence of none of which is claimed here ; and we pass to the second question . Second . To support its contention that the removal provision of ? 1 , as we have just construed it , is an unconstitutional interference with the executive powers of the President , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 272 U. S. 52 . . . . Nevertheless , the narrow point actually decided was only that the President had power to remove a postmaster of the first class , without the advice and consent of the Senate , as required by act of Congress . In the course of the opinion of the Court , expressions occur which tend to sustain the government 's contention , but these are beyond the point involved , and therefore , do not come within the rule of stare decisis . In so far as they are out of harmony with the views here set forth , these expressions are disapproved ... . The office of a postmaster is so essentially unlike the office now involved that the decision in the Myers case can not be accepted as controlling our decision here . A postmaster is an executive officer re'stricted to the performance of executive functions . He is charged with no duty at all related to either the legislative or judicial power . The actual decision in the Myers case finds support in the theory that such an officer is merely one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to the exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the chief executive , whose subordinate and aid he is . Putting aside dicta , which may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but which are not controlling , the necessary reach of the decision goes far enough to include all purely executive officers . It goes no farther ? much less does it include an officer who occupies no place in the executive department and who exercises no part of the executive power vested by the Constitution in the President . The Federal Trade Commission is an administrative body created by Congress to carry into effect legislative policies embodied in the  | statute , in accordance with the legislative standard therein prescribed , and to perform other specified duties as a legislative or as a judicial aid . Such a body can not in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive . Its duties are performed without executive leave and , in the contemplation of the statute , must be free from executive control . In administrating the provisions of the statute in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say in filling in and administering the details embodied by the general standard ? the commission acts in part quasi-legislatively and in part quasi-judicially . In making investigations and reports thereon for the information of Congress in aid of the legislative power it acts as a legislative agency . Under 7 , which authorizes the commission to act as a master in chancery under rules prescribed by the court , it acts as an agency of the judiciary . To the extent that it exercises any executive function ? as distinguished from executive power in the constitutional sense ? it does so in the discharge and effectuation of its quasi-legislative or quasijudicial powers , or as an agency of the legislative or judicial departments of the government . If Congress is without authority to prescribe causes for removal of members of the Trade Commission and limit executive power of removal accordingly , that power at once becomes practically all inclusive in respect of civil officers , with the exception of the judiciary provided for by the Constitution . The Solicitor General at the bar , apparently recognizing this to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect of the removability of members of the Federal Trade Commission necessitated a like view in respect of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Court of Claims . We are thus confronted with the serious question whether not only the members of these quasilegislative and quasi-judicial bodies , but the judges of the legislative Court of Claims , exercising judicial power . . . continue in office only at the pleasure of the President . We think it plain under the Constitution that illimitable power of removal is not possessed by the President in respect of officers of the character of those just named . The authority of Congress , in creating quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial agencies , to require them to act in discharge of their duties independently of executive control , can not well be doubted ; and that authority includes , as an appropriate incident , power to fix the period during which they shall continue , and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime . For it is quite evident that one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter 's will .  | The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence , direct or indirect , of either of the others , has often been stressed and is hardly open to serious question . So much is implied in the very fact of the separation of the powers of these departments by the Constitution , and in the rule which recognizes their essential coequality . The sound application of a principle that makes one master in his own house precludes him from imposing his control in the house of another who is master there ... . The power of removal here claimed for the President falls within this principle , since its coercive influence threatens the independence of a commission , which is not only wholly disconnected from the executive department , but which , as already fully appears , was created by Congress as a means of carrying into operation legislative and judicial powers , and as an agency of the legislative and judicial departments . In the light of the question now under consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myers case , and find nothing in them to justify a conclusion contrary to that which we have reached ... . The result of what we now have said is this : Whether the power of the President to remove an officer shall prevail over the authority of Congress to condition the power by fixing a definite term and precluding a removal except for cause will depend upon the character of the office . The Myers decision , affirming the power of the President alone to make the removal , is confined to purely executive officers . And as to officers of the kind here under consideration , we hold that no removal can be made during the prescribed term for which the officer is appointed , except for one or more of the causes named in the applicable statute . To the extent that , between the decision in the Myers case , which sustains the unrestrictable power of the President to remove purely executive officers and our present decision that such power does not extend to an office such as that here involved there shall remain a field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for future consideration and determination as they arise . In accordance with the foregoing the questions submitted are answered . Question No. 1 , Yes . Question No. 2 , Yes .  | MARBURY v. MADISON 1 Cranch 137 ; 2 L. Ed. 6o. 1803 . Although the election in the autumn of 1800 brought to the Federalist party a defeat which they never retrieved , President Adams and his Federalist associates did not retire from office until March , 18o1 . While the Federalists had been for some time considering plans to reform the federal courts by remodeling the Judiciary Act of 1789 , yet now in the eleventh hour they boldly set themselves to the task with renewed energy in order to make sure that the needed changes should be made by themselves rather than by the triumphant incoming Republicans and in order , undoubtedly , to insure a fortress for Federalist principles not easily to be broken down . Accordingly they passed the Judiciary Act of February 13 , 18oi , which relieved the Supreme Court justices of circuit court may , increased the nu-be-of circuit court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial positions . President Adams proceeded during the last sixteen days of his administration to fill these newly created vacancies , sixty-seven in all , with loyal Federalists , and the task of signing their commissions occupied him until well into the night before the inauguration of Jefferson . The federal courts had already incurred the bitter animosity of the Jeffersonian party , largely because of the vigor with which they had enforced the obnoxious Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 ; and the Republicans were enraged beyond measure at what they deemed the effrontery of the Federalists in enacting the statute just mentioned . The judiciary was caustically referred to by Randolph as a " hospital for decayed politicians " while Jefferson wrote to a friend , " The Federalists have retired into the judiciary as a stronghold . . . and from that battery all the works of republ caiiish are to be beaten down and erased . " One of the first Republican efforts , therefore , was to repeal the judiciary Act of 18or , and after a long and acrimonious debate this was accomplished , March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court judges to circuit court duty and abolished the new judgeships which had been created . The Federalists in Congress had bitterly assailed the repealing statute as unconstitutional , and Marshall himself always adhered to that view and probably would have held the law void if it had come before him in his judicial capacity . In order to prevent this , however , the repealing act had so altered the sessions of the Supreme Court that it did not convene again for fourteen months , by which time acquiescence in the act by the judges affected made an attack upon its validity impracticable .  | However , when the Court convened in February , 1803 , the case of Marbury v. Madison was on the docket . Marbury was one of those whom President Adams had appointed to a justiceship of the peace in the District of Columbia under the Judiciary Act of 1801 , and whose commission , signed and sealed on March 3 , had not been delivered when Jefferson , with Madison as his Secretary of State , had taken office on March 4 . Needless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen , and Marbury filed a suit asking the Supreme Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to compel Madison to deliver the commission . The right to issue such a writ had been conferred upon the Court by a provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and jurisdiction thereunder had been exercised by the Court twice before Marshall 's accession to the bench . When the case came on for argument it assumed very largely the aspect of a quarrel between the President and the judiciary . Marbury 's own interest in it was small , since it wasfair y clear that Jefferson had no intention of giving him his commission even if the Court ordered it to be given The Republicans seem to have expected that the Court would issue the mandamus asked for and there were open threats that Marshall would be impeached if that occurred . The decision in Marbury v. Madison was therefore received with some astonishment , for while Marshall held that the case was one in which a writ of mandamus afforded a proper remedy and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission , he went on to hold that the section of the Judiciary Act of 1789 purporting to add to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court the power to issue such a writ exceeded the power of Congress under the Constitution . This being the case he announced that it became the duty of the Court to declare the section in question void . Thus was established the great doctrine of judicial review , or the power of the Supreme Court to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional . It is worth noting that this important doctrine was by no means an innovation . Most of the arguments which Marshall uses in his famous opinion hadbeen presented again andagain in the debates in Congress on the Repeal Act of 18oz . Moreover , the power of invalidating legislation had been exercised by the lower federal courts without opposition , and there seems to be evidence that public opinion looked upon the practice as one of the normal incidents of judicial power The decision itself seems not to have been criticized at the moment because of its enunciation of this important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer was subject to control by mandamus if issued by a court having jurisdiction . It was only as the doctrine of judicial review came eventually to appear to the Republicans as a menace to their party program that they opposed it . The case of Marbury v. Madison has a certain strategic significance which should not be left out of account . The next case in which an act  | of Congress was invalidated by the Supreme Court was the famous Dred Scott case decided in 1857 . By that time nearly seventy years had elapsed from the time of the formation of our constitutional system , and the Court was composed of men holding far less strongly nationalistic views than those of Marshall and his associates . If the power of judicial review had not been exercised and the doctrine established in the case of Marbury v. Madison , one may well conjecture whether our constitutional development would have been the same . The portion of Marshall 's opinion here printed deals only with the question of the power of the courts to invalidate an act of Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , by the act establishing the judicial courts of the United States , to issue writs of mandamus to public officers , appears not to be warranted by the Constitution ; and it becomes necessary to inquire whether a jurisdiction so conferred can be exercised . The question whether an act repugnant to the Constitution can become the law of the land , is a question deeply interesting to the United States ; but , happily , not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest . It seems only necessary to recognize certain principles , supposed to have been long and well established to decide it . That the people have an original right to establish , for their future government , such principles as , in their opinion , shall most conduce to their own happiness , is the basis on which the whole American fabric has been erected . The exercise of this original right is a very great exertion ; nor can it nor ought it to be frequently repeated . The principles , therefore , so established , are deemed fundamental . And as the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , they are designed to be permanent . This original and supreme will organizes the government , and assigns to different departments their respective powers . It may either stop here , or establish certain limits not to be transcended by those departments . The government of the United States is of the latter description . The owers of the legislature are defined and limited ; and that those limits may not be mistaken , or forgotten , the Constitution is written . To what purpose are powers limited , and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing , if these limits may , at any time , be passed by those intended to be restrained ? The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished , if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are irpposed , and if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation . It is a proposition  | too plain to bm .. contested that the Constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it ; or , that the legtsrature may alter the Constitution by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle ground . The Constitution is either a superior paramount law , unchangeable by ordinary means , or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts , and , like other acts , is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it . If the former part of the alternative be true , then a legislative act contrary to the Constitution is not law ; if the latter part be true , then written constitutions are absurd attempts , on the part of the people , to L limit a power in its own nature illimitable . Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation , and , consequently , the theory of every such government must be , that an act of the legislature , repugnant to the constitution , is void . This theory is essentially attached to a written constitution , and is consequently to be considered , by this Court , as one of the fundamental principles of our society . It is not , therefore , to be lost sight of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legislature , repugnant to the Constitution , is void , does it , notwithstanding its invalidity , bind the courts , and oblige them to give it effect ? Or , in other words , though it be not law , does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law ? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory ; and would seem , at first view , an absurdity too gross to be insisted on . It shall , however , receive a more attentive consideration . r It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is . Those who apply the rule to particular cases , must of necessity expound and interpret that rule . If two laws conflict with each other , the courts must decide on the operation of L each . So if a law be in opposition to the Constitution ; if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case , so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disregarding the law , the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case . This is of the very essence of judicial duty . If , then , the courts are to regard the Constitution , and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature , the Constitution , and not such ordinary act , must govern the case to which they both apply .  | Those , then , who controvert the principle that the Constitution is to be considered , in court , as a paramount law , are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the Constitution , and see only the law . This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions . It would declare that an act which , according to the principles and theory of our government , is entirely void , is yet , in practice , completely obligatory . It would declare that if the legislature shall do what is expressly forbidden , such act , notwithstanding the express prohibition , is in reality effectual . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real omnipotence , with the same breath which professes-to - restrict their powers within narrow limits . It is prescribing limits , and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure . That it thus reduces to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement on political institutions , a written constitution , would of itself be sufficient , in America , where written constitutions have been viewed with so much reverence , for rejecting the construction . But the peculiar expressions of the Constitution of the United States furnish additional arguments in favor of its rejection . The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution . Could it be the intention of those who gave this power , to say that in using it the Constitution should not be looked into ? That a case arising under the Constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it arises ? This is too extravagant to be maintained . In some cases , then , the Constitution must be looked into by the judges . And if they can open it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read or to obey ? There are many other parts of the Constitution which serve to illustrate this subject . It is declared that " no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State . " Suppose a duty on the export of cotton , of tobacco , or of flour ; and a suit instituted to recover it . Ought judgment to be rendered in such a case ? ought the judges to close their eyes on the Constitution , and only see the law ? The Constitution declares " that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed . " If , however , such a bill should be passed , and a person should be prosecuted under it , must the court condemn to death those victims whom the Constitution endeavors to preserve ?  | " No person , " says the Constitution , " shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court . " Here the language of the Constitution is addressed especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rule of evidence not to be departed from . If the legislature should change that rule , and declare one witness , or a confession out of court , sufficient for conviction , must the constitutional principle yield to the legislative act ? From these , and many other selections which might be made , it is apparent that the framers of the Const tut Oncontemplated that instrument as a rule fox the government of courts , as well as of the legisJ.ature . Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it ? This oath certainly applies in an especial manner to their conduct in their official character . How immoral to impose it on them , if they were to be used as the instruments , and the knowing instruments , for violating what they swear to support ! The oath of office , too , imposed by the legislature , is completely demonstrative of the legislative opinion on this subject . It is in these words : " I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich ; and c that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties incumbent on me as ? , according to the best of my abilities and understanding , ' agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States . " Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the Constitution of the United States , if that Constitution forms no rule for his government ? if it is closed upon him , and can not be inspected by him ? If such be the real state of things , this is worse than solemn mockery . To prescribe , or to take this oath , becomes equally a crime . It is also not entirely unworthy of observation , that in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land , the Constitution itself is first mentioned ; and not the laws of the United States generally , but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the Constitution , have that rank . Thus , the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law repugnant to the Constitution is void ; and that courts , as well as other departments , are bound by that instrument . The rule must be discharged .  | 12 Sergeant and Rawle ( Pennsylvania Supreme Court ) 330. 1825 . The power of the Supreme Court to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional has so long been an integral part of our constitutional system , and Marshall 's reasoning in the case of Marbury v. Madison , supra , is so impressive , that it is easy to lose sight of the fact that a most cogent argument may be made against the establishment of the power , and that had the Supreme Court never enjoyed it no very calamitous results would have ensued . Jefferson , Marshall 's most bitter personal and political adversary , never admitted the paramount authority of the Supreme Court to determine the validity of an act of Congress , but held that each of the three departments of the national government being equal and separate was equally empowered " to decide on the validity of an act according to its own judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This view was shared by many other thoughtful men of the day . In the exercise of its power of judicial review the Court will not pass upon what it terms " political questions " ( see Luther v. Borden , p. 187 ) , questions the final determination of which has been confided by the Constitution to the discretion of the political departments , that is , the legislature or the executive . According to the view of Jefferson and his followers all questions involving the constitutionality of acts of Congress which might come before the Court would be " political questions . " The statute might conflict with the Constitution , but that fact would not of itself endow the Court with any power to invalidate it ; rather it would be the duty of the Court to enforce the statute without questioning its validity . That such a system would not have been followed by any strikingly disastrous results may be inferred from the fact that in most of the constitutional governments of the world the courts do not enjoy the power of judicial review ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been held unconstitutional ( through the 1939 term of the Court ) , of which only a very few involved problems of any vital or lasting importance ; and that even one of the members of the Supreme Court itself , Mr. Justice Holmes , has declared , " The United States would not come to an end if we lost our power to declare an act of Congress void . " It may be suggested by way of caution , however , that the power to declare an act of Congress invalid is a very much less important power of the Supreme Court than the power to pass upon the validity of state legislation . This last authority may well be regarded as vital to the preservation of our federal system by providing a necessary method of preventing the state governments from encroaching upon the domain of federal authority or impairing the federal rights and immunities of the individual . Perhaps the most lucid and carefully reasoned answer to Marshall 's argument in Marbury v. Madison is to be found in the following excerpt from  | a dissenting opinion written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1825 . The case itself is of no intrinsic interest or importance , but it raised the question of the power of the state supreme court to invalidate a statute , and Judge Gibson took occasion to express his views upon this point although a majority of his brethren did not agree with him . It is interesting to note that twenty years later a lawyer in pleading his case cited to the court this opinion , whereupon Judge Gibson replied to the lawyer : " I have changed that opinion , for two reasons . The late convention which had framed the Pennsylvania constitution of 1838 , by their silence , sanctioned the pretensions of the courts to deal freely with the acts of the legislature ; and from experience of the necessity of the case " ( Norris v. Clymer , 2 Pa . St. 277 , 281 , 1845 ) . ... I am aware , that a right to declare all unconstitutional acts void , without distinction as to either constitution , is generally held as a professional dogma ; but , I apprehend , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that I once embraced the same doctrine , but without examination , and I shall therefore state the arguments that impelled me to abandon it , with great respect for those by whom it is still maintained . But I may premise , that it is not a little remarkable , that although the right in question has all along been claimed by the judiciary , no judge has ventured to discuss it , except Chief Justice Marshall ( in Marbury v. Madison , i Cranch , 176 ) , and if the argument of a jurist so distinguished for the strength of his ratiocinative powers be found inconclusive , it may fairly be set down to the weakness of the position which he attempts to defend ... . The Constitution and the right of the legislature to pass the act , may be in collision . But is that a legitimate subject for judicial determination ? If it be , the judiciary must be a peculiar organ , to revise the proceedings of the legislature , and to correct its mistakes ; and in what part of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter in the opposite direction , what would be thought of an act of assembly in which it should be declared that the Supreme Court had , in a particular case , put a wrong construction on the Constitution of the United States , and that the judgment should therefore be reversed ? It would doubtless be thought a usurpation of judicial power . But it is by no means clear , that to declare a law void which has been enacted according to the forms prescribed in the Constitution , is not a usurpation of legislative power . It is an act of sovereignty ; and sovereignty and legislative power are said by Sir William Blackstone to be convertible terms . It is the business of the judiciary to interpret the laws , not scan the authority of the lawgiver ; and without the latter , it can not take cognizance of a collision between a law and the Consti'tu- tion . So that to affirm that the judiciary has a right to judge of the existence of such collision , is to take for granted the very thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument may be made in this way , I am not disposed to deny ; for no conclusions are so strong as those that are drawn from the petitio principii . But it has been said to be emphatically the business of the judiciary , to ascertain and pronounce what the law is ; and that this necessarily involves a consideration of the Constitution . It does so : but how far ? If the judiciary will inquire into anything besides the form of enactment , where shall it stop ? There must be some point of limitation to such an inquiry ; for no one will pretend that a judge would be justifiable in calling for the election returns , or scrutinizing the qualifications of those who composed the legislature ... . Everyone knows how seldom men think exactly alike on ordinary subjects ; and a government constructed on the principle of assent by all its parts , would be inadequate to the most simple operations . The notion of a complication of counter checks has been carried to an extent in theory , of which the framers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its elementary parts , and distributed to the appropriate branches , all things incident to the exercise of its powers were committed to each branch exclusively . The negative which each part of the legislature may exercise , in regard to the acts of the other , was thought sufficient to prevent material infractions of the restraints which were put on the power of the whole ; for , had it been intended to interpose the judiciary as an additional barrier , the matter would surely not have been left in doubt . The judges would not have been left to stand on the insecure and ever shifting ground of public opinion as to constructive powers ; they would have been placed on the impregnable ground of an express grant ... . But the judges are sworn to support the Constitution , and are they not bound by it as the law of the land ? In some respects they are . In the very few cases in which the judiciary , and not the legislature , is the immediate organ to execute its provisions , they are bound by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary . In such cases , the Constitution is a rule to the courts . But what I have in view in this inquiry , is the supposed right of the judiciary to interfere , in cases where the Constitution is to be carried into effect through the instrumentality of the legislature , and where that organ must necessarily first decide on the constitutionality of its own act . The oath to support the Constitution is not peculiar to the judges , but is taken indiscriminately by every officer of the government , and is designed rather as a test of the political principles of the man , than to bind the officer in the discharge of his  | duty : otherwise it were difficult to determine what operation it is to have in the case of a recorder of deeds , for instance , who , in the execu() tion of his office , has nothing to do with the Constitution . But granting it to relate to the official conduct of the judge , as well as every other officer , and not to his political principles , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only as far as that may be involved in his official duty ; and , consequently , if his official duty does not comprehend an inquiry into the authority of the legislature , neither does his oath . It is worthy of remark here , that the foundation of every argument in favor of the right of the judiciary , is found at last to be an assumption of the whole ground in dispute . Granting that the object of the oath is to secure a support of the Constitution in the discharge of official duty , its terms may be satisfied by restraining it to official duty in the exercise of the ordinary judicial powers . Thus , the Constitution may furnish a rule of construction , where a particular interpretation of a law would conflict with some constitutional principle ; and such interpretation , where it may , is always to be avoided . But the oath was more probably designed to secure the powers of each of the different branches from being usurped by any of the rest : for instance , to prevent the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Supreme Court from attempting to control the legislature ; and , in this view , the oath furnishes an argument equally plausible against the right of the judiciary . But if it require a support of the Constitution in anything beside official duty , it is in fact an oath of allegiance to a particular form of government ; and , considered as such , it is not easy to see why it should not be taken by the citizens at large , as well as by the officers of the government . It has never been thought that an officer is under greater restraint as to measures which have for their avowed end a total change of the Constitution , than a citizen who has taken no oath at all . The official oath , then , relates only to the official conduct of the officer , and does not prove that he ought to stray from the path of his ordinary business to search for violations of duty in the business of others ; nor does it , as supposed , define the powers of the officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in violation of the Constitution , when they give effect to an unconstitutional law ? Not if the law has been passed according to the forms established in the Constitution . The fallacy of the question is , in supposing that the judiciary adopts the acts of the legislature as its own ; whereas the enactment of a law and the interpretation of it are not concurrent acts , and as the judiciary is not required to concur in the enactment , neither is it in the breach of the Constitution which may be the consequence of the enactment . The fault is imputable to the legislature , and on it the responsibility exclu- sively rests . In this respect , the judges are in the predicament of jurors who are bound to serve in capital cases , although unable , under any circumstances , to reconcile it to their duty to deprive a human being of life . To one of these , who applied to be discharged from the panel , I once heard it remarked , by an eminent and humane judge : " You do not deprive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital crime ; you but pronounce his case to be within the law , and it is therefore those who declare the law , and not you , who deprive him of life . " LUTHER v. BORDEN 7 Howard 1 ; 12 L. Ed. 581. 1849 . Not all questions which arise under the Constitution of the United States are questions which the Supreme Court will undertake to answer . Very early in the exercise of its power of judicial review the Court pointed out that certain powers are vested in the legislative or executive departments of the government to be exercised in a purely discretionary manner , and that whether they have been constitutionally exercised or not is a " political question " which the Court will not undertake to decide . One of the early and very striking instances of this type of question was that which was raised in the famous case of Luther v. Borden . This case arose out of the following facts : The original constitution of Rhode Island , which was merely the colonial charter with a few minor adaptations , provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the right to vote continued to be thus limited long after universal manhood suffrage had been rather generally adopted throughout the country . Many efforts were made to have the constitution amended so as to put the franchise upon a more democratic basis , but all such attempts were defeated by the relatively small group of legal voters . In 1841 the popular feeling regarding the situation ran even higher than before ; mass meetings were held throughout the state , and without any semblance of constitutional sanction the citizens were directed to choose by universal manhood suffrage delegates to a constitutional convention . The convention thus formed duly met and drafted a new state constitution which established adult manhood suffrage and made many other changes . A popular referendum was conducted in which all the adult male citizens of the state were permitted to vote , and the new constitution was approved by a majority of the votes cast . The leader of the whole movement was a young lawyer , Thomas W. Dorr , who was elected governor under the new constitution and immediately attempted to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course did not recognize the validity of any of these acts . It called out the state militia and declared martial law and finally appealed to President Tyler to send  | federal troops to aid in putting down the insurrection . The President took steps to comply with this request and the " Dorr Rebellion " collapsed . Dorr himself was captured , tried for treason , and finally sentenced to life imprisonment . He was later pardoned . He naturally had managed to arouse a good deal of sympathy for his cause outside the state , particularly amongst the Democrats , and it was felt that it would be desirable to present to the Supreme Court of the United States the question of the legality of the new constitution and the acts done under it . This was tried first by Dorr himself by attempting to sue out a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court , but that tribunal dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction , see Ex parte Dorr , 3 Howard 103 ( 1845 ) . Upon the assumption that the same issue could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relatively unimportant in itself , was pushed through to the Supreme Court . Luther had been a supporter of the Dorr movement , and in an effort to arrest him , Borden and others who were enrolled as members of the militia under the charter government broke into Luther 's house . This act they justified upon the ground that martial law had been declared and that they were acting under the orders of their superior officers . Luther , however , sued Borden for trespass , claiming that the act of the legislature establishing martial law was void inasmuch as the Dorr government , elected by the people of the state , was the lawful government . ( It should be noted that in January , 1842 , the charter government had called a constitutional convention and drafted a new constitution which was ratified by the people in due form and went into effect in 1843 . Thus the Dorr movement did not entirely fail in its purposes . ) By the facts as presented in this case , the Court was invited to decide which of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1842 was the lawful one . But this question , replied the Supreme Court , was a " political question . " The President in exercising the power conferred on him by Congress to send federal troops to aid states in suppressing insurrection had indicated that he regarded the charter government as the lawful government , and this decision was binding upon the Court . The Court intimated that Congress itself would also share the power of deciding between the competing governments by deciding which group of rival Senators and Representatives it would seat in Congress , but it was not asked to make such a decision . The Court declined to decide whether Rhode Island had a republican form of government within the meaning of the guaranty in the United States Constitution , Article 4 , section 4 , but held that the enforcement of that guaranty was confided to the political departments of the government . There are , of course , numerous other questions which have been held by the courts to be " political " in character . Such is the question whether there is a sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an act of Congress , in calling out the militia to repel invasion or to put down insurrection ( see Martin v. Mott , 12 Wheaton 19 ; 1827 ) . Such also are many of the questions which arise for determination in the course  | of the conduct of foreign relations ; as , for instance , the recognition of a foreign government , the acquisition of territory , the determination of boundaries , the existence or termination of a treaty , and the like . The early case of Foster v. Neilson , 2 Peters 253 ( 1829 ) , raising the question as to the title to certain territory which was the subject of international dispute , emphasized the unwillingness of the Court to attempt to settle this type of question . The question whether or not a state of the Union has a republican form of government within the meaning of that clause of the Constitution guaranteeing such form of government was squarely raised in 1912 in the case of Pacific States Telephone &; Telegraph Co. v. Oregon , 223 U. S. 118 . In 1902 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initiative and referendum . In 1906 a law was proposed by popular initiative and duly enacted by the people which imposed certain taxes on corporations . The plaintiff corporation resisted the payment of the tax on the ground that the incorporation of the initiative and referendum into the constitutional system of the state destroyed the republican character of its government and thus robbed it of lawful authority . The argument was that republican government means representative government and that representative government is destroyed by the system of direct legislation . The Supreme Court refused to pass on the question whether Oregon had a republican form of government or not , and pointed out that that question was political in character and had been determined by Congress in admitting Senators and Representatives of the state to their seats in Congress . In Coleman v. Miller , ( p. 1 ) , the Court held that many questions relating to the procedure of federal amendment were " political " in nature . Mr. Chief Justice Taney delivered the opinion of the Court , saying in part : ... The fourth section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides that the United States shall guarantee to every state in the Union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on the application of the legislature or of the executive ( when the legislature can not be convened ) against domestic violence . Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a state . For as the United States guarantee to each state a republican government , Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the state before it can determine whether it is republican or not . And when the Senators and Representatives of a state are admitted into the councils of the Union , the authority of the government under which they are appointed , as well as its republican character , is recognized by the proper constitutional authority . And its decision is binding on every other department  | of the government , and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal . It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Senators or Representatives were elected under the authority of the government of which Mr. Dorr was the head , Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy . Yet the right to decide is placed there , and not in the courts . So , too , as relates to the clause in the above-mentioned article of the Constitution , providing for cases of domestic violence . It rested with Congress , too , to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to fulfill this guarantee . They might , if they had deemed it most advisable to do so , have placed it in the power of a court to decide when the contingency had happened which required the federal government to interfere . But Congress thought otherwise , and no doubt wisely ; and by the act of February 28 , 1795 , provided that , " in case of any insurrection in any state against the government thereof , it shall be lawful for the President of the United States , on application of the legislature of such state or of the executive ( when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such number of militia of any other state or states , as may be applied for , as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection . " By this act , the power of deciding whether the exigency had arisen upon which the government of the United States is bound to interfere , is given to the President . He is to act upon the application of the legislature or of the executive , and consequently he must determine what body of men constitute the legislature , and who is the governor , before he can act . The fact that both parties claim the right to the government can not alter the case , for both can not be entitled to it . If there is an armed conflict , like the one of which we are speaking , it is a case of domestic violence , and one of the parties must be in insurrection against the lawful government . And the President must , of necessity , decide which is the government , and which party is unlawfully arrayed against it , before he can perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the President has acted and called out the militia , is a circuit court of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right ? Could the court , while the parties were actually contending in arms for the possession of the government , call witnesses before it and inquire which party represented a majority of the people ? If it could , then it would become the duty of the court ( provided it came to the conclusion that the President had decided incorrectly ) to discharge those who were arrested or detained by the troops in the service of the United States or the government which the President was endeavoring to maintain . If the judicial power extends so far , the guarantee contained in  | the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy , and not of order . Yet if this right does not reside in the courts when the conflict is raging , if the judicial power is , at that time , bound to follow the decision of the political , it must be equally bound when the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored , punish as offenses and crimes the acts which it before recognized , and was bound to recognize , as lawful . It is true that in this case the militia were not called out by the President . But upon the application of the governor under the charter government , the President recognized him as the executive power of the state , and took measures to call out the militia to support his authority , if it should be found necessary for the general government to interfere ; and it is admitted in the argument that it was the knowledge of this decision that put an end to the armed opposition to the charter government , and prevented any further efforts to establish by force the proposed constitution . The interference of the President , therefore , by announcing his determination , was as effectual as if the militia had been assembled under his orders . And it should be equally authoritative . For certainly no court of the United States , with a knowledge of this decision , would have been justified in recognizing the opposing party as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurgents the officers of the government which the President had recognized , and was prepared to support by an armed force . In the case of foreign nations , the government acknowledged by the President is always recognized in the courts of justice . And this principle has been applied by the act of Congress to the sovereign states of the Union . It is said that this power in the President is dangerous to liberty , and may be abused . All power may be abused if placed in unworthy hands . But it would be difficult , we think , to point out any other hands in which this power would be more safe , and at the same time equally effectual . When citizens of the same state are in arms against each other , and the constituted authorities unable to execute the laws , the interposition of the United States must be prompt , or it is of little value . The ordinary course of proceedings in courts of justice would be utterly unfit for the crisis . And the elevated office of the President , chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the high responsibility he could not fail to feel when acting in a case of so much moment , appear to furnish as strong safeguards against a willful abuse of power as human prudence and foresight could well provide . At all events , it is conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States , and must , therefore , be respected and enforced in its judicial tribunals . ... Undoubtedly , if the President , in exercising this power , shall fall into error , or invade the rights of the people of the state , it would be  | in the power of Congress to apply the proper remedy . But the courts must administer the law as they find it .... Much of the argument on the part of the plaintiff turned upon political rights and political questions , upon which the Court has been urged to express an opinion . We decline doing so . The high power has been conferred on this Court of passing judgment upon the acts of the state sovereignties , and of the legislative and executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are beyond the limits of power marked out for them respectively by the Constitution of the United States . This tribunal , therefore , should be the last to overstep the boundaries which limit its own jurisdiction . And while it should always be ready to meet any question confided to it by the Constitution , it is equally its duty not to pass beyond its appropriate sphere of action , and to take care not to involve itself in discussions which properly belong to other forums . No one , we believe , has ever doubted the proposition , that , according to the institutions of this country , the sovereignty in every state resides in the people of the state , and that they may alter and change their form of government at their own pleasure . But whether they have changed it or not by abolishing an old government , and establishing a new one in its place , is a question to be settled by the political power . And when that power has decided , the courts are bound to take notice of its decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit court must , therefore , be affirmed . Mr. Justice Woodbury dissented . NEW HAMPSHIRE v. LOUISIANA 108 U. S. 76 ; 27 L. Ed. 656 ; 2 Sup . Ct . 176. 1883 . When the Constitution was before the states for ratification its opponents raised the objection that the clause which provided that the judicial power of the United States should extend to controversies " between a State and citizens of another State " ( Article 3 , section 2 ) would subject the states to suits brought by individual creditors and others who might feel that they had grievances . This idea was particularly obnoxious because the states had neither the intention nor the desire to repay money which was owing to loyalists or British subjects nor to restore the property which had been confiscated during the war . That the clause in question would authorize suits by citizens against the states was denied by Hamilton in the Federalist ( No. 81 ) and was also vigorously repudiated by Madison and Marshall in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788 ( Elliot 's De- bates , 2d Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears which had been aroused were not ill-founded , however , was evidenced by the fact that within two years after the organization of the Supreme Court four cases were instituted before that tribunal against states of the Union by individuals . The first case which came on for decision was that of Chisholm v. Georgia , 2 Dallas 419 ( 1793 ) , which involved a suit brought by Chisholm and another , citizens of South Carolina , as executors of an English creditor of the state of Georgia . Georgia hotly declined to appear to defend the suit , denying the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to entertain such an action . The Court , however , to the general surprise held that the suit was properly brought and that a state could be sued in the Supreme Court by an individual . Construing the clause of the judiciary article above quoted the Court observed that surely a controversy between A and B was also a controversy between B and A and under the wording of the clause it had no choice but to assume jurisdiction . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judgment by default was entered against the state . The decision aroused immediate and bitter opposition . The lower house of the Georgia legislature passed a bill to punish by hanging any person who should attempt to aid in enforcing the decree of the Court . Other states also protested , for upon the authority of the Court 's decision suits were soon instituted against several other states . Within two days of the handing down of the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia a constitutional amendment was introduced into Congress depriving the federal courts of all jurisdiction in cases brought against a state by the citizens of other states or of any foreign country . This was ratified in 1798 and became the Eleventh Amendment . In Hans v. Louisiana , 134 U. S. I ( 1890 ) , the Supreme Court held that a state could not be sued by one of its own citizens . The adoption of the Eleventh Amendment not only " recalled " the Supreme Court 's decision in Chisholm v. Georgia , but it made it possible for any state of the Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to repudiate its debts to individuals . And there have been a number of instances in which states have availed themselves of this dubious right . One or two of these cases have given the Supreme Court the opportunity to indicate the real force and significance of the Eleventh Amendment . In the case of New Hampshire v. Louisiana ( combined with New York v. Louisiana ) the two plaintiff states sought by appropriate bills in equity to compel the state of Louisiana to pay the interest on certain of its bonds ; bonds which had been assigned by their owners to the states of New Hampshire and New York for collection . Under acts in New Hampshire in 1879 and in New York in 188o any citizen of the state holding a valid claim against any other state of the Union , which claim was past due and unpaid , might assign in writing the claim in question to the state , the attorney general being thereupon authorized to bring suit against the de-                @ @ @ @ @
