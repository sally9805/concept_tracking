Whatever the old international significance of a rise in the Bank rate , the motive for the recent advance in New York must be sought in this country alone . <P> In respect to the general money market , the raising of the New York rate has another and even deeper significance . The classical law of rediscount banking is to keep the rediscount rate above the open market rate , in order slightly to penalize rather than subsidize the bank applying for the rediscount . <P> The Federal Reserve system has followed this principle only occasionally . Now on Feb. 21 , while the New York Bank rates still stood at 4 , the market for acceptances had risen to 4-4 ? and for commercial paper to 4 . This situation was partially remedied by the end of the week ; with the rediscount rates at 4 acceptances stood at 4-4 ? and commercial paper at 4-5 . Thus the Bank rate is now slightly higher than the rate for acceptances , but slightly lower than that for paper . <P> To keep Bank rate above market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so violent an advance has evidently been considered undesirable for the present at least . <P> The recent advance of the Reserve rate is reassuring proof that the Reserve authorities realize this possibility and are already taking steps to obviate it .
