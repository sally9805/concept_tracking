Clougher , secretary to Dr. Frank J. Monaghan , former Health Commissioner after Clougher had succeeded in having the Health Department ban against the Western product removed . Danziger , who is the chief witness for the State at Clougher 's trial before Judge Albert Cohn and a jury on a charge of bribery in the Bronx County Court , declared that he was able to retain only $10.503 of the sum paid him by the cream companies in commissions . When he protested to Clougher at the large percentage which the latter demanded , Danziger said Clougher told him he " had to take care of some one else . " And when he asked the identity of this person his only satisfaction . according to the story he , told the jury , was Clougher 's answer that " good soldiers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours he was on the witness stand was the almost stolid self-possession of the " czar of the milk dealers " shaken . Danziger is awaiting sentence in the Supreme Court in Bronx County on a plea of guilty to an indictment charging extortion . He was subjected to a gruelling cross-examination by Henry Vollmer Jr. , chief counsel for the former Health Department official , but he bore it unflinchingly . Tells of Trips Together . It was an amazing story that Danziger told . It included details of trips to road houses on Long island and to the Commodore and Hotel Pennsylvania grills , in company with Clougher. other Health Department officials and parties of young women . Miss Helen Sprey , his secretary , was his companion on these expeditions , Danziger said . Details were unfolded of a week 's dash to Montreal in Danziger 's automobile in the Summer of 1.923 , when the party registered under assumed names at the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs and attended the races there . When they learned that former Mayor Hylan was there , seriously ill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Lake George , where they stopped the next night , the party did not register at all because , according to Danziger , Clougher did not want it known they were traveling together or on intimate terms . The start was made from the Department of Health sanitarium at Otisville , N. Y. , and those who made the trip . it was said by Danziger , were he , Dr. Joyce , superintendent of the sanitarium ; Dr. Joyce 's young son . Clougher , and Richard P. Walsh . head of the Special Service Division of the Health Department . Clougher was also anxious , Danziger told the jury , that Dr. Monaghan should not become aware of their close relations . Although he said that Clougher proposed him for membership in the Brentwood Golf Club , and they went there as many as sixty times together , Clougher would telephone him not to visit the club on days when he found Dr. Monaghan , who also was a member , was there . Met Clougher In 1923 . Danziger said his first meeting with Clougher was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter of introduction to Dr. Monaghan He had been having " trouble " in connection with his milk business , he said , but Clougher eventually " fixed him up . " " I told Clougher I was boss of the milkmen and manager of their organization . " Danziger said . " Clougher asked me if 1 was making very much money at it , " went on Danziger , " and I told him ' Yes . ' He wanted me to meet him the next week at Parker &; Keitel 's clothing store . 1.561 Broadway , Brooklyn , and I did , about 5:30 o'clock one night We had dinner together and he asked me about business , and I started meeting him regularly after that . We talked about Western cream for the first time in the Summer of 1923 . " About that time Danziger made his contract with the Nestles Food Company , he told the jury . It provided for the payment of 61 for every . can of Western cream he could sell for them . He received it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jamaica and they went to Clougher 's home in Hollis , where he exhibited the contract . " It was In July or August , 1923 , ' continued Clougher . " I think it was the same night I got the contract . Clougher read it and put It in his pocket I met him nearly every week from that time until the admission of Western cream was approved in August , 1924 . ' It 's all right , ' he would tell me . ' I 'll take care of it . rn put it over . ' " Lot of Money in It . " " He asked me if there 'd be a lot of money in it and I said ' Yes . there 'd be a lot of money in it for you . ' He said he would attend to everything and for me to ' leave it alone . ' Clougher asked me if I thought the people would live up to their contract and I said I thought they would . " Danziger said the first check he received for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in was granted . It was one for $400 from Mark H. Fox of Chicago , and he at once showed it to Clougher , he testified . It was at this time , according to Danziger , that Clougher made his demand for 90 per cent . of all the commissions paid the witness . Clougher also insisted , so Danziger said , that all checks be shown to him so that " he would n't feel I was holding out on him . " It was explained by Danziger that , although he was in bankruptcy and had no bank account , he usually carried several thousand dollars with him . It was his habit , he said , to show Clougher the checks he received and then pay him 90 per cent . of their value in cash . Such payments were usually made on Mondays , he testified , but not always . Identifies Checks . Danziger was called upon to identify four bundles of canceled checks which were placed in evidence and which he said included his payments to Clougher . He identified sixty-seven checks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-one from the Universal Milk Company amounted " o 519.886 . They were all paid between Oct. 6 , 1924 , and Dec. 29 , of the same year , according to Danziger . The fiftythree checks from the Valley Dairy Company totaled 531,196 and were dated from Dec. 20 , 1924 , to Dec. 29. 1925 . There also were thirty checks from Mark H. Fox of Chicago , showing payments of $19,859 . All of the checks were admitted in evidence after Danziger had testifie , i he had paid Clougher 90 per cent . of the entire amount . In his testimony regarding the parties at hotels and road houses , Danziger said that William H. Kehoe , termed the " attorney general " of the alleged graft ring , who is under indictment in Manhattan in connection with the milk scandal , sometimes accompanied them , as did Fred W. Kautzmann , a former ! us ector of tie Special Service Division , also facing indictment . Danziger said that he visited Kehoe 's home in Hollis ten or twelve times and that he met Clougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission from Danziger that he had extorted $7,000 from milk dealers in the Bronx , that he had pleaded guilty ' and that he was at present at liberty in $10,000 bail . Danziger denied he had been promised that he would " be taken care of " if he connected some " high public officials " with the milk graft . Denies He Was Threatened . " Were n't you threatened as to what would happen to you if you did not do so ? " asked Mr. Vollmer . Danziger denied this . He also denied that Supreme Court Justice Aaron J. Levy had told him he had " better go to the District Attorney " and tell all he knew . Mr. Vollmer quoted from the statement made by Justice Levy in the Supreme Court in the Bronx April 29 last , in which the Court said that " unless you materially aid the public prosecutor ? ? ? very little mercy will be shown you . " " After you heard that , " went on Mr. Vollmer , " you brought men in the Health Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danziger admitted . " You had connected no one in the Health Department before that . You understood that if you did n't you would get no mercy whatever ? " Danziger agreed that was his understanding . " Is there any understanding that you are not to be sentenced until after you testify to see whether or not you keep faith ? " Mr. Vollmer asked . Danziger said there was not . It was brought out that Danziger was married six years ago and that he has two children toward whose support he pays $35 weekly . He had not lived with his wife for three years , he said . On the question of his income , the witness testified he received from $700 to $800 a month in milk commissions from 1923 to June , 1925 , when he was cut to $500 a month . The Metropolitan Milk Dealers ' Association paid him 2 cents a can on all sales from August , 1924 , to October , 1925 , and he netted about $200 a week . He said he really began making money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers ' association amounted to $1,000 to $1,500 a week . He hired ten men to assist him , ha testified , and paid them from $60 to $100 a week from his own pocket . Danziger admitted that when he first met Clougher he had told him he was in the building business , although this was not the fact . Mr. Vollmer wanted to know why he had done so . " Pint on a Big Front . " " Well , " said Danziber , " I told Clougher that because I thought if I did n't put on a big front he would n't bother with me . I wanted to keep in his good graces . I wanted to make his acquaintance the first time I saw him because I thought it would be a good idea to have some one in the Health Department that I knew . " " What you wanted to dO , " commented Mr. Vollmer , " was to betray a friendship . You wanted to tell the milk dealers that you had a strong pull with Dr. Monaghan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted him for a friend . " " You had to Ile to him to keep his friendship ? " " No . " Danziger denied that he haa ever been convicted of carrying a weapon . Questioned by Mr. Vollmer , he said that the automobile trip to Canada had been taken on Clougher 's suggestion . On one occasion , Danziger said , he asked Clougher what the latter would do if the Nestles Food Company " fell down " on their contract to pay him $1 a can for all the Western cream he sold , and that Clougher had answered he would " shut them up . " The trial will be resumed at 10 o'clock this morning . when Danziger 's cross-examination will be continued . Miss Helen Spey is expected to follow him on the witness stand .
