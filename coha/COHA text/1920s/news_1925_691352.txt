Standing as it does where Beekman Street twists its narrow way to the sea , this hospital is the dividing line between the two widely divergent localities it serves ? on the east , the congested tenements of Cherry Hill and Mulberry Bend ; on the west , the impregnable steol towers of Wall Street and the Stock Exchange . Its district is limited to everythinR south of Canal Street  --  a district where population shifts in 12 hours of the day with an influx and efflux of half a million souls . " Where industry is so keen , hazards are necessarily great , " said Dr. Joseph A. Blake , consulting surgeon . " Beckman Street Hospital saves hundreds of lives eari year by its proximity to the scene of accidents . The builder who is hurt on the job , the elevator man who gets his hand caught in the shaft , the office man who is injured in the building , can be rushed to Beekman Street and given emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him were he to be carried miles - away to some uptown hospital . " The campaign will continue through May 9.
