Manageable enough over short distances , electricity is a hard horse to drive a great way . The higher its voltage , the more perverse are its paces . Yet the higher its voltage , the more work it can do at long distances from its source . Big rivers will generate millions of volts , but the highest voltage , carried for the longest distance , is the 220,000 volts carried by the 550-mile Big Creek system in California . <P> Last week the Westinghouse Electric Co. announced that it had acquired , from Engineer Frank G. Baum of San Francisco , the rights to an invention by which " superpower " might be transmitted across the continent , if need be . At an added cost of 20% , the most high-powered line now known could be increased 75% in capacity and made part of a line of unlimited length . <P> The chief difficulty in transmitting high-voltage current arises from the fact that the natural leakage of the conducting line causes a loss of power at a certain distance from the source of the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , long distance high voltage lines are apt to behave erratically . To steady the operation of the line , automatic voltage regulators are added to it at regular intervals . Engineer Baum 's invention consisted , broadly , in replacing all but a minimum of auxiliary regulating equipment , with synchronous condensers every 100 miles . In these condensers , the current is given opportunity to steady itself , and pick up whatever voltage* it has lost traveling from its source or from its last correcting station . <P> The Significance : possible use of Rocky Mountain waterpower current in the Mississippi Valley , of Niagara 's power in Manhattan , of Muscle Shoals by the southern hinterland ; power for farmers ; de-centralization of industry . <P> *Last week was the death centenary of the man who first understood that electricity flows in currents measurable in pressure units . " Volts " and " voltage " were the work of Alessandro Volta ( 1745-1827 ) , professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia , Italy . His compatriot and contemporary , Luigi Galvani of Bologna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by contact with mixed metals and moisture had deduced that the muscles contained electricity . Volta examined the theory of " galvanism " and traced electricity , not to the muscles , but to the mixed metals and moisture . He piled pairs of silver and zinc discs together , with moist cloths between and a wire connecting top and bottom discs-the first battery . Napoleon called him to Paris , sent him home laden with honors.
