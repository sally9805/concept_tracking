Announcements were made from Copenhagen and Washington of remarkable improvement in cases of general paresis ( a degenerative disease of the brain , usually fatal , and caused by syphilis in the central nervous system ) by the introduction of Plasmodium vivax , the germ of tertian malaria . Authorities in a Danish insane asylum have been experimenting with the method for five years and claim to have obtained absolute cures . <P> Dr. William A. White , well-known American psychoanalyst , and superintendent of St. Elizabeth 's Hospital , the government institution for mental diseases , under whose care the Washington experiments have been made , is less sanguine , but believes that there is considerable hope from the malaria treatment . <P> Practically all efforts to attack paresis hitherto have been frustrated because antisyphilitic drugs , usually mercury or arsenic compounds , can not pass through the choroid plexus , a sort of fine filter at the base of the brain . The germs which reach the higher centers are free to develop and soon do permanent damage to the brain tissue .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
