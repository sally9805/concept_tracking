From Newport , Wales , to London is roughly 200 miles by road , and by road a small army of 400 unemployed miners , old men with sticks and young men with fresh complexions , set out last week to present a petition " in boots " to Parliament calling attention to the suffering and distress in the Welsh coal mines . <P> There was a sharp tang in the cold , raw air as they started merrily to such songs as the " International " and the " Red Flag . " Leading the procession were red flags and the two banners which read : " On to London , the seat of our trouble " and " We demand bread for our people , justice for the miners . " All were stoutly shod and all carried an extra pair of " boots . " A rolling kitchen and a motor truck filled with supplies followed them , and there was an ambulance with well-trained male nurses to look after sore and swollen feet . <P> Who financed the march ? None other than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Secretary of the Miners ' Federation , who spent months raising the necessary funds . But where was the " Emperor " ? Not among the marchers , but far away in London attending to " urgent business . " True , he did wire the " boys " that he would be with them for a Sunday , but what is one day out of the 12 that the " army " expected to take to accomplish its journey ? These were some of the questions and answers of supercilious critics . <P> Came the army to Bristol , first stop , where the good citizenry served tea to the foot-weary marchers and where pretty girls coaxed the younger marchers to trip a measure of jazz dancing with them . Later , the rolling kitchen got busy and soon after night fall a one-legged war veteran was serving hot food to the cry of " roll up " - the equivalent of the U. S. " come and get it . " <P> Came the army to Bath , over an ancient road built for the war chariots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quota of pretty girls and they likewise enticed the young men from their weariness , while the older ones enjoyed rest . <P> Came the army to Chippenham , where hot tea and biscuits ( crackers ) were served to them at Labor headquarters . They came in the dead of night , their miners ' lanterns swinging by their side . No pretty girls could lure them from their sleep . <P> Went the army on toward London .
