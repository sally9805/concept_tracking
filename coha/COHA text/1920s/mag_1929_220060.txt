( See front cover ) <P> After much secret and uncertain picking up and putting down , Herbert Hoover fitted ten pegs into ten holes and finally made up his Cabinet . It had been a brain-bullying task and the result , somehow , failed to produce the striking design of supermen and specialists which Mr. Hoover-and the U. S.-had hoped for last November . He had had a surplus of little pegs that would have fallen through the holes , whereas big pegs of individual shapes refused to fit in , even when pushed . But a survey of his handiwork at least brought the new President the consoling knowledge that it was composed chiefly of good obedient yes-pegs who would not hop out of their holes and make trouble for him . <P> One peg was a New England aristocrat , while another owned a small automobile agency in Missouri . One peg had been worn smooth with a quarter-century 's public service , while another had never been outside the steel business . Two pegs were frankly politicians , stuck in as rewards for services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two others had snugly filled their holes for eight years under Presidents Harding and Coolidge . One peg was an old college friend , another a Democrat except in Presidential elections . <P> Nine of the ten pegs went to college ( Harvard , 2 ; Michigan , 2 ; Yale , Pittsburgh , Coe , Minnesota , Stanford , one each ) . Three pegs have done military service . One peg is immensely rich ; two pegs are rich ; the rest , well-to-do . The pegs ' geographical centre is further west than in any previous cabinet-Far West , 1 ; Midwest , 5 : East , 3 ; New England , 1 . <P> Viewed as men instead of pegs , the Hoover Cabinet was seen as follows : <P> Secretary of State . Henry Lewis Stimson of New York , began crossing water at the behest of Presidents 23 years ago in Rock Creek Park , Washington . There he was riding on the bridle path one drizzly afternoon when he heard his name imperiously called from across the creek . The caller was Mr. Stimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State . out for an airing with President Roosevelt . Sergeant Stimson of Squadron A. N. Y. National Guard , spurred his horse over the swollen stream , nearly foundered in the middle , clambered up the slippery bank opposite , gave a mud-bespattered salute , reported for duty . President Roosevelt asked him to dine at the White House and later appointed him U. S. District Attorney in Manhattan . <P> District Attorney Stimson destroyed the sugar fraud ring , sent Charles W. Morse to the Atlanta penitentiary , extracted a $30,000 fine out of James Gordon Bennett for running immoral " Personal " advertisements in the old Herald . ( Simultaneously the outgoing Secretary of State , Frank Billings Kellogg , was engaged in smashing the old Standard Oil Co . ) <P> President Taft summoned District Attorney Stimson across the Hudson . Delaware , Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers , from Manhattan to Washington , to serve as Secretary of War . President Wilson commissioned him a colonel of artillery and sent him across the Atlantic to fight with the 77th Division . President Coolidge despatched him first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace between Diaz and Sacasa and later across the Pacific to be Governor General of the Philippines . President Hoover recalled him to sit at his right hand at the Cabinet table .
