txt Assemblyman Joseph V. of the Seventh District , Bronx , who has been advocating a reduction in the prices of adnislaion charged for boxing bouts under the Jurisdiction of the State Athletic Commission , yesterday directed a letter to Governor Miller , in a request for action on his campaign to establish a maximum admission charge of $7 instead of the $25 now permitted under the law . Assemblyman 's communication to the State Executive follows an exchange of letters the Bronx representative had with the State Athletic Commission , in which he threatened to bring the matter before the Legislature unless action was taken to reduce the maximum admission charge . In his letter to Governor Miller , Assemblyman states that the leasing of the Polo Grounds for boxing purposes and the opening of the new Yankee park , id which boxing matches will be held , make restrictive measures additionally advisable . Assemblyman advised Governor Miller that , unless drastic action is taken by the Chief Executive , disgrace must come to the State as a consequence of the existing admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by professional fighters and their managers , Assemblyman 's letter to Govehtor Miller follows : I desire to place before Your Excellency a matter that is of great moment to the citizens of our State and one that is important in its possibilities for scandal and corruption . I know from my experience in the Legislature that it was with some reluctance that you signed the bill reestablishing the Boxing Commission under the title of the New York State Athletic Commission . The impression given by you at that time was that the boxing exhibitions In New Yoric State had previously been of no credit to the State of New York and that you hesitated to give official recognition to professional fighting for purses in our State . However , the bill was signed bY Your Excellency and the State of New York , by your action , became a party to progressional pugilism and assumed active supervision of prize fighting in the State of New ork . " Holding the Bag . " It is a debatable question whether or not this is a proper and right thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the question whether or not the State of New York should be placed In the unenviable position of holding the bag for a sordid ring of professional pugilists . Yet that is exactly what the State , through your commission , is doing . It is unnecessary for 11112 to point out the degraded conditions that exist today regarding professional boxing . Professional pugilism has become a gigantic financial enterprise in which boxers and their managers are demanding and receiving prices that are wholly disproportionate . Not content with the percentage of the gate , the fighters demand and receive ' guarantees for one bout that makes a bank president 's annual salary look like a scrubwoman 's pittance . There are very few boxers who have not reached the prima. donna stage in demanding and receiving vast sums for championship and near-championship bouts . In addition , many of the bouts are very questionable and present evidence , that points to corrupt methods , or at least highly suspicious 011PR . This ' condition is being fostered by the New York State Athletic Commission . It has taken upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York State , even going so far as to declare who shall be and who shall not be champions . Yet , instead of attempting to remedy the situation by drastic action , the State Commission Is affirmatively encouraging the boxing promoters to continue gouging the public by establishing a scale of admission lirlees that are absolutely without justification . Prhis became apparent when the Commission officially decreed that the maximum admission price shall be $25 and other prices in proportion . It is scandalous that anybody should be allowed to charge $25 for admission to any boxing exhibition . It is worse when done by and with the direct authority and sanction of the State of New York . Want , $7 Maximum . have tried to prevail upon the State Athletic Commission , if it persists in regulating prices , to place a reasonable restraint upon the greed of the boxers and promoters . 1 have asked that it make $7.00 the maximum charge . This it has refused to do , although I think you will agree with me that $7.00 is a very large Awn to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially true when the bouts are attended by some ten to twenty thousand people . Unless drastic action is taken by you , disgrace must come to the State of New York . As the situation now stands , the State Is tarred wi4h , the same stick as those profiteering from the excessive retnrus demanded and received by the professional fighters and their managers . With the leasing of the Polo Grounds and the new Yankee Stadium , the opportunities for taking in still larger sums will be greatly enhanced . With so much money involved . it is apparent that the situation presents such poten tentialties for evil that should warn the State to take steps to prevent the scandal and disgrace that must be the inevitable outcome of such a condition . Human ? nature very frail and , with so much money involved , it is only a question of time before the State of New York will be dragged in the mire of corruption and disgrace , place this matter before you in the ? hope that it will be remedied . There are thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They join with me in asking that a curb be put upon the activities of those promoters and fighters who are exploiting the State of New York and its citizens . They can not obtain any help from your representatives on the State Athletic Commission - and they ' do not relish the thought the ; they are made fair game They by any official act of the State . They hope for relief before the entire eitizenry demands the abolition of professional boxing in the State of New York .
