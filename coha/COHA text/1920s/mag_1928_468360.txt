IN ALL ages the opinions and knowl- edge possessed by the leaders have differed from those of the " men of the market place " ; and in spite of all our popular education that same differ ? ence holds good to-day . This fact was brought clearly into relief in the popular comment and discussion on the so-called " monkey-trial " at Dayton , which pro ? vided heart-searchings for some , amuse ? ment for many , and complacent self-satisfaction for hordes of John Does . It was easy to laugh at the Tennesseeans , but was the Dayton trial , after all , merely an uproarious farce ? the last stand in the mountains of a dying Obscurantism ? Are not aspects of that and other manifestations of what we have come to call " Fundamentalism " i worth pondering on broader lines than whales and Jonahs and the first chapter of Genesis ? Were the citizens of our cities and graduates of our high schools really so much more intelligent than the shirt-sleeve mountaineers ? Do they really know so much more about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that different periods in the history of man have had different in ? tellectual " climates , " and that the whole mentality of each period is dependent upon the particular climate then pre ? vailing . We can not understand a book written 500 B.C. or 1200 A.D. merely because we can read its words . We have got somehow to come to understand the whole " intellectual climate " of that period . No man 's thought can be un ? derstood without it ; and no man , then living , was unaffected by it . There was , for example , a very distinct " intellectual climate " in the medieval period in Europe , in which Dante 's Divine Comedy or the works of St. Thomas Aquinas flowered as naturally as the giant ferns in the Carboniferous era . Then came great " cl irn at ie " changes in intellectual Europe and , later , in the New World , and the climate in which we live now is wholly different . It can be called , for want of a better name , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sort which almost involuntarily rejects any general ideas or principles which can not be " verified " by harmonizing them with a succession of facts tested by instru ? ments . The only truth about the starry heavens , for example , which carries any conviction to most men to-day consists only of such " facts " as are revealed by the telescope , the spectroscope , and other instruments , or such hypotheses as seem to be corroborated by other facts similarly revealed or by mathe ? matical " laws . " Now , this is something distinctly new in the way of an " intellectual climate . " A civilization as a whole is probably related in some way to the intellectual climate of its period as the fauna and flora of past ages were re ? lated to the physical climates of their day . Everything at any given moment somehow " hangs together . " Nobody has yet satisfactorily defined what we mean by " civilization , " and we have no standard by which to judge whether one of the several civilizations that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man is a con ? ceited creature , and very likely the men of each civilization would consider their own , which they were used to , the best . The average man in each , however , can no more escape the intellectual in ? fluence of the " climate " of the times than he can escape from breathing the physical air of his time and place . Un ? consciously he is formed by it . He accepts it as part of the order of nature and can not understand any other . The average busy man of the present day , and not a few of the minor scientists , may think that they have replaced a worn-out religious faith by " scientific knowledge , " when all that they have really done is to replace one childlike faith by another and one bigotry by another . The " man in the street , " whether that street be the Acropolis of Athens , the Forum of Rome , the narrow byways of medieval Florence or Paris , or Pall Mall or Broadway to-day , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical results and conforms to the current religion or opinion . The prac ? tical technological , economic , and so ? ciologica.I results of science have been colossal , impossible almost to over ? estimate . Had the views advanced by scientists not had these practical results they would have interested the average man as little as do the ideas of Plato or Hegel . It may yet remain to be determined whether science has proved a blessing or a curse . It is too soon to say , and the problem is too complicated . But certainly it is the fact that scientific " ideas " work so astoundingly in the practical life which has given them such an enormous philosophical va ? lidity in the eyes of the people at large . Science in the opinion of the multitude has become something sacro ? sanct , and the average man to-day is as much a bigot about " science " ? as he understands it ? as the average man in Europe in the year 1000 was about the dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air of the intellectual climate of his day . He has picked up the ragtag and bobtail ideas which are floating about just as his predecessor did . In the Tenth Century Catholicism was the accepted mode of thought , and no sensible person questioned it . It is precisely the same with " science " to-day . If a merchant 's clerk in the year 1000 was asked why he believed the dogmas of the church , just what those dogmas were , and on what philosophical basis they were founded , he could not have answered to save his life . They were the only sensible things to believe , and he was too busy and too practical to bother about philosophy . lie knew that everyone else believed ; he knew a lot of practical things the church did ( or might do ) for him , and anyone who did not believe was a crank or worse . In the same way , to-day , of the thou ? sands who laughed at the Daytonians how many could have told what is the philosophical basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based , and just how far , and why , it is a valid interpretation of the universe ? They know ? as the Catholic book ? keeper in the year 1000 knew , about the church ? that science in certain prac ? tical ways has done a lot for them . There is the meehanico-materialistic interpretation of the universe , held by some scientists fifty years ago , which has now filtered down to the public and become fixed in its mind . The " aver ? age man " of the Middle Ages had his physical flames of Hell and his jewel-strewn Heaven . His modern counter ? part has his " scientific laws " and his materialistic interpretation of the universe . And bigotry along the new lines has already set in . If one were not histo ? rian enough to know how such things go , one might be surprised to find the " scientific , enlightened " mob who laughed at the Tennesseeans refusing to listen to the leaders among scientific thought . Let us take the case of a man I happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Huxley , and the other scientists who were leaders in that clay . In a sense he is himself a leader in his community , a man of fairly large income , a member of a somewhat exclusive intellectual club , but he says he has time to read only eight or nine books a year . Several of these are scientific , but he will have none of the philosophy of science . He would have no more use for Ritchie or Whitehead or Poineare on the one hand than he would for the Daytonians on the other . If any " scientist " questions a purely mechanist-material view of the universe , he is to be summarily dism issed . He is as inflexible as the clerk of the Middle Ages . For him the scientific assumptions of a generation ago have become an established dogma , as little to be questioned by the leaders of science itself as by the Daytonians . As Poin ? care says , " for a superficial observer , scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt . . . . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions ; each saves us from thinking . " It is of no use to say to such a man that Poineare , the leading mathemati ? cian and one of the leading scientists of our time , has admitted that science can teach us nothing of the real nature of things , that all it can do , and that only in part , is to elucidate certain relations between them . Moreover , as he ex ? plains , science deals with only a very limited number of facts , those which recur with sufficient frequency to enable us to establish " laws , " which , as another scientist says , are " hypotheses with a high degree of probability . " As Poin ? care says again , we have to stop some ? where , and scientists merely work on certain groups of facts so as to establish certain simple rules valid for those groups of facts only . They have established a good many such rules , and they have had astound ? ing repercussion in the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I repeat again , which has so deeply impressed the average man . Heaven and Hell are unprovable and very likely unreal . The " good life " was always a matter for the elect and cultured to debate over . But for the common man , the movies and the telephone and the Ford car and a huge increase in popula ? tion with jobs still going round are realities , and science has brought them about . But does science give us any satis ? factory explanation of the universe ? No scientist of any standing would claim that it tells us why things happen ; it tells us only how they happen . Science does not tell us the cause , in the popular sense , of a single happening . It can only tell us that if certain things occur others will follow . And it can do even that for only an extremely limited num ? ber of phenomena . The popular idea is that , given time enough , science will be able to explain everything . Will it , even as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a biological chemist of international note , says , " it seems clear to me that the order in nature of which science reports is really there , and is not a mere figment . But it seems to me equally obvious that the orderliness is not all-pervasive . There are streaks of order to be found among the chaos , and the nature of scientific method is to seek these out and to stick to them when found and to reject or neglect the chaos . It is obvious that we have succeeded in finding some order in nature , but this fact in itself does not prove anything farther . It suggests that. , having found some order , it is worth looking for more , but it does not imply that nature is orderly through and through , though , of course , it might be so . Nevertheless , the extreme difficulty and labor of finding laws of nature even when you know where and how to look , much more when it is a question of discovering a new one , suggest that there is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The fact that the regions of nature actually covered by known laws are few and fragmentary is concealed by the natural tendency to crowd our experience into those regions and to leave others to themselves . We seek out those parts that are known and familiar and avoid those that are unknown and unfamiliar . This is simply what is called ' Applied Science ' . " The reason I claim that popular science has already become a sort of dogmatic religion with the ordinary man , and that he is as much a bigot as the Daytonian , is that he will not listen to this sort of thing even from leading scientists . He has accepted as a new dogma the science of thirty years ago as it has filtered into popular works and he accepts , utterly uncriti ? cally , because he has had no philosoph ? ical training , any philosophical non ? sense handed him by the popularizers of science . He believes that science will ultimately explain everything , because he believes the entire universe is gov ? erned by laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandonment of any doctrine of the freedom of the will ; but many scientists without philosoph ? ical knowledge apparently overlook this entirely , and in the preface to one of the most popular books on recent science we read that we men , owing to science , " have stepped from the rank of Creation 's scheme . " If science is universal , how arc we , any more than anything else in the universe , going to step out of the rank of " Creation 's scheme " ? Would n't that be a colossal miracle , and if an unimportant creature like man can voluntarily step out of the sphere of influence of " natural laws " and begin to control or thwart them himself , what becomes of that all-per ? vasive " reign of law " ? Why be so conceited ? If we can step aside from " Creation 's scheme " because of what science has learned in a few generations , the universe would seem to be much more loosely governed than popular science believes . H science is universally valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying all we have hitherto considered worth striving for , and must theoretically destroy all initiative . Yet science has given us such power over the forces of nature as to stir us to an activity hitherto unknown in the world 's history . We have been able to produce and maintain a population undreamed of . We are flying through the air at three hundred miles an hour . We can speak with a person three thousand miles away . We can do all the incredible things we do to-day , and so we , part of an inexorable nexus of laws , are dreaming of annihilat ? ing almost every law of nature ! There is the paradox , which the popular scientist and the man in the street both ignore , being " practical " men in a " scientific " age . But to get back to our Daytonians and our high-school graduates . As far as thinking powers are concerned , I frankly do not sec much to choose be tween them . The high-school gradu ? ates have accepted certain facts the Daytonians did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigoted as the Daytonians . They not only refuse to think but they have reached the point in accepted and crystallized dogma where they refuse to follow even the leaders of science themselves in their philosophic inquiries . Anyone who does not accept the few established facts which these High Schoolites have ac ? cepted , are , in their opinion , ignorant boobs . Any scientist who is philosoph ? ical enough to carry on speculations which appear to endanger the simple mechanical scientific ideas to which the High Schoolites have become accus ? tomed is a " crank " and no longer a " scientist . " But , again , it may be asked whether the Daytonians ' protest ? I cite that simply as an example of a state of mind not confined to the Tennesseeans ? is based solely on scientific ignorance and Obscurantism ? Are these various pro ? tests , in more or less ignorant form and based on positions which , intellectually , are unfortunately taken , the dying gasps of a conflict which is almost passed or the first cries of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the " climate " of one 's own age , and so dangerous to be a heretic , scientifically , that the ques ? tion may seem a foolish one , but I am not so sure that it is . I am not so sure that the next century or two are going to be as rigidly " scientific " as our own . These protests , as I sense them , have to do fundamentally , not so much with certain items of knowledge or ignorance , as with our attitude toward the whole range of values in human ' life . There are certain questions about life which man has always asked , certain modes of self-expression and enjoyment which he has craved , certain ideals he has enter ? tained , certain forms of experience he has insisted upon . In the ebb and flow of humanity through the ages , in minor changes of modes of thought and socialcustom , we may sometimes lose sight of these fundamentals ; but if we study men in all stages of evolution from savagery to the highest civilizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant . For one thing , he has always insisted on trying to find some real and satisfying explanation of his own nature and that of the universe into which he is born ; he has never ceased to ask the why of birth and death , of suffering and sin and happiness ; he has always expressed himself in art ? written poems , painted pictures , carved sculpture ; he has always insisted that he was himself a personality , and that the drama of his own life , somehow , had significance . There have been pe ? riods when a philosophy or religion arose which ran counter to some or all of these instincts , and for a time , oddly enough , may have seemed to increase the energy of the people believing it , as in. the case of Mohammedanism . But sooner or later the people release themselves again , and the religion or other hampering influences become mere forms and lose their significance in practical life . Now , what is the relation of science to these deep-lying instincts ? It can offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nature of the universe or ourselves . Its " causes " are mere antecedents . It pictures a mere succession of events . Not only must it always be silent as to why any ? thing happens , but even as to the how , what it really says is merely that if a certain selected group of phenomena is found now , another combination will follow . This is enormously useful to know , and I am not belittling the amaz ? ing amount of knowledge of a certain sort which science has accumulated . It is probable that mankind will never find any answers to their many why 's . That is not the point . The point is that mankind , age after age , has always sought answers , has always refused to remain in a purely agnostic attitude . Has human nature changed so corn pletely and suddenly that it is now going to remain forever content with those answers of science which are no an ? swers ? Moreover , man has implanted in him a peculiar feeling that somehow there is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some things , some thoughts , some lines of conduct have more value than others ; that a great poem is worth more than an obscene couplet scratched upon a wall ; that a noble and brave man is worth more than a puny coward . But , however an individual scientist may ignore the im ? plications of science in private and practical life , science has no place for values . In a universe governed wholly by predictable and inexorable law , value , in its human sense , is an inad ? missible quality . The man who sacri ? fices his life to save women and children in a shipwreck is doing nothing more noble or of more worth than the man-eating tiger who pounces upon a child in the jungle . Both are equally the liter ? ally un-willing resultants of the entire complex of forces in the universe center ? ing upon them at the time and place , and their acts are as wholly devoid of moral value as the motions of the stars in their courses . If we adopt sincerely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values in human life . The arts are already beginning to show this deteriorating influence . In fiction , for example , of what use to write of char ? acter if there is no such thing , if person ? ality is a myth , if freedom of action is a dream , and if all we are is merely a succession of states of mind having as little significance as a glow of phos ? phorescence over decaying wood ? The logical outcome is Joyce 's Ulysses , in which for hundreds of pages we have merely the successive and passive states of mind of one man during a few hours . As an experiment it may have an in ? terest . As the sole form to which the art of fiction is reduced by science , it means the end of art . It may all be true but neither man nor his arts can try to live by it and survive . It is needless to go on multiplying instances . As to the immediate ques ? tions at issue at Dayton , I believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as to the larger implica ? tions of the whole present situation believe the Daytonians were on the right trail , however clumsily and ignorantly they were groping for it . If man can not live by bread alone , neither can he live on disinfectants or aeroplanes . As an historian I am skeptical of general laws in history , but one which does seem to be established is that man never goes back to revivify old forms . His civilizations may rise and fall , but he never goes back to relive the thoughts of an earlier period . I do not look for a great popular revival of Christianity any more than of Greek philosophy or Confucianism . Christianity will prob ? ably last for centuries and provide com ? fort and hope for millions , but those who have grown away from it , and their successors , are not likely to be won back . On the other hand , I do not believe that any body of doctrine so spiritually and , speaking broadly , intellectually sterile as science will satisfy the many-sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incomparably useful , but they are too much on the order of a picture-puzzle to satisfy men forever . There comes a time when the contemplation of the unthinkable distances of the stars or the habits of an electron or even the geological record fail somehow to move us . It gets a bit too much like reading of Rockefeller 's millions , because , at bottom , and ineradicably , man craves spiritual and moral values , and an answer , however crude , to his question why ? It is obvious that we can not get along without science . Intellectually it has an interest we shall never again willingly forego . Practically it is essen tial , not only for our comfort but , as things are now , for our very existence . In fact we have reached the point where in order to support the population brought into the world by science we shall have to have more and more science , more and more inventions almost daily . But , basing my prediction solely on the unchanging nature of man 's deepest cravings throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mind , I do believe that science will some day cease to be the sole method of interpreting the universe and that scientists will cease to be the high priests whose words are the sole authority as to what men can and can not believe about themselves and their environ ? ment . It has been said recently that science may some day become a sort of religious cult , with its own hierarchy and its influence on the life and thought of the people comparable to that of the great established churches . I doubt that , for , as I said , it is too sterile . IL has appealed to men in general in our day for special reasons , but I do not believe it can permanently satisfy the whole of man 's nature , and I believe the " intellectual climate " will gradually alter again ? as it has so many times ? and science will come to be considered an extremely useful practical tool , an indispensable one , and an extremely interesting interpretation of certain aspects of the universe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole interpretation of the whole of it . Whether in the course of the next few centuries some new religion may be taught , I do not know , but I do not believe that a few generations of scien ? tific teaching have permanently altered man 's nature . I believe that before so long he will insist , simply because he can not help himself , on some restora ? tion of spiritual and moral explanations and values in his world . A philosophy which teaches that there can be no answer to his deepest questionings , that all his spiritual and moral values can be resolved into nothing , that he himself has no personality , not only after death but even in this world , that he is merely a bundle of " states of mind " can not satisfy him always . When beauty , love , duty , loyalty , and all the rest of what has hitherto given some value to exist ? ence have been swept away by scien ? tific analysis . I believe they will come in again by some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know . In all that I have here said about science I have been speaking of it in the popular acceptation of what it stands for ? a conception that unfortunately is entertained also by too many scientists of smaller caliber . Far out on the fron ? tiers of knowledge are scientists who themselves glimpse something different . It may be that they will be the ones to open the door and if they do , I am not at all sure that the Daytonians may not be more ready to enter than the High Schoolitcs . The Tennesseeans ' science may be negligible but their uncritical sensing of man 's deepest needs , of his unchanging nature , and of the values of life is more valid than that of many of the half-educated who got such a hearty laugh out of them , even although the crude protest may have been due to mere resentment against the disturbance of cherished religious dogma , " Intel ? lectual climates " may change ; civiliza ? tions may rise and fall ; our skyscrapers may yet stand deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every shred of contrary evidence , that he is a person ? ality , that there is a scale of values which transcends the useful , that there is more in love and beauty than a complex of instincts and impacts , that there is a mystery and a meaning hidden in the universe , and he will still frame answers to his eternal why ? The old religions may long linger , but none can be born again . If science can not lead into some new world of interpretation , it will be thrust aside , except as a tool , and man will turn to some new philos ? ophy of life , for his instincts are stronger than his reason , and man is more than his mind .
