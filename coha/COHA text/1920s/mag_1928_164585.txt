THE INTELLIGENT WOMAN 'S GUIDE TO SOCIALISM AND CAPITALISM-Bernard Shaw-Brentano ( $3.00 ) . <P> Four hundred and seventy pages of text , 33 of table of contents , and five of foreword to American readers , comprise what G. B. S. is pleased to call his last will and testament to posterity . Such a document is often a summary of previous implications : and here are the echoes of many a famous " preface " concerning religion , eugenics , education , professional morality , economics-in short , society . But the echoes are measured and stressed in a grand symphony of discord for which the resolving chord is equality of income . The bizarre title of the composition is calculated to attract male attention : a man can not confess his ignorance of politics , economics , and all the rest of a voter 's business , but he does not object to elementary instruction offered his wife . And if the husband should overhear . . . . Shaw chuckles contentedly , and instructs : <P> Society is based upon the distribution of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been advocated : <P> 1 . " To each what she produces " seems fair enough , until the impossibility of ascertaining the amount each produces proves the plan nonsensical . <P> 2 . " To each what she deserves " is equally absurd because merit can not be measured by money , <P> 3 . " To each what she can grab , " a plan still tolerated in business , is not only amoral , but even among pirates found impracticable . <P> 4 . " To the many as little as possible , and the rest to the few " has no longer its one justification of providing capital , as capital can now be provided in less abusive ways . <P> 5 . " To each class of society a fixed amount , according to scale " provides more of course , for the bank president than for the street scavenger , but the impossibility of gauging just how much more vitiates the plan . <P> 6 . " To let things slide " sets up a disastrous strain unless legislation keeps pace with sliding ( change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To each an equal income " - the object of socialism-is the only remaining possibility . <P> Every known economic scheme but socialism being convincingly wiped out by stultification in the best Shavian manner , the author then proceeds to establish the necessity , the practicability , of socialism-originating not so much with the Proletariat ( the Third International is damned along with Capitalism ) , but with the great middle class ( Fabianism ) . When with logic and concrete example , he has demonstrated the practicability of gradual nationalization of income , he shows that the great deterrent is not practical but metaphysical : the will to equality . <P> But Shaw 's rationale , his passionate plea , his drole cajolery , will do much to arouse that will-to-equality , and even more to stimulate women , and their men , toward intelligent consideration of some solution , whether it be socialism , or some other ism .
