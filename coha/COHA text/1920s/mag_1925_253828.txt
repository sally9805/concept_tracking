There are only two kinds of men . Those who fight with their faces to the enemy-who are the victors-and those who fight with their tails to the enemy - who are the vanquished . From time immemorial , the victors have laughed at the vanquished ; and so the desire to avoid the imputation of cowardice is a primitive complex . Every man resents it . <P> Hence the storm that arose last week . Major General Robert Lee Bullard , who commanded the First Division , then the Third Corps , later the Second Army of the A. E. F. , has written his memoirs of the War , which have appeared serially in the New York Herald-Tribune and the Chicago Tribune . With each installment , he printed an apology for possible error . " . . . I am not offering these memoirs as absolute fact , but as my impression and belief at the time . " Nevertheless , critics swarmed last week when one installment was printed , describing General Bullard 's experiences with the 92nd ( Negro , draft ) Division which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few weeks of the War : <P> <P> The Cry . <P> <P> I . . . found that in the battle of the Meuse-Argonne , a part of the 92d Division , beside the French in battle , had twice run away from in front of the enemy , causing the <P> French , for their own safety , to request the relief of the Negro division from the fighting line . Some 30 Negro officers were involved in this running away . Five-the clearest cases and supposed leaders of the movements-only five , had been selected for trial by the law officers of the Second Army . A court martial , composed of officers from another , a white division , had been ordered for this purpose . <P> <P> ( General Bullard told how all five were sentenced to death but how he , knowing that " . . . even the most exact justice meted out to Negroes , if meted out by white men alone , becomes to Negroes injustice . . . " had recommended that President Wilson pardon them . This was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ) : <P> <P> I saw especially the Negroes , the 92 Division , which , after more than a month in the trenches , can not yet make a raid . It failed again on one today . Poor Negroes ! They are hopelessly inferior . <P> From about Oct. 25 , then , until a few days before Armistice , I put forth every effort to have this division execute some offensive operation , as a raid , against the enemy . The division was large and composed of exceptionally husky , vigorous looking soldiers , well equipped . The enemy troops against them were of second or third class , not by any means the best . I provided the most skilled French and American advisers and instructors for them in an effort to have them execute a successful raid . I never succeeded even to a slight degree . As I remember , in those three weeks this division of some 27,000 men captured one German ! <P> The Negro is a more sensual man than the white man and at the same time he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . The little acts of familiarity that would pass unnoticed in a white man , becomes with white women the cause of complaint against the Negro . This special Negro division was already charged with 15 cases of rape .
