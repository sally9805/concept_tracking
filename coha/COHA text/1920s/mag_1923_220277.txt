New York newspaper women gave a ball at the Ritz-Carlton . But Miss Margery Rex of the Hearst American was not present . That was because there is no such person as Miss Margery Rex . She is just a name , and whenever Mr. Hearst discharges the person who writes under that name he engages somebody else to be " Margery Rex " - thus losing none of the good will that the first Margery may have built up for his paper . <P> For the same reason that Miss Margery Rex could not attend the Newspaper Women 's Ball , Michael Grayson of Mr. Munsey 's Sun can never be a member of the Newspaper Club . There have been three " Michael Graysons " in the past four months . Mr. Hearst and Mr. Munsey are aware that contracts with ectoplasmic personalities can not prove awkward .
