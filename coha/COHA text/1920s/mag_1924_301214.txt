The election of Patrick E. Crowley to the Presidency of the New York Central Railroad ( TIME ; April 14 ) was interpreted as revealing the policy of the company 's directors in favoring succession in office of operating executives . Since Chauncey M. Depew , a lawyer , was President , all his four successors-Samuel R. Colloway , William H. Newman , W. C. Brown and the late A. H. Smith-have been operating men . <P> Secondly , the Board is believed to have taken into consideration Mr. Crowley 's popularity in the rank and file of Central employees , in which he resembles the late Mr. Smith . Crowley began at 14 as a telegrapher on the Erie . <P> Finally , the selection is a tribute to Mr. Crowley himself . He began as an employee of the Central at 25 ; for about ten years he was a train master ; at 36 he became a division superintendent ; at 40 , assistant general superintendant to the road , and at 43 its General Manager . Subsequently his title has been changed to Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been as chief operating executive of the road with the duty of maintaining its equipment and its line of 17,000 miles . Next August Mr. Crowley will be 60.
