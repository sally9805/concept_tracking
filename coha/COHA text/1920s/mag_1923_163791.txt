Two most experienced and careful pilots , H. De Lay , aerial daredevil , and R. I. Short , President of the Essandee Corporation , were killed at Los Angeles , the wings collapsing in a loop at 2,000 feet . A pin holding the wings to the body of the plane was only three-eighths of an inch in diameter instead of the required three-quarters , and its loosening caused the accident . Previous attempts on De Lay 's life , his many enemies in the beach district , and his usually minute care in plane maintenance lead friends to believe that this is the first airplane murder-more subtle than mediaeval poison .
