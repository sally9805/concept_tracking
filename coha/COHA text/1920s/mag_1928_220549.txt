Science has often upset philosophy , religion and even government . When it upset business lately , in California , the event was more unusual . <P> The scientific subject in question was Earthquakes . In California , allusion to earthquakes is avoided in polite conversation . God is very close to California and His acts , against which people take out insurance policies , do not bear discussion . <P> But almost as strong as reverence for God in California , is the rivalry between Los Angeles and San Francisco . Los Angeles could not overlook it when a San Francisco man-Professor-Emeritus Bailey Willis of Stanford University , President of the Geological Society of America - freely predicted some time ago that the next mighty upheaval of the Pacific Coast would come in Southern California . As a result of that prediction , insurance rates in Los Angeles skyrocketed 200 to 2,200% . The premium of the Union Bank and Trust Co. ' s building , for example , went from $2,500 to $12,500 . <P> Los Angeles property owners at once engaged Geologist Robert Thomas Hill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U. S. Geological Survey , to examine the terrestrial underpinning of Los Angeles and make an announcement " to the world . " There was little doubt but what this report would mitigate , if not wholly crush , the Willis doctrine . In seismology , as in medicine , so many factors must be surmised that from the few known facts , paid experts may arrive honorably as often as willfully at different conclusions . <P> Geologer Willis chanced to be away from California , lecturing in Ohio , when , last fortnight , Geologer Hill 's retort professional was given " to the world " by the Los Angeles Graphic ( society weekly ) . Whether or not the world heard , the Graphic made sure that Geologer Willis would hear . Of him it said , with good-natured Californian venom : " God must have tipped him off ... the incondite ravings of a mischief maker . ... It is generally believed that Dr. Willis ' service to the fire insurance underwriters was substantially rewarded . " <P> Of the Willis predictions and the security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I heard these cries of disaster and from the time I began to investigate them , I knew that they were ill-founded and that some , as yet unexposed fallacy lay at the base of them . These doubts were based upon a long acquaintance with the geologic and historic facts of Southern California . We , of Southern California , where engineering skill has long been at its highest , knew that no such movements had occurred here within the recollection of man . If so , our aqueduct across the San Andreas rift would have long since been destroyed . Even the San Francisco earthquake movement did not faze it . If such movements had occurred they would have been reflected in the astronomic computations from Mt . Wilson , in our land surveys , or by dis placements along our many highways and railways which cross fault lines . <P> " First , I deny that any man can predict the time or place of the next earthquake in California . . . . Southern California is but a small spot along the great <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8,000 miles from the Arctic circle to Tehuantepec. . . .
