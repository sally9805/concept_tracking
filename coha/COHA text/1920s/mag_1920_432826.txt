AN accomplished woman who had rendered great service with the Red Cross in France had come to talk with me about the joys and surprises of working with the men overseas . She had heard that I had once worked in the same chitteau at Luzancy on the Marne to which she had gone months afterward . It is always the same in one of these interviews : the talkers vie with each other only in seeing which has the richest instances to tell of kindly approaches , of beauties of action , of inexhaustible fun and unforgettable men , and by talking try to recapture a little of the joy of it all . But except for some such slight revival of the old satisfactions as a chance conversation might give , my friend was tacitly taking the ground that it was all over and must all slowly fade into the past . With the same fear myself , I had determined not to let it fade if I could help it , and for three months past had gone about whenever I could , just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . My journeys had taken me into five states , following all kinds of clues ; and when I began to speak of doughboys as if they were still with us and one could still see as much as he would of the wounded , she seemed rather puzzled and asked , ' But why do you take all that trouble ? ' She had too easily given in to the conventional idea that it was all over . . Spaced out all over the land as he IS , the doughboy , the artilleryman , the amIntlancier , the hospital and medical man , is just the same person that he was in France . He has brought home with him just what gladdened our souls over there . He will not say much about it while this strange vogue of silence is on ; but anyone who wants it can have much of the old experience still . If I were a millionnaire , ? which the reader will be pleased to have mentioned so early in thenarrative , ' ? I should go on one grand tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretchers or in hospitals , or whom I met by chance on French roads for only a little space , but long enough for them to say or do something that gripped one 's heart forever . But the grand tour being impossible , I take the short ones , and turn aside whenever a dktour will bring me within hail of them . Never did I imagine that Pittsburgh and its environs could suddenly become endowed in my imagination with all the colors of romance ; but this is what has come to pass ; for out in that region live a great number of those who surprised me into the happiest days of my life . A week in Pittsburgh , with the privilege of looking up the doctors , the cook , the bell-hop , the bar-keep , the street-car conductor , the drug-clerk , the hostler , the automobile agent , the shoe-clerk , the miner , the student , the farmer , the drummer , the lawyer , and McCafferty of the pickle factory , quite casts Atlantic City and Mt . Desert into the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the first two days there with Pennsylvanians , the whole state was glorified in my imagination forever . I had see him word that I was coming , and on a ? ival telephoned to some outlying village that I was there and at the hotel . The last time I had seen him I had admired the subtle skill with which he had always quietly managed , no matter how crowded the circle , to get one of the seats by the stove up there in the distant Auvergne mountains , where he was a patient after the action was all over . I remembered the day when I saw him off on the train for the coast . Any of them would gladly have taken train from the most comfortable spot in France , thoughit should carry them only twenty miles and land them in a swamp for a month , such was their glee at being that much nearer home . And now I heard my name paged in the great lobby , and , as I went forward to answer , there , following the bell-boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most comfortable place to talk I said , ' Now , Alex , come over here and we 'll have a grand powwow . ' But catching me by the arm and blushing and laughing , he whispered to me , Why , you know I ca n't do that , chaplain ; they wo n't let me sit here in the lobby . ' And why not ? ' I asked . ' Why , Lord bless you , chaplain , did n't you know ? I 'm a page here myself and go on duty in an hour . ' But I stood on my rights as a guest ; and besides , he looked a good deal better than anyone else in the lobby , and so we had the hour out together . He told me why he was a page , and his reasons seemed to me cogent as he told of his tips and his wife and baby . He was just as good as he was in France , yes , better , and I thought , ' How can anybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on knowing them always ? ' A little extra pains , a little car-fare , and the thing is done . Then he disappeared , and came smiling back in his page 's uniform ; and so through the days he was always at hand ? good as gold ; and by reason of his calling , I saw more of him than would otherwise have been possible . It had been one of the worst nights at Chateau-Thierry , and the back-wash of the wounded came in fast . There he sat ? this one ? bolstered up in bed , with both legs gone , and his face black with a hundred powder-stains , and his eyes closed . With what little energy he had left he said , ? ' There ' s just one thing I want to ask you , chaplain , and that is whether you know anything about the science of artificial limbs ? ' ' Yes , something . ' How far along has it got ? ' ' Oh , a good way . ' ' What do you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he could hope for a good deal , and so he stopped . I saw him at intervals through the two days , and then he was whisked away to some Base ; butI was always haunted by that boy and wondered what the end might be . On my return to the States , I found one day in one of the magazines a selection of the brighter kind of soldiers ' letters , and one of them was some doughboy 's breaking it gently and jocosely to his mother that he was coining home , ' but that there was not quite so much of him ' ; and at the end the name that was so sharply etched on ni , ? memory . ' At last I had struck the trail . Giving a guess as to which hospital he was likeliest to be in , I made for Colonia , to find that he belonged there but was on furlough for the day in another town ; and there I found him . Waiting in the parlor , I heard him stumping down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a while , give me time . ' So I went out into the hall to see him . There he was , young , smiling , well , and puzzled as to who I might be . ' I guess I 'll have to think a bit , ' he said . You were at Chiteau-Thierry , were n't you ? ' I asked . Well , I should rather think I was , ' he replied ; and then , after a good long look he said , ' By George , I wonder if you can be the Red Cross man who used to come to my bed when I was there ? ' I asked him what he thought of the ' science of artificial limbs ' now , and he said it was all I had claimed for it and more . I used to be six feet one , but they 've taken me down two inches ; ca n't balance me at the old height , you see ; but I can drive a car and swim and everything is going fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those times you came to my bed , because you had a book in your hand and I thought it was all up with me until I found you were going to use it for the chap in the next bed , to give him the communion . You know , I 've always wondered what became of him ; what did ? ' The boy in the next bed was the Lawrenceville School boy , and he rests in ChkteauThierry . The other day I went to the train to meet my rediscovered friend and bring him home ; and when he sat here across the table from me in my own house , and I thought of all that had happened before this circuit was complete , it seemed a sort of miracle . Columbia has him now , and I like to think that Ch9.teau-Thierry did not end , but only began , the adventure of our friendship . What I have lost through not keep-Mg an address-book earlier , I can not estimate . There are men who passedlike ships in the night , but not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are . Sometimes you just remember a slight clue , and it was such that enabled me to find G again . He was shot on outpost at Belleau Wood at midnight , but could not leave until , just as it was getting gray , he saw the Huns break out of the woods , and going to give the alarm , was hit by a piece of shell and lamed for life . I was at Base Hospital 2 in Paris during the ten days when they came in , and the day he came I encountered him . He was so difficult that I simply had to do what I could for him and then side-step him , until one night the head-nurse said to me , Why do n't you go in to see C. -- oftener ? ' ' Because he is the only man in there who does n't want to see me . I think he 's chaplain-shy . ' The nurse said she believed he did want to see me , thought he put that all on ; and added that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in and try him again . The dusk was falling , and there he lay , alone in the room , one leg hoisted on one sling , one arm on another . He looked up at me in the same old scornful way as if I were dirt ; but , drawing up a chair , I began to make conversation , and he let me make it ? what was made . At last , being all talked out , without any response from him except monosyllables , I had got to the pass of Hosea Biglow where he says , ' He staits his subjick ag'in ; does it back'ards , sideways , eendways , crisscross , bevellin ' , noways . ' It was no use . Why had the nurse sent me in again when I was ready to let the poor boy alone ? At last , feeling like a ' returned empty , ' I got up and said , ' I think I 'll go now , G --  ' ; whereupon he turned his head toward me , and looking daggers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay ! ' So with that I drew up my chair again and told him we might just as well have this out now as any time ; that he was the only man in the room I could never get a word out of , and now , when I had come in to try it again , he acted as if he wished I 'd go . ' And when I start to go , you say , " Do n't go : stay . " What does it all mean , G ? ? Let 's have it out . ' At that he grasped me by the hand , turned his head away , and burst into tears . ' Yes , ' he said , ' that ' s me all over . You 're right . I was always that way : whenever I really want to know anyone I always act as if I did n't . ' It was not very difficult after that . But overnight I was sent up on the Marne and never got back ; and so I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mistake about the name of his home town in Massachusetts , and had to go to two towns that summer day to find him . At last I found his home close down by the shore , but the boy was still away in the Marine Hospital ; so I journeyed to Chelsea , and had him called down to the guard-house . I watched him coming down the terraces , and on going up to meet him ran straight into the same old scornful look once more . He did not know me , but I was determined that this time I would let him take his leisure about coming to . ' I did not mind in the least going through the Hosea Biglow business that day . I told him I had been in his home and seen his mother , that I had once seen him in France ; but he seemed to think that was ' my own look-out ' : if anybody wished to do anything so foolish , it was no concern of his . But at last some little allusion made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled , and then he blurted out , ' My ? I are you the chaplain ? And you mean to say you ' ye been out to my town ; you ' ve been in my home ! Gee , I 'll never forget this , This is worth a hundred dollars to me : So there we sat on the grass while he told me all that had happened in the year , laughed about his old infirmity and how I had caught him at it again , but said he was really getting over it . Months later , when he was discharged and I was in Boston again , he came to see me off at the train and said , Do you remember sending a cable home for me ? You said a Plainfield lady had given you money for such things , and so I let you . But when you asked me what to say and I said , " Well and happy , " you set up a great kick and said you would n't do it because it would only make matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . ' Oh , yes ? well and happy . ' Never was anything so bad but that well and happy ' would be the cheerful description of it . With the death-rattle in his throat , ' says an Englishman , ' the Brit , ish soldier will assure you he is " doing fine . " ' Doingfine ' weretheexactwords of the boy marine from Oregon when , to the amazement of us all , after two days he roused a little , though the great surgeon had said he would never recur . er consciousness . Always doing fine , ' Only the minor things got a grumble from them , and the grumbling I could listen to all night because of its charm . The Georgia boy who had lain out in the field twenty-four hours before he was found , whose leg had been amputated at the hip , cheerfully asked me to write to his father in Rome and tell him all about it , but to do it in such a way that he wo n't worry any about it . ' One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a questionnaire sent to doughboys ; and anyone who would be guided by what theysaid off-hand would be taking little account of the mystery of these men ' ; for the better you know them , the more the mystery increases . Ludendorff , accusing Von Bernstorff , says , We took Americans prisoner who had an entirely wrong or vague conception of what they were fighting for . ' I relish the thought of what , with innocent countenance , a doughboy might have handed out to a German interrogator . Men who were always ' doing fine ' when everything was at its worst could be trusted to kid along ' an enemy questioner , and look as if they were hardly aware there was a war at all , or even make him believe they thought it was all about Votes for Women . It was most unlikely that I should ever see again the lad who was shot in the St. Mihiel sector , for nobody seemed ever to have heard of his hamlet , nor was it on any map ; but at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the coal-mines . If I got up early enough , left the train at a certain junction , and walked the track the next two miles , I was told that I would find it ; but , as I discovered , that was only the post-office , his real home being a half-mile farther down the track . Yet even so it was better than Atlantic City , if R ? T ? was really at the end of it . In the middle of the hot August morning I found the mine , and its seven or eight supporting houses climbing the steep slope that led up to it ; and the last house up was where this husky nineteen-year-old miner lived . The last time I had seen him was the day when , knowing that he was to be shipped to the coast , I had gone along the street of Royat in the mountains of France , asking the men if they knew where he was , when suddenly he rushed bareheaded out of a cafe and said , ' I heard you was inquirin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to tell you myself that I was right in here , taking a last glass of beer , before any of them guys went and told you . That ' s what I was doing , chaplain . But here I am . ' The boy 's sister told me that he was still sleeping , and that I could go in and wake him up if I wished . He just simply stared and stared and said nothing . Nothing would do but that I should stop and have another breakfast with him in the midst of a large and cordial family ; but it was worth a night 's ride to see him sitting there , clean and collarless and healthy , and look out over our ham and eggs and past him across the valley where the boy had always lived . Why did n't you ever answer that letter I wrote you ? ' I asked . And he , coloring up , laughed in his old way , and said nothing . But his mother put in cheerily : Now , I ' 11 tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did , he was afraid that some day , perhaps , when you were traveling , you might come and look him up and find out what a poor old place he lived in . ' I asked him if that was so , and he said , Well , yes , it was so , chaplain , to tell the truth , but it ai n't so any more . I can tell you , I ' m so glad you came . ' He took me up to the mine to meet his comrades as they came out on the trolley with their loads of coal , explaining as we went that he had quit work because of some new arrangement which took , as nearly as I could make out , some fifteen cents a day from his pay . He said he could make between six and eight dollars a day . Of course the layman immediately multiplies the maximum of eight dollars ' by three hundred working days in the year and estimates that the boy has a comfortable income of twenty-four hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , without a question as to how many days in the year he gets even the six dollars . But I was not there to discuss economics but just for the joy of seeing the fine fellow again . His fellow miners were a bit puzzled for a while as to what R ? might have in common with a chaplain ; but finally , accepting me as a human being , they let it go at that and wanted to know why I could not stay a few days . It was just as it was in France ; for somehow in the neighborhood of this lad cheerfulness would break in upon you , and life did seem simplified just by being with him as he went on telling of his life , his joys , and his happiness and amazement that anyone should remember him like this . As the day was closing , he took me down the bank to the railroad , ? there was no station , ? and signaled a train for me , and we parted . Comparisons are invidious , but none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chaplain , you must n't fail to look up C ? and L ? ; they ' re both working in the same cafe down the street ; you ' 11 find C ? at the bar and L ? at the lunch-counter , ' said one of the doctors in the once smoke-grimed but now ? to me ? romantic city . No fear that I should ever forget them . And there they were . L ? got a call-down from an impatient customer for pausing thunderstruck to come out from behind the lunch-counter ; but went back after whispering , ' You just wait a few minutes , chaplain , and I ' II fix you up all right . ' And then C ? came up from the bar , and just sat down opposite me at a table and stared at me . The old days were all on again . Probably C ? would be mad as a hatter at me for saying it , but there was some moisture in his eyes as we recalled the kitchen in the old Augustinian convent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambulanciers and the orderlies behind the blanketed windows . It was C with whom I had walked up to see No-Man 's Land in the Argonne Forest , returning from whence at dusk , we found that Field Hospital 112 had moved bag and baggage in our few hours of absence , and there was nothing left except the chaplain 's baggage to show that we had ever been there . The bar was a bit dull , and I judged that there was little going on there except talk and two-seventy-five , ' so that C could always stop and visit . He was a Roman Catholic , and L ? a Greek , and I a Presbyterian . The way that German Fatherland begat brotherhood in everybody that was against it is almost the best thing it has done . An hour later , buying a paper at the street corner , I saw one of the best of them speeding past , and stepping after him , caught him by the coat and asked him where he was going so fast . Going to your hotel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just heard fifteen minutes ago that you were here . ' And there he was . It was on a cold October night in the shock ward made by hanging blankets in the corner of a wretched barn in Neuvilly of the Argonne that one of the ? boys had said , ' You ' d better go over and speak to him , chaplain ; he ' s over there in the corner alone . He ' s had bad news . His mother died . ' It was one of the good things of army life that you did not have to say much when there was not much to say . Meanings got conveyed if you meant them , and a word or two would make the friendship which it might have taken months to make at home . And what we really live for after all is to achieve now and then an hour or two such as we two had together . The war had done him nothing but good . Heartiness , openness , friendliness and cheer and courage , all these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , but assumptions have little edge , while actually going and finding out for myself sent me back into life with something new and fresh in it . All that I had known of him in France was just verified , and it was all there and waiting for you whenever you wanted to go and claim it . I had written home about Dan so much that the family had come to be familiar with him . A small Irish lad who was confined to the ' Itch Tent ' on the Marne , he was the quietest of them all , but somehow his manner made him notable and his lack of wants made you all the more ready to fill any that he had ; so that you found yourself dropping into the 110tel de Scabies , ' as they had cheerfully labeled it , because it made you feel more comfortable to have a word with Dan . The day had come for him to be shipped away , and as he had never asked for anything , for that very reason I opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rules , and told him to take anything he wanted , whether it was intended for officers or for men . The Red Cross was not obsessed with the idea of symmetry or rules , and every time I broke a regulation it was fruitful , and whenever I nearly broke my neck trying to observe one , no good came of it that I ever had any account of . Dan was well outfitted when he climbed into the great truck which was to carry him off . And that was the last of him , save for a letter saying that he never could talk much but hoped I understood his way and knew that he appreciated all that the Red Cross had been to him . One day months later , ? for my friends at home now knew Dan almost as well as I did , ? there came from them across the sea a clipping from a Boston paper , with Dan 's picture and the news that he had fallen . It was not easy to drop Dan out of the list of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have another page of that pleasant friendship if I tried : there must be a little more , and while it would be fainter in outline , it must be that his family , if I could find them , could add something to my treasures of memory and I to theirs . So , enjoining the postmaster of his city to do all he could to find the family of this soldier , I drew a bow at a venture and sent my letter off . In three days came a letter from Dan himself saying that he had been shot within two hours after going over the top , but was alive , all there , well again , and waiting to see me when I could come . At last I found him . At the top of the Parker House steps there stood a boy in blue serge , whom I glanced at and then passed by until something made me turn to look again ? and it was Dan . He had dropped work at the gauge-factory and come into town at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . ' A grand evening , ' said Carlyle , after a whole evening spent in smoke-encircled silence with a friend . You hardly know what to say first with someone who has been reported dead and is alive again ; but you find your way . But Dan 's silences on the Marne had only helped to draw out friendship there , and it was good to find that in Massachusetts it was just the same , and I could have it all the rest of my life . IV On a rainy Sunday in New York the elevator man rang to say that there was a plumber below who wished to see me . As I could think of no plumber who could have any business with me , Joe explained that the man 's name was E -- - , and he came from Pennsylvania . The name was enough to recall one of the bitterest tragedies of the Argonne . A father and a younger brother had traveled all night just to come and have a word . So through the long rainy afternoon we sat , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at Neuvilly Bridge ? about his heartiness and his quickness to forgive , his mistakes and his desire to make good , and his commander 's letter about how the boy had done it . Then they in turn wanted all the details of that roadside burial which , for all the roughness of its surroundings , was not without some unusual honors . A great French truck train had stopped beside us , hemming us quite in , in our little cove beside the road , with every motor running with such noise as to make a service impossible , until a French captain , seeing our difficulty , gave a signal which stopped every motor the length of the train , and then another signal which brought every French soldier to join us till the service was done . Each burial seemed to have something distinct about it , and one never knew just what would break out ; there was scarcely one where something did not happen if you had eyes to see it . That day , prompted by I know not what , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it was over . A hundred times I had thought about that boy 's home ; for with the sergeant I had gone over his pocket treasures , and his home and love for it to an unusual degree were written all over everything he possessed . Today the boy 's home had come to me . The mess-sergeant has been sending messages with regard to dates in October . He can not be certain yet , but is anxious to know if I will be in the city on or around a certain day . At last it dawns across me what may be afoot and I ask bluntly , Is he going to bring his bride ? ' Yes , that is just it , chaplain . ' And at last they come . This is a crowning compliment , and no ring at the door could announce a more wel come pair . The bride may have suffered a bit under the flood of reminiscence into which we plunged at once . Of course , we are not so dull as not to know that pretty soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends will say , ' Good heavens , have they got going again ? ' or , more politely , ' Suppose we go out into the garden now . ' Yet I think it will always be possible , like the Lantern-Bearers , to have our stealthy reunions and keep alive about the best friendship that ever was on sea or land . And then there is a wealth of little unexpected meetings everywhere . We all have them . It is a joy to be buying your ticket at a station window , and have a smiling chap step up and say , I beg pardon , but were n't you a chaplain overseas ? ' To be sure ; but with all the good fortunes of that year , I could not realize for a minute or two that I had ever been friends with this gracious stranger ; yet so it was . He was now buying his ticket from Boston , to go and bury himself in a little western hamlet and its spinning-mill , to learn the trade . But we had three hours together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill , and said that he had been pretty lonesome but had always remembered our luncheon together as his farewell to Boston , it made me feel like Newman 's allusion to the snapdragon at Trinity . You 'll run across our men every . where around here , chaplain , ' had been his last words ; and within five minutes , sauntering across the Common , came a familiar form . It was M ? , the prizefighter . Our friendship had begun by his asking me to receive his confession in the chateau of Luzancy ; but though I had told him I could not , John always dogged my steps after that , sidling up to me on all occasions and seeming to think that I could do it perfectly well if I only wanted to . Telling him that he was the third prize-fighter with whom my fortunes had become linked in France , I added that my friends all laughed me to scorn because I had said that what chiefly impressed me about the three was the gentleness of them . At this John fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've said it , you 've said it . You 've hit the nail on the head this time . People think we ' re a lot of rough-necks , but it ai n't so . Why , chaplain , we would n't harm a rabbit . ' So with this paradox passed , John unfolded to me his present scheme of a restaurant on Commonwealth Avenue somewhere , and made me a customer in advance . In another city , one whom I had last seen in the region around Mont Sec seized me on Saturdaynight and begged that I would come out to his suburb Sunday morning early , go to his Bible class with him , and then home to see his father and mother . When I told him that I could not because of a day full of engagements , he changed his tone and said , ' Well , now , you 've just got to , you 've got to . Now , listen , and I 'll tell you why you 've got to . ' Then he told me why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Nobody could have resisted that reason , nobody would have , and I went . It was just as he said . I went , and my aftermath will always be richer for that going ; but the reason is just between A ? and me . But think not , gentle reader , that it was always church services on which these friendships were based . There were many which sprang into existence there , and these are the hardest to tell about . You tell about these only to groups of individuals . But many friendships came to be for the very last reason in the world . Around the corner one day , as I was rushing to get a train , there swung the Headquarters truck driver , as a result of which I did not take a train until hours later . John could furnish an incontestable alibi as regards any of my services . It was not these which had cemented our friendship . As a matter of fact , John had run off with my wash-basin and water-bucket and a small store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well but for the sick . The loss was no small matter up in the neighborhood of Fismes , and I opened negotiations for their recovery ; but John 's explanations and theories and arguments carried on through many , days ; the fertility , invention , earnestness , and charm with which he variously accounted for their disappearance made me finally drop the search for my belongings and take him for a lifelong friend instead . ' I do n't believe they are half as interesting as you claim , ' said a New Yorker who was taking me out into New Jersey to hunt up one of the choice buck privates whom I had traced to a dairy there . ' I saw a group of them the other day in the street ' , he remarked , and after all you had said , I took a good look at them , and I confess they did n't look very interesting to me . ' At length we saw Ike coming along the country road in his overalls , leading an old horse homeward from the cornfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to supper with him and his wife , and as we sat there I could see layer after layer of crust dissolving on the surface of my friend , until at last , when we were ready to go , he whispered to me to ask if he could n't invite them both to visit him in New York . As we rode away , he , all aglow , said , ' Why , that 's a wonderful fellow . I do n't wonder you wanted to see him . I have n't seen anybody more attractive . ' And then , as if to preserve some of his earlier doubt , Still , I do n't believe there are many like that . ' With the proper prodigality of one who had known some thousands of them , I told him that I could show him hundreds just as good as Ike . The week that does not bring letters from them is a week lost now . ' All I ask for is to git back to B ? , Kansas , and git to farming again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing the stump of his arm up at Royat . He writes to say that already he drives the team as well as ever , breaks young horses to ride , and drives a car ' like anyone else . . . . And the girl ? well , ' pardon me , chaplain , for I do like her ; at least , they say I show it with this one arm of mine . ' The statesmanlike suggestions as to the reconstruction of Church and State with which it was prophesied that the A.E.F. would return quite loaded up are strangely lacking , though Bill Anderson thinks the government has been fooling around long enough and ought to get something settled by this time . Their lack of anything to sly about the issues of the time always makes me think of what a parishioner of Emerson 's said of him . When asked what kind of a minister Emerson was , he replied that in most ways he was very acceptable , but that he was no good at funerals and never seemed to know what to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are endlessly satisfying on most subjects , but they never seem to know what to say about a battle or a wound or a lost limb or saving democracy , andgenerally act as if those were subjects to which , they had never given any thought . Hardly a week goes by without establishing communications with some family whose son rests overseas . After a year and a half I find the California family whose son I buried by the buttress of the ruined church of CharyChartreuve , and who write to say that every crumb of knowledge about him is priceless to them now . That burial stands out because of the son himself , about whom I always felt that some day I should know more , ? I wanted to , ? and because of the ambulance-driver , a stranger to me , who helped lay him in his grave and then bolted just at the benediction and hid himself behind the church . There I found him after they had all gone . He had seen many such events , but this somehow smote him and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later that I saw him again , and in the Argonne , red with confusion because I had seen him give way , until he found I thought none the less of him for it ; and after that it was a jocose query in his section as to how on earth Y ? and the chaplain had got so well acquainted . Every few weeks the wheel comes around full circle and puts me in touch with people I have been wondering about and searching for . None of the orderlies at Chateau-Thierry ever forgot L ? and his sufferings from gas and the way he bore them ; but it is only now , after a year and a half , that I can tell his wife in West Virginia about him ; and to-day his picture and his history are in my hands and the full story of his fortitude and faith is in hers . One day the mail brought a little folder of board-covers , and opening it , I found pages of my own handwriting which I recognized as the letter I had sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot at Belleau Wood . It seemed a strange thoughtfulness that he should return my letter , until , looking more closely , I found that it was my letter photographed which , with the boy 's portrait and a beautiful tribute from an uncle , they had made their memorial for the boy . These families come to seem like your very own . When three months in a new home had put me out of reach of the old outfits , and not a day of a dreary winter had gone by without longing for them , who should burst in on me , hurried , hatless , and welcome , but Vincent of the 23rd Ambulance . There he had been , living in the fraternity house next door , all the time . My first rides on the ambulance had been with him along the stretches of the Marne and between Coulommiers and B ? zu-le-Guery , and it was he who had created my enthusiastic opinion of ambulance men which never afterward changed . The fact that the war had set him backtwo years in his studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' almost providential , ' as the cautious old Princeton professor used to put it , for I could now look forward to two years with one of the best of them always at hand . But there are others to whom I have no clue . I can not imagine now why I did not make sure of them when I could ; but in the haste of it all , they drifted out . I would like to know those two stragglers who had walked miles in the sun to find a canteen , only to discover that it had moved . They were now on the return journey , and I met them on the road just opposite Quentin Roosevelt 's grave , walking toward Chamery . These two had something on their minds . A few days before they had found along the roadside , up by ' St. Gillies , ' as they called it , an American boy unburied , and had managed somehow to make a graveand lay him in it . And then , as one of them said , they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within reach , and ' we ai n't neither of us very religious . You know how it is , chaplain ; but we could n't stand for burying him like that , so we just agreed we 'd stand over the grave and say what Bible verses we could both remember . And so we did that ' Then they asked me if , the next time I went up that way , I would not go to that spot and read a real service . ' You ca n't miss it . About two hundred yards beyond the railroad tracks as you go out of " St. Gillies , " and his name is Zaner . ' But those two immortals slipped away . And Betts ! I shall never quite give up the hope of finding Betts again . Whether it was gas or bronchitis that brought him into Field Hospital 111 at Courmont , I do not know . But it was he who , with incredible adroitness , without moving from his bed , got me out between nine and ten at night , when all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me break open enough chocolate for him and his two hundred fellow patients . I had been off all day to get it at Cohan , and had not got back until dark ; and not daring to go near the tents until they were all asleep , 1 at last stole down to the entrance of one of them , to have some whispered consultation with an orderly , when up from the middle of the black silent tent rose a husky , drawling , cheerful voice : ' Oh , my eyes are sore watching all dayunder that tent for you to come ! ' Walking down into the tent , I asked who it was that was having all this eye trouble . ' Oh , it 's only me , Betts , ' he laughed . Betts by daylight could get almost anything out of you , but Betts at night was even more appealing . There was nothing to do but go back and stealthily break open enough for him and his forty in the same tent ; but while I was gone , the villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other tents , and there was no rest for the weary until the whole two hundred had been fed up . When it was all over , and in the darkness I had given Betts five times his proper share and was passing out , he called after me , ' Good night , chaplain , my eyes are getting better every minute . ' Through military channels I am now advertising for Betts .
