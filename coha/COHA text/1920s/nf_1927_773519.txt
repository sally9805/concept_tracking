txt // means can be discovered for the measurement of the pressure of public opinion as exercised in the past in keeping the family in its orthodox form . It is clear that both husband and wife when their union has remained barren have felt that they were somewhat frowned upon by neighbors and friends who were doing the expected thing . The legal stress put upon barrenness is a striking illustration of the way public opinion has regarded parenthood . How far this attitude of public thought has pressed individuals into parenthood undesired we have no way of knowing , but there can be no doubt that it is these changes in public opinion that are giving the companionate its opportunity . Indeed , in the case of many the movement of thought has completely reversed , and the coming of the child is regarded as a real misfortune by others who have successfully avoided parenthood . The new social attitude reveals the temper of modern life as it operates upon the family . As the companionate program becomes increasingly secure by advances in the technique of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be scolded , tricked or bribed into parenthood . Society itself must develop conditions that favor the home or a growing proportion of persons will choose the easier and safer and freer companionate , preferring to keep their union on the sex and comradeship level rather than undertake the burdens that befall parents . Mothers by Coercion. ? The task of the mother , as Professor Leta S. Hollingworth shows , is similar to that of the soldier as a contributor to the state . This writer 's indictment of social leadership for using the processes of control to induce women to bear children and confine themselves to home duties is justified by the facts . The desire for population has expressed itself in social attitudes that in the past have made the childless woman at least uncomfortable . Professor Hollingworth points out that not only have the costs and dangers of childbirth been minimized , but also that the average woman has been led , through the construetion of her ideals as well as by art , education , public opinion , belief and the law , to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personal wishes . It is not too much to say that in the past there has been a conspiracy against childlessness , which has been built not upon the deTHE // sire for good homes but rather upon exploitation , mass dominance and national confidence in the security of a multiplying population . It is no longer possible to manipulate social control to such an extent for the stimulating of births by means of pressure upon women . In the better homes children are not likely to come unwanted . Their appearance must more and more depend upon the sincere wish of both husband and wife for children and a willingness to assume the kind of handicaps that children bring . The family can compete with the companionate only by providing for many people a more desirable type of experience . The companionate will not be lessened by attack . The more complete form of married life can be encouraged by creating social situations that permit it to furnish more adequate satisfaction for most married men and women . Certainly the companionate is to be a persistent rival of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority . How many unwilling mothers we have had under the former regime can never be known , but it is most fortunate that society has at last progressed to the point ' where the home with children in it will be for most of those who establish it a definite choice . If in the past individuals have been pushed from the level of impulse to the more complete experience of parenthood , in our time they who go beyond the reaches of the companionate will more often proceed by conscious and deliberate volition . The Social Value of the Companionate. ? It is well that modern youth are not made to choose between living a single life and parenthood . The possibility of the companionate experience offers a compromise of decided social value . No one who recognizes the motives that influence people to postpone and refuse marriage will question the utility of the companionate . This new type of marriage relation will induce some to marry who , faced with the probability of becoming parents , would hesitate to enter matrimony . As the social currents are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reject marriage will grow more compelling . The companionate is not without its responsibilities . It asks more of human nature than does single life ; it contributes to the maturing of personality and the stabilizing of the emotions as well as to a larger sense of public obligations and even to more // exacting morals . It is well to remember also in a discussion of the companionate that those who form it do not always remain steadfast in their program . The experience itself tends toward greater maturity and a finer sense of values and often those who would not have married without confidence that they could maintain the companionate voluntarily go beyond this into the more difficult and more satisfying experiences of parenthood . It is especially likely to be true of the woman that not until she has enjoyed several years of the comradeship of married life does she realize the strength of her own longing for children ; then , finding that the companionship of her husband . is not enough to feed her craving for intimate response , she determines to have children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure the woman gets from her companionate opportunity of mothering her husband . There will always be some for whom the companionate will act as a prelude to the more complete type of family life . If the companionate is an arrested human relationship , single life for the biologically mature is even more an obstruction of human development . Here again social pressure will be found unavailing except as society brings about conditions that make marriage more desirable and the single life less satisfying . Legislation. ? Legislation can of course affect the growth of the companionate . Legislation that adds to the handicap of parents will automatically act as an encouragement of the easier type of marriage relationship . The influence of legislation upon home life is often practically forgotten by those who pass laws with attention upon certain objectives , which , although desirable in themselves , are obtained by regulations that hamper the having and rearing children . Our income tax laws have been written with much more thought of the possibility of easily bringing in the necessary funds with the least disturbance of business than of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of the need of keeping the interests of the home ever in mind in passing legislation that influences family life as the trend toward the companionate grows more apparent . In the effort more nearly to equalize the social burdens of the orthodox family and the companionate , legislators must beware of fixing upon the companionate too great handicaps by the passing of taxation regulations , for it // will be easy to induce a more ominous trend toward single life and the avoidance of all marriage by over-penalizing the companionate . A Positive Program. - The companionate must be treated as a serious change in family relationships . For many it is to be the desirable , even the conscientious type of family . The prosperity of the more mature form of family life demands a positive program . It is only by building up the most favorable conditions for wholesome and successful parenthood that society can meet the problem thrust upon it by the coming of the companionate . Education , that does so little specifically to foster family life , must assume a new task with zeal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most emphatic in their demand that they be given instruction that will help them to enter marriage well prepared . Likewise from young mothers of intelligence is coming a request , which has become irresistible , for concrete assistance in dealing wisely with their children . The friends of the family must look to education rather than to legislation or social pressure for the means by which the orthodox family may win its fair share of adherents . The companionate is itself in no small measure evidence of an inadequate and uninterpretive education which distorts the values of life . If the companionate reduces the number of families with children , it will at the same time tend to elevate the general level of family life . The companionate is not born of new motives in human experience . It would have come in the past if it had been possible and if social conditions had stimulated its development as modern life has done . The right sort of educational preparation for marriage and home life will give the great majority of youth the courage to undertake the full task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of relationship calls forth moral qualities that more than compensate for the limitations placed upon the parents by their obligations . It is only in the superficial sense that there is real conflict between parent and child . When Sumner said : " The interests of parents and children are antagonistic ; the fact that there are or may be compensations does not affect the primary relation between the two , " 8 he was oblivious to // the deeper and more significant moral advantages that the child brings the parent . The Problem of Population. ? It is necessary in considering the social significance of the companionate to consider its relation with what is known as the problem of population . The relation between the number of people that must be fed and the food available for their support is a matter of the largest concern to society and one that since the publication of Malthus ' famous " Essay on Population " has been much discussed . The great growth in the world 's population during the nineteenth century , an increase of approximately one hundred per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth could continue to multiply at such a rate without a necessary decline in the standards of living . In the years before the Civil War the population of the United States increased over one-third of its total population each decade . With this increase of numbers there occurred a noticeable advance in the general standards of living . During the latter half of the nineteenth century we have in most European countries and in the United States a decline in the birth-rate . In this country immigration has had an important influence upon the increase of population and upon the birth-rate of the native stock . Partly because of economic competition between the natives and the new settlers and in part as a result of other social and economic conditions which would have operated had there been no immigration , the size of the families of native American stock has constantly decreased and this gradual displacement of the original stock by the later arrivals and their offspring is popularly known as our problem of race suicide . It is clear that the influences which have tended to decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this viewpoint the companionate may be regarded as one of the preventive checks that work against a too great birth-rate . Even if desirable from this larger social outlook the companionate may nevertheless constitute , when considered in its domestic aspects , a serious social problem for the home . The fact that it is a means of giving social relief from excessive births does not change its influence upon those who maintain it . It may be both an advanTHE // tage from the standpoint of population and also an obstacle that prevents many from receiving the full satisfactions of marriage . The problem of population , however , is not merely one of quantity . The question of the quality of a people is also included and it is in this fact that the social risk of the popularity of the companionate is revealed . Many of those who choose to marry and go through life childless are just the people who by inheritance and favorable environment are well fitted to have children and give them a good preparation for life . The companionate can not be treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also is a relationship that influences the distribution of population . It leads a large proportion of those who are gifted and fortunate in material resources to deny themselves children and leaves to those less favored the opportunity to supply in excessive measure the population of the nation . CHAPTER VII COURTSHIP History of Courtship. ? Courtship has existed longer than man himself . We find it among the animals , particularly the birds , where it appears in a highly developed form . Anyone familiar with bird-life has seen in the pairing season the male wooing the female in a way suggestive of modern human courtship . The male tries to attract the attention of the female by strutting , display of feathers , flying about and uttering cries ; the female assumes a more passive role , but when he shows discouragement she at once changes her disposition and incites him to new interest . This play element in animal courtship is said to have an important biological function , since it acts as a stimulus for the male and the female and prepares them the better for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modern courtship , where it has chiefly a social function . There is also a combative element in animal courtship , especially among the higher animals , where two males fiercely contend for the possession of the female , not uncommonly in her presence . The struggle acts as a selective process , for in most cases the more vital animal becomes victor and transmits his qualities to the next generation . It apparently also acts as a sex stimulus , at least for the female . In modern human courtship this element of combativeness also appears , but like the play element its function is primarily social . It is not possible to make a satisfactory general description of courtship among savage people because of the diverse customs and differing interpretations made of them by European students . The problem of adequately picturing courtship among savage peoples is bound up with the more comprehensive task of directly estimating the position of woman . Speculations of half a century ago regarding the position of the savage woman , built upon the idea of the matriarchate and given extreme expression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the // anthropologists , in view of the information which we now have , showing explicitly that the older positions are untenable . Perhaps , however , of late there has been a tendency for the anthropologists to go too far in their statements of woman 's inferior social status . Not only is the problem baffling on account of the difference between the social theory and actual practice among primitive people , but particularly because of the temptation of the European to contrast savage situations with those familiar to him in his own society . It is clear from the immense amount of concrete data that has been gathered regarding the courtship habits of savage peoples that often the woman , as in modern life , has a real choice of mates and has to be won by her suitor by practices not essentially different from what we have in our own courtship . A savage Besisi in Kuala Langat on the Malay Peninsula , when asked how a man would speak to a woman he wanted to marry , and who was willing to accept him , replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you willing to take me , say ? " Woman. ? What mean you ? I merely follow you . How can I refuse ? " Man. ? I wish that too . " Woman. ? How can I refuse ? It is the man with whom it rests . I merely follow you , since I am but a woman . As I am a woman , I merely follow you . " Man. ? If that is truth , so be it . I will be father and mother to you , rest assured . " Woman. ? What mean you ? I follow you for a single day , but not for long . " Man. ? That is also my desire . " Woman. ? If you are savage , overbearing , harsh-spoken , if you are like that , if you are like a hornet , I shall be unable to endure it beyond tomorrow . " ' There have been great changes in the form of courtship during the historic era and at the present time the variations between nations and even sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of courtship shows marked changes and the evolution is still going on . Just now the tendency is unmistakSkeat and Bladgen , ' Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula , " vol. ii , p. 69. // ably toward permitting the woman to have a more open part in. the courtship without meeting social disapproval . She has always had a larger place than appears on the surface , but she is now more free to exercise openly and frankly prerogatives that in the past were supposed to be primarily man 's and which formerly she assumed with safety only when she was skillful in concealing her leading part . In this discussion it will be necessary to confine ourselves to modern American courtship . Among us today courtship may be said to have three purposes : first , it provides opportunity for the getting acquainted of the two persons ; second , it permits their testing ; and finally it allows their interest in each other to be developed to the point of preparation for marriage . Getting Acquainted. - The element of chase which has so large a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process by which the individual who takes the more active part wins the attention of the other . What we call flirtation is a mild form of courting and adolescents are always potentially ready to enter upon the exciting experience of courting or being courted . Certainly the normal adolescent boy or girl finds the opposite sex the most interesting thing in the world and needs little opportunity to start courting . The daydreams of adolescent girls have been studied more carefully than those of boys . We find , as we would expect , that in their daydreaming girls are for the most part reveling in pleasant imaginings that have to do with either love or social prestige . Even the second type of daydream is likely to be more or less related to thoughts of the other sex , since the coveted success is either the starting point of winning a boy 's regard or the imaginary delight is exhibited before the applauding male . We have no reason to suppose that the boy is less given to concentration on the subject of girls and courting when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imagination because of his more active life . Being free to engage more openly than the girl in aggressive courtship he does not need to hide his interests // in fiction , as must the girl , of whom social convention expects a more passive part in courtship . It is the woman 's part to attract the attention of the male and in this sense she is often the instigator of the courtship . Here is rooted the enormous control that fashion has over the dress of the woman , particularly the young woman . Those who know the working girl bear testimony to the fact that she will endure a great deal of physical discomfort and sometimes actual privation in order to have the necessary funds to spend on clothes that give her a fair chance in competing with her acquaintances for the favor of a man . At least in , the adolescent period the male is influenced by the dress of the girl and her conformity to the prevailing style of adornment . Some girls become adept in winning attention and often the intense pleasure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do not pass from the first stages and to the surprise of observers they finally do not marry at all . As soon as the courtship begins to be too serious they break it off , frequently using jealousy as the means , and then without loss of time they start another experience . A young girl of this sort was noticeable during a summer filled with flirtations because of the unusual form in which her skill showed itself . She picked up an acquaintance with a rather unattractive girl , her opposite in coloring , taste in dressing , and degree or vivacity . The flirt stuck closely to her drab friend and accepted no invitation that did not include both girls . Thus she cleverly placed herself against a background where she always excelled in contrast to the inferiority of appearance and attractiveness of the other girl . The latter was no loser since she had pleasures that would not have come to her otherwise and she felt no grievance . Whether the man-hunting girl had consciously worked out her program or fallen into it more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so well served her double purpose of exciting i he ardor of ' men and preventing the development of their courthip beyond the point where it gave her a sense of dominance . Winning the attention of the candidate for courtship is only I he first part of the girl 's role ; she must also incite pursuit . If she is the leading spirit in the affair it is usually necessary for her // to conceal this fact lest the man lose interest and turn aside . He craves dominance and the social stage is set for him to have the leading part . It may be only in appearance that he is in the foremost position , but while this situation complicates the girl 's courting , it also tends to make her more skilled in the art of retreat that subtly beckons . The girl must also know the opportune time for the ending of the pursuit by becoming " the steady , " the favored one from among those who were competing for the lover 's attention . If she surrenders too soon the courtship runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his zest as a wooer and in time the relationship breaks off . It is equally true that if he is kept too long on the hooks of indecision he may become discouraged and turn his eyes elsewhere so that he is captured by a rival . Commonly held to be a matter of intuition , it must really be observation and thought which enables the girl to know just when to bring the courtship to its climax . There can not be courtship without social conditions that make it possible . As many observers have pointed out , the working classes are most hampered . Often the girl can not invite her friend to her own home on account of its crowded condition or its poverty . Students of this problem criticize the regulations of parks and other public places that would naturally be used for courtship if there were no prohibitions . Indeed these regulations are exceedingly difficult to enforce because there is such great temptation on the part of the young to evade them and it is difficult even for the police to draw the line between what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices the way many adults who have left their courting days behind them react to any expression of attraction between young people one doubts whether , as Emerson once said , " All the world loves a lover . " The menace of the automobile is , in part at least , due to the inability of a multitude of city workers to get a reasonable chance for courtship . The great isolation that the automobile permits both makes it a favored choice for courting and leads , as does nothing else , to the incitement of vice . Not only does the automobile provide privacy , it also brings about anonymity . Thus there is temptation to exploit the girl who is not consciously accepting // danger but only embracing an opportunity , as she supposes , for legitimate courtship . Society must take a reasonable attitude toward courtship and our churches , particularly those that serve young people who live in congested quarters , should more frequently than they do provide opportunity for courtship . The advantage that the owner of an automobile has explains in part the stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners or left where they are likely to be found by the police . The newspapers from time to time record the tragic end of a joy ride which was taken in a stolen machine and since these disastrous endings must be a small proportion of the total number of such adventures there can be little doubt that the desire for courtship is one of the motives for the borrowing of automobiles without permission . College officials , for example , know that individuals who would not ordinarily appropriate another 's property have not hesitated to go off in an automobile which they have surreptitiously taken from somebody else 's garage , as a means of getting girls to join a party obviously planned for flirtation or courtship . Courtship during the period of pursuit is notorious for its financial temptation . The man often spends beyond his resources in order that he may win or hold the interest of the girl . He is expected to treat her , as a rule , although there is an increasing disposition , which should be encouraged , for the girl to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two is so nearly equal in many cases that the man is no better able than the girl to finance all the entertainments that they are likely to attend . A young girl sometimes breaks off an association with a young man in whom she had been interested , because he is too sensible to spend beyond his means or in such a way as to hamper his business or educational progress . Such a girl indicts the man for niggardliness when an actual investigation has proven that the man was supporting a relative , paying up his college expenses , or in some other way exercising the judgment or generosity that prophesied well for his stability as a future marriage partner . The woman likewise is tempted to spend too much money on dress . The judgment of a man , particularly in the late adolescent period , is exceedingly superficial and he is far more likely to be // interested in a girl who overspends , if she outdresses her competitors , than in one who has the good sense not to live beyond her earnings . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of petting . Petting is a revival of customs of the past which have permitted great freedom in courtship and stands in contrast with the conventional regime of the recent period of chaperonage . To some extent it is nothing new , except that it is a familiarity more commonly allowed , than in the last few generations , when it was countenanced only after courtship had passed out of its first stages and was close to actual marriage . The exacting girl of high standards finds herself today , according to her own testimony , face to face with a serious dilemma . I f she permits the freedom a man usually expects she loses selfrespect and is unhappy . If , on the other hand , she maintains her customary behavior she is said to be aloof and uninteresting and is quickly dropped . Just how far this is a serious problem in the actual courtship of our youth one can not know . It must be a problem of some size or it would not be brought up so often in conference by the modern girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate its origin . The increased frankness of men and . women , their more open courtship , their greater sophistication and the larger freedom of their period would naturally issue in a situation involving risk . The mischievous element in petting must not blind us to the impossibility of forcing the behavior of young men and women in their courtship back to the more restrained conventions of a decade ago . Moreover , it must be frankly confessed that the change is not so great as it appears , since it is in part only a more open expression of what was largely prevalent in courtship in the past . Parents who realize the seriousness of this problem will prepare their children for the ordeal of adolescence before it comes . The parents of the boy need to give most attention to teaching the safeguarding of the newer freedom in modern courtship . The liberties sometimes permitted in what are known as petting parties carry a danger not generally recognized , although its seriousness is realized by those who are familiar with its actual consequences . i n spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concrete cases demonstrate that she is far less able to protect herself than is usually supposed . Her ignorance is startling for he assumes the attitude of one thoroughly informed regarding matters of sex . A recent case which resulted in the pregnancy and hurried marriage of a college graduate forcefully illustrates the situation . Such terms as birth control were mere abstractions in this girl 's vocabulary and she asserted that the majority of her college mates like herself attempted to convey the impression that they were very knowing regarding physical sex when as a matter of fact they , , , were both curious and ignorant . Anyone who knows the effort the modern girl makes to get information concerning sex realizes that men are often deceived when they assume that their partner in petting is well informed and able to protect herself from serious risk . Some boys know no more than their girl friends , although like them they think themselves well informed , as is occasionally revealed by a study of cases of illegitimacy . There is often just enough knowledge to give a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their risk were clearly understood Courtship As a Test. ? There is necessarily , even when it is unconscious , an element of make-believe in courtship . One who is trying to impress his personality upon another is led to some deception . All highly emotional experiences make it hard for literal fact to emerge from the coloring of heightened susceptibilities , but courtship stands out as the most liable of all human experiences to take on the atmosphere of fiction . In the grip of so powerful an emotion as comes when courtship settles into what is popularly called love it is impossible even for the person concerned to know what is genuine and what is exaggerated , for this emotional experience has the power to magnify the self and give a substance to the finer qualities of the personality that was absent previously . All the changes that come with the intense affection expressed in courtship can not therefore be charged up to the dramatic or the deceptive element of courtship . It seems almost out of the question for these two highly wrought individuals to be frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a reasonable amount of real knowledge that can serve as a basis for determining the wisdom // of marriage , courtship sooner or later takes on a testing function and the fictitious is partially separated from the qualities that are characteristic of the person . This provision for the getting acquainted of the two persons in a way that will give them some clue as to the advisability of going on with their marriage plans or finally separating before they take that step is one of the most important functions of modern courtship . That it may accomplish its purpose the courtship must be of sufficient duration to permit the emotional attitudes to settle themselves somewhat . On the other hand , a very long courtship tends to exaggerate differences and little by little , there being no final commitment , a schism occurs and the marriage is repeatedly postponed until it does not occur at all . If courtship elates the two individuals enamoured of one another they must have an opportunity to come down from their super-level and see life without distortion . This can seldom be entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers that underlie the transition from courtship to marriage . The sharp break that for some individuals occurs so early in matrimony between the spirit of courtship and the actualities of marriage brings out the fact that each experience must be understood in relation to the other . The Development of Courtship ? Considering courtship as it has to do with society we find that it contains three distinct processes when it has a normal development . It stimulates sex attraction even though the physical element be absent from consciousness . There is also a sublimation of this sex element and in this way the physical side of the attraction is largely kept from consciousness As a consequence we have an idealization which is the most remarkable part of courtship and which makes this particular human relationship the favored topic of the literary artist . Human nature never reaches greater heights of unselfishness or appreciation of another 's character , so far as the emotions are concerned , although most persons happily married realize that they tread higher ranges of experience , but without such intense emotional upheaval . Anticlimax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement gives emphasis to this fact . " Man , " it is // said , " thinks of courtship as a means to an end ; woman , as an end in itself . " In so far as there is this difference between men and women , it is doubtful whether it is based on inherited peculiarities that accompany sex ; it is rather that the woman clings to the courtship because marriage so seldom gives her the social opportunity to transfer her interests satisfactorily . The man as a competitor in the world of affairs is forced not only to make a quick departure from the intense emotional relation of courtship , but to concentrate his interests in dealing with the obligations he can not escape . It follows , therefore , that the woman is more likely to sense the anticlimax when the days of courtship are ended by the beginning of marriage responsibilities . Perhaps she blames the man 's ambition in his business or even imputes to a lack of sincere affection the change which she meets with dismay . The conventional pictures of literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building up within her the impression that as soon as a man 's courtship fervor begins to wane , her power is dwindling and the most interesting period of her life is ended ; in the same way she has also been led to think that when practical interests have a large place in married life and the emotional tone of courtship and the honeymoon is lowered , the marriage has slipped from its original high plane of poetic idealism and henceforth must travel on the lower level of material advantage . It may take some years for the woman to come to the realization that her conception of higher and lower was a sentimental mixing of terms due to her immaturity of judgment , since the relationship of the young couple is of greatest social value when it ceases to be predominantly self-centered . We have reason to suppose that the modern girl has a better understanding of the true situation than had her mother . If there is to be wholesome married life the courtship must pass on and change its spirit by becoming a part of the calmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman who does not see this at first soon discovers it ; others suffer acutely in their futile attempt to continue courtship beyond its season . It would be an advantage for the comfortable development of the marriage relation if this necessary transformation from courtship to marriage fellowship were more commonly appreciated // by men so that they could more satisfactorily do their part to help the young bride look forward rather than backward as she feels the emotions of courtship ebbing away . It is false counsel to advise a young man to keep the spirit of courtship , for the new relationship makes the old incompatible , but it is good judgment on the part of every man to make his wife feel that she is not taken too much for granted and treated with an irritating certainty which was never present during courtship . It is well for both husband and wife , as a means of protecting themselves from too matter-offact a contact , for each to have a degree of privacy of thought and action as well as the opportunity for self-expression that was natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a transfusion of both personalities - that is so complete as to sink their association to a humdrum level . The Wedding. ? The wedding may well be considered the ceremony that either ends courtship or commences marriage , for it does both , It is usually to a large extent a family observance and so many considerations enter into its performance that the prospective bride and groom are seldom entirely free to arrange it according to their choice . There are decided advantages in a simple wedding since it frees the bride from fatigue and worry and the groom from nervous embarrassment just at the critical starting-point of their new life together ; for people who are not wealthy the wedding should also he inexpensive , for financial difficulties are only too likely to cause strain during the early part of married life when the cost of equipping a new home is coupled with lack of skill in the technique of household budgeting . The only risk connected with the simpler wedding is that the bride may be sensitive to the conventions which make the wedding in itself so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will regret the simplicity of the occasion . The present movement toward a greater equality of the sexes is influencing the wedding ceremony in a far more significant way than the omission of the bride 's promise to obey her husband . The wedding is taking a more reasonable place in the matrimonial program , and it is this perhaps that explains the tendency , which apparently is on the increase , for the young people to cut themselves away from all the difficulties of the wedding ceremony // as a family social event by quietly slipping to some other locality and getting married with the utmost simplicity . Although the press reports this as an elopement it is , of course , nothing of the sort , but an effort to avoid the ordeal of the wedding which in times past was thought of as the great climax of a woman 's career , and in our more normal period is considered merely the legalizing of a relationship which points forward , rather than an event of great significance in itself . Honeymoon. ? The honeymoon is a distinctly modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do with marriage . Its actual purpose is to give the newly married a propitious start in their new relationship with an opportunity to transfer safely from the atmosphere of courtship to the realities of marriage . This is the easier done if travel , a new environment or something that removes them from their wonted associations accompanies the change of status . The honeymoon , because it does constitute a transition from courtship attitudes to those of marriage , has a decided significance that may color the entire after-life of the married couple . It is here that anticlimax is felt by the woman who lingers as long as possible in the delights of courtship . The honeymoon program sometimes in itself menaces the wholesome start of marriage . The wedding may leave one or both life partners tired , nervous and supersensitive . The travel that conventionally goes with the honeymoon may be unduly prolonged so that it results in excessive fatigue . There may be also financial worry on the part of the man , for people who , like railroad ticketagents , know the honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips are undertaken that are too expensive , and sometimes have to be shortened at the last moment because of a shortage of funds . In contrast with the mistakes of such couples we have the opposite risk of the wealthy who extend the honeymoon to great lengths or give it an abnormal testing by some such experience as a cruise around the world in a yacht which tears the two people from their accustomed environment for too long a time , depriving them of their usual pleasures and at the same time forcing them to depend exclusively on each // other for companionship until the association becomes monotonous and irritating . Familiarity with the origin of family difficulties of a serious character teaches one that a considerable percentage of separations start during the honeymoon experience . This is often due to the nervousness and fatigue of one or both members of the newly founded family . Incidents and remarks that would otherwise receive little attention are magnified out of all proportion by the almost hysterical individual and from that moment a wedge enters the union and gradually forces asunder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well illustrated by a case reported by Morton Prince . XYZ had her feelings hurt seriously on the first night of her honeymoon . It happened that her husband went down into the hotel lobby where he met some political acquaintance and became greatly interested in a political discussion . Strange as it may seem , he forgot his waiting bride and when a few hours later he returned to her and explained what had happened she was not only terribly hurt but also angry and determined , to use her own words , that she " would be hanged if " she would show any response to his affection . The result was that she became a victim of a neurotic dissociation which completely ruined her marriage by producing a state of long-lasting asexuality.3 Kinds of Honeymoon. ? There are various kinds of honeymoon , but the conventional short travel trip is exceedingly common . Anyone who goes about much is familiar with the couple who start their journey with a send-off from their friends that advertises what perhaps needs no announcement since the selfconsciousness of the young couple would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interest of curious fellow-travelers and all in all they have a bad beginning for the kind of transition into marriage their interests demand . It would be difficult to suggest a substitute for this sort of wedding trip , but it would be a great advantage if it became a matter of wedding ethics to allow the bridal couple to slip off quietly without the horseplay that is always annoying and sometimes goes to dangerous lengths . It is encouraging to notice the growth of the unconventional ' Prince , " The Unconscious , " p. 436. // honeymoon . The automobile trip escapes all the ostentatiousness of the usual steamboat or railroad journey . There is some tendency also toward camping trips and for those qualified to enjoy a semiprimitive life such a honeymoon is ideal . An owner of a cottage beautifully located in the mountain section of one of our eastern states advertises his most attractive summer place for honeymooners and it is constantly occupied by the type of people who appreciate wild nature . Bridal couples who have a touch of the vagabond spirit are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their honeymoon . Anything that avoids publicity is an advantage , for experience in dealing with family difficulties reveals the frequency of wedding-journey strain as the primary cause of estrangement in couples that were destined otherwise to a happy married life . The honeymoon is not a trip for the pleasure of traveling ; it is a social convention which has come about as a means of providing favorable conditions for the transition from courtship to wedlock . It has its serious side as a preparation for successful marriage . e CHAPTER VIII FAMILY INCOMPATIBILITIES Beginning the Home . The most critical period of marriage , as a rule , is its beginning . No undertaking in life is so influenced in its later course by the conditions of its start as is marriage . There are various reasons for this . The happenings at the commencement of married life are embedded in the emotions . in a way that magnifies their importance out of all proportion to the meaning they would have under ordinary circumstances ; subsequent events also are apt to take on a coloring due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigued , worried or self-conscious either husband or wife is when passing into marriage through the gateway of the wedding , the greater is the risk of emotional stress with its rapid fluctuations and inconsistencies . Even when no strong emotional undercurrent exists , the early days of married life are particularly significant , for immediately there commences an attempt to reorganize the lives of the two persons who were previously adjusted to different circumstances and other individuals . Even if the courtship has been unusually long and frank the new relationship completely changes the interaction of the two personalities and forces a different state of intimacy . It must not be thought from this that there is a definite procedure through which husband and wife pass in the readjusting process of the honeymoon . Human nature does not operate by a fixed rule . Some individuals slide with little difficulty into the new relationship . Others have considerable trouble , but once they come to their new understanding all goes well and they remember with a smile their serious efforts to meet problems that as they look backward appear so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adjustment , but the passing of time reveals that they were really only extending courtship into marriage and postponing the inevitable disillusionment . When they finally settle down in grim earnest to meet the problems of living together it grows increasingly clear that they can not be happy together . Then there are some // who at once discover the folly of their marriage , their unfitness for one another , and a cleavage begins immediately and widens with time . Whatever the situation at the beginning of marriage , the current starts flowing toward or away from a successful family life . Instruction as to marriage problems can not prevent this necessary process of adjustment , but a previous understanding of possible difficulties does help to make the transition easier and its dangers fewer . The greater risk of committing some costly mistake falls upon those who have no insight into the testing they are receiving in their attempt to find happiness together . Attempting too Much. ? There is a disposition among moralists in writing or talking about family failures to dismiss the problem of adjustment by charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind even when they justly catalog the faults of character of married persons add nothing that helps in the understanding of a family situation or that protects individuals from wrecking at the start their hope of matrimonial success . What we do need is concrete studies of individuals entering marriage , their reactions and later happiness or unhappiness . Such information is at present meagre , and what we have is more a product of unhappy than of happy homes . A mistake often made in the first steps of home-making , perhaps more common among those who achieve happiness than among those who fail , is the blunder of taking too seriously some part of the new experience . It is more often the bride who conies to grief by too much concern . She has heard much of the need of changing her habits and committing herself thoroughly to the matrimonial venture . Driven by love and influenced by her emotional state of mind , she cuts herself off from all her old ways , interests , friends and relatives , and ties herself utterly to her new experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overboard too much , but not until she has lost associations that she ought to have retained or interests that would have kept her from a morbid concentration upon her home . She regrets the friends she has dismissed , who now have departed from her life because they have been so carelessly treated and have been actually given to understand that they are no longer a very essential part of her world . After a little she looks back to what she threw away , blames the // marriage and assumes that married life requires this breakage . It is well to consider a matrimonial undertaking as a long trip that needs a program which one can find satisfying not merely at the start but for the whole journey . Fair it is to charge thoughtless indifference to the new duties of home-making to selfishness , but not the over-conscientious regard which may be equally destructive of family satisfaction . The wife that begins home life with too much concern for the housekeeping portion of her new undertaking provides a good illustration of the risks of attempting too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily hurt by any suggestion of criticism or failure of recognition . The graver danger is that in fulfillment of her program she takes over too much of the home load and her husband accepts her sacrifice as a matter of course and thus hurts his own development and at the same time injures her by making her temporary spurt a routine . Advantage of Preparation. ? It is a decided advantage for any girl , whatever her social situation , and even if her home duties are limited to light housekeeping , to have had definite preparation for marriage and home-making . Young women who have received in their school career instruction in well-conducted home economics courses prove the advantage of such training by the greater ease with which they assume their new task . At present , however , many girls leave the high school with practically no instruction that can help them in the marriage career most of them will eventually choose and to which nearly all look forward . It is doubtful whether a high school training that does next to nothing to prepare for marriage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are planning to continue their education in college . Every girl in the high school should be given some insight into the problems that marriage brings , for such instruction is a practical and economical way of lifting the standards of the home . Since there are many girls who do not enter high school there is need also of similar courses , more elementary in character , in the grammar school . The adolescent girl is not , of course , ready for such instruction as can properly be given the matured person about to marry , but the // value of such courses as can be taught in the high school is clearly demonstrated . Public school training that seriously attempts to prepare the girl for the obligations of living , and especially of living in a home , must include studies now listed under home economics . A place for such courses can easily be found by simply pushing aside such required subjects as geometry that came into the curriculum in the days of meager educational resources and continue because of the power of inertia and tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the schools would be most happily supplemented in many cases , for the average home in its normal procedure has opportunities for practical training of the greatest value . It is true that it is often easier for the mother to do the work herself or to farm out to the daughter definite routine tasks in a way that reduces to the smallest proportion their educational value by allowing no opportunity for personal initiative and no sense of self-chosen responsibility . No child can be expected to begin at the level of efficiency attained by the mother after years of experience . From the mother 's point of view the child may not keep house well . Expenses may run up , dishes be broken and the house get cluttered , but all this would be a necessary part of the learning process . It is certainly better for the girl who is likely sometime to become a bride to have some experience in the well-established home of her mother than to have everything to learn in the first days of marriage when she is forced to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will answer this suggestion with the statement that their daughters are not interested in housekeeping and can not he induced to try their hand at actual management of the home . This is a confession on the part of the mother of her own failure in t he bringing up of her daughter , and her blunder usually goes back to the very early years when the child wishing to play house and " help " her mother in the different household operations was denied the privilege because she was so great a bother . The mother 's refusal to allow the child to invest her interest in the work of the home led to the daughter 's later indifference , which in time to come is bound to make unnecessarily difficult the early married lire of the daughter and her husband . A mother does not do her duty by merely teaching the child to follow directions ; household // management involves the ability to form accurate judgments and make careful decisions based on the practical knowledge that comes only from first-hand experience gained without the hampering protection of ever-present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories , stores and offices have a decided conviction that the business girl is not so well trained for actual homekeeping when she enters marriage as was her mother . Unless the mother makes a special effort to train the child this is the result to be expected when life presents so many interests that compete against those related to future home-making . The fact that so many mothers have neither the patience nor desire to help their daughters get practical homekeeping experience makes it all the more imperative that the school do more than it does at present . It is well to remember also that many mothers are so inefficient as wives and housekeepers that they can not give their children good training ; and what they do is more likely to handicap the young bride than to help her . The boy is less prepared than the girl for the obligations of home-making , and if we want better homes we must not leave his training out of the program . He also needs specific instruction and practical experience both at school and at home . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financing of a home so that he may have an idea of his future wife 's budget problems . Our traditional idea that a man does his part in earning the family income is deceptive . If only one earns , both spend , and there can not be the best sort of cooperation in expenditure unless the husband understands to some degree the financial side of homekeeping . It is also desirable in these days when good homes are more and more products of cooperative housekeeping that would have been ridiculed two decades ago , that the husband have some experience in the tasks of everyday housekeeping , especially such essentials as cooking . Wives become sick , go to hospitals , require help at the time of childbirth , even take over part- or fall-time jobs , and the tendency for men to help somewhat in the housework under such circumstances is already more prevalent than is generally supposed . Boys enjoy opportunities to cook and , if given a chance to learn , in later life never regret their knowledge , indeed are more // likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ordinary occupation . Disillusionment. ? The illusive element in all human experience has been commented upon by philosophers since the days of the Greek thinkers , but marriage has been singled out by them as the most vivid illustration of the inevitable disappointment that comes to one who is forced to bring his hope of happiness in contact with the given facts of actual life . Poetry , fiction , and most especially the small talk of the sophisticated adult who prides himself upon his practicality , is replete with the idea that disappointment in marriage is something axiomatic . Much of this is the product of a sensible interpretation of common happenings . Men and women do enter marriage with expectations of perfect happiness furnished by an imagination that , driven by the powerful flow of emotions and unrestrained by experience , pictures a state of bliss that nothing human could satisfy . Disillusionment in such cases is bound to come , not as the result of a serious deception in the relationship itself but simply because fancy must at last surrender to fact . Such experiences occur constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way and another to fulfill his cravings . The happy husband and wife look back upon these earlier adjustments with a tender sympathy but with no sense of having been betrayed by false hopes . The fact is that more was gained by the ordeal than was lost . This transition from love-making to marriage does hold an element of danger and becomes for some married couples a cause of psychological incompatibility . The appeal of courtship for some persons lies almost wholly in its fantasy . They insist upon remaining in an atmosphere that gives them the luxury of the daydream . If the husband or wife becomes the instrument by which such a person is brought back to reality or even pushed toward it , at once upon the head of the ill-fated partner in matrimony falls the blame for having spoiled marriage . The daydreamer who has carried on from childhood the habit of castle-building is the kind of person who can not make the adjustment from courtship to family responsibility required by wholesome marriage . Any attempt to bring the family life into accord with actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimonial alliance is chided with bitterness for lack of affection . It is necessary in such cases to notice that any other relationship involving responsibility and adjustment to obligations would have revealed the character-defect just as did marriage . Marriage tempts such persons because courtship offers an exceptional chance for the daydreamer 's revels , and they accept marriage as a means of prolonging this delightful experience . These daydreamers detect the ordeal awaiting them in other relationships , and either refuse to enter or else try to protect themselves from the rude awakening which they always dread . Marriage is not justly charged with having misled the type of person whose whole life is a pilgrimage in deceit . The woman who declares that marriage offers nothing except the pleasures of courtship and of the wedding confesses her inability to pass into a mature family relationship , and her statement that marriage is a failure is actually a confession of an infantile character that forbids a genuine trial of marriage . Marriage is by its nature a testing undertaking , for those who are trying to escape adult responsibilities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to blame their partners than to accept criticism for their own failure . Thus it comes about that family life is at times marked almost at its beginning by the unwillingness of husband or wife to accept a normal , sincere commitment to the tasks of married life . It is equally true that the opposite fault show 's itself in family life . All the idealism and thought of another 's welfare that some individuals ever experience in any large way appears in courtship . After marriage these persons flatten out and settle down to a Main Street humdrum that blankets all the hopes of their finer-grained spouse . Protest against making marriage a deadening routine is not evidence of a daydreamer 's hostility to the meeting of life squarely , but of a discernment of the tragedy of allowing the finer attitudes of early marriage to evaporate . A wife or husband who sees that the family life has sunk through the other 's indifference into an endless round of toil or social dissipation has a just cause for feeling cheated . It is difficult to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human // values , but impossible to see a relationship that opens with the promise characteristic of the beginning of marriage fade into dull or even coarse routine without profound resentment . Here also is born a psychological incompatibility . Courtship can at times stir into temporary flame what appears to be noble passion , but due to thinness of personality the fire soon dies down . Even if the attitude was genuine during courtship it appears wilful deceit to the other member of the new family who feels victimized by the marriage partner 's pretenses . Sometimes an incompatibility is caused by one of the married couple discovering that he or she has been consciously deceived by the other . This may be in regard to something comparatively trivial , which in spite of its unimportance comes to have a separating influence . For example , in one case the family difficulty originated from the wife 's discovery that her husband chewed tobacco and had secretly continued the habit throughout courtship . It was a disquieting thought that there had been a determined effort to hide from her something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be trusted in other matters ? She reacted at once to the suggestion of suspicion and for a time it seemed as if her married life would come to a quick end . Pride probably saved her from a public confession of failure but she never developed genuine confidence in her husband . If the husband or wife becomes careless in dress or in any other habits there is danger of the mate 's becoming irritated and disappointed . What starts as a feeling of disapproval and occasional embarrassment grows by constant association until it finally turns to shame and anger . Perhaps the more careful and ambitious member of the household develops the idea that the bad ways of the other are an obstacle to success for both of them and then hate sets in . Family disasters of this type are not the result of the common transition from courtship , with its element of acting , to the serious tasks of marriage , but rather the product of a moral letting down of character which the more efficient individual resents . A Stimulus of Disagreeable Thoughts. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir up disagreeable ideas in the mind of another . Even plants and animals come to have the power of suggesting the unpleasant to those who in childhood had // some unhappy experience with a particular plant or animal . Perhaps certain flowers bring always a spontaneous feeling of repulsion . This is even more frequent with reference to definite foods , especially when they bring back memory of some illness connected with them . We have habitual likes and dislikes that appear at once when the appropriate stimulus acts upon us . It may be that a person with a certain color of hair or a definite mannerism in walking or talking starts disagreeable feelings in the consciousness of one with whom he comes into contact . The mental mechanism holds in the close contact of home life and in this way one individual is said to get on the nerves of another . This is a type of complex-reaction that grows rapidly in continuous association and often the originator of the emotional recoil is utterly oblivious to the influence he generates . At first the feeling of repulsion may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family , later spreading until the entire personality stimulates the victim adversely . Mrs. L , the wife of a doctor , has left her home and is planning to get a divorce . Her marriage was for spite . She became angry over a note incorrectly interpreted , written by the young man to whom she was engaged , turned from him and a few months later married a doctor with whom she had meanwhile become acquainted . At first the marriage appeared successful but after a year trouble began to brew . She complained of habits that annoyed although she had to admit they were rather trivial and balanced by other qualities most desirable . The real situation immediately appeared when she told of her first engagement , her regret that she foolishly broke it off , and declared that the habits of her husband that annoyed her always suggested her first lover since they were just opposite to his ways . Clearly her husband had become an innocent victim of her regrets by stimulating thoughts that she found painful . Becoming an Obstacle. ? Another social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband or wifa seems to the other an obstacle to ambition . The following case illustrates a problem of this kind . Miss K , the youngest and most spoiled of several children , recently became pregnant . The father of her offspring was a young college student who had still one year of study before graduaFAMILY // tion . He was as much surprised as the girl when he learned of her predicament and before he could adjust himself to the position in which he was placed the girl 's mother entered the discussion with demands that he marry at once . It is probable that he recognized this as his duty ; in fact there was no reason to suppose that the idea of marriage was not attractive to both young people . The mother of the girl , however , displayed the same emotionalism that was the cause of her having had some serious difficulty with each one of her children . The young man was dragged to the church pastor , threatened with various penalties if he did not consent to immediate marriage ; indeed greater mismanagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been asked by one of the relatives who could view the problem without emotion to give counsel . I pointed out the need of winning the sympathy and stressing the sense of honor of the young husband-to-be so that his quick change of plans might not seem something forced upon him by outside pressure as a form of retaliation . The girl confessed at once that she was the more responsible party in the events that led to her conception . Since she had been given no help whatever by her mother I decided that the latter was the really responsible person . The mother refused to cooperate in any tactful handling of her future son-in-law but rather enjoyed to the full the opportunity to upbraid both of the young people , especially the man . The college student was hurled into the marriage ceremony in a most insulting manner and soon trouble began between the newly married couple . What I prophesied as the most likely thing if the girl 's mother continued her dominance soon occurred . The young husband had of course immediately left college " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother , although it would have been entirely feasible for him to have completed his remaining year . Ile found work in a few months that made it necessary for him to leave the country and soon he was safe where be could not be brought back for desertion . Were he to return he would discover that he could easily become legally free for his wife , a few months after the birth of her child , became pregnant a second time and the offender was one whom she knew only a few hours and never saw a second time . // It is easy to see that in such a case as this the young man , forced out of college into a course of action incited by the desire for revenge rather than by any serious effort to help work out a difficult situation for the best welfare of both young people , would have a sense of grievance and would think of his wife as an obstacle to his ambition . Even assuming that he was justly punished for his unconventional behavior , it is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only result in developing in him the feeling that she had spoiled his life . By the process of time through constant suggestion she became to him the obstacle between him and happiness . Successful marriage was impossible . Persuading a young college girl to leave her education uncompleted for marriage is always a venturesome experiment . Even when the marriage turns out well , as it fortunately often does , there is a shade of regret that hampers the fellowship of husband and wife . The wife frequently feels that another year or two of delay to enable her to get her degree would have been far wiser . If the hazard created by this short-circuiting of educational preparation were more generally understood , the right sort of man would seldom urge it . There is greater danger when the man 's plans are disrupted by a premature marriage than when this happens to the woman , since in the case of the man this more often means the thwarting of his career . It is , for example , a serious handicap that a couple takes over at marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business or moves from some advantageous environment in order to marry . At the time this sacrifice may seem normal , if it contributes to the happiness of the bride , but in after years when it is plain that financial success has been flouted at the time when it was almost within reach , the sacrifice seems foolish and becomes a source of deep regret . There are myriad ways by which one member of a household comes to be an obstacle to the happiness of the other so that chronic dissatisfaction follows . If there were greater frankness , especially in the first months of marriage , so that this feeling of being hampered would be confessed and talked over freely , many situations that go from bad to worse could be handled rationally at the start , thereby only cementing affection the harder . It is surprising how // difficult such confidential discussions are in the relationship of marriage . In business and professional enterprises there is a far greater freedom in squarely facing the beginning of an incompatibility than there is in most homes . Incompatibility the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife to exploit the other is one of the most common and perplexing of marriage difficulties . We can assume that from the start of the homemaking one is a little more sacrificing and affectionate than the other . Being part of the new experience of pleasant intimacy , this is rather pleasant for both and it runs rapidly on until on one side there is a strong desire to sacrifice and on the other a great willingness to accept the sacrifice . If this lasts for any length of time ? and once started it often persists throughout life ? the resultant family situation is distinctly bad for both . It has come about naturally enough , but it acts more and more against the family welfare . If it does not last , when the movement swings back to something more normal there may be on the part of the person who received the sacrifice the feeling that the other 's affection has weakened . Experience shows that it is the woman rather than the man that is apt to be too prone to sacrifice . It is therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the exploiter . The one who gives , develops , though not so far as judgment is concerned ; the other becomes unfair and selfish , even childish . v Resentment at Transferred Mother-love. ? Another difficulty which has to be frankly faced occurs in greater or less degree in most marriages . Few men realize that a woman 's affection has at least two emotions , tied together when she marries a man but sooner or later separated when she becomes a mother . One is the wife-attitude and one is the mother-attitude . When she first marries she thinks of her husband in a double way . He is her husband : he is also her child . With the coming of a baby into the family group the two attitudes are immediately divided even though the wife did not herself anticipate this . Once the division has taken place things can never be as they were before . Another interest has come into the life of the young woman which in some ways rivals her earlier affection ; her mother attitude will now he bestowed where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ist SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE FAMILY uncommon for the husband to react against this change , feeling that his wife has ceased to care for him in the intense way that she did . Then the man will make remarks that show that although he is fond of the child , its coming means for him that he must take second place . In some women the mother attitude may seem more powerful than the wife attitude ; in others the reverse appears true . But the two attitudes do not compete with each other . They were bound together in the beginning when there was no child to receive the mother affection , and now that there are two distinct objects for the two kinds of affection one attitude has been separated from the other . Whether one is stronger than the other does not matter ; the husband must take what is his . If women are deeper in their affection as mothers than as wives no advantage comes from denying this . Whichever way the balance swings the family life can go on smoothly as long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same dual affection occurs also in the man . This seems to be getting to be more true as man 's love of offspring is increasing . For a long time woman has cared for the children more than has the man , but fatherhood is rapidly catching up . Occasionally it happens that a wife feels hurt by the removal of her husband 's father-affection from her to their children , not realizing that she is trying to force the man to keep together things that are naturally separated ? affection for mate and child . Jealousy. ? The great enemy of love is jealousy . When jealousy creeps into the home love packs up and gets ready to depart , for it can not thrive under the perpetual tyranny of a jealous spouse . Yet nearly all jealousy is unfounded . It is the culmination of childish habits that have never been cast aside as the jealous person found it easier to conceal them than to go through the painful process of uprooting them . Babies demand the exclusive attention of their mother ; twoyear-olds have been known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken from them the position of supreme importance in the household ; even the child of five is apt to feel pangs of jealousy on hearing the first wail of a newborn infant in the home and realizing that the name and prerogatives of " Baby " are to descend to another . Children tend to be jealous of a brother or // sister who receives praise , toys or privileges that seem more desirable than the ones given to them . Most of us outgrow our infantile habit of giving way to jealousy but a few people allow the habit to grow stronger with the passing of years because they suffer from a deep sense of inferiority and can not accustom themselves to the idea that they merit as good treatment as others ; therefore they fear lest they be given only what they would measure out as their own deserts . These people who are driven into jealousy by their inferiority complex are not necessarily inferior in any way to those with whom they compare themselves , but their lack of self-confidence keeps them ever on the watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm of jealousy . During courtship the jealous person holds in check his suspicions and tries to act like other adults , but once the marriage knot is firmly tied he goes back to his old ways with a slump , for now he seems bent on making up for the difficult self-control he had to exercise while winning a mate . Be may dig up trivial occurrences of the courtship that were supposedly forgotten by both young people and rehearse them until he has worked himself into a jealous rage . At the slightest suggestion of rivalry in the affection of the mate , whether from parent-in-law , work or social activities , he may bury himself in the depths of bitter jealousy . The other member of the marriage partnership hardly dares to look at the opposite sex , much less show any of the courtesy convention demands ; but it makes little difference what is done , jealousy can easily feed L. itself , and the home life is poisoned by unfounded suspicions . Jealousy that is not a hangover from childhood may be caused by social suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter of one 's friends make jealousy seem the normal reaction to certain stereotyped situations , thus precluding the unemotional talking over of circumstances whose wrong interpretation causes hard feelings in both young people . The person whose jealous trend is not of long standing can free himself of the inclination before it becomes an integral part of his disposition if he has the courage and determination to carry out a long and difficult process of readjustment and can obtain the needed advice from // one who understands the mechanism of this vexing adult behavior-problem. j Relatives-in-law. ? Relatives , and particularly mothers-in-law , are notoriously troublesome to the newly married . Even the savages by their taboos may have registered their realization of the problems in family life caused by unwise mothers-in-law . It is a common observation that some of our marriage failures originate in the too great interference of the mother-in-law or the overdependence of the newly wedded man or woman upon the mother . The difficulty must be considered in its larger and more significant aspects . The mother-in-law has become a symbol of the natural obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to establish itself as an independent unit , free from the surveillance of either of the parent-families . The marriage of their child means to parents a breaking away from long-accustomed relationships usually maintained since childhood , while for the young married couple it brings about a new alliance which automatically includes considerable intimacy and therefore has to set earlier associations at arm 's length . It is not strange that the mother-in-law , husband and wife all find a degree of difficulty in establishing the new status . By far the most strain is felt by the mother-in-law . Not only must she give up her precedence in affection to another , but she must have the insight to see when her help is really needed and when it is far wiser to let the young couple work out their own matrimonial salvation . , Her ever-present temptation is to attempt to give the young people the benefit of her experience on every possible occasion , forgetting how hard it is for anyone to profit from the experience of another and how necessary it is that the new home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has explained the inner protest many mothers make against their son or daughter becoming independent of early home ties . There are mothers whose whole policy has been that of repressing the personality of their children . They have made use of the strong affection between mother and offspring as a method of holding their child in a subserviency which we are . wont to call a mother-fixation . This program of keeping the child dependent has become a settled conspiracy against his maturing // to the point of self-reliance and what we think of as typical motherin-law behavior is merely the continuation of a life-long policy . The dominance of the mother is likely to be resented after Marriage even when it has been accepted by the child as a matter of course up to this time . It is received with instinctive hostility by the child-in-law , who , unfettered by previous subordination , easily sees the significance of the interference and struggles against it immediately . The contest is accepted by both parties to it as a real trial of strength and in its heat there is risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests are not altogether on the same side ; this tension may increase until it forms the basis of a permanent separation of interest between the young folks . It is not hard to indict the mother-in-law but the fact is that social conventions are in part responsible for her attitude . In the recent past and even yet in a multitude of cases , in certain sections and in the class of persons who are inadequately trained for life it is customary for the mother to concentrate upon her children and develop no serious interests outside her home . This is the program expected of the mother ; its acceptance is held to be the mark of an ideal home . The consequence is that as her children leave her the mother finds herself suddenly stripped of many of the habitual activities that have become by repetition the very substance of her life . Without children to assist , plan for and protect her career seems all at once like a ship that has dropped its anchor . As she has gone on in life she has never taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape of each child leaves her with a greater void . The educated woman of the present time sees the cause of this disaster more clearly than did her mother and she is much more likely to welcome her child 's maturity than to try to prevent it . The mother of only one or two children runs a greater risk of encroaching upon their proper field of development hut if she faces her problem intelligently and with knowledge of its cause she also may succeed in managing her role without bitterness in herself or damage to her child . This is much the same problem that the man meets who finds himself forced to give up the control of his business to a younger successor . If the older man has no strong interests outside his // business , it has become a proverb that he will fade quickly upon retirement . The mother-in-law 's problem is therefore not something primarily belonging to women , but the difficult adjustment that awaits the man or woman who has lived too narrow a life . The mother 's solution is complicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caring for her child . Fathers occasionally find the transference of a child , especially a daughter , to another home as severe a testing as do mothers and thus the father-in-law problem originates . We find aunts , sisters , brothers and foster parents also testifying by their reactions that the protest against the breaking away from home-ties to the beginning of a new home-circle is a human weakness rather than a fault characteristic only of mothers-in-law . It would be easier to make a gradual adjustment satisfactory to each member of the tragic triangular contest if only the sonor daughter-in-law were more patient , cool and sympathetic . Jealousy flares up quickly and there is a sharp resentment that all ties with the former home are not instantly cut . It seems like criticism of the marriage itself ; actually it is proof of a fondness for homelife that sooner or later without inner wrenching of spirit can be transferred from the old to the new family . Ruth 's commitment is not to be expected of every individual who enters matrimony , for it is too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents ' fellowship that they start marriage with the rigorous declaration , " Entreat me not to leave thee and to return from following after thee ; for whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest I will lodge ; thy people shall be my people and thy God , my God . " It is well to notice that this high resolve was spoken to a mother-in-law and expresses the conviction of the author that an ideal understanding is possible between those who are relatives-in-law . The commonness of the in-law incompatibility must not mislead one into supposing that the relationship is inherently mischievous . Although the association is a searching test of the wholesomeness of character we have every reason to suppose that the greater proportion of those who pass through it meet their trial with success . CHAPTER IX DIVORCE AND DESERTION Modern Life and Divorce. ? The trend in modern life toward an increase in divorce is unmistakable . Although the record of this country is particularly bad with reference to the number of divorces granted , the influences that are stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment of modern man and woman rather than from social conditions distinctly American . The forces that tend to bring about divorce are in some countries checked front expression by repressive legislation or the influence of the churches that hold to a sacramental interpretation of marriage and refuse to recognize the right of divorce . There is , indeed , unmistakable evidence in all progressive civilized countries of the working of social influences that favor divorce . It is , however , the American situation in which we are interested . The History of Divorce in the United States. ? As has been previously stated , the American colonies differed with reference to the granting of divorces . Although we find variations in the New England colonies , the general trend was in harmony with the teachings of early Protestantism ; marriage was made a civil contract and the right of legal divorce became a logical deduction . The Southern colonies , on the other hand , under the influence of the teaching of the Church of England , moved in the opposite direction , and absolute divorce was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void of any reference to the subject of divorce restriction.l The middle colonies also were conservative in their attitude toward divorce , their sentiment being more in sympathy with the practice of the southern colonies than with the liberal policy of their New England neighbors . During the latter half of the nineteenth century not only was there a sharp rise in the divorce rate in America , but also a multi- // plying and still more liberal legislation covering the legal grounds for divorce . Sectional differences in regard to divorce still exist , the high divorce rate of New England , the Middle Western States , the Pacific States and the Rocky Mountain States contrasting markedly with the low rate of the Southern States . Statistics of Divorce. ? The United States Government has made four investigations of the American situation with reference to marriage and divorce . The first , conducted by the former Department of Labor , covered the twenty-year period from 1867 to 1886 ; the other three , made by the Bureau of the Census , reported the twenty-year period 1887 to 1906 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total number of divorces reported for 1922 was 148,815 as compared with the record of 112,036 for 1916 , but the latter report was incomplete , lacking returns from ninety-five counties . A comparison of the two reports shows an apparent increase of divorces amounting to 36,779 , or 32.8 per cent . If we exclude the divorces reported for 1922 from the ninety-five counties that do not appear in the report for 1916 , amounting to 1799 , the increase in divorces granted in 1922 over 1916 is 34,980 divorces or 31.2 ' per cent . An increase in the number of divorces reported appears in each geo-graphic division , in the District of Columbia and in forty of the forty-seven States which permit divorces . The lowest rate of increase was 23.8 for the Mountain division and the highest , 43.3 for the South Atlantic group of States . The comparison of the several States reveals that Idaho had the lowest rate of increase , 5.6 , and Colorado the highest , 94.7 . Both North Dakota and Washington State show a large decrease in the number of divorces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report was influenced by changes in the divorce law which reduced the number of divorces during 1922 ' ; at the time of the 1916 report divorces became effective when granted , while in 1921 a change was made in the law so that divorces do not become effective until six months after the interlocutory decree is granted . The report of the Government makes a statistical comparison between the situation in 1922 and 1916 in the following table : // It is apparent that no satisfactory comparison can be made beten the numbers of divorces reported for the various periods studied by the United States Government unless the increase in the number of divorces be interpreted in the light of the changes in population . This comparison has been made by the investigation of the Federal Government and reveals that for more than half a century ; expiring in 1922 , the growth of divorce has been greater than the growth of population . This appears in the following table : That these detailed comparisons between the reports of 1916 and 1922 show the increase in divorces in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the comparison between the reports for 1916 and 1922 brings out the fact that the divorce rates for the States show greater variations than do those for the geographic divisions . The variation between the States is to be explained , as the report states , by such influences as differences in color or race composition of the population , differences in the proportion of foreign-born and in the countries from which they came , the relative strength of the prevailing Churches , especially that of the Roman Catholic Church , differences in the laws regulating divorces , and in the practices of ' Ibid. , p. 11. // the courts having jurisdiction over the granting of divorce and in inter-State migration for the purpose of obtaining divorces by taking advantage of the laws of the more liberal States . The Federal report summarizes this difference between the States as follows : The divorce rates for States show much wider variations than do those for geographic divisions . The number of divorces per 100,000 total population varied ; in 1922 , from 37 in the District of Columbia and 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 the variation was from 12 in the district of Columbia and 30 in North Carolina to 820 in Nevada . Similarly , the number of divorces per 100,000 married population varied , in 1922 , from 85 in the District of Columbia and 92 in New York to 3289 in Nevada , and in 1916 from 29 in the District of Columbia and 81 in New York to 2008 in Nevada . The population to one divorce ranged , in 1922 , from 2718 in the District of Columbia and 2589 in New York to 75 in Nevada , while in 1916 the range was from 8493 in the District of Columbia and 3284 in North Carolina to 122 in Nevada . There was , likewise , a wide range in the married population to one divorce ? from 1177 in the District of Columbia and 1087 in New York to 30 in Nevada in 1922 , and from 3411 in the District of Columbia and 1236 in New York to 50 in Nevada in 1916 . It will be noted that in the case of each rate , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York next lowest , and Nevada highest . In 1916 , in the case of each rate , the District of Columbia was lowest and Nevada highest , with New York next lowest as to number of divorces per 100,000 married population and as to married population to one divorce , and with North Carolina next lowest as to number of divorces per 100,000 population and as to population to one divorce ' Since the Southern Atlantic States are the most conservative in their divorce policy , the report of conditions in Florida and Mississippi , made by Dr. R. M. Harper , statistician and geographer of the State of Florida , is most interesting . The results of Doctor Harper 's study appear in the April , 1926 , issue of Eugenical News . The divorce situation in Florida is portrayed by Doctor Harper in the following table : DIVORCE AND DESERTION 14 , E Concerning Mississippi , the investigator states : Only one-fourth of the couples divorcing in Mississippi had children , averaging not quite two per couple , or less than half a child for each divorce as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi family in 1920.7 Comparison of Husband and Wife with Reference to the Granting of Divorce. ? There has been little change in the proportion of divorces granted to husbands and wives from 1887 to 1922 , as appears in the table that follows : During the thirty-six years covered by this study , less than onethird of the divorces granted were obtained by husbands and more than two-thirds by wives . The difference is largely due to the fact that the wife has given her by law a larger number of legal grounds for divorce . For example , in 1922 non-support or neglect to provide was not a legal ground for divorce on the part of the husband except in Utah , although a frequent cause for divorce on the part of the wife . Even grounds for divorce that apply equally to husband and wife , from their character , as appears in the case of cruelty , are more common offenses among men than women . It must be remembered also that the social consequences of certain charges made the basis for divorce carried more weight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adultery . In some circles , therefore , the // social code demands that the man assume the burden of guilt , at least as far as legal procedure is concerned , and the husband in response to this convention at times protects the character of his wife by taking the blame when he is entirely innocent . This masculine code has a definite influence on the granting of more divorces to women than men . The Grounds for Divorce. ? Anyone familiar with the divorce trial realizes that the legal ground given for divorce is often not the true cause . The reason advanced for the giving of the divorce necessarily is influenced by the law of the State ; the real root of the family discord may be one not recognized as a sufficient ground for divorce by the courts , so it becomes necessary to make the plea on the basis of some ground that falls within the statute . It is also true that there is sometimes a disposition on the part of both husband and wife to protect their future by having the complaining party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both know to be the real reason . The following table gives the legal grounds for divorce ats reported in 1922 : // In a comparison of different States as to the frequency of any definite cause for divorce appearing in statistics , great caution must be observed ; even when the same term is used by different States as a ground for divorce , the statutory definition or the legal interpretation with reference to a given cause may so vary as to make any statistical statement with reference to the frequency of the cause studied misleading . There are also cases where the legal ground for divorce as it , appears on the court records is itself a result of a family situation too subtle to come under the range of any legal term , but which is nevertheless the actual cause of the divorce . We can catalogue the reasons for divorce under the legal grounds , the moral causes or the social situation . It is , however , only when we study the divorce problem as an interaction of two personalities , expressing itself in a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any considerable scientific insight into the influences that lead toward divorce . Divorce is a conscious recognition of marriage failure and , like any other maladjustment , has as its fundamental cause character defects or bad social environment or both . A comparison of the record of 1922 with that of other periods appears in Table IX . Social Restlessness and Divorce. ? If the analysis of a definite divorce leads to an explanation of its cause by revealing the interplay of personality and environment , investigation of the increase in divorce characteristic of the modern trend emphasizes the significance of modern society itself as the operating cause : what is to be its ultimate influence is beyond prophecy , but at present modern civilization is stimulating the increase of divorce . A large number of modern men and women express in all sorts of ways a tendency toward social instability as a result of rapid changes in modes of living . The pulsations of life move swiftly , thoughts are discarded , conventions superseded , thrilling experiences not previously dreamed of are provided , former habits loosened , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present-day civilization . z Marriage is one of the most delicate , and sensitive of human relationships , and it would bestrange indeed if it did not reflect ! I // the general unrest of our times . The life comradeship of a man and woman , to be successful , requires the development both of qualities of personality and of spiritual ties less easily established now than in the slower-moving civilization . A careful investigation recently made regarding divorces granted in Suffolk County ( about 90 per cent . of which is the city of Boston ) from January , 1900 , through December , 1921 , shows the effect of the World War upon the increase of divorces within that county . A remarkable increase of divorces appears for the years 1919 , 1920 and 1921 . A corresponding investigation of marriages discloses that there is no , proportionate increase in marriages for these three years nor for the few years immediately preceding ; there is a slight increase , temporarily , in marriages for the year 1917 , but not of a character to explain the increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of the rise in divorces based upon industrial conditions . He concludes that what seems to be the only reasonable deduction as the essential cause of this phenomenal increase in divorces was the disrupting influence of the World War ; this great conflict was both an expression of the general restlessness which is the bitter fruit of contemporary civilization , and , itself , a source of social discontent . All parts of life felt its upheaval . Nowhere was its effect more clearly registered in disturbing and uprooting influences than in the family.11 Divorce and Parenthood. ? Compared with the period 1887-1906 , the proportion of cases of divorce in families with children had decreased in 1922 from about two-fifths to slightly over onethird . In the three Government investigations , 1887-1906 , 1916 and 1922 , children were reported more frequently in divorces granted women than in the case of divorces granted men . The explanation suggested for this is that where there are children the court is more likely in case of divorce to give them into the care of the mother , and because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , since he would run risk of losing his children . The statistical statement follows : 31 Hexter , M. B. , " Social Consequences of Business Cycles , " Ch . VI . // Divorce a Product of Family Incompatibility. ? Divorce is the climax of family difficulties . It follows that an adequate treatment of the problem of divorce involves a study of family life in all its social aspects . In a previous chapter appears a discussion of some of the outstanding family situations that lead to incompatibility ; elsewhere , the author discusses from a different point of view the social causes of divorce.13 It is important to interpret the divorce situation with an understanding of the entire social situation of the modern family in order to escape the fallacy of attempting to deal with divorce as something that exists by itself , an exhibition merely of personal faults unrelated to social conditions that influence character . The family does not live its life in a social vacuum , and // when a marriage undertaken with the promise of happiness ends in the tragedy of divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society as well as the individuals concerned . Divorce Legislation. ? Although the evils resulting from the diversity of the legislation of the various states in regard to divorce may have been exaggerated , there is general agreement as to the desirability of greater uniformity . At first advocates of divorce reform pleaded for a Federal law , a program which required for its success the passage of a Constitutional amendment . Because of the practical difficulties involved in getting this amendment , later effort has been directed towards procuring greater uniformity in the laws of the separate states . Progress is undoubtedly being made , and the general trend seems to be toward greater uniformity among the states respecting the essential features of divorce legislation . There does not appear to be the amount of moving from one state to another having more lax divorce regulations that one would expect of persons seeking matrimonial release , but there is undoubtedly interstate migration for such a purpose . Apparently there are practical considerations which hamper the movement of those who find the getting of a divorce in their own state difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various states do not , according to Wilcox , influence materially the number of divorces granted , but affect chiefly the choice of the ground upon which the divorce is sought.14 The contrast between the divorce rates of the different sections of the nation is not a mere expression of variation in legislation . Even if we had a Federal law or if the statutes of all the states were essentially the same , we should still have variation because of unlike conditions in the different parts of the country . Legislation that encourages divorce is of course a social menace , but drastic legislation has its dangers also . Some advocates of divorce reform undoubtedly seek stringent legislation , but their solution of the divorce problem , if it were attainable , would prove mischievous and intolerable . The friend of the family will remember that it is not the legal opportunity for the getting of divorce , or the desire for such separation , but the family situation that seeks court relief which constitutes the heart of the divorce problem . // Howard has well said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , the centre of the problem is marriage and not divorce . " Without question legislation influences divorce . We need the best laws that can be written to conserve family welfare , but any attempt to solve teh divorce problem by the mere passing of new . laws will be futile . The American divorce record is , from a social point of view , startling and , when one translates it into the disappointment and suffering of individual men and women , pathetic ; but its real significance is the revelation it gives of social forces at work that are making marriage success difficult , or ? and this side of the problem must not be overlooked ? the growing intolerance of low marriage standards or vicious conditions within the home circle . An increase in happy , wholesome marriages is the only permanent solution of our divorce problem , for the divorce is only a product of the family 's reflection of widespread social conditions that make matrimonial comradeship between modern men and women more difficult than once it was . Divorce , like crime , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strain where there is special need of strengthening the weakness disclosed by using our social resources to encourage sane ways of living . Divorce and Marriage Legislation. ? There may not have been in recent years too much discussion concerning laws proposed to decrease divorce , but there certainly has been too little attention given to the question of marriage legislation . Although it is not possible to trace with any degree of exactness the influence of our rnarriage laws upon our divorce rate , there can be no doubt that one of the effective ways of legislating against divorce is by the enactment of more uniform and better marriage laws than we now have . The states of the Union show great diversity in their marriage laws . It is of course to be expected that because of the varying social conditions of the different states and sections the same regulations of marriage should not prevail everywhere , but there is far greater variation than can be socially justified . " As is the practice with so // much of the legislation passed in this country , such laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lax way . Marriage laws are even disregarded to the point of permitting illegal marriages . One investigation disclosed that more than half of 240 marriage licenses issued had been granted illegally . ' ' A great deal of the variation between the states with reference to marriage legislation does not reflect the social conditions , but merely expresses lack of understanding or indifference in regard to the social consequences of discordant marriage legislation . Conditions which permit couples married legally in good faith in one state to become , by merely crossing the state line , guilty of crime and their children bastards , owe their existence to the fact that they echo prejudice or traditions of a haphazard and accidental origin . In many of our states there is need of legislation to lift the minimum age of marriage , and the trend fortunately is in that direction . This tendency , which shows itself from time to time as state laws are changed , is encouraged without question by the political influence of modern women . Although the student of the family will welcome an increase of scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such knowledge as we now have justifies the position that the marriage of the socially immature child , even when physically developed , is undesirable and should be prevented as far as it can be eliminated by law . The statutes of the various states regarding the minimum marriageable age of girls , including laws passed at regular sessions of the legislatures meeting in 1919 , are summarized by Hooker.18 There is need also of laws requiring a medical certification for marriage . Wisconsin was one of the first states to pass such a la and its practical value seems clearly demonstrated by a recall study of its results . The law has acted as an educational instrument leading to public discussion and a much wider appreciation of the risks of venereal disease , the need of early discovery of infection and thorough treatment by a reputable physician.10 The law has led men who are planning to marry to make sure of their fitness before applying for a marriage license . In some cases ) // examination has led to the discovery of disease which has postponed marriage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Some of the examinations have been merely routine and the statements issued by the physicians have been , so far as protection from venereal disease is concerned , valueless . The fee permitted doctors for the examination has been inadequate and it does not appear that the medical profession has heartily cooperated in the carrying out of the law . Although too much may easily be expected of laws requiring medical certification for marriage , it represents a step in the right direction and has an educational influence in elevating the idea of marriage along other lines than those that have merely to do with physical welfare . Common Law Marriages. ? There is need of legislation abolishing common law marriages . Common law marriage means to most people the living together of a man and woman in adultery , but where such marriages are recognized as valid by the state , the individuals concerned are as much married as those who , having obtained their license to marry according to law , have celebrated their union by a church wedding . To create a binding common law marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an assumption of the marital relationship . This means entering marriage by the pathway of fornication . Common law marriage is defended as necessary to protect from illegitimacy the children born of such a union ; some also insist that the abolishment of such marriages would strike away one of the rights of the individual . The common law union debases conventional marriage and encourages deceit and vice . The state certainly has the ' moral obligation of protecting the institution of matrimony from exploitation by the indifferent and by those who wish to enter marriage under cover because for some reason they wish to escape the responsibilities of a publicly acclaimed union , although as a matter of fact the couples living together in common law marriage do not usually regard themselves as married and generally do not intend to live , together permanently . The matrimonial anarchy produced by recognition of the corn156 SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE FAMILY mon law marriage as valid appears plainly in Table XI , which shows the legal situation as it is at , present in the United States . In interpreting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of entering a common law marriage , one by present ! consent to become husband and wife , per verba de praesenti , and the other by an agreement to become husband and wife at some future time followed by carnal intercourse , per verba de futuro . Alimony and Divorce. ? Modern economic conditions as they affect women show their influence in the attitude of some of our ; judges in regard to the granting of alimony . In a recent decision Judge Strong of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court is quoted by the press as having said , " Everything considered , I believe alimony should be discontinued because it keeps certain women lazy , gratifies their revenge , makes men miserable and serves no good ends . " A woman 's right to financial support from her husband when she has successfully divorced him has been taken for granted so long that we have assumed its justice as a matter of course . Alimony in the first place was an attempt to give protection to the woman who left her husband and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in the world . In those days when matrimony was the only vocation for women , it seemed fair that the woman driven from her husband 's protection by his misdeeds should receive from him maintenance in proportion to his income as a substitute for the support which he promised her at marriage and which she was now losing through no fault of her own . In the early history of the American colonies it was so difficult for either man or wife to be self-supporting without the help of the other that couples who separated were sometimes publicly commanded to take up again their life together , lest either of them become a burden on the community . Often the man was ordered to live with his wife or else give her a definite sum of money , or a certain number of pounds of tobacco or bushels of corn and wheat per year for her maintenance . Since those days women have gone into competition with men in every kind of industry , and matrimony is no longer ordinarily entered upon as a means of support . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their husbands . It // is even true at times that a wife can find employment when her husband can not . So long as women were social dependents with no means of support except wifehood , alimony was not only just but a public necessity . No woman , however cruelly treated , would attempt to get a divorce if this left her financially stranded , a candidate for the almshouse . Without the possibility of alimony the right of divorce was a mere farce . The possibility of obtaining alimony if her marriage venture fails is without doubt in the mind of many a woman who is enticed into matrimony by economic ambition . To such a woman divorce may come to mean freedom from the limitations of marriage without the sacrifice of the financial advantages she sought in marrying . The court decree may furnish her with an allowance that permits an indulgence in personal luxuries beyond what she enjoyed as rife . The opportunity to get alimony easily becomes under such circumstances a stimulus to divorce . Even when the divorce is sought without mercenary motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a stated sum to his wife when they have separated for some trivial reason makes later reconciliation difficult . Encouraged perhaps by a type of lawyer who fattens on the profits of divorce cases , the wife who left in a fit of anger may refuse to meet her husband half way in an effort to forget the past and get a second start on the road toward marriage happiness . If the prospects of alimony were ruled out , the professional divorce lawyer would often be less keen in urging a divorce , knowing that even were the decree granted , it would not be followed by a series of payments to the wife , a substantial part of which he could expect to fall eventually into his own hands in the form of fees charged for his services . Family Desertion. ? Divorce and desertion are family probems that have much in common . On account of this likeness desertion is commonly called " the poor man 's divorce . " Although this statement correctly brings out the fact that desertion among the poorer classes is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it conveys the impression that these two forms of family disintegration are the same , except that one is confined exclusively to people of a lower economic status . Desertion is one type of // family disintegration , divorce is another ; the wealthy , the professional classes and those socially well established turn for various reasons , when family life becomes unsatisfactory , to the divorce court for relief , while the more mobile unskilled worker , or the individual whose occupation provides great economic freedom , cuts himself away from family difficulties by merely leaving the home and disappearing . There are many reasons why the well-to-do should prefer the use of the legal method of getting free from marital difficulties . In addition to the other social advantages of divorce , it is the customary way of getting freedom in their class and , therefore , in accord with the proprieties . In the professional class divorce frequently carries with it social risks from which the individuals shrink , but to attempt to escape these by family desertion would he ruinous ; in some cases it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hope of a second start in one 's vocation . Here also the class code does not include family desertion as a proper means of getting rid of marital difficulties . There are many motives that tempt the poor in family unhappiness to desert rather than to have the court cut the matrimonial ties . It is , of course , in this country the man who generally deserts . Apparently under other social conditions the woman rather than the man may be tempted to leave the family , for I am told by Miss Asa Matsuoka , a Japanese graduate student , that it is the woman rather than the man who more often deserts in Japan . A study of the conscious motives that lead men in the poorer classes to leave their families discloses the fact that desertion is not just an easier and cheaper way of ending matrimony than is offered by divorce . Often the husband seeks not so much to get rid of the family as to become free from an economic burden , from conditions of work that seem intolerable or from unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much repudiated as left behind . The man is consciously seeking not so much a permanent separation from his family as a brief spell of relief from the heavy load lie has been carrying or an opportunity to start afresh . To be sure , rationalization is as often found in the motives that lead to desertion as in other lines of conduct where the reasons built into consciousness conceal the deeper desires that bring about the , // behavior . It is easy for the desertion that starts as a temporary expediency to become a permanent separation , and in many of these cases the men drift into a complete and final severance of family ties rather than deliberately breaking from the family with a definite decision to seek a divorce . It is easy for the unskilled or factory worker to pack up and leave a family situation which has become troublesome . Indeed , this procedure is often the line of least resistance , for it seems , and often actually is , easier to go than to stay . Wanderlust and the desire for travel are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief cause of desertion . It is this type of desertion that has led the social worker to call desertion " the poor man 's vacation from his family , " rather than a divorce . Where the desertion results from a family incompatibility which in some other class would be likely to end in a divorce , it is easy to understand why so many men prefer leaving their family to the , legal method of separation through the divorce court . They are familiar with desertion , for it is frequent enough in their class to be a matter of common knowledge , and they have little understanding of court procedure , particularly when they are immigrants who are perhaps suspicious of any process that has to do with our legal machinery ; moreover , if they have religious scruples against divorce they find desertion less antagonizing to their conscience . Desertion brings out clearly the greater instability of family life in the city as compared with our villages and country places . In addition to the greater difficulty of holding together the family in the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease with which one can disappear ; the city-dweller has fewer of the face-to-face associations that tend to check the feelings of anonymity and irresponsibility which encourage family desertion . The earlier treatment of the deserting husband by our social agencies stressed the law . Largely as a result of their effort , legislation with reference to non-support and desertion has been passed by many of our states . Now that our courts are better prepared to deal adequately with the deserter , the tendency has been to make use of the law only as a last resort . Increasingly , it is becoming clear that little headway can be made against the tendency among the // poor in our cities to desert their families unless each case is treated as a home problem , complex in character and requiring diagnosis and sympathetic treatment . If rehabilitation of family life is desirable , haling the deserter into court and bringing in the wife as complainant is all too apt to become a hopeless obstacle in the way of any later attempt to reestablish the family life . Desertion , like divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and it can be more successfully attacked by efforts to reenforce the family and to procure social conditions that will minister to its health than by regarding desertion as a crime that deserves just punishment . The statistics of family desertion seem to demonstrate that the family agencies at present are making little headway against it , and there is no hope of substantial progress in dealing with this particular product of family instability until greater and more practical effort is made to conserve home life .
