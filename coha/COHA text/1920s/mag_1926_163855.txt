ARMY &; NAVY <P> In legislation now before Congress or germinating in committee , the Army and Navy air services for the next few years hang in the balance . <P> As for dirigibles , the Shenandoah was built in this country and as a war vessel . The only ship of this type that the U. S. now has is the Los Angeles , built in Germany and by diplomatic agreement not to be used for war purposes . <P> Representative Butler , Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee , has introduced a bill for building a new ship , bigger and better than the Shenandoah . Such a ship would cost upwards of $5,000,000 . It would probably take four or five years to build . Secretary Wilbur and Admiral Jones are willing that such a ship should be built , provided the cost of building does not reduce the amount of money available for other naval purposes . <P> There is another proposal , which has been considered chiefly as an alternative : to build a small metalclad dirigible costing about $300,000 . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Naval officials are about ready to agree to this proposal , pointing out however that the ship would be an experiment and too small for war purposes . <P> The Naval Supply Bill passed by the House last week provided for no new dirigible and proposed closing the Naval Air Station at Lakehurst , N.
