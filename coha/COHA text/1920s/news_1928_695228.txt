txt Broadway became a way of sorrow yesterday , its motion and its bedlam stilled , as the funeral cortege of Captain Emilio Carranza passed along it to the train waiting to bear the body of the flier back to his native Mexico . It was a tribute of silence such as New York has seldom paid to any man . Two hundred thousand persons stood along the route ? of the solemn procession , first in Broadway . then in Times Square , and last along Seventh Avenue . Ten thousand more were outside the Pennsylvania Station to witness the last honors . The scene in front of the granite station was impressive . Draped in the colors of his own country , for Which he had flown and fought and in the flag of the United States , for the good-will of which he had given his life . Captain Carranza 's coffin was lifted from the caisson as the station entrance was reached . It was placed ? upon a catafalque standing alone near the street car tracks . Firing Squad Takes Position . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In rigid lines infantrymen stood at attention . There was not a sound in an area ordinarily reverberating with noise . A firing squad clicked into position at one side of the bier . As the squad paused in position the silence , which had been broken briefly , was resumed . The officer in command snapped out a word or two . The rifles leaped to the firing position , the barrels flashing in the sun . For a second they remained thus . poised as though aimed at windows high in the skyscraper opposite . Another word of command and a volley was fired . The reports gained volume in the confined space .. The . brass-jacketed cartridges leaped out , dropping  --  close to the cof fin . Again the order and the sharp burst of gunfire . More brass tubes fell with metallic jingle to the as . phalt . The brief roar of the final volley cut the silence , the squad faced south and resumed its place in the stiffened ranks of the Eighteenth Infantry . As they moved mechanically away a bugler took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded taps , and the lingering notes of the military farewell , sad in their normal setting , had added pathos when sounded in a city street As the last rising note ended the cor tege re:formed and moved down the ramp to the train , which started its long journey at 4:50 P. M. 10,000 Troops Lead Cortege . The note of homage that reached final expression at the station had been sustained from the time the cortege formed at Sixty-sixth Street and began the slow march down Broadway , moving to the sound ' of muffled drums and the rhythmic tread of marching feet . Ten thousand soldiers led the cortege , swinging soldiers led the of the black crepe-bound drums . Then behind them came . the white ranks of sailors , the swords of officers decorated with black bows . Behind the sailors was the caisson bearing the body . Six black horses drew the black caisson . Resting upon it was the bronze coffin , one corner flashing back the sun from beneath the folds of  --  the flags . Khaki clad artillerymen from West Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the red blankets beneath their saddles . The caisson moved so slowly as to seem to be not moving at all , and the tramping ranks of the infantry and sailors ahead had to be slowed to the pace of the black horses . The funeral trappings and the slow move- merit of the marchers seemed to heighten the impression made upon the onlookers . Charger Follows Caisson . Directly behind the caisson came ' the military symbol of a comrade passed on  --  a riderless horse . A tall , black charger had been chosen for this post in the cortege , and over the animal a black mantle had been draped . The mantle had a hood , which left only the eyes of the animal showing . A corporal from Governors Island led the charger . Showing through a slit in the mantle was a sabre , with a bow of black tied at the guard . A pair of black stirrups were suspended from the empty saddle . In accordance with military custom the stirrups held a pair of military boots , which were reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sidewalks , or the other thousands looking down from windows , gazed at it in silence . Heads were bared and here and there a woman dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief as the coffin moved past . Overhead an escort such as the Captain would have liked most of all maintained guard . Twenty-one air-1 planes from Mitchell Field and from Miller Field droned above the procession , coming at times close to housetops when their motors sounded an accompaniment to the muffled drums below . In various formations the airplanes flew above the procession and at the station they moved in slow circles during the firing of the last volleys and the sounding of taps . Crowds Gather Early . Long before 3 P. M. , the hour set for the start of the cortege , more than 5,000 persons had jammed a way into Broadway and the streets near Sixty-sixth Street . Hundreds who had had closer association with the dead airman had entered the funeral church of Frank E. Campbell where the body of Carranza had lain in State since Friday .

After the coffin had been placed in the foyer a large wreath of roses sent by President Coolidge was placed on top . Next to it was placed the wreath of President Calles of Mexico , fashioned of roses in the form of an airplane model . A third wreath to rest on the coffin was the joint offering of the Consuls General in this city . Twenty-one Consuls General or their assistants from the consulates of Latin-American nations and eighteen consular representatives of European countries attended the funeral .

As the Sixty-second Regiment of Coast Artillery , an anti-aircraft organization , wheeled into post outside , the caisson with its sable trappings was driven to the entrance and five minutes later the coffin was carried out .

The Mexican group sang their national anthem , which was played by the Sixty-second Artillery band as the coffin was placed on the caisson . The thousands of soldiers lined up to face the catafalque presented arms and the first of the aerial escorting planes droned overhead . When the coffin was in place , the military escort fell into line and the cortege moved down Broadway . As the troops moved , the father of Carranza was escorted out a side door of the Funeral Church and taken by Consul General Arturo M.

During the broadcasting of the funeral services for Captain Emilio Carranza yesterday , a poem entitled " To the Airmen , " by Barbara Young , was broadcast from stail-In WCGU . It follows : The windy sky is full of flying men ; They are lice birds to our sight , Like mighty birds who live for flight alone . From West to East , from East to West again Their pinions cleave the currents of the air With godlike , s  --  vift-nesq , certain and aware Of space incredible , the timeless span . What do they seek , these pilgrims of the sky ? A paean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek the trails that later slower men Shall find and follow for a chiseled name Set down upon the tablet of the years ? Nay , these are dreamers who have dreamed of God And they are seeking Him behind a yell , Knowing full Weil that he who seeks shall find . And they remember time before time was , When every man was winged and every wing Was feathered fur these illimitable flights . And now again they would essay the heights And the wild glory of the thunderbolt And every tenine4t They would see God 's face . Above the fog 511 ( 1 fury of the storm They would ride in unto His dwelling place . Andflisgohntie have made the further . lonelier Beyond the earthly pole . These flew indeed . Unburdened r.f the weight of any wing They have encompassed the stations of the stars . Those who return Lath set their winged feet Once more upon lire little ways of men . Are dreamers still and seeking still the dream .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
