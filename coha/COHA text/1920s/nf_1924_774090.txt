txt // For instance , when a crystal is allowed free development , it assumes a form bounded by plane faces . The direction , or orientation , of these faces is determined by the lattice underlying the crystal . Similarly , it is found that crystalline bodies often possess the property of breaking easily along certain planes , called " cleavage planes . " Deformation of metals takes place by sliding on planes known as " slip planes , " as will be described later . In any given crystal , the orientation of the cleavage planes and slip planes is fixed . When a crystalline substance is subjected to attack by a chemical solvent , it is found that the resistance to solution is greatest on certain planes . The planes determining external form , cleavage , slip , and resistance to chemical attack are planes which pass through atom centers in the space lattice . It will readily be seen that a very large number of sets of parallel planes could be drawn which would pass through all of the atoms , but the significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms is large . Symmetry . Any plane passing through a crystal in such a way that the atoms on one side occupy the positions of mirror images of those on the opposite side is a plane of symmetry . Two kinds of planes of symmetry are distinguished . If the structure on one side of the plane can be rotated on the plane through some angle ( other than 180 deg. ) without destroying the symmetry , the plane is said to be a principal plane of symmetry . If such rota tion destroys the symmetry for all positions other than the original or one reached after a tonal ion of 180 deg. , t hen the plane // is called a secondary plane of symmetry . To express this more mathematically , principal planes contain two or more equivalent and interchangeable directions , while secondary planes possess no interchangeable directions . An axis of symmetry is a line through a crystal such that a revolution about it , through some angle less than 360 deg. , will result in a duplication of the original position of the crystal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the number of times ( luring a complete revolution that such duplication occurs . When such a condition is brought about by a revolution of 180 deg. , or twice during a complete revolution , the crystal is said to possess a twofold or binary symmetry . Similarly , the classification is extended to threefold or ternary , fourfold or quadratic , and sixfold or hexagonal symmetry . Axes of more than twofold symmetry are called " principal axes of symmetry . " Twofold or binary axes are called " secondary axes. , " In considering their structural characteristics , crystalline bodies are looked upon as extending indefinitely , in all directions . The planes and axes referred to represent directions rather than specific planes or lines . Other planes through atom centers parallel to a plane of symmetry are likewise planes of symmetry of exactly the same kind . When it is said that the isometric system possesses three principal planes of symmetry , it is meant // that there are three sets of parallel planes , any one of which is a principal plane of symmetry for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System. ? The direction of a crystal lographic plane is defined by referring it to a system of axes chosen with respect to the particular crystal system under con consideration . The cubic or isometric system , which is the simplest and also the most common among metals , will serve to illustrate the method of designation . Axes OX , OY , and OZ ( Fig. 4 ) are , in this case , the intersections of the three principal planes of symmetry . They are perpendicular to each other and are said to be of equal length , meaning that the same scale is used to represent distances on all the axes , and there is nothing inherent which distinguishes one from the other . Plane ABC is called the " ground plane . " In all systems one of the parameters ' of the ground plane is taken as unity , for simplicity of reference , and the other parameters are then fixed in accordance with the nature of the system . In the isometric system all of the parameters of the ground plane are equal and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances from the origin . The indices of a plane are the reciprocals of the parameters , and planes are more usually designated by indices . The planes noted in Fig. 4 have indices as follows : For the definite designation of each set of parallel planes , the directions of OA , OB , and OC in Fig. 4 are considered positive , and the opposite directions negative . If the parameter of a plane is negative , then the corresponding index is negative , and it is written with the negative sign above the index . If the parameters of a certain plane are OA = ? 2 , OB = 1 , OC = 1 , the indices are 1A , 1 , 1 . Since , however , indices and parameters express only ratios , not the actual position of a particular plane but the direction of a series of parallel planes , the indices ( 1- , 1 , 1 ) are the same , crystallographically , as ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 4 , 4 ) , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it has no fractions and has at least one index unity . The above system of notation is the Miller system . In metallography , when symmetry permits , ' ' I'li panuneters of any plane are the intercepts on the axes of reference . ' t 'M ? pnruuieters of plane C/X ; /5 ' , for example , are co , co , and ( OC ) = 1 . // the indices are used without signs to represent not only one system of parallel planes but all sets of parallel planes having the same spacings . For example , the 100 planes in the isometric system include all of the cube faces ; the 110 planes include all of the cube diagonals , etc . Crystal Systems. ? All possible crystal structures can be divided into six groups , each characterized by a particular grade of symmetry:l 1 . Isometric or Cubic System. ? Three principal and six secondary planes of symmetry . Crystals referable to three equal rectangular axes . Most metals belong to this system . 2 . Tetragonal System. ? One principal and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axes , only two of which are equal . No metals are known to belong to this system , with the exception of tin and indium. 3 . Hexagonal System. ? One principal and six secondary planes of symmetry . Crystals referable to four axes , three of which lie in the same plane intersecting at 120 deg. , and are equal in length . The fourth axis is perpendicular to the plane of the three others at their intersection and may have either greater or less length . The metals magnesium , zinc , and cadmium , belong to this system . There are three other systems ? namely , orthorhombic , monoclinic , and triclinic ? in which no pure metals are known to crystallize . Visible Metallic Crystals. ? Under some circumstances the crystalline nature of metals becomes apparent to the unaided eye . The crystalline appearance of the zinc on iron galvanized by the hot , dip process is familiar to everyone . Similar regularity of external form is frequently produced when metals solidify with one surface free from restraint . Figure 5 shows the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mold . During solidification of a metal , crystallization begins at centers called " nuclei , " and proceeds in a directional manner . Growth is most rapid along some line which bears a simple relat ion to the symmetry of the crystal . A trunk shoots out in this Iirection and branches grow out from the sides of the trunk parallel Io one another and in directions determined by the structure of the cryst at The result is a formation which , from its resemblance to a trce , is called a dendrite . The dendritic appearance of IiAYI.ra W. " Elementary Crystallography , " McGraw-Hill Book Co. // many of the crystals can easily be seen in the photograph of tellurium ( Fig. 5 ) . Because of the fact that most metals contract on solidifying , the dendrites which form on the surface of a metal are left in relief by the lowering of the level of the liquid metal . Since several nuclei form simultaneously and growth proceeds in all directions ( especially when the nuclei are completely surrounded by the molten metal ) , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a single crystal is allowed to develop from a molten bath , its external shape will be a fairly perfect geometrical figure . With a large number of growing crystals , however , as the molten metal becomes exhausted , the crystals must meet in such a manner as to fill the space completely . These crystals will be oriented in different ways , and hence , in order to fill space , can not form their habitual external shapes . Such a crystal , with orderly arrangement of the atoms in the interior but an external shape determined by the influence of other crystals , is called an allotrio morphic crystal , or crystallite , or , more commonly , a grail ? . In any given grain , therefore , the atoms are arranged in the same manner as they would be in a perfect crystal of the metal , but the grain may have any external shape . // No two adjacent grains in a cast metal have the same orienta tion . By " orientation " is meant the direction of the crystallo graphic axes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boundary between them would disappear and the two grains would become one . A metal , therefore , which has solidified from the molten state consists of an aggregate of differently oriented grains . These grains vary widely in size and shape , according to the specific crystallizing properties of the metal itself , the rate of cooling through the solidification range , the temperature gradients , purity , and other factors . Sometimes the grains are so large that they can readily be seen with the unaided eye , and at other times they are so small that a microscope is required to see them . Etching Polished Sections. ? For examination under the micro-scope , a piece of metal must be ground or filed flat , and then carefully polished . Examination may then reveal no structure whatever , except for particles of included foreign matter , such as slag and oxides . The boundaries of the grains themselves are not distinguishable . It has been suggested by Beilby ' that the process of polishing has produced a surface layer of amorphous metal which is opaque and covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved in a chemical reagent in which the metal is soluble . The process of chemical attack on the polished surface is called etching . The boundaries between the grains are regions of low resistance to chemical attack and their location is shown after light etching . Deeper etching develops marked differences in color between different grains , some appearing dark and others light . The process of solution produces minute facets , which vary in orien tation from one grain to another . Light falling on an etched surface will be reflected into the microscope only by such facets as have the appropriate orientation . These grains will appear light , while other grains will appear darker . The different tints of the grains are , therefore , evidence of their crystallinity and of their different orientations . St ill deeper etching often produces within certain grains geometrical figures which are called " etching pits . " These pits approximate a definite geometrical form , such as a triangle or rectangle , and within any particular grain have the same form // and orientation . They furnish additional evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just described are shown in Figs. 6 , 7 and 8 , taken from a specimen of nearly pure iron ( Armco iron ) . // Intracrystalline Slip. ? If a piece of ductile metal is polished and etched to bring out the grain boundaries , and is then subjected to a load which causes a slight permanent deformation , examination under the microscope reveals systems of parallel lines running across the grains . In any one grain the lines are approximately straight and parallel to one another , but their direction is different in different grains . In the first stages of deformation only a few of these lines appear , and not in every grain . As the defor mation increases , more lines appear , becoming closer together and appearing in grains previously free from them . Finally other sets of lines are developed , parallel to one another in any one grain and crossing the first set of lines . Close examination shows that the first sets of lines have been displaced along the second sets by a minute amount , so that they no longer register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very carefully investigated , ' and they are known to represent block movement or slip along // crystallographic planes . The lines observed are steps on the polished surface produced by the elevation or depression of blocks or fragments of the grains . They are called slip bands , and the crystallographic planes along which slip occurs are called slip planes . A slip band becomes visible under the microscope only when the displacement along the slip plane is on the order of 0.00001 in. , which corresponds roughly to 1,000 atom diameters . Displacements have been measured as high as 0.00005 in. , or about 5,000 atom diameters . Even greater movements probably occur in severe deformation . Cold Work or Plastic Deformation. ? The great permanent deformations imposed on metals in the various processes of mechanical working , such as rolling , forging , and drawing , are substantially integrations of very many block movements along slip planes . This type of deformation is called " plastic deforma tion , " as opposed to " fluid deformation , " which is characteristic of liquids and of amorphous solids like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confined to the slip planes , the crystalline fragments between such planes moving as units in which the atoms retain substantially their initial relative positions with respect to their neighbors . When the external shape of a piece of metal is changed by a deforming load , the shapes of the grains undergo similar changes . Normally , the grains are so shaped that , on the average , their diameters are equal in all directions . Such grains are called " equiaxed grains . " Now if the metal is deformed , as by drawing // out into a wire , the grains are similarly drawn out . The change in the external shape of a grain is made up of a multitude of minute slips , each so small that the grain retains an apparently smooth outline . In Fig. 9 is shown a section through the piece of iron shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , after compressing it cold until its height was reduced about 60 per cent . A much greater degree of deformation is represented in Fig. 10 , a section through a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was repolished and etched after being compressed , a procedure which effaces slip bands . However , lines are visible within the grains which are undoubtedly due to the cold deformation . Rosenhain considers these to be the traces of slip planes on the plane of the microsection . Howe is less certain of their nature , and calls them x-bands . Grain deformations are substantially permanent when effected below a temperature known as the " annealing temperature " or " recrystallization temperature . " If the metal is subsequently heated above that temperature , the grains recrystallize into new grains , which have a tendency toward equiaxial shape and bear little relation to the old grains . If the deformation is carried out above the annealing temperature , the mechanism is substantially the same , except that the metal anneals during the working . Mechanical work carried out on a metal above the annc:iliug temperature is called " hot working , " while , if the ternperature is below the annealing temperature , it is called " cold working . " ( ' old work results in a distorted structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure without much change in hardness . Cold working followed by annealing has similar effects to hot working . When a ductile or malleable crystal ( or grain ) is loaded suffi-ciently to cause failure along some crystallographic plane , the fragments formed cohere , and deformation takes place without rupture . The atoms of one fragment are not sufficiently removed from those of the others to lose cohesion permanently . When a brittle crystal is broken , fracture takes place , usually along the crystallographic cleavage planes , and the fragments formed do not stick together . A crystal that is brittle at one temperature may be ductile at a higher temperature . Crystals that are brittle under ordinary conditions of loading may be capable of undergoing plastic deformation under increased hydrostatic pressure . Bismuth and antimony , for example , which are ordi-narily quite brittle , can be extruded into wires when sufficient pressure is applied in such a way that the metal is confined on all sides . Increase of pressure brings the atoms into closer contact , facilitating the reestablishment of cohesion bonds along the planes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the amplitude of atomic vibrations . Brittle metals , such as chromium and manganese , break without permanent deformation , and their cleavage planes are clearly revealed . The fracture then looks crystalline . Ductile metals break only after the grains are greatly drawn out and slip has taken place on very many planes . The fracture then has a more or less fibrous appearance , which does not suggest the inherent crystalline nature of the metal . The same piece of metal , however , when subjected to repeated applications of stress , breaks along the crystallographic planes with practically no permanent deformation , and the fracture may appear crystal-line . It is often said that the fatigue has caused the metal to " crystallize , " whereas , in reality , the peculiar manner of failure has merely revealed the crystalline structure already present . Twinned Crystals. ? Sometimes grains grow together in such a manner that they are symmetrical structurally with respect to a plane between them . These are called " twin crystals . " Usu-ally , the twinning is of such a nature that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount about an axis perpendicular to the twinning plane , the two parts would possess the sane orientation and would merge . Sometimes several parallel // twinning planes occur , so that each alternate crystalline strip has the same orientation . This is called " polysynthetic twinning . " Figure 11 shows this type of twinning in Alpha brass , a solid solution possessing the essential structural characteristics of pure metal . Figure 12 shows slip bands in Alpha brass twins . It will be noted that these slip bands are continuous through each grain , but change direction at each twinning plane . These twins in brass were produced on annealing after cold working . Twins produced in this way are generally called annealing twins , to distinguish them from mechanical twins , which are formed in some metals , notably Alpha iron and zinc , by cold deformation alone . Mechanical twins , in fact , are removed by annealing . Mechanical twins appearing in iron as narrow dark bands are known as Neumann bands or Neumann lines . They are parallel to certain crystallographic planes . X-ray Analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metals is limited by the wave length of the light used . With the highest powered microscopes available , it is possible to distinguish separate particles whose diameters are not less than about . ! i 00,000 in . It is theoretically possible , approximately , t o double this resolving power by using ultraviolet light of short wave length , but this has not so far been accomplished in a practical manner . At the best , visibility or photography is // limited to distances on the order of 1,000 atom diameters . Since 1912 , methods of crystal analysis by means of x-rays have been developed by Laue , Bragg and Bragg , ' Hull , 2 and others , which extend the field of investigation down to the atom itself . X-rays are entirely similar to visible light but have wave lengths of the same order of magnitude as the distances between atoms in crystals . It has been possible , by their use , to determine not only the arrangements of the atoms in metals but the exact distances between them . The fundamental principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grating , which consists of a piece of glass or metal on which are ruled a great many parallel and equidistant lines . A beam of monochromatic light falling upon such a grating is diffracted through an angle depending on the wave length of the light and the spacing of the lines on the grating . When white light falls upon the grating , the rays of different wave lengths ( or color ) are diffracted through different angles , thus forming a spectrum . The grating can be used for the analysis of light and for the exact measurement of the wave length of any particular portion of the spectrum . Or , conversely , monochromatic light of known wave length may be used to determine the spacing of the lines on an unknown grating . The wave lengths of x-rays are about one ten-thousandth as large as those of visible light , and it would be entirely impos-sible to construct a grating of appropriate spacings by the usual method of ruling lines . It occurred to Laue that the ordered arrangements of the atoms or molecules in crystals might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacings of the planes of atoms ( or molecules ) are of the right order of magnitude . This idea has been successfully developed experimentally . The first problem was to verify the supposition that x-rays were , indeed , of undulatory character like ordinary light , and to measure their wave lengths . The process could then be reversed , using mono-chromatic x-rays of known wave length to measure the spacing of the planes of atoms in a crystal . The problem differs from that of the ordinary grating , in that the crystal grating extends over three dimensions . The principle // can be explained by reference to rig . 13 . The lines p , p , p , etc. represent planes of atoms in a crystal , separated by a common distance , d . A , Al , A2 , A3 , etc. are a train of advancing waves of x-rays of wave length Lambda ( A ) . Consider that these rays are partly reflected from each plane according to the usual law that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the remainder penetrating deeper into the crystal . Consider any path of reflection as BC , which is parallel to all other paths of reflection and typical of them . The , waves AB , A'B ' , A " B " , etc. join in reflection along BC . These waves are in phase with one another at AA'A " A " ' , a line perpendicular t o the direction of propagation . If they remain in phase with one another after reflection along BC , reinforcement will take place and a strong beam will result . If they are not in phase , the rays will be lost by interference . The necessary condition for reinforcement is that the difference in the paths of these waves must he an integral multiple of the wave length . This condition may be expressed mathematically : Draw BN perpendicular to AB . Draw BD perpendicular to pp . Prolong A'B ' to D. Then : wllPI s a is ainy wchole number . // This is the fundamental equation . It expresses the fact that , in order for strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of certain definite values . These values are given by : 3.5 X 10-8 = 2.85 . Reflections of the first and second order only are possible . An experimental set-up may be represented by the line drawing of Fig. 14 . AA is a pencil of monochromatic x-rays . B is a crystal having crystallographic planes ( planes of atoms ) , as indicated by the fine parallel lines . B is mounted on a pedestal capable of rota-tion about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the paper . C is a device for detecting x-rays , such as an ionization chamber . ( x-rays have the property of ionizing gases , thereby The reflection at the angle B1 is called the reflection of the first order , that at the angle 02 , reflection of the second order and so on . The possible number of reflections is limited for given values of d and A , since sin 0 can not have a value greater than 1 . Then in the limit // causing them to conduct electricity . The conductivity of the gas in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gives a measure of the intensity of x-radiation entering C. ) C is mounted to swing on the arc indicated about the same axis as B. By rotating B on its axis and C along its arc , several conjugate positions can be found for which strong reflections will enter C , corresponding to the various orders of reflection . The angles 01 , 02 , etc. can readily be measured and , given the wave length of the radiation , the spacing of the planes of atoms can be calculated in accordance with equation ( 1 ) . By choosing different faces of the crystal , this process can be repeated so as to give the spacings of the various sets of parallel planes , from which data the arrangement of the points in the space lattice can be deduced . Powder Method of Crystal Analysis. ? Suppose that the crystal B in Fig. 14 is properly oriented for a reflection of the first order . If a photographic film , DE , is interposed perpendicular to the beam AB , the diffracted beam will strike it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principal beam , AB , will , for the most part , not be diffracted , and will strike the film at E. Now suppose the crystal to be so mounted that it can be rotated about AA as an axis ; during the rotation the correct glancing angle 01 will be preserved , and the diffracted beam , BDC , will draw on the film a circle about E as a center . One complete rotation of the crystal will cause it to assume successively all of the positions from which it is capable of sending out a reflection of the first order from the particular set of planes in question . The diffracted beam generates a cone of x-rays about AA as an axis . A film interposed cuts out a circle , which is thus the locus of all the possible first-order reflections from this set of planes . For reflections of higher orders , other circles will be drawn on the film , having diameters increasing with the order of the reflection . It will , of course , be necessary to reset the crystal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rot at ion about AA . Now suppose the crystal to have its orientation so altered that another set of crystallographic planes diffracts beams onto the film . If the above process of setting the crystal to the proper glancing angles and rotating it about AA is repeated , nnot her set . of circles representing the various orders of reflection will he obtained . If the spacing of the planes differs from that // of the first set , the circles will have different diameters , corresponding to the different glancing angles involved . This process might be repeated for every set of crystallographic planes . The result would be a series of concentric circles . Each circle would be proof of the presence of a set of planes having that particular spacing capable of diffracting a beam through the angle represented by the circle . Instead of carrying out this process by the systematic method of setting the crystal and rotating it about AA , the crystal might simply be caused to assume successively all possible orientations . Exactly the same pattern of concentric circles would then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very large number of small crystals with random orientations , is chosen as a specimen the sank remit is obtained again , without rotating the specimen . // This is the foundation of the generalized method of crystal analysis , or the method of powders , as developed independently in America by Hull and in Germany by Debye and Scherrer . A fine-grained metal possesses the same properties as apowderfor this purpose , since it is an aggregate of crystalline grains of mixed orientation . Smaller specimens can be used if they are rotated , as this gives the effect of a greater number of crystal orientations . A single photograph of such a specimen gives all of the possible circles and hence the spacings of all possible crystallographic planes . A diffraction pattern of aluminum obtained by this method is shown in Fig. 15 . In actual practice , it is customary to photograph only a small portion of the pattern , and to bend the film into the arc of a circle so that the distances between the lines cut from the large circles are proportional to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Figs. 16 and 17 . Figure 16 , in fact , may be considered a magnified section of a portion of Fig. 15 . It was photographed on a film bent around an arc about B , whereas Fig. 15 was a fiat plate ; consequently , the ratios of the distances between successive lines do not have a simple arithmetical relation . However , two bright lines are followed by a broad space , a bright line , a narrow space , two close lines , one brighter than the other , etc . Atomic Arrangement. ? In this discussion many important dct ails have necessarily been omitted , in order to simplify the presentation of the essential principles . It is also beyond the scope of this chapter to go into the actual synthesis of crystal structures , from the data obtained by these methods . These // subjects are completely discussed in the references . For the present , the treatment will be confined to the presentation and discussion of some of the results thus far obtained on metals . The arrangement of atoms in metals has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement possible is one in which the atoms occupy positions at the corners of a system of equal closely packed cubes . This is known as the " simple cubic arrangement . " No metals or other elementary substances have been found to have this arrangement , but it is typical of salts composed of equal numbers of positive and negative ions , such as the alkali halides . The most common arrangement in metals is the face-centered cubic arrangement , shown in Fig. 18 , where the atoms are at the corners of a system of equal closely packed cubes and also at the centers of each cube face . This arrangement may be con sidered as formed by two simple cubic lattices intersecting each other in such a manner that the corner atoms of one lattice fall at the centers of the faces of the other lattice . All of the atorns in the face-centered arrangement are , in reality , similarly situated . Any particular set of atoms may be equally well regarded as corner atoms or as face atoms . Each atom is surrounded by 12 equidistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two which furnish the closest possible packing for a number of equal balls . It is , accordingly , sometimes referred to as the " cubic close-packed arrangement . " The greater the distance between adjacent parallel planes ( atomic spacings ) the greater is the atomic concentration on the plane and the greater the ease of slip ; also , the greater the atomic spacing the less will be the angle of x-ray diffraction . The first line from the main x-ray beam on the x-ray pattern will be produced by the planes of easiest slip and the order of " first-order " diffraction lines gives the order of ease of slip . In the face-centered cubic arrangement , the first four lines are produced by the following planes : 111 , 100 , 110 , and : 31 I , in the order of // their occurrence . There are four sets of 111 planes , three of 100 planes , six of 110 planes , and twelve of 311 planes . The next most common arrangement is built upon a unit cube having an atom at each corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 19 . The corner atoms and center atoms are interchangeable , so that , if the system of lines in Fig. 19 had started with one of the center atoms , all the corner atoms ' would become center atoms , and vice versa . Each atom is surrounded by eight equally distant and symmetrically situated atoms . This arrangement is not so closely packed as the facecentered : mrrangement .. The three first diffraction lines in the Is Iy-cent Bred : m ? rangeuuent are produced by the 110 , 100 , and 112 // planes . There are six sets of 110 planes , three of 100 planes , and twelve of 112 planes . Figures 20 , 21 , and 22 show each of these planes . The black circles represent atoms , and the encircled atoms are on the plane which is cross-hatched . There is another arrangement commonly found in metals , known as the " hexagonal close-packed arrangement " ( Fig. 23 ) . It is equally close packed with the face-centered cubic . The space occupied by a crystal of this sort may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely packed right-triangular prisms whose bases are equilateral triangles . The altitudes of the prisms are equal to 1.633 tildes the length of the sides of the // triangles . An atone is located at each prism corner and at alternate prism centers . Each atom is therefore surrounded by 12 other equidistant atoms , as in the face-centered cubic arrangement , but not quite so symmetrically . Allotropy. ? Several of the metals are known to exist in two or more allotropic modifications . It has been difficult to define allotropy in a certain manner . The new information on crystal structure suggests that an allotropic change may be defined as a change in atomic arrangement . This definition should furnish a positive criterion of allotropy , hindered only by the experimental difficulties involved in determining atomic arrangements at high temperatures . Some Results of X-ray Analysis. ? Table I ( page 5 ) gives information on the positions of atoms in several metals . The study of the positions of atoms in metals is so recent that only a few generalities can be drawn at present . Some features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystallizing with the face-centered cubic arrangement has been found so far which is not ductile throughout a considerable range of temperature . The face-centered metals are usually ductile even at liquid air temperatures . 2 . All of the noble metals so far studied crystallize with the face-centered cubic arrangement . 3 . All of the best electrical and heat conductors have facecentered ( ' 11111 ( arrallgelllents. // 4 . Both ductile and brittle metals are found in the bodycentered cubic arrangement . This system seems to be less favorable to ductility than the face-centered , according to Hull . 5 . In the hexagonal arrangement , both brittle and ductile metals are found . Hull points out that in the hexagonal arrangement there is only one set of planes parallel to which easy gliding can take place , whereas in the face-centered cubic there are four . 6 . Metals having the hexagonal close-packed arrangement harden rapidly under cold deformation. 7 . Mechanical twinning ( Neumann lines ) occurs in metals having the centered cubic and the hexagonal close-packed arrangements . Alpha iron is an example of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observed in tin , which is thought to crystallize in the tetragonal system . 8 . Annealing twins are certainly most prevalent in metals crystallizing in the face-centered cubic arrangement . 9 . Annealing twins have not been observed in metals having the body-centered cubic arrangement , such as Alpha iron , tungsten , and molybdenum. 10 . Not all face-centered metals show twinning . Twin crystals have not been observed in aluminum , for example . Further results of x-ray analysis will be considered in subsequent chapters . CHAPTER IV THE AMORPHOUS METAL HYPOTHESIS Although solid metals are , in the main , undoubtedly crystalline in structure , there is reason for supposing that they may exist partly in an amorphous condition , and that those portions which are amorphous may exert a very important influence on the properties of the aggregates . This view was first advanced some twenty years ago by George T. Beilby , ' largely as a result of his studies on the nature of polished surfaces . It has since been elaborated and extended , notably by Rosenhain , 2 so that the amorphous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modern metallographic theory . It is the purpose of this chapter to recount the principal elements of this hypothesis and to present a critical discussion and a statement of the hypothesis which is believed to be con sistent with the results of recent research . Definition of " Amorphous . " ? Crystalline materials are charac terized by the orderly arrangement of their constituent particles ? i.e. , atoms or molecules in definite geometrical patterns . Materials whose molecules do not possess any such regularity of arrangement are amorphous . The term " amorphous " is , thus , in the broadest sense , directly opposed to crystalline . A further distinction must be made . Wood is a material which is decidedly not crystalline , and yet , because of the processes of its growth , it possesses definite directional properties . The arrangement of its atoms or molecules is not entirely haphazard . The same is true of all vegetable and animal tissues . In order to define more specifically what he meant by the term " amorphous " in connection with metals , Beilby used the qualifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances which in some degree resemble the glass-like form assumed by the silicates when they are solidified from the molten state . " 63 // Amorphous solids are essentially luidercooled liquids of great viscosity . The constitution of the liquid is preserved and , with it , the property of fluidity , masked from casual observation by the high viscosity . Glass may be taken as an example . On cooling from the molten state , it passes in a continuous manner from a liquid , which can readily be poured , to the solid commonly known at ordinary temperatures , with a hardness comparable to that of the hardest steel . In spite of this hardness , a rod of glass supported at the ends will sag or " flow " under its own weight in the course of months or years . It has been pointed out in the last chapter that the regularity of atomic arrangement in crystals leads to mechanical weakness along certain crystallographic planes . The absence of such planes of weakness in amorphous materials leads to great hardness at low temperatures . The hardness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the present , it is merely necessary to say that the amorphous modification in most metals is regarded as being harder and stronger than the crystalline at ordinary temperatures . Amorphous Films on Rubbed Surfaces. ? The studies of Beilby referred to above showed that the operation of polishing causes a surface flow of the material being polished . The action of abrasive materials is essentially one of cutting . The grinding of a metal surface by an abrasive , such as emery , consists in the cutting of minute grooves , the emery particles acting as cutting tools . When such a surface is polished or burnished , the surface layers of the metal are caused to flow , bridging or filling up the grooves left by the emery . Working with the mineral calcite ( calcium carbonate ) , which is especially suitable for such observations , Beilby found that the flowed surface possessed certain properties which distinguished it from the unpolished crystal face . It was harder , as tested by the loaded needle , and its hardness was the same in all directions , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction in which it was measured . Perhaps the most significant thing is the way in which the polishing operation gradually smooths over the scratches , finally obliterating them and leaving a surface with an appearance " absolutely homogeneous and vitreous , like a coating of varnish or enamel . " Furthermore , that this smooth surface is merely a coating is demonstrated by the fact , that the scratches are again // revealed when the surface layer is dissolved in hydrochloric acid . Beilby concluded that the flowed material is rendered amorphous by the action of polishing . This amorphous film was assumed to be in a condition of great mobility at the instant of formation , so that , under the influence of surface tension , it would assume a very smooth surface . It was then supposed to solidify or " set " in the final hard , glassy state . It had already been shown that the permanent deformation of metals takes place by a kind of block movement on certain crystallographic planes , known as " gliding planes " or " slip planes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other on the slip planes generates films of amorphous metal comparable to the surface films produced by polishing . Like the surface films , they were supposed to pass through a mobile stage and then become hard and rigid . Now the ductile metals are greatly hardened and at the same time made brittle by deformation carried out below the annealing temperature , whether such deformation be effected by cold drawing , rolling , pressing , or other means . According to Beilby 's theory , this " hardening results from the formation at all the internal surfaces of slip or shear of mobile layers similar to those produced on the outer surface by polishing . These layers retain their mobility for only a very brief period , and then solidify in a vitreous amorphous state , thus forming a cementing material at all surfaces of slip or shear throughout the mass . " The increased hardness is thus attributed to the presence of a framework or matrix of a modification of the metal possessing greater specific hardness than the crystalline modification . After this stiffening of the metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes , thereby producing more amorphous metal and still greater hardness . There is a practical Iimit to the amount of cold deformation that a metal will endure . Further attempts cause rupture . Thus in wire drawing , if the process is carried too far , the wire draws hollow or splinters . Even before this stage is reached , maximum hardness and st rengt li are produced . Overdrawing reduces the strength . This is regarded by Beilby as due to the exhaustion of available crystalline material . The crystalline modification of the metal is regarded as the sole source of plasticity , and when the available supply is exhausted the metal becomes incapable of further deformation. // Recrystallization. ? Metals which have been hardened by cold work are softened by heating to a suitable temperature . The softening is accompanied by the restoration of ductility and by the substitution of a clearly crystalline structure of equiaxed grains for the disordered structure found after cold working . This operation is called annealing , and is a regular part of most industrial processes involving the cold deformation of metals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amorphous metal produced by the cold work . Disappearance of the amorphous metal would , of course , involve the simultaneous disappearance of the hardness and brittleness supposed to be due to it . Crystallization of an amorphous solid or undercooled liquid is a common occurrence . Glass and vitreous silica crystallize or " devitrify " when exposed for a long time to temperatures at which they are somewhat soft . The presence of crystalline nuclei greatly facilitates this transformation . Beilby considers the recrystallization of metals to be strictly analogous to that of other amorphous materials in the presence of nuclei . The nuclei are the fragments supplied by the breaking up of the original crystalline grains . The amorphous metal is regarded from the physicochemical viewpoint as identical with the liquid phase . Hence , it must be unstable at all temperatures below the melting point of the metal and is prevented from reverting to the stable crystalline form only by its rigidity due to the low temperature . On raising the temperature of a metal , the atomic mobility becomes sufficient for the unstable amorphous phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Producing Amorphous Metal. ? Beilby ( lid not consider deformation to be the only means for the production of amorphous metal . He recognized that it is not possible to retain metals in the amorphous condition by rapid cooling from the molten state , as is the case with glass , vitreous silica , and many other typical amorphous solids . He did , however , advance the suggestion that " the evolution of a dissolved gas when a critical point is reached may so effectually prevent or modify crystallization that the metal is hardened . " And again , Sometimes a very minute addition of a second substance to a pure metal is sufficient to prevent crystallization in the regular way , or even to prevent it altogether . The product is then more rigid and less plastic than the pure metal . // This statement was offered as an explanation of the fact that solid solutions of two metals are usually harder than the pure metals , the case of gold and silver being mentioned as an example . Another suggestion was that amorphization might be brought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shrinkage strains . Certain samples of electrodeposited copper are found to be very hard and to possess a structure somewhat resembling that of cold-worked metal . Annealing causes recrystallization and softening . From these observations Beilby concluded that " the deposition of the metal under conditions of strain had caused the molecular aggregation to be of the amorphous type . " These suggestions are interesting to note in tracing the develop ment of the theory . Beilby sums up thus : The development of the maximum intrinsic hardness of the metals can thus be brought about in many different ways , but in every case it appears to depend on the special development of the cohesive force which is associated with the amorphous or non-crystalline aggregation of the molecules . What Cements Crystalline Grains Together ? ? In 1912 , Beilby 's hypothesis received a very important extension , consisting in the proposition that the amorphous phase exists not merely in cold-worked metals but'is also a normal constituent of all metals in the form of an intergranular cement ) . Beilby 's original hypothesis that amorphous metal is formed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardening . The postulation of an amorphous intergranular cement was advanced to explain an entirely different set of phenomena , which will now be briefly described . When pure metals that are in what may be called a normally healthy condition are broken , the path of fracture is found to pass almost exclusively through the grains , rather than between them . The grain boundaries appear to be stronger than the grains themselves , rather than weaker , as might be expected . When metals are broken at temperatures just under their melting points , however , the conditions are reversed , fracture following the grain boundaries . // Permanent deformation of metals consists of plastic deforma tion of the crystalline grains , by the process of slip or gliding . If the grains possess any inherent plasticity , as is normally the case in the ductile metals , then fracture through the grains is neces sarily preceded by some plastic deformation of the grains and a general deformation of the metal as a whole . Transcrystalline fracture is , therefore , accompanied by a ductile break . Inter-granular fracture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a brittle manner ? i.e. , with little if any general deforma tion of the metal . The cohesion between grains has become so small that they pull apart before sufficient load can be transmitted to deform them . The assumption that the grains of metals are held together by a cement of a vitreous amorphous nature explains these phenomena is a very satisfactory manner . At the lower temperatures this cement is hard and strong , so that the necessary loads can be transmitted to the grains to deform them and finally cause rupture to pass through them . As the temperature is raised , the amorphous cement gradually softens , ' so that at high tem peratures it is very weak . The grains then readily pull apart without any appreciable deformation . Time Factor in Loading Amorphous Material. ? Since the atoms ( or molecules ) of amorphous materials do not occupy fixed positions with respect to one another , such materials can be deformed by the gradual shifting of the relative positions of their particles . The atoms in a crystal of metal are held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there-fore takes place by the simultaneous movement of a large number of atoms . A correspondingly large number of atomic cohesion " bonds " must be broken at one time . The result is that the strength ( or what is the same thing , its elastic limit in shear ) of a crystal is definite . The cohesion bonds in an amorphous material may be broken very gradually ? almost one atom at a time . The force required to produce deformation is , therefore , // very small . Such small forces must , of course , act for considerable periods of time in order to effect appreciable deformations . There is a distinct and important time effect in the rupture of metals at high temperatures . At any given temperature which lies well above the annealing temperature of the metal , but not too close to the melting point , either intergranular or transcrystalline fracture can be produced at will by varying the rate of applying the load . This is illustrated by some tests carried out on copper wire at a temperature of 950 ? C. l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fracture changed by increasing the rate of loading , but the strength is very greatly increased . This is explained on the assumption of an amorphous intercrystalline cement by the known properties of solid amorphous materials . Attention has already been called to the fact that glass will flow under its own weight acting for a long period of time , whereas it is perfectly elastic up to a stress of perhaps 30,000 lb. per square inch under loads acting for short periods . The typical combination of fluidity and hardness possessed by amorphous solids is perhaps illustrated even better in the properties of pitch . At ordinary temperatures , pitch can be pulverized by means of hammer blows . If the particles of powder thus produced are put in a receptacle , the force of gravity alone is sufficient to weld them into a single coherent mass of pitch . This welding may require considerable time , but it is so effective that even the air bubbles are slowly forced to the surface . Pitch can be deformed into any shape desired if sufficient time is taken . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by allow-ing it to flow very slowly from a small hole . At any time during 1lcis process of flow , a sharp hammer blow will shatter into frag-ments the stream of flowing pitch . Pitch is thus either hard and brittle or soft and plastic , according to the rate of deformation // attempted . Resistance to rapid deformation is very great , but deformation can be effected slowly by extremely slight forces . Now the crystalline grains of a metal are supposed to be held together by an amorphous metal cement whose properties at high temperatures resemble those of pitch at ordinary temperatures . At the freezing point of the metal the liquid or amorphous metal has practically no resistance to deformation . At the same time the crystalline metal has very considerable resistance to deformation . The case is similar to that of water and ice at the freezing point of water . As the metal cools , the undercooled liquid or amorphous metal at the grain boundaries increases in viscosity , so that at very low temperatures it has great hardness . At the same time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a less rapid rate . At " high temperatures , " which in the case of metals means at temperatures above that of recrystallization , the amorphous metal is softer than the crystalline . Suppose a piece of metal , such as the copper wire mentioned above , be subjected to a small tensile load which is insufficient at the temperature of the test to deform the crystalline grains ( the force required to deform a crystal is practically independent of any time effect ) . If this small load is allowed to remain on the test specimen , it will in time cause flow in the viscous amorphous cement and the grains will finally be pulled apart , without having themselves undergone any deformation . The fracture will then be of the intergranular , brittle type . Suppose a similar specimen to be loaded rapidly to a much higher stress . The amorphous cement will sustain high stresses for short periods of time , so that , if the load is applied rapidly enough , a stress can be reached which is high enough to deform the crystalline phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of between them , and will be accompanied by considerable general deformation of the piece as a whole . Hypothesis of Amorphous Metal Cement. ? This is , in brief , the amorphous metal cement hypothesis as proposed by Rosenhain and Ewen . It was advanced primarily to account for the cohesion between the grains of a metallic aggregate and the changes in cohesion with change in temperature . The developmerit of the hypothesis leads , of course , to conclusions regarding other phenomena , particularly hardness . The . amorphous metal at the grain boundaries was supposed to be the same as that // proposed by Beilby as the cause of the hardness produced by cold deformation . Any increase in grain boundary surface must , therefore , result in an increase in hardness . This afforded a ready explanation of the fact that the hardness of metals increases as the grain size becomes smaller . Carrying the idea to the extreme , Rosenhain proposed that the great hardness of hardened steel is due to " the presence of an extremely minute network of amorphous layers " surrounding the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation of Gamma iron . He regarded the amorphous iron as being especially hard in this case because of iron carbide in solution . Beilby 's theory of hardening by the formation of amorphous metal and Rosenhain 's conception of an amorphous intercrystalline cement comprise what may be called the fundamental ideas of the amorphous metal hypothesis . These ideas have in some form gained a rather wide acceptance in England and America , although they have not been so favorably received on the Continent . There is at present no unified opinion regarding the details of the hypothesis , which is quite to be expected , considering its newness and its speculative nature . It must be recognized that this hypothesis concerns some of the most important properties of metals , and therefore deserves very careful inquiry and consideration both as to the fundamental ideas and their detailed development . Can Metal Be Produced Entirely Amorphous ? ? The first question to be considered should , perhaps . be that of the reality of amorphous metal . It is possible by means of the x-ray spectrometer literally to " look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . Unfortunately , however , there is no such positive test for the presence of amorphous material . The most direct proof of the reality of amorphous metal would , of course , be the production of metal entirely in the amorphous condition . Beilby attempted to do this by mechanical deformation , and he selected wire drawing as a suitable process because of its drastic nature . After having drawn wires of silver , copper , and gold to as much as 14 times their original lengths , he concluded that they still contained crystalline metal and that it is impossible by mechanical deformation to convert a metal entirely into the amorphous modification . In addition to the microscopic observaai ions upon which his conclusion was largely based , there is an : abundance of confirming evidence of a more positive nature . // Beilby considered that he had produced a totally amorphous mass of metal by compressing very fine gold powder precipitated from aqueous solution . He described his product as harder and , less plastic than other forms of gold , and also resistant to recrystallization at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature required for the recrystallization of cold-drawn gold wires , a property he attributed to the absence of crystalline nuclei . It is now known that chemically precipitated metallic powders , even when composed of the finest particles , are perfectly crystalline , so that masses formed by compressing them are themselves predominantly crystalline . It is quite certain that no totally amorphous mass of solid metal has been produced . A little consideration of the molecular structure of amorphous bodies is interesting in this connection . The materials which are most readily obtained in amorphous form , such as pitch , glass and vitreous silica , always have several atoms to the molecule . Some of the chemical elements , of which sulphur is an example , can also be obtained in an amorphous condition . A sulphur molecule contains 8 atoms . Metals are monatomic in all conditions of aggregation , and therefore crystallize more freely . A single atom can obviously find its place in a crystal lattice more easily than can a molecule containing several atoms . It will therefore be very difficult to obtain metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grain Boundaries. ? The best evidence for the existence of amorphous metal is probably to be found in the conditions at grain boundaries . In the original statement of their intercrystalline cement hypothesis , Rosenhain and Ewen advanced the idea that the crystallization of metals takes place by the addition of crystal units containing large numbers of atoms . In the region where two crystals abut against one another ? that is , at the grain boundaries ? there would have to be some metal which could not attach itself to either crystal because of being too small in amount to form crystal units . Furthermore , since the crystalline grains have different orientations , the units or blocks of one would not fit in with the blocks of the other , and interstices of irregular shape would be left which could not be filled up with other crystals no matter what their orientation . The metal remaining in these interstices must then retain the structure of the liquid ? i.e. , must be amorphous . // I The diagram in Fig. 24 shows this condition in a schematic way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This conception is no longer tenable , inasmuch as it now appears quite certain that the " crystal units " consist of one atom each . The actual conditions must nevertheless be very similar , in a qualitative way and on a smaller scale , to those represented in the diagram . Certainly , where two crystals of different orientation meet , it is not geometrically possible for all of the atoms present to have places in an undisturbed space lattice without leaving some voids . There are three possible conditions : ( 1 ) There are voids between the two crystals ; ( 2 ) there is a zone in which some of the atoms are held in both crystal lattices , in which case the lattices would be distorted at the surface of contact ; or ( 3 ) there is a zone of disorganized or amorphous metal . There is no way known at present of determining the actual structure at the grain boundaries of metals . It is certain that , under various conditions of temperature and rate of loading , metals behave as they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantially amorphous nature . There are many other properties of metals which are consistent with the assumption of an amorphous cement , and none , to the authors ' knowledge , which are inconsistent . The hypothesis is thus plau sible from the structural viewpoint and logical , in that it offers satisfactory explanations of the properties of the grain boundaries // of metals . This is enough to justify the utilization of the idea as a working hypothesis but one can go even further . The amorphous metal cement hypothesis is at the present time the only satisfactory explanation of the effect of temperature and rate of loading on the strength and manner of rupture of metals . This fact confers upon it an added degree of probability . Impurities at Boundaries . The only alternative theory that has been advanced is based upon the assumption that , even in what are ordinarily termed " pure " metals , there are appreciable quantities of impurities forming eutectics melting below the melting point of the metal . When the metal is heated to high temperatures , these eutectics melt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The molten layers have very little strength , and hence allow the grains to be pulled apart on the application of small loads . There are a great many objections to this explanation . The phenomena to be explained occur with great distinctness in metals of the very highest purity . Any eutectic that might be present in such a pure metal would necessarily have a very high melting point , little short of that of the theoretically pure metal . In any case , the melting point of the eutectic would be fixed . This is not the case with the temperature separating intergranular from transcrystalline fracture , which varies with the rate of loading or duration of load . Furthermore , intergranular fracture can be produced at any temperature from the recrystallization temperature to the melting point . The intergranular eutectic hypothesis is untenable from this point of view . An additional objection is that it does not sufficiently explain the time effect , especially on the tensile strength , such as quoted on page 69 for copper . In the authors ' opinion it is justifiable to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amorphous material . It is not possible to reach any definite conclusions regarding the degree of disorganization of this material or the thickness of the films around the grains . Although definite information on these points is desirable , it is not necessary to the formulation of a useful theory . The essential fact is that the grain boundary metal possesses mechanical properties like those of a vitreous amorphous substance . The amorphous cement occupies a very important place in the structure of metals , inasmuch as it is continuous . Nevertheless , the amount of crystalline metal is so preponderant that , as a rule , I // metals never exhibit properties like those of an entirely amor phous material . In the tests of metals at high temperatures which have been referred to , the tensile strength varies with the rate of loading in the same manner as that of an amorphous mate rial . That is , the longer the time taken in breaking the speci men the smaller the load required . The elongation , on the contrary , follows an exactly opposite course . Metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show little if any elongation , while an amorphous material , like pitch or glass ( at a red heat ) , shows more elongation the slower the loading . Zinc-aluminum-copper Alloy of Peculiar Properties. ? An alloy ' has recently been described which is of special interest , for the reason that both its strength and its ductility are affected by the rate of loading in the same manner as are those of amor phous materials . The alloy is the ternary eutectic of zinc ( 89 per cent ) , aluminum ( 7 per cent ) , and copper ( 4 per cent ) . The principal metal , zinc , recrystallizes at room temperature , so that the " high-temperature " phenomena of less fusible metals , like iron , are in this case obtained at ordinary temperatures . The properties are shown best by the alloy after it has been subjected to considerable rolling at about 250 ? C. A strip of the metal in this condition can be bent double between the fingers , if the bending is carried out slowly , taking , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes it to break with a sharp snap . This is exactly the behavior that would be expected of an amorphous material like pitch . This simple experiment demon strates in a qualitative way the effect of rate of loading on the properties of this alloy . A quantitative expression of the same effects is found in the curves reproduced in Fig. 25 . This alloy resembles amorphous materials in another respect ? namely , the return flow or " creep " after deformation . If a strip of amorphous material , like pitch , is bent in a given direc tion and then released , it springs back somewhat in the opposite direction , but does not immediately assume a stable position . It continues to creep back slowly at a steadily diminishing rate . All metals , with the exception of single crystals , behave in a simi lar manner , but the creep is usually so slight that rather sensitive instruments are required to detect it . Rosenhain 's alloy exhibits this property to a degree comparable with pitch . The curves in // Fig. 26 show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , except that for glass the deformations are magnified 14% times . The exceptional degree to which this alloy resembles materials that are entirely amorphous is attributed by the present authors to a very fine grain size stable at temperatures normally in the recrystallization range . The alloy consists of the three structural constituents of the ternary eutectic . These crystalline con stituents are divided very finely by the rolling process . Grains of a pure metal broken up in this way by deformation carried out above the recrystallizing temperature promptly unite so that the metal is left in a moderately coarse-grained condition . In this case , however , the eutectic constituents can not unite and , by // interfering with grain growth in the matrix ( zinc ) , cause the final grain size to be very small . This , coupled with the probable high specific hardness of the crystalline constituents , accentuates the effect of the properties of the grain boundary metal . The discovery of the properties of this alloy is important , because this is the only case on record in which the properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crystalline con stituents in a metallic aggregate . Other Properties of Grain Boundaries. ? There are many phenomena for which the amorphous metal cement hypothesis furnishes a convenient explanation , but for the explanation of which the assumption of an amorphous cement is not necessary . They are , therefore , not to be regarded as strong evidence for the existence of an amorphous metal cement , but merely as facts which are consistent with the hypothesis . One group of such facts may be comprised in the statement that the grain boundaries of metals are particularly subject to chemical attack and to the penetration of gases . A bronze can be disintegrated into its individual crystals by the action of mercury ( Desch ) , 1 which dis solves away the grain boundary metal . Dickenson has shown that certain failures of manganese bronze were caused by the penetration of solder between the grains while the metal was under tensile stress . The solder must , of course , be molten to have this effect . It is usually necessary in this , as in other cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension in order for any rapid intergranular penetration to take place . Cold-worked articles of brass , such as cartridge cases , are subject to a type of failure known as " season cracking . " After standing for some time , perhaps years , the article develops cracks which are shown by microscopic examination to be intergranular . It has been stated by Rosenhain that failure analogous to season cracking may take place in certain rolled aluminum-zinc alloys in the entire absence of corrosive agencies . There is no doubt , however , that corrosion , either by the atmosphere or by other agencies , greatly hastens the process . Brass articles are often tested for susceptibility to season cracking by immersion for a short time in a solution of mercurous nitrate . Metallic mercury is liberated and penetrates the grain boundaries of the brass where tensile stress exists . Cracking then follows quickly . // Iu the carburizing of steel , the carbon penetrates more rapidly by way of the grain boundaries than through the crystals themselves . Diffusion follows the grain boundaries , as can also be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then cooling rapidly . ' The carbon will be found to have been reabsorbed into the iron by way of the grain boundaries . Commercially pure copper is embrittled to a ruinous extent by annealing in a reducing atmosphere , such as hydrogen . The hydrogen is supposed to penetrate the metal and reduce the copper oxide which is always present . The steam formed is unable to escape and its disruptive force is the cause of the bad effect on the copper . In this case again the penetration of the hydrogen takes place partly by way of the grain boundaries . Many other examples could be cited to illustrate this susceptibility of the grain boundaries to attack . It is to be assumed that the amorphous cement supposed to exist at the grain boundaries is electropositive to the crystalline metal , since it more closely resembles the liquid in structure , and therefore has a higher internal energy content . This would account for its greater susceptibility to chemical attack and penetration by molten metals . The penetration by gases would be ascribed to the freedom of motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not present a rigid barrier to the penetration of gas molecules , as would the fixed atoms in the crystal lattice . These facts can also be explained on the assumption that the structure at the grain boundaries of metals consists of two perfect crystal lattices interlocking with the formation of voids free from any amorphous metal . Vacuum Etching. ? Another phenomenon closely allied to these is one known broadly as " vacuum etching . " Rosenhain and Ewen sought to demonstrate the existence of amorphous metal at the grain boundaries by determining the relative losses in weight of coarse- and fine-grained metals when heated in vacuo . They showed that the losses of the fine-grained specimens were much greater than those of the coarse-grained specimens , and attributed this to the presence of greater quantities of amorphous metal , which is quite logically supposed to have a higher vapor pressure than the crystalline metal . These observations are , however , i Aitcncn , R. S. , Graphitization of White Cast Iron , Am . Inst . Mining Enpr. , Feb . Meeting , 1920. // explained with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain boundary structures mentioned above . Special attention has been called by one of the authors ' to the flow of metals at high temperatures . In making filaments for certain classes of electric lamps , it is desirable to have tung sten wire which will not sag under its own weight when heated to high temperatures . It has been found that at high temperatures fine-grained wires sag much more than do coarse-grained wires . This is consistent with the theory that the sagging consists in flow in the layers of amorphous cement around the grains . Small grains would lead to greater flow because of more grain boundary surface . An alternative explanation is that the sagging of the wires consists in a migration of the grain boundaries ? that is , grain growth ? under the influence of stress and temperature . Such grain growth would take place in a direction tending to relieve the stress , which would cause the wires to sag . The greater sagging of the fine-grained wires would be due to the greater boundary surface and to the greater tendency of small grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in the observed flow ( although not the only one ) , but such a mechanism does not account for the strength properties of the grain boundaries . The authors therefore prefer to consider that the grain boundaries are amorphous , because this accounts for all of the observed properties . Amount of Amorphous Metal Produced by Cold Work. ? The question of the formation of amorphous metal during plastic deformation is perhaps more difficult than that of its existence at grain boundaries . There is , again , no direct evidence and there are in this case no phenomena which can not be explained without assuming the formation of amorphous metal on all of the slip planes . Beilby advanced his hypothesis primarily as an explanation of hardening . It is the opinion of the present authors that hardening can be satisfactorily accounted for on the basis of a rearrangement of crystalline material , as described in subse quent chapters . Any amorphous metal formed would , of course , contribute to the hardening , but it is not necessary to assume its presence for this purpose . Beilby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his studies of polished surfaces . Having concluded to his // satisfaction that the surface layers of polished metals are in an amorphous condition , he assumed that the internal friction on slip planes during deformation also generates layers of amorphous metal . There is some doubt that the surface layers of polished metals are entirely or even largely amorphous , but even granting that they are entirely amorphous , this can not be considered as more than a suggestion that similar layers are formed on the internal surfaces of slip . The processes ? polishing and slip  - -  differ in two important respects . The friction in polishing is between the metal and a dissimilar surface , usually a cloth charged with fine particles of metallic oxide . Secondly , the amount of relative motion between the two surfaces in the case of polishing is enormously greater than in the case of crystalline displacement by slip . Beilby 's Original Hypothesis Impossible. ? A rough calculation will suffice to show that Beilby 's hypothesis as originally proposed is untenable . According to this hypothesis , amorphous metal is developed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . From many observations of slip band , made mostly on fairly coarse-grained specimens , it appears that the maximum extent of motion along a slip plane during a single deformation ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 atom diameters ? seldom greater . It also appears that the extent of slip is less the smaller the grain size . Normally , therefore , the average extent of a single slip is probably well under 1,000 atom diameters . Assume , for example , a single crystal in the shape of a 1-in. cube , of a metal having 100,000,000 atoms per linear inch . Assume that slip generates amorphous layers 2 atoms in thickness , which is about the minimum that could be considered amorphous . The number of possible slip planes on the cross-section would then be 50,000 , - 000 . A slip on each of these planes to an extent of 1,000 atom diameters would result in a general extension of 500 in. , after which all of the metal would be amorphous . But copper can be extended by cold swaging and drawing , without intermediate annealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the metal is still preponderatingly crystalline ! Tungsten wire drawn to 200,000 times its original length without intermediate annealing still gives strong x-ray patterns , showing that it is predominantly crystalline ! Beilby 's scheme of plastic deformation is not consistent with such facts . // The wires of copper , silver , and gold with which Beilby experimented were in no case drawn to more than 14 times their original lengths , and he stated that the maximum strength was reached after drawing to from 3 to 5 times the original length . This increased strength and hardness he attributed to the formation of layers of amorphous metal , yet the proportion of metal converted to the amorphous condition would not have to be so very large . The greatest possible proportion actually so converted in his wires may be judged by the fact that wires drawn 1,000 times as much are still predominantly crystalline . It is believed , therefore , that any amount of amorphous metal that may be produced by drawing a wire to 5 times its original length can not , in itself , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crystalline material left in a cold-drawn wire is further shown by the fact that wires drawn until they have lost practically all of their ductility when tested at ordinary temperatures regain their ductility to a large extent on cooling to the temperature of liquid air . Ductility is at low temperatures dependent on the presence of a very considerable amount of crystalline metal , since amorphous metal is considered to become increasingly hard and brittle as the temperature is lowered . The evidence shows that whatever amorphous metal may be formed during cold deformation is . very much less in amount than indicated by Beilby . It follows that the importance attached to the specific hardness of amorphous metal as the cause of hardening has also been greatly exaggerated . What Causes a Slip to Halt ? ? The conclusion that there are not formed on all of the surfaces of slip vitreous amorphous layers which prevent further slip on those surfaces does not preclude the possibility that some amorphous metal is produced during plastic deformation . A little consideration will show us that the block movements on slip planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two rather distinct classes . When a single crystal of metal is broken in tension , it might be expected that the final failure would take place on the first plane on which slip occurs . Such , however , is not the case , since large single crystals of ductile metals are themselves ductile and draw out under tension into the form of wedges . This shows that failure does not occur on the first slip plane . The conclusion trust be that something happens ( luring the process of slip which causes the resistance to further slip on that plane to // be greater than the resistance to the starting of slip on some new plane . The slip may be said to be " self-stopping . " In ordinary pieces of metal , which are aggregates of many small grains , it is probable that only a small proportion of the slips are self-stopping . The majority of the slips are brought to rest by end resistance . There is every indication that the resistance to further movement on the surfaces of such slips is less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the beginning . therefore , a slip plane is a surface of weakness . All this amounts merely to saying that a certain amount of movement or of time , or both , is required for the building up of resistance on a slip plane . The " weakened and building-up " stage corresponds to the " mobile " state of Beilby . It may be that amorphous metal is actually in process of formation in this stage . The later stage , when the slip has become self-stopping , undoubtedly represents an altered structural condition at the surface of slip , which must necessarily involve some local disorganization of the crystalline metal . This disorganization may or may not be sufficient in kind and depth to justify the assumption of vitreous amorphous layers . The indications are that the disturbance does not penetrate very deeply and also that the differences in orientation between two adjacent crystal fragments are never very great . Certainly , the surface condition at slip planes , even in the self-stopping stage , does not prevent further movement on the same surface . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume the presence of any amorphous metal , and in the later stages it is not justifiable to assume the presence of vitreous layers so rigid as to prevent further slip . At the grain boundaries the conditions are different . The shapes of the original grains must change in a manner depending on the change in shape of the piece of metal taken as a whole . No matter what the direction of extension , the grain boundary surface is increased by cold work . Each slip intersecting a grain boundary produces one " lapped-over " fragment , the surface atoms of which may be utilized to increase amorphous metal at the grain boundary . As deformation becomes severe , the grain boundary layer of amorphous metal should hecouie thicker by the same process . It is the authors ' opinion that the chief generation of amorphous metal by cold plastic deformation occurs here . // Summary . 1 . Certain properties of cast metals , or metals which have been worked and annealed , are satisfactorily explained only on the assumption that the metal at the grain boundaries is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at present sufficient evidence to determine whether this grain boundary metal possesses the perfectly amorphous structure indicated by the term " vitreous . " There is , however , enough evidence to justify the assumption that the grain boundary metal possesses the essential deformational and strength characteristics of typical vitreous amorphous materials . 3 . The hypothesis that crystalline grains of metal are cemented with amorphous metal ? i.e. , the amorphous metal cement hypothesis ? is not inconsistent with any of the known properties of metals . 4 . Plastic deformation at temperatures below the temperature of recrystallization generates additional amorphous metal at the boundaries of the original grains . 5 . There is no means of estimating with any exactness the quantities of amorphous metal which may be present under various conditions . There is certainly more amorphous metal in severely cold-worked metals than in annealed metals . Even the most severely cold-worked metals are predominantly crystalline . The amorphous metal hypothesis is a qualitative rather than a quantitative conception , so that it is perhaps not necessary to form very definite ideas as to the possible quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amorphous metal at all the internal surfaces of slip in the manner postulated by Beilby is not tenable , and the hardness produced by cold working can be readily explained without the assumption of such amorphization. 7 . There is developed on some of the surfaces of slip a condition of cohesion greater than that in the undeformed crystal . This condition may presumably be due to a locally disorganized structure , but the assumption of a layer of vitreous amorphous metal is not necessary , nor is it consistent with all of the facts . 8 . Whereas the amorphous metal theory of deformation postulates that when slip has once occurred on a particular plane no further slip on that plane is possible , the evidence available indicates not only that further slips on a " used " plane are possible but that they must occur in the course of the maximum deformation that can be effected . // 9 . The conception of an intergranular amorphous metal cement furnishes a very good explanation of certain deformational and strength properties of metals and a very useful working hypothesis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause of hardening has been greatly exaggerated . CHAPTER V GRAIN GROWTH AND RECRYSTALLIZATION The crystalline structure of metals was discussed in Chap . III . This chapter will deal more specifically with the sizes and shapes of grains produced on the solidification of metals , on grain growth in the solid state , and on recrystallization . When a metal freezes , the sizes and shapes of the crystalline units or grains vary in accordance with the conditions obtaining at the time of crystallization . In general , there is no distinction made between crystallization and solidification , since the latter is due to the former . As a rule , rapid solidification produces smaller grains than slow solidification . The grain size of cast metals , provided they have not been plastically deformed , can not be changed by heating below the melting point . This is true no matter what the grain size in the cast metal . ' When a cast metal is plastically deformed at a temperature high enough so that no " strain hardening " results , microscopic examination shows that new and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such temperatures is termed " hot working . " Plastic deformation has thus caused the grains to undergo some change which usually produces several grains from each of the original ones . Supposing the metal under consideration is copper , and assuming that the temperature of working is 600 ? C. , severe work ing will produce a marked " refining " of the structure that is , the grains will have increased greatly in number and will have decreased proportionately in size . If the metal is now heated to , say , 800 ? C. , it will be observed that grain growth has taken place and that there are fewer and larger grains . The melting point of copper is 1,083 ? C. ; this grain growth occurs , therefore , while the metal is in the solid state . In what is termed " normal grain growth , " the higher the temperature and the longer the time at heat the larger will be the grain size . In some cases grain 85 // growth is very rapid at a given temperature for a short time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a condition of metastable equilibrium . An increase of tem perature usually produces further grain growth in these cases . Definition of Recrystallization. ? When a metal is plastically deformed at a temperature so low that " strain hardening " results , it is said to be " cold worked . " Microscopic examination shows that the grains have been deformed in about the same manner and magnitude as was the piece of metal taken as a whole . Except in the soft metals , like lead , tin , and zinc , these distorted grains do not change at room temperature . On heating , however , a temperature is reached , different for different metals and for various degrees of cold work , at which the distorted grain structure is replaced by new grains , usually approximating an equiaxed shape . By equiaxed grain is meant one whose diameter is approximately the same in all directions . Hardness tests show that most of the " strain-hardening " effect is lost with this change in structure . This change is usually referred to as " recrystallization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the microscope appear may be called the recrystallization temperature . Recrystallization temperatures for certain metals , after severe cold plastic deformation , are given in Table IV . It is intended to present here a definite concepi ion of the mechanism of recrystallization which will define recrystallization // in a fundamental manner . The values given in the table must be considered as approximations , and are selected with reference to the lowest temperatures after severe cold work , which will produce new grains visible under a high-powered microscope . The recrystallization temperature is lower the greater the amount of cold work , the lower the temperature of working , the purer the metal , the smaller the grains before deformation , and the longer the time of exposure at temperature . It is only a matter of usage that the temperature of the beginning of recrystallization should be selected with reference to the appearance of grains which can be seen with a microscope ; other measurements , such as tensile strength , electric conductivity , or hardness , give more sensitive indications of the first changes of structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen , the change toward the properties of the annealed metal is marked . Technically , recrystalliza tion is the structural change produced in a cold-worked metal on changing from the strain-hardened state to the annealed state . Although there are an infinite number of stages , curves relating certain physical properties to temperatures of heating a cold-worked metal will often show sharp changes within a small tem perature range and a gradual change both above and below this range . Such curves are given in Fig. 27 , showing the tensile strength , elongation , and electrical conductivity changes in cold-worked copper heated at various temperatures . A sharp break in all of the curves corresponds to a structural change , the elon88 THE SCIENCE OF METALS gated ( strain-hardened ) grains having been replaced by small equiaxed grains . The sharpness of the changes in Fig. 27 shows the justification for a term such as " recrystallization " to desig nate the temperature range within which they occur . If a strain-hardened metal is heated to a temperature just below that of recrystallization , no visible grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grain growth takes place , the higher temperatures and extended exposures producing the larger grains . When metal powders are briquetted and heated to tempera tures somewhat below their melting points , grain growth takes place . In the case of tungsten , molybdenum , or nickel powder , the density of the briquet may be only 60 per cent of that of the " solid " metal but , after heating to a high temperature but below the melting point , the density becomes about the same as in the cast or worked metals . On heating these briquets , the grain size normallyl increases both with the temperature and with time of exposure . Electrodeposited metals are crystalline . The grain size may be large or small but heating such a metal may cause grain growth below the melting point . Iron is unique in its grain growth characteristics because of the allotropic change in a temperature region permitting grain growth . If iron is cast , it forms grains of Gamma iron above 900 ? C. , crystallizing with a face-centered cubic lattice . On cooling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 900 ? C. , and this transformation gives rise to entirely new grains . If the iron is kept below 900 ? C. , it behaves much like any other metal within a similar temperature range . It can be cold worked and hot worked and the grain growth characteristics can be studied at temperatures up to 900 ? C. On heating above about 900 ? C. , however , the structure again changes completely into new grains of Gamma iron . Every time iron is caused to change from one crystal lattice to the other a new set of grains is produced . Pure Gamma iron can not be cold worked , because at the lowest temperatures at which it is stable it can not be strain hardened . Average Grain Size. ? Before proceeding with a more detailed account of grain growth phenomena , it will be well to explain what is meant by some of the terms used . // ( trains are three-dimensional bodies roughly polyhedral in shape . Observation of them especially for the purpose of deter-mining grain size , is usually on a polished plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the volume of the grain , but some linear dimension or area . Furthermore , the grains in a given piece of metal of even the most uniform structure always vary rather widely in size . Rosenhain has pointed out that , for practical purposes , it is perhaps the size of the largest grains which is of most importance , and some specifications have been written upon this basis , rejecting material which contains grains exceeding a certain stated diameter or area . It is , of course , probable that the observed plane section of any particular grain does not represent its maximum cross-sectional area , but it is also probable that the maximum grain area observed on a polished section containing a large number of grains does represent closely the maximum size of the grains . It is more common to measure the average grain size over the observed area . The various methods of doing this will not be dis cussed , but a preferred method ( which has been described fully by one of the authors ) will be outlined for purposes of illustra tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a photograph is not desired , the image on the ground glass of the camera may be used . A circle is drawn on the ground glass or on the micrograph representing a certain area on the surface of the specimen , selected so as to include a fairly large number of grains , preferably over 50 . A count is then made of the number of grains totally enclosed and also of the number intersected by the circumference of the circle . Twinned portions of grains are not counted as separate grains . The sum of the number totally enclosed plus half the number intersected gives the equivalent number of whole grains within the area of the circle from which the average number of grains per unit area or the average area per grain may be readily calculated . It should be emphasized again that this quantity does not represent the maximum cross-sectional area of the average grain , but the average cross-sectional area such as would be cut by a plane taken at random . A value , which will be called the average grain diameter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain area . This diameter has no exact physical meaning . It represents what // would be the length of side of the grains if they were all square . Actually , the average grain diameter , determined in this manner , is sufficiently close , for all practical purposes , to the average intercept cut by a straight line through a large number of grains . ' When it is desired to make computations on the basis of volume , the hypothetical square grain may be extended to a cubical grain . The average grain volume is then equal to the cube of the average grain diameter . It will be seen from the above that grain size measurements are only approximate . Some have objected to this inaccuracy and attempted by mathematical analysis to arrive at more exact expressions . The objection and attempt are unjustified in view of the real significance of the figures . The properties of metals are not affected to any marked extent by a variation in grain size of 25 or even 100 per cent . Indeed , such variations commonly occur from point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common use for measuring and expressing grain size are , therefore , amply exact for the purpose . Grain growth may occur without affecting the grain size as expressed by average grain area or diameter . During the first stages of growth the total number of grains within a given area does not change , and hence the average grain size remains con stant . It is not until some of the grains are completely absorbed that the measured grain size indicates the change . Some other means must be used for detecting slight grain growth . For most practical purposes , however , the grain growth considered is of such magnitude that it is well shown by changes in the measured average grain size . Elongated Grains. ? When the grains depart widely and consistently from an equiaxial shape , as in cold-worked metal , it is often better to determine grain size by the intercept method ? that is , by counting the grains intersected by a given length of straight line . It will be understood that the grains of a cold-worked metal are broken up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that the reference here is to the counting of the original grains . The average grain // diameter may be determined in this way both in the direction of working and at right angles to this direction . A complete description of the grains requires measurements in three directions , corresponding to coordinate axes , and made on two surfaces usually at right angles to each other . The ratios of the average grain diameters thus determined indicate the shape of the grains and the amount of deformation that the metal has undergone . The term worked metal will be used to denote metal which has been subjected to mechanical working of any kind , hot or cold , by rolling , forging , pressing , swaging , drawing , or otherwise . The word strain is used very commonly in connection with grain growth , in a sense not altogether obvious . From the phys-ical or mathematical viewpoint , any deformation is a strain , in-cluding the elastic deformation represented by the first portion of a " stress-strain " diagram . But an elastic deformation does not constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . Strain is sometimes used to denote stress , and at least carries an implication of this meaning . " Strain " as used in these pages does not necessarily involve stress . A strained metal or grain may be defined as one which has been permanently deformed in such manner as to harden it . A hot-worked metal is not strained . The strain of a cold-worked metal is removed by annealing. ' l'lie hardness produced by work is called strain-hardness or work-hardness. // Unstrained grains are normally equiaxed in shape , but excep tions are very common . When a metal containing material which mechanically obstructs grain growth is subjected to con siderable working , either hot or cold , it is sometimes found to exhibit grains which are consistently elongated in the direction of the working , even after thorough annealing . An example of this type of structure in tungsten is shown in Fig. 28 . These grains are unstrained , though not equiaxed . A distorted grain shape suggestive of cold working is not , therefore , to be regarded as proof of strain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often found that long grains grow out at right angles to the walls of the mold . These grains are referred to as columnar and they are , of course , unstrained . If the mold is circular , or nearly so , in cross-section , the grains converge toward the center , and may then be referred to as radial grains . Dendritic Grains. ? The appearance of the grains of a cast metal on a plane surface cut through the metal usually gives no indication of the mechanism of their formation . Each grain appears uniform within its own boundaries and does not suggest that it has grown by a process of dendrite formation . That such is the case is revealed by examining an exterior surface of the metal which has been allowed to solidify freely and upon which the dendrites will usually be found in relief . An illustration was given in Chap . III . Figure 29 is a micrograph of a cast brass containing 90 per cent copper and 10 per cent zinc . The structure approximates that of a pure metal , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in etching tint due to concentration of the zinc near the grain boundaries . This effect is known as coring and regularly occurs ( luring the solidification of alloys which in equilibrium consist of homogeneous solid solutions . // Cored Crystals . As the amount of impurity increases , the coring effect becomes more marked . In Fig. 30 is shown a cast brass containing 70 per cent copper and 30 per cent zinc . Under equilibrium condition about 36 per cent of zin is soluble in copper in th solid state , but equilibrium is not attained during solidification and the struc with perhaps the separa tore shows marked coring tion of a second phase The dendritic structure o the primary copper-rich grains is clearly shown Figure 31 shows a simiia structure in cast mone metal , which contain about 67 per cent nickel , 28 per cent copper , and 5 per cent iron and manganese . Both this alloy and the 70:30 brass , after working and annealing , exhibit perfect solid solution structures , indis-tinguishable under the microscope from those of a pure m e t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metals to crystallize in the form of dendrites but also that the solid solution alloys are not homogeneous solid solutions in the cast state . This is important because the discussions below deal with grain growth in sub-stantially pure metals and solid solution alloys , which , after a homogeneous structure is produced , follow the same laws of grain growth as pure metals . On solidification , the amount of the added element in an alloy of the solid solution type influences the grain size . This is particu94 711E SCIENCE OF E7'I LS larly true in case of sharp variations of temperature betweendifferent parts of the solidifying alloy . Whereas pure metals cast in iron molds , or otherwise caused to solidify rapidly , nearly always show smaller grains than when cast in sand molds , solid solution type alloys often show larger grains when cast in chill molds . There seems to be a certain temperature gradient and composition favoring the formation of large grains . The solidification of an ordinary steel ingot in an iron ingot mold seems to produce the proper conditions for large grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interior . It should be remembered that the grain size of cast metals is always large as compared with that ordinarily found in worked metals . Nucleus Action. ? The effect of existing crystals on the crystal lization of a liquid is well known . If a crystal of a salt is put in a saturated water solution of the salt and the temperature lowered , the existing crystal grows larger . The added material assumes the same orientation as the original crystal . If the temperature is lowered very gradually , no new crystals may form . This is only one of many cases illustrating that when a liquid solidifies existing crystals form nuclei on which the liquid crystallizes . A // good example of this rule was observed when a coarse-grained tungsten ingot was heated by the passage of electric current until the central or axial portion fused . Figure 32 shows that the grains in the resolidified portion are continuations of the grains in the unfused portions . When a fine-grained tungsten ingot was fused in the center , however , the metal resolidified in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about 100 of the original grains . The structure of such an ingot is shown in Fig. 33 . This relatively coarse-grained structure is produced in spite of a rapidity of solidification perhaps seldom equaled in any other metal . The fusion of the ingot breaks the electrical contact and in about one minute the ingot cools from 3,400 to about 50 ? C. Such a cast structure does not show grain growth in the solid state , even with long exposures at temperatures slightly below t he melting point . Normal Grain Growth in Solid Metals. ? Grain growth in the solid state in worked metals and solid solution alloys can be illustrated by the behavior of Alpha brass . The structure of a 70:30 brass as cast is shown in Fig. 30 . After hot working or cold working and heating to a temperature around 600 ? C. , the structure is that of a homogeneous solid solution composed of ( quiaxed grains . In worked brass the grains are nearly always // twinned , although twins are not found in the casting . The history of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass after 50.9 per cent reduction in thickness by cold rolling is shown in Figs. 34 to 41 inclusive . No grain growth takes place until a temperature of about 275 ? C. is reached and the cold-worked structure is completely replaced by small equiaxed grains at 400 ? C. after a 30-min. exposure . As the temperature increases , the grain size increases . The increase in grain size with temperature can be seen quali-tatively in the micrographs and is plotted in Fig. 42 . The shape of this curve is similar to that found for many metals by various observers , including Mathewson and Phillips ' working on Alpha brass ; Mathewson2 on copper-tin alloys with 2.4 and 8 per cent // Lin ; and Mathewson and Thalheimer for copper . ll.cpid increase in grain size begins at about 700 ? C. for copper . Although this type of curve is normal for many metals , there are many factors which may and often do cause marked devia tions . McAdam shows that cold-worked Armco iron , annealed for either 7- or 14-hr. periods , has a fairly constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which temperature there is a marked grain growth . His temperature-grain size curves are more flat at low temperature than the one shown in Fig. 42 , but the increase in grain size above 800 ? C. is more pronounced than in Alpha brass above 600 ? C. One of the authors has found that the normal grain size-temperature curve for briquetted and sintered tungsten powder3 is more nearly a straight line than that of Fig. 42 . Sometimes when abnormal growth occurs , the curve may depart entirely from the normal type within certain temperature ranges . The time of exposure at the various temperatures is an impor tant factor in the resulting grain size , especially at the lower temperatures . In Alpha brass a grain size is reached after a comparatively short time , say 30 min. , at 650 ? C. , which does not change to any marked extent with longer exposures . If the temperature is 325 ? C. , the time necessary to establish apparent equilibrium grain size is measured in days . Figure 43 shows the time necessary at various temperatures to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the tempera ture is raised to a little below the melting point , a fraction of a minute is often sufficient to produce a grain size which does not change noticeably on further exposure . Incandescent lamp filaments of tungsten operated at a temperature of about 2,100 ? C. usually exhibit growth until " burn out , " which is sometimes as long as 90 days ' total heating . The same filaments can be heated to a temperature just below the melting point ( 3,400 ? C. ) and in a few minutes , or sometimes in a fraction of a minute , a grain size will be produced which does not change notice-ably when the filament is subjected to a lower temperature . // A severely cold-drawn nickel-iron alloy containing 56 per cent iron and 44 per cent nickel , with a melting point of about 1,475 ? C. , was heated to 1,200 ? C. for 30 sec. and a grain size was developed which did not change with longer exposure at that or lower temperatures . The same alloy required several hours at 725 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the grains were much smaller than those produced at 1,200 ? C. Armco iron containing only 0.02 per cent carbon was pressed cold and heated to 850 ? C. At the end of 1 hr. the average grain diameter was 0.0022 in . At the end of 10 hr. this had increased to 0.0077 in. and after 168 hr. the average grain dia meter was 0.25 in . How much longer this growth would have gone on is not known , as the test was not continued . The important conclusions from these observations are : ( 1 ) that under some conditions of temperature , particularly at rela tively high temperatures , a grain size is established in a very short time , which is stable so long as the metal is not subjected to a higher temperature ; and ( 2 ) that there is in some metals an intermediate temperature range ( which is around 2,100 ? C. for tungsten and 850 ? C. for iron ) at which grain growth continues for long periods and very large grains may be developed . This intermediate temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found , an abnormal grain size may develop . Carpenter and Elam ' report that large grains are developed in commercial aluminum sheet severely worked and annealed for 2 weeks at 550 ? C. Recrystallization. ? A great amount of work has been directed toward the study of the phenomena of recrystallization . Recry stallization has been defined above as the change from the strain-hardened to the unstrain-hardened condition . When recrystallization is complete , the small unstrained grains grow into larger unstrained grains in accordance with the general rules just considered . The greater the degree of strain hardening the lower will be the temperature of recrystallization . Consequently , with a metal of a given composition ? i.e. , a given degree of purity ? anything which will increase the degree of strain hardening will decrease the recrystallization temperature . The amount of deformation effected below the recrystallization temperature is // one factor influencing the degree of strain-hardening . The general rule is that the recrystallization temperature is lower the greater the amount of cold work . Mathewson and Phillips show that in Alpha brass , previously annealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in area by cold rolling requires a temperature of 650 ? C. , and after 40 per cent reduction the temperature is 350 ? C. for a 30-min. anneal . Carpenter and Elam show that commercial aluminum sheet previously annealed for 6 hr. at 550 ? C. , and then elongated 2 per cent at room temperature , did not show recrystallization , or at least complete recrystallization after a heating of 65 hr. at 500 ? C. With 4 per cent or more elongation , recrystallization was complete under these conditions of time and temperature . With severe cold work the recrystallization temperature may be lowered to 200 ? C. or less . Usually , in such cases the grain size is smaller the greater the previous deformation . Grain size prior to cold deformation is an important factor in connection with the degree of strain hardening and hence affects the recrystallization temperature . The smaller the grains the greater is the strain-hardening effect of a given amount of deformation and the lower is the recrystallization temperature . Fine-grained metal elongated 1 per cent may have a lower recrystallization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . This disparity in grain size prior to cold deformation may even produce such marked difference that a coarse-grained metal elongated as much as 5 per cent will not recrystallize at a temperature which will cause normal grain growth in an annealed but fine-grained sample of the same metal . For example , a severely cold-worked aluminum sheet heated for several hours at 250 ? C. will recrystallize . The grains will be small . If the same piece is heated to 300 ? C. , grain growth will take place . A very coarse-grained sample stretched 5 per cent cold may show no signs of recrystallization at 300 ? C. Time of exposure at temperature is an important factor in the temperature of recrystallization ( refer to Fig. 43 . ) A cold-worked metal which might show only partial or no visible signs of recrysallization in 5 min. might show complete recrystallization in an Ilour or more . So far as tests go , it seems that the recrystallization temperature becomes lower the longer the time of exposure . When the temperature which will cause recrystallization with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in temperature // causes an enormous increase in time to produce recrystallization . So great is this effect that a temperature is found not far below the ordinary recrystallization temperatures which would necessitate an exposure of years to produce recrystallization . The temperature of deformation is also a factor in determining the recrystallization temperature . The lower the temperature at which the deformation is effected the lower will be the recrys tallization temperature . A possible exception to this general rule is iron worked at a temperature near 200 ? C. The purity of a metal is also an important factor in connection with the recrystallization temperature . As a rule , a solid solution alloy has a higher recrystallization temperature than the solvent metal . For example , severely strain-hardened Alpha brass containing 34 per cent zinc has a recrystallization temperature of about 300 ? C. , whereas severely strain-hardened copper has a recrystallization temperature of about 200 ? C. Impurities producing mechanical obstruction to grain growth also increase the recrystallization temperature . The recrystallization temperature not only varies for different treatments of different pieces of the same metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a homogeneous condition does not exist . Since with mild cold deformation and large grains it is impossible to produce a condition even approximating homo geneity , such samples usually recrystallize over a considerable range of temperature . The greater the amount of strain harden ing the smaller this range will be ? that is , the complete change in structure frcnn strained to unstrained grains will lake place // within a small temperature range . Since the properties depend on the structure , there is a marked change with a small temperature change . If the temperature at which recrystallization is just complete is considered , it is observed that the lower the recrystallization temperature the smaller the grain size . When some condition is varied which raises the temperature of complete recrystallization , such as the amount of deformation , the grain size after complete recrystallization is larger than with the lower recrystal lization temperature . With a given recrystallization tempera ture there is a certain minimum grain size which can be produced . This minimum is less the lower the recrystallization temperature in any particular metal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature tends to disappear as normal grain growth proceeds above the recrystallization temperature . Equality of grain size is produced only at high temperatures . Figures 44 to 49 , of Alpha brass , cold worked different amounts and then heated for 30 min. at 550 ? C. , show how the grain size becomes smaller as the recrystallization temperature decreases . The grain sizes of the more severely deformed samples were still smaller at temperatures only slightly above recrystallization. // If all were heated to about 800 ? C. , the grain sizes would be approximately equal . The history of recrystallization can be studied by subjecting strain-hardened metal to various temperatures and cooling and examining with a microscope after recrystallization has com menced but before it is completed . This has been done by Chappell ' on iron , Mathewson and Phillips on Alpha brass , and Carpenter and Elam on alminum . In all cases recrystallization begins at the old grain boundaries , preferably at the junction of three original grains . The new grains grow into the original grains with about equal ease . Because new grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly considered that new grains do not appear in the interior of the original grains . By referring to Fig. 35 and comparing it with Fig. 34 it will be obvious that many of the grains in the former must have formed in the interior of the old grains . A case which has been observed frequently is the recrys tallization of coarse-grained tungsten after working . The original grains in a particular case were 0.25 in. in diameter . The ingot was worked below its recrystallization temperature about 50 per cent reduction in area and then heated quickly to a temperature well above that of lowest recrystallization . The grains then measured 0.008 in. in diameter . Most of the new grains were formed inside the original grains . Compressed Powders. ? Grain growth in the solid state in com pressed metal powders has been studied most extensively with tungsten.2 The metal does not consolidate until a temperature is reached far above that of recrystallization after severe cold work . In tungsten , the density of the compressed briquet is usually about 60 per cent that of the consolidated metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 2,400 to 2,600 ? C. , which is at least 1,000 ? C. above the tempera ture of lowest recrystallization after severe cold working . After the briquet has consolidated , it consists of very small grains , which , however , are larger than the original particles of powdered metal . Higher temperatures normally produce larger grains , the same as in recrystallized metals . Special cases of ab normal grain growth in compressed tungsten briquets will be considered in connection with " germination . " // Obstruction. ? Any foreign ' natter in a metal affects the grain growth characteristics . The foreign matter may be in solution in the metal , or it may be present as a ruecha real inclusion or as a separate phase or constituent of an alloy A good example of mechanical obstruction to grain growth is thoria ( Th02 ) , intentionally added to tungsten for the purpose of retarding the rate of grain growth or of producing smaller grains at any given stage in the life of a larnO i the effect of such obstruction is to introduce resistance to grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the obstructing particles . A given amount of obstructing material therefore offers more re ' stance to grain growth the smaller the particles or , with given sized particles , the greater the amount of obstructing material the greater will be the resistance to grain growth . Thoria is introduced as thorium nitrate inf the tungstic oxide before the latter is reduced by hydrogen to tungsten powder . The heating changes the thorium nitrate to oxide . Thoria is present in such small particles that they are not visible except under a high-powered microscope . With 0.75 per cent thoria present , a polished section may cut about 5,000 of these small particles per square millimeter . Many cases of directional obstruction are encountered in worked metals . Slag in wrought iron sometimes obstructs grain growth more in a direction per , fr licular to that of working than in the direction of working . , 0 hen a tungsten briquet containing approximately 0.5 per cent thoria is sintered at a high temperature , the grains are , as nearly as can be measured , equi axed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal is worked at a temperature near 1,300 ? C. , the thoria globules elongate into fibers which do not change mate ially when the metal is heated to a very high temperature . the tungsten . ' a ? ? . ed in drawn wires containing thoria are nearly always longer in the direction of worki g than in other directions . It is obvious that threads of thoria will obstruct growth more in a per endicular than in a parallel direction to their long dimension // Gradients. ? The examples of grain growth given above are typical of the results ordinarily obtained and may be considered " normal " grain growth . Such growth usually results when the metal is reasonably uniform in structure and is uniformly heated . There are many instances of grain growth which seem to be in direct contradiction to the laws of normal growth . A careful study of these cases usually reveals that some non-uniformity either in structure or in temperature has been responsible for the apparent paradox . The most important type of structural non-uniformity is that due to variable strain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two types of strain gradient to be considered ? " general " and " local . " A general strain gradient consists in a gradual variation in the degree of strain over a considerable distance in the metal , such as is produced when a bar is bent or when a Brinell impression is made . A general strain gradient is the result of a grossly non-uniform mechanical deformation , but no deformation , however uniform , can be effected without introducing local variations in strain from grain to grain or in different parts of the same grain . These are referred to as local strain gradients . A second type of structural non-uniformity consists in a nonuniform distribution of material which mechanically obstructs grain growth , and may be designated an obstruction gradient . Obstruction gradients are generally local in character . Variations in temperature within a piece of metal are referred to as temperature gradients . Temperature gradients always exist during heating or cooling , and are greater the faster the change in temperature . The outside of a piece of metal is always hotter during heating than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal , as by the passage of an electric current , in which case the inside may be very much hotter . In ordinary muffle heating the rate is so slow that only small ternperature gradients exist and , if the temperature distribution in the furnace is good , the metal may be considered substantially free from temperature gradients . When temperature gradients exist , they often play an important role in grain growth . Certain combinations of non-uniformity of structure or temperature give rise to what may be termed " exaggerated grain growl 11 " that is , the production of grains of abnormally large size . : 1 ny case of the development of abnormally large grains // may be called germination . ' The temperature range within which the abnormally large grains are formed is called the germinative temperature range . Some typical examples of germination will be considered . An ' important type of exaggerated growth was reported by Prof. A. Sauveur , ' in soft steel containing about 0.05 per cent carbon , given a preliminary normalizing treatment by heating to about 900 ? C. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite degrees of strain by stretching in a tensile machine . Professor Sauveur expressed the strain in terms of the stress to which the specimens were loaded . This is not , of course , an accurate measure of strain , if materials of different stress-strain characteristics are being used , but where all experiments are carried out on the same material the stress does indicate the strain . A specimen stretched by a unit load of 40,000 lb. per square inch and then annealed for 7 hr. at 650 ? C. showed a marked increase in grain size ( Fig. 50 ) . A similar specimen loaded to 38,000 lb. per square inch and annealed in // the same manner showed no grain growth , nor slid germination result if the specimens were loaded to 42,000 lb. per square inch or more ( Fig. 51 ) . Similar results are shown qualitatively by making a Brinell impression in a piece of mild steel and then heating it 7 hr. at 650 ? C. The strain is , of course , greatest immediately below the impression and decreases gradually as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked by coarse grains the strain is just right to produce germination . Professor Sauveur bent another bar of mild steel cold and gave it the same heat treatment . Figure 52 shows how germination took place in a certain zone between the axis and outside of the bar . Another ' very clear illustration of the facts is seen in Chappell's1 tapered bar shown in Fig. 53 . The strain increases continuously toward the small end of the bar . It will be noted that , as the degree of strain increases , the point at which grain growth begins is sharply marked . With still further strain , // however , the grain size decreases in a gradual rather than abrupt manner . Professor Sauveur concluded that there is a critical strain which produces germination . He was unable to produce marked grain growth in Armco iron containing only about 0.02 per cent carbon or in steels containing over about 0.12 per cent carbon . He reports : " It would seem therefore that we must also recognize the existence of a critical carbon content ( 0.04 to 0.12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not grow on annealing below the range , even if they have been critically strained . " The effect of carbon is undoubtedly one of mechanical obstruc tion to grain growth , so that , translating this last conclusion , it may be said that there is a critical amount of obstruction for " exaggerated grain growth . It is now known that some coarsen ing will occur in steels containing less than 0.04 and more than 0.12 per cent carbon , but the maximum effect is obtained in the range named by Sauveur . It is also now recognized that " critical strain " applies to only one set of conditions as to annealing temperature and obstruction . For each degree of strain there is a critical temperature for germination . This ' aw is well illustrated by Ruder 's results on silicon steel ' ( essentially a solid solution alloy ) . Pieces of silicon steel sheet were annealed at 1,100 ? C. and then subjected to various amounts of cold deformation by stretching . Pieces with each degree of strain were heated for 10 hr. at 750 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are expressed qualitatively in Table V , where the amount of strain is expressed as per cent elongation . Only three degrees of grain growth are indicated . A blank space indicates that no growth has occurred . " Coarse " indicates very large grains , and " medium " indicates that some growth has occurred , but that the grain size is not so great as where " coarse " is reported . Table V shows that the germinative temperature increases as the degree of strain decreases and that when the annealing temperature is well above the germinative temperature the grain size produced is smaller than with the same degree of strain , but an anneal at the germinative temperature . An additional fact not brought out in the table is that , as a rule , the grain size // produced at the germinative temperature is larger the higher the germinative temperature ? that is , the less the strain . This series shows the effect of rate of heating through the germinative temperature on grain size . For example , in the 800 ? C. series , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently , in the 1,100 ? ( ' . series the 2.5 per cent sample was heated rather rapidly through the tem-perature range around 800 ? C. and the grain size is smaller in spite of the fact that it was maintained 10 hr. at a temperature 300 ? C. higher . If the heating had been slow , or if the steel had been maintained at the germinative temperature a long time during heating to 1,100 ? C. , the grain size could not have been smaller than in the 800 ? C. series , and might have been larger . An example of exaggerated grain growth in tungsten was reported by one of the authors.I The normal grain growth-temperature curve for these tungsten briquets is shown by the straight line in Fig. 54 . Exaggerated growth can be pro-duced by using metal with a certain obstruction to growth and varying the temperature , at the same time maintaining a temperature gradient . Fine-grained tungsten powder con-taining 0.75 per cent ThO2 was briquetted and heated to 2,600 ? C. by the passage of electric current , and held 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very fine-grained , that at the axis somewhat coarser , and the intervening portion was very coarse-grained . The axis of the rod was the hottest and the surface the // coolest . A briquet of this metal heated quickly to 3,200 ? C. develops a fairly uniform grain size throughout the briquet and only about one one-thousandth the size of that produced at 2,600 ? C. The results of a set of tests on briquets made of very fine tungsten powder containing 0.75 per cent thoria are shown in Fig. 54 . Between 2,600 and 2,800 ? C. there are two curves plotted , one marked " Germinative " and the other " Normal . " The " Normal " curve was obtained with briquets of a separate lot of coarser tungsten powder containing 0.75 per cent thoria . Owing to the coarseness of the tungsten particles , no germination took place , and consequently the curve is normal . In the fine-grained powder the curve is normal up to 2,600 ? and above 2,800 ? C. ' It will be observed that the grain size produced by // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal in size . i. /fr variations in grain size can be produced in the fine-grained tungsten powder briquets by varying . rate of heating to temperatures above that of germination . ' By heating very slowly to 3,200 ? C. , for example , an average grain diameter of 0.03 in. was produced . By heating to 2,600 ? C. for 20 min. and then raising the temperature quickly to 3,200 ? C. and holding 10 min. an average grain diameter of 0.007 in. was produced . By heating quickly to 3,200 ? C. and holding 30 min. the average grain diameter was 0.00045 in . ZEA study of the history of the formation of the large grains always reveals the fact that in the early stages a few grains reach a size considerably larger than their neighbors . Growth is relatively slow during this stage . As the large grains become larger the rate of growth increases , provided the smaller grains remain unchanged 3 When germinative conditions are encountered , rapid heating to a temperature above the germinative range is often the surest and easiest way to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where large grains are desired the rate of heating is again all important . Germination can be produced in tungsten powder by incor porating the proper amount of obstruction matter ( wand heating to a certain temperature by the passage of electric cur-rent Six lots of tungsten powder were prepared containing 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 per cent thoria . These were briquetted and heated for 12 min. in an atmosphere of hydrogen at 3,200 ? C. by the passage of electric current . A temperature gradient obtained from the axis ( hottest portion ) to the surface of the briquet . The resulting grain sizes produced are shown graphically in Fig. 55 . ' Jlthough the obstruction to grain growth is greater the greater the amount o the ej a critical combination of obstruction , temperature , and temperature gradient which produces a germinative condition . This series is particularly important , because it shows how the germinative temperature may be made non-existent by raising it hypothetically to a tem perature above the melting point of the metal The 5 per cent thoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Another case of germination in drawn tungsten wire is very interesting . ' The tungsten metal in question has a small amount of non-metallic obstruction in very small particles . The wire was drawn in the usual way , so that the strain hardening was very great . If this wire is heated quickly to a temperature near the melting point of tungsten , a small grain size is produced . If , however , the temperature is raised gradually by means of an electric current , the structure is very coarse . In fact , the grains usually extend across the whole cross-section of the wire and may be as much as 0.5 in. in length . These large grains form in a time not exceeding about 10 sec . This coarse-grained structure is desirable in certain lamps to prevent undue sagging at high temperatures Germinative conditions are not confined to the growth of grains completely in the solid state . The present authors have found that mechanical obstruction introduced in slight amount into a liquid aluminum alloy containing 4 per cent copper pro-duces a moderate refinement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grain size after solidification is very // large . With still greater amounts of obstructing material the grain size again becomes small . The rate of freezing was the same in all of the tests and the only variable was the amount of obstruction material . Enlarged photographs of this series are shown in Figs. 56 , to 59 . Because of the " coring " tendency dining freezing of solid solution type alloys , a " concentration gradient " might exist . A concentration gradient would produce a freezing temperature gradient which might promote the formation of large grains . In the examples just considered , // however , the concentration gradient by itself was not sufficient to produce germination ; a certain amount of obstruction was necessary . The same amount of obstruction did not cause ger mination in commercially pure aluminum . The striking resem blance of the 4 per cent copper series , at least qualitatively , to the series in which the thoria content was varied in tungsten will be noted . Germination may also be produced by a temperature gradient in a severely strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A condition of grain size contrast which leads to germination may also develop in a severely strained metal on heating above the recrystallization tempera ture . In this connection it has been observed that germination often follows the first structural changes on heating . For exam ple , a strained metal may recrystallize normally and the recrys tallized grains may , at a little higher temperature or on longer exposure , coalesce to form abnormally large grains . In cases of germination due to obstruction and temperature gradients there may be some growth below the germinative temperature . One method of utilizing the principles of grain size contrast and temperature gradients to produce excessively large grains has been described by Ruder for silicon steel2 and Schaller for tungsten . Ruder has treated a strip of silicon steel about 1 by 1 , 6 by 14 in. in such a manner that it consists mostly of a single grain . Schaller has produced some grains about 7 in. long in tungsten wire of small diameter . The process consists essentially in starting with a material with grains so small that much growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of metal is heated to a high temperature in such a manner as to develop large grain locally . The piece of metal is then moved through the heated zone at a rate comparable to the rate of absorption of the small grains by the large . Macromechanism of Grain Growth. ? Grain growth in the solid state takes place by the gradual absorption of some of the grains by others . This may be referred to as " boundary migra tion . " It was formerly held by some metallographists that whole grains gradually changed orientation until two adjacent ones // had the same orientation , after which they suddenly merged . The boundary did not move , according to this view , but disap peared as a boundary on account of the common orientation . Rosenhain long ago showed that growth in lead took place by boundary migration . One of the present authors ' reported the results of an investigation showing conclusively that growth in iron took place by boundary migration . Carpenter and Elam2 have described a most satisfactory method for studying the prog ress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antimony . When this alloy is etched and heated into the grain growth temperature range and then cooled to room tem perature , the original grain boundaries as well as the new bounda ries are visible . Inasmuch as each heating and cooling reveals the new boundaries and does not efface the old ones , as many sets of boundaries as desired can be obtained . Photographs taken after each heating give a splendid record of the history of growth . Carpenter and Elam 's results give additional proof that growth takes place by boundary migration . Laws of Grain Growth. ? 1 . The grain size of cast metals is usually smaller the more rapid the rate of solidification . The grain size in cast metals which undergo no phase change in the solid state can not be changed appreciably by heat ing below the melting point . Grain growth in the solid state may occur in ( a ) worked metals , ( b ) compressed powders , ( c ) electrodeposited metals , ( d ) in iron when it changes allotropic form , and ( e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the solid state . The recrystallization temperature is Iower ( a ) the greater the amount of deformation , ( b ) the smaller the grains prior to deformation , ( c ) the purer the metal , ( d ) the lower the tempera ture at which the deformation is effected , and ( e ) the longer the time of heating . In any given metal the grain size , after complete recrystal lization , is normally smaller the lower the recrystallization temperature . Above the recrystallization temperature the grain size is normally greater the higher the temperature and the longer the exposure . // 7 . The higher the temperature the more rapid the grain growth . At a temperature near the melting point , a few seconds is often sufficient to produce grains which may not change further on extended exposure . 8 . Certain conditions of non-uniformity sometimes give rise to the formation of abnormally large grains . This is called " germination . " 9 . The non-uniformities giving rise to germination are grain size contrast , strain gradients , temperature gradients , concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign matter or a second phase introduces mechanical obstruction to grain growth . Resistance increases as the quantity of foreign matter or other phase increases and as the particle size decreases . 11 . The presence of a certain amount of obstruction matter promotes germination . 12 . The higher the germinative temperature the larger will be the grains and the quicker will they form . 13 . The more rapid the heating through the germinative temperature range , at least within limits , the finer will be the grain size . Need of a Working Theory. ? The material so far presented in this chapter has consisted entirely in the presentation of the facts of grain growth and of such generalizations as may be drawn from them . Some of these statements may require correction or amendment in the light of more accurate or more complete observations , but in the main they are well established and are of immediate practical use in controlling grain growth in metals . It is also desirable to have a conception of the fundamental causes underlying these phenomena , as by this means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rapidly discovered . Many contributions have been made to the literature on grain growth and no small part has been devoted to the theoretical aspects . Naturally , many of the ideas have been discarded and certain ones have gained a sufficient following to warrant their general acceptance by metallographists . In the remainder of this chapter the authors will put forth a conception of the fundamental causes of grain growth consistent with the observed facts and with modern developments in molecular physics . // Possible Causes of Grain Growth. ? Grain growth obviously results from the tendency of matter to assume the form of greatest physical stability , which is the form of least energy . The crystallization of metals from the liquid state is always accompanied by an evolution of heat , representing the loss in the kinetic energy of the atoms incident to their fixation in the rigid crystal lattice . The atoms at the surface of a liquid or solid body are less subject to the attraction of their neighbors than are the atoms in the interior . They are therefore more free to move and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " surface of any body is thus a locus of extra energy , known as " surface energy " or sometimes " surface tension . " There is , therefore , a tendency for small particles , such as drops of a liquid or crystals of a solid , to unite to form larger particles , since in so doing they diminish their surface area and hence their total energy . It follows that the most stable form for any piece of metal would be a single crystalline grain . To have the smallest possible surface area , this grain should be spherical in shape . This would not , however , necessarily give the minimum surface energy , because of the geometrical properties of the crystal . The most stable shape for a crystalline substance is often an idiomorphic form built up of the natural crystal faces . On the other hand , it is well known that small particles of certain crystalline constituents in a metallic aggregate tend on long heating to assume a spherical form . The question is not of great importance here , and may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallic crystal is that of least surface energy , which will probably be either idiomorphic or spherical . There has been considerable confusion in the literature on grain growth , arising from a lack of distinction between true or stable equilibrium and metastable equilibrium . Some have considered that the ultimate stable condition of a piece of metal is not a single crystal , simply because such specimens are very rarely encountered , and then only as a result of rather special manipulation . Such a conclusion is just as absurd as a conclusion that the gravitationally stable form of the earth 's surface consists of mountains and valleys , and for the same reason . ( gain growth is a process involving inertia which must be overcome , just as the friction of the material composing a mount , tin must be overcome before the force of gravity can level it // with the plain . Similarly , the fact that , even after prolonged annealing above the recrystallization temperature , grains may be found having jagged or irregular outlines does not in any way disprove that smooth outlines would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any roughness on the surface of a crystal is a source of increased surface energy , and hence diminished stability . If a crystal is subjected to an external load below its elastic limit , it becomes temporarily deformed or distorted . On release of the load , the crystal returns to its original form . The deformation of the crystal by the external load requires an expenditure of energy which is stored in the crystal itself and manifested by its ability to return to its original shape , doing work as it returns . An elastically deformed crystal thus contains more energy than a similar crystal free from stress and distortion , and is therefore less stable thermodynamically . All the factors have now been considered briefly , which , according to present knowledge , may influence the stability of a crystal namely , size , form , surface , and distortion . The most stable form for a solid metal is a single crystal , spherical or idomorphic in shape , of smooth surface , and free from any distortion of its space lattice . All solid metals must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Any piece of metal which consists of more than one grain must possess a tendency for grain growth which is greater in proportion to the departure from the condition of maximum stability . For convenience , this tendency may be designated growth force . Grain growth will take place whenever the growth force is sufficient to overcome the opposition to growth . Grain growth takes place by a process of boundary migration which involves the gradual transfer of atoms from the lattice of one grain to that of the adjacent grain . Whether or not this transfer takes place through a layer of amorphous grain boundary metal , it requires a certain degree of atomic mobility or temperature for its accomplishment . There is usually present in metals some form of obstruction which mechanically interferes with grain growth , such as thoria in tungsten and pearlite in steel . This obstruction may be so great that it prevents grain growth altogether . In any case , with a given growth force , the presence of obstructing materials raises the temperature required for grain growth . GRAIN GROWTH AND RECRYSTALLIZATION 121 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one grain to absorb another , it is necessary that the orientations of the two grains be very similar . Some observers have reported , however , that the relative orientation of the grains has no apparent effect on growth . It may well be imagined that , although similarity of orientation might facilitate the process of growth , this very condition would also decrease the force tending to cause growth . In any event , there is not sufficient evidence to justify consideration of relative orientation as a factor in grain growth . The proposition that the impetus or growth force is due to a condition of thermodynamic instability and that , when such a condition exists , growth will take place whenever the temperature and obstruction factors permit may be taken as a sound foundation for the development of a theory of grain growth . The factors affecting the stability of the grains of a metal , and hence the growth force , have been indicated ( size , shape , surface , and distortion ) . The relative importance of these factors will now be considered more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , even in unstrained metals , grains of such elongated or extended shape that the ratio of surface area to volume is abnormally high for grains of that size . Presumably , such grains are less stable than grains of the same size but of more nearly equiaxed shape , which , therefore , tend to grow at the expense of the former . Actual observation indicates , however , that such differences in shape constitute a relatively minor factor in grain growth . Rosenhain has observed that in deformed lead , in which grain growth was occurring , the outlines of the grains were ragged , while in cast lead , in which grain growth could not be produced by heating , the outlines of the grains were much more smooth . He considered that the ragged boundaries represented a condition of greater surface energy , hence less thermodynamic stability , and , consequently , a greater tendency for grain growth . This may account , in part , for the fact that grain growth occurs in worked metals but not in cast metals . General observations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lacking , however , so that this factor can not be incorporated as basic in a theory of grain growth . Grain Size the Important Factor. ? The tendency of metals to reduce their store of energy by increasing their grain size is the factor which has probably been considered the principal cause of // grain growth . There are , nevertheless , many who do not regard this as furnishing an adequate explanation of all the phenomena involved . The authors believe that grain size , considered both absolutely and relatively , is the chief factor determining the growth force or tendency for grain growth to occur , and that it furnishes the basis for a completely satisfactory theory of grain growth . A crystalline grain is to be regarded as an organized structure having a definite power to hold its atoms in their positions in its space lattice , and to attract neighboring atoms into its lattice . This power is due to the cumulative effect of the directional force fields of the atoms composing the grains . The exact nature of these force fields is not known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is held by some students of atomic and molecular physics that the attractive force of an atom does not extend to a distance of more than 2 or 3 atom diameters , in which case the orienting power of a crystal would be very little affected by its size when such a crystal contained more than about 6 atoms across its smallest diameter . The authors believe that the influence of the atoms within a crystal upon its orienting power extends to a much greater distance . In any event , it is certain that large crystals or crystalline grains do possess that property which has here been called " orienting power " to a greater extent than do similar crystals of smaller size . Many examples of this general fact are known . It is known that the solubility of many salts in water is greater the finer the particles of the salt . Some figures for the solubility of calcium sulphate in water are as follows : That is , the concentration of a saturated solution in equilibrium with an excess of the solid salt is greater the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that the small particles are less capable of attracting atoms or molecules from solution than are the larger particles . The actual observed effect upon the solu bility is small , and is smaller the larger the size of the par-tides of excess solid . It is sufficient , however , to cause the size of the particles or crystals to increase by a process of solution and redeposition . Chemically speaking , the solution is unsal ur:i , ted with respect to the smaller crystals but supersaturated // with respect to the larger crystals . The former therefore dissolve and the material thus removed precipitates upon the larger crystals . Entirely similar phenomena are observed in metals . The most familiar example is that of cementite ( iron carbide ) in iron . If a steel containing , say , 0.90 per cent carbon is hardened by quenching in water from about 760 ? C. and then tempered by reheating to about 400 ? C. , it is obtained in a structural condition which is metallographically termed " troostite . " Although the structure of troostite is irresolvable under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of submicroscopic crystalline particles of cementite imbedded in ferrite ( iron ) . Now , if the steel is heated for several hours at a temperature of about 700 ? C. , the cementite particles become visible , and on continued heating can be observed to grow . They are not directly connected with each other in any way , so the transfer of material from one particle to another must take place through the ferrite . The smaller particles dissolve in the ferrite until a solid solution is formed which is supersaturated with respect to the larger particles . Precipitation then occurs on these larger particles , with the net result that they grow at the expense of the smaller particles . Physically , this means that the larger particles have stronger attractions for their constituent atoms than do the smaller particles . The general principle here illustrated is that , in an aggregate of grains of various sizes , the larger grains tend to grow at the expense of the smaller . If a condition is assumed in which all of the grains are of exactly the same size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition with no opportunity for grain growth , even though the tendency for growth is present , due to the fact that the thermal stability of the aggregate would be increased by an increase in grain size . The grains all possess equal powers of orientation , however , so that there is no resultant growth force . Grain growth thus depends on a difference in grain size , or on what may be called " grain size contrast . " While the orienting power of a crystal probably increases with its size almost indefinitely , there is ample evidence that the rate of increase is most rapid when the size is very small , and may become practically negligible for larger crystals . Thus the effect of crystal size on the solubility of salts is appreciable only for relatively small crystals . Similarly , the growth of cementite particles in steel becomes very slow after they have reached a // diameter of about 0.00004 in . The actual extent to which such growth proceeds is determined largely by the temperature , since a higher temperature is necessary to facilitate growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently determined the effect of particle size upon the melting point of myristic acid and found that this temperature is lowered about 0.5 ? C. by decreasing the particle size from 10 to 0.8 ? . This phenomenon is another illustration of the fact that very small particles of solid have less attraction for their atoms or molecules than do larger particles . The growth of certain grains in a metallic aggregate at the expense of others may be regarded as a competitive process . At the boundary between two adjacent grains there is a competition for the surface atoms , or the atoms of the essentially amorphous cement which probably surrounds the grains . The grain which has the greater orienting power attracts atoms from the other grain and thereby grows . Drawing an analogy with vital proc esses , it may be said that the grains have definite powers of attack and defense , and that the stronger grains feed upon the weaker . Power of attack and of defense is , of course , synony mous with what is here called orienting power . Orienting power depends upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth force , depends upon a difference in orienting power . This difference increases with the disparity in grain size and with the smallness of the smaller grain . To sum up the above discussion , the causes favoring grain growth arc : Small grain size . Grain size contrast . The importance of grain size contrast as a cause of growth has been questioned by some students of the subject and has recently been emphatically denied by Carpenter and Elam ' as a result of observations purporting to show the absorption of large grains by small ones . These observations are open to two serious objections : 1 . They were made on plane sections , and grains which appear small on such a section may actually be very much larger . Given // any two adjacent grains , of which one is only moderately larger than the other , it will usually be possible to pass through them a plane on which the sections of the grains are reversed in size . It is therefore a mathematical probability that when the differences in grain size are not great there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains some cases where the larger grains appear to be the smaller . In the discussion of Carpenter and Elam 's paper , this objection was raised and has not been satisfactorily answered . 2 . The alloy of tin and antimony used in their experiments is very soft and susceptible to strain in the polishing operation . It is therefore quite possible that an observed large grain , apparently intact , had actually been broken up into very much smaller fragments . There is no reason why a small unstrained grain should not absorb a large strained grain ; this is , in fact , more probable than the reverse phenomenon . The present authors do not know of any well-established case of the absorption of a large unstrained grain by a smaller grain . Even if some such cases should be established , however , they would merely show that some of the other factors which have been mentioned may occasionally overbalance the grain size contrast factor , and would furnish no basis whatever for the dogmatic statement that grain size contrast is not important as a cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive evidence of the strongest kind that the grain size contrast principle is important and usually dominant . Temperature and Obstruction Limiting Conditions. ? The presence of a growth force due to the causes just described will not result in grain growth if the temperature is too low or if the mechanical obstruction to growth is too great . The factors are mutually interdependent . With given conditions as to mechanical obstruction , grain growth will occur at a lower temperature the greater the growth force ; or , conversely , the less the growth force the higher the temperature required to bring about grain growth . With a given growth force the temperature required to bring about growth increases with the amount of mechanical obstruction . Thus grain growth is controlled by three factors : ( 1 ) grain size , relative and absolute , which determines the growth force or tendency for growth to occur ; ( 2 ) temperature , which is equivalent to atomic mobility and determines whether the growth force can overcome the rigidity of the metal ; and // ( 3 ) obstruction , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equilibrium. ? Grain growth may fail to occur or , having started , may come to a halt as a result of unfavorable conditions in respect to any one of these three factors . The growth force may be so small that , even in the purest metal , grain growth will not occur at any temperature short of the melting point . This is the condition that ordinarily obtains in metals solidified from the molten state and not subjected to any form of deformation . It is quite natural that this should be the case , in view of the rapidity of grain growth at temperatures near the melting point . The short time which elapses during even the most rapid solidification is sufficient for the growth force to be reduced by the process of grain growth to such a point that no further growth will take place at lower temperatures , even when maintained for long periods of time . It is quite common to find fairly marked grain size contrast in cast metals in which it is not possible to bring about grain growth . A common example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains which grew out from the mold walls with the equiaxed grains in the central portion of the ingot . Such observations have been considered by some to be inconsistent or even incompatible with the grain size contrast principle . While granting that the failure to obtain grain growth under these conditions may be influenced by the shapes of the grains or their contours , the present authors consider that the grain size principle alone is sufficient to account for the facts . While the grain size contrast may in some of these cases be considerable , the actual grain size is never very fine , in comparison to the grain size of worked metals . It is this general coarseness of grain in cast metals to which may be attributed their failure to exhibit grain growth on heating at temperatures below the melting point . There is reason to believe that grain growth , in the solid state , does occur in cast metals during the process of solidification . An example was described earlier in this chapter of a tungsten rod , the axial portion of which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was pointed out that , whereas it might be expected that the grains formed during resolidification , would be found starting from the unmelted grains as nuclei , what is found in fact is that the new central grains are vastly larger than the old grains in the outer rim , exGRAIN // tending from this riot to the center of the rod . It is quite certain that , in the initial stages of the resolidification , the new grains actually did form upon practically all of the old grains in the rim and began to grow inward . The final result indicates very strongly that some of the larger grains absorbed their smaller and already solidified neighbors . Upon annealing worked metals under certain conditions , it has been shown that the final grain size depends very largely upon the annealing temperature . For the lower annealing temperatures the grain size depends to a large extent upon the degree of prior strain hardening , the rate of heating , time of holding at heat , etc. , but at higher temperatures the effect of such variables is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from growth obstruction , so that the annealing temperature is the principal factor determining the grain size . In other words , there is an apparent equilibrium grain size for each temperature . As the temperature of the metal is raised , grain growth takes place until the growth force is reduced to a point where it can no longer cause growth under the existing conditions of temperature and obstruction . The metal is then in a state of metastable equilibrium as regards grain growth . In this condition the grains are usually fairly equal in size . Consequently , the normal grain growth which takes place on heating a worked metal consists merely in a change of structure toward the condition of metastable equilibrium for the temperature of the anneal . Recrystallization is Grain Growth. ? The replacement of a single strained grain by a number of unstrained grains of various orientations suggests that new crystalline nuclei are formed during the process of recrystallization . It is known , however , that the strained grain has within it an abundance of nuclei in the form of fragments produced by deformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the growth of some of these grain fragments to visible size than that entirely new nuclei are formed . A strained grain may be regarded as an aggregate of a large number of crystalline fragments , each equivalent to a very small grain . This aggregate is not the same as an equal number of unstrained grains of similar size in annealed metal , since the boundary conditions are undoubtedly different . It is probable , too , that the change in orientation from fragment to fragment is very slight as compared with that from grain to grain in an annealed metal . In spite of such differences , the strained // grain is actually an aggregate of smaller grains which , because of their small size and the size contrast unavoidably present , are especially susceptible to growth on heating . When an annealed metal is plastically deformed , the action is most severe near the grain boundaries . The grain fragments formed are , therefore , smallest in these regions . Small grain size is conducive to growth at low temperatures , and it is therefore quite natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and temperature which produce only partial recrystallization , that the new grains are first observed at the old grain boundaries . Long heating at low temperature might cause these first grains , by reason of their advantage in size , to absorb all of the grain fragments in the central portion of the old grain . In such a case the new grains could not possibly be smaller in diameter than one-half the least diameter of the strained grain . If the metal is heated quickly to a temperature well above that of incipient recrystallization , fragment growth will take place sub stantially at the same time in all parts of the old grain . This is probably what happens in ordinary industrial annealing . An objection to this view that recrystallization is merely sub-microscopic grain growth is found in the belief held by some that during plastic deformation the grain fragments retain substanti ally their original orientation ) It is a fact that the new grains which form from a strained grain upon proper heating have orien-tations which may differ from that of the original grain . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments of the old grain , then it must be considered that the fragments which acted as nuclei also possessed different orientations . In view of the fundamental importance of the question , some experiments were made by means of x-ray analysis to determine whether or not new orientations are produced by deformation . The methods and results have been published.2 The evidence was conclusive that new orientations are produced by the sim plest types of deformation , such as rolling or pressing . A striking illustration of chane of orientation produced within // a grain by twisting is shown in Fig. 60 . The definite proof that the grain fragments produced by the deformation of a single grain actually have mixed orientations removes the only valid objection to the view that recrystallization is merely grain growth . The actual amount of grain growth involved in the process of recrystallization is remarkably great considering the small change in temperature necessary for its accomplishment . The average grain diameter in a pure metal or solid solution alloy which has just been completely recrystallized is generally not less than about 0.0005 in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragment size in a strain-hardened metal , but it is known that it is very small , since it requires only a slight deformation to produce slip bands upon a polished metal surface so close together that they can not be resolved under the microscope . The much more severe deformations commonly effected in cold-working operations must produce fragments with diameters on the order of 0.000001 in . The increase in grain diameter during recrystallization is then about 500 to 1 . In terms of grain volumes the increase is 125,000,000 to 1 . The same ratio represents the decrease in the number of grains in a given volume of metal . Expressed in a slightly different way , 125,000,000 grain fragments unite during recrystallization to form one unstrained grain . The temperature change required to bring this about for ordinary periods of heating is usually not over 1,0 ? C. // If a similar ratio of grain growth were effected in the recrystallized aggregate whose grains average 0.0005 in. in diameter , the new grains would be / in. in diameter . This is an enormous grain size for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained under germinative conditions , but seldom as a result of normal grain growth , even on raising the annealing temperature from that of recrystallization to just under the melting point . This suggests that the commonly observed recrystallization normally takes place under what might be called germinative conditions . It has been seen that the recrystallization temperature is higher the less the previous strain hardening . As a cause of grain growth , strain is merely a mechanical process of grain refinement . The greater the degree of strain the smaller are the grain fragments produced and , consequently , the lower the temperature at which grain growth , or recrystallization , will take place . Desch and others have examined the shapes of whole grains removed from cast metals and from worked metals which had been heated to high temperatures . The shapes were as nearly spherical as could be expected when it is considered that the grains were in contact with other grains on all sides , and hence completely filled the space . Foam cells , when isolated , are spherical , but assume polyhedral shapes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external shapes of grains have been found to be very similar to those of foam cells . As evidence of the effect of surface forces , the smaller grains in an aggregate are usually more nearly spherical in shape than adjacent larger grains ? the boundaries of the smaller grains tend to be convex . The number of faces on the surface of the polyhedral grains varies somewhat , but on the average there are 12 to 15 faces . These polyhedral shapes may be considered as the stable shapes toward which grains change when free growth conditions are possible . The grain fragments produced by cold work are bounded by crystallographic planes . Inasmuch as most of the deformation takes place by movement along a relatively small number of types of slip planes , it would be expected that cold-worked metal would consist of fragments of entirely different shape from the grains produced by grain growth . In general , the emystal fragments of cold-worked metals will depart much more from // spherical shape han grains which have been allowed to form at relatively high 1 emperat tires by grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals are only in part similar to very small grains in an unworked metal . The changes which take place on heating a cold-worked metal below the recrystalliza tion temperature would be largely in the direction of perfecting crystalline organization at the boundaries between crystal frag ments and perhaps in the coalescence of some of the very smallest fragments . Such structural changes would be accompanied by moderate changes in physical properties . Complete recrystalli zation , however , would involve not only a reduction in the number of crystal fragments , but the growth of these under such condi tions that the external shapes of the new grains are no longer controlled by crystallographic planes ( slip planes ) but by the surface forces between grains of characteristic polyhedral shape . Recrystallization is , therefore , not merely decrease in number and increase in size of crystal fragments , but it represents a change from grain fragments ? which owe their external shapes to the slip planes ? to grains whose external shapes are controlled by surface tension forces . It has been stated above that normally no new nuclei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence on this point . When metals are cold worked very severely , there is a tendency for the crystal fragments to become oriented in definite directions with reference to the direction of working . After the working has progressed a considerable amount , certain orientations are found to be entirely absent in the cold-worked metal . When such a metal is heated above the recrystallization temperature , the new recrystallized grains have the same direc tional orientation as the crystal fragments in the cold-worked metal . If new crystalline nuclei formed on recrystallization , they would be expected to form with random orientations . It is very important here and subsequently to keep clearly in mind the fact that small grains or fragments facilitate growth because they are easily absorbed . In an aggregate of grains which are strained to various extents , the grains which are least strained are in a position to grow by feeding upon their more severely strained ? i.e. , fragmented ? neighbors . It has been a common mistake to consider that , since strain leads to grain growth , the grains which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallacy seems to be based upon a false conception of // the energetics of the case . It is held that energy is required to impart the power to grow , and that this energy must be stored in some way in the grain . The strained grain is , therefore , regarded as the one endowed with the power of growth . Actually , the conditions are the exact reverse . The unit which does the growing is the grain of greatest thermodynamic stability , and hence least energy content . The logic of this is apparent on considering the conditions on the solidification of a metal from the molten state . The solid , unstrained grains feed upon the molten phase , which has the higher energy content . Grain Growth in Electrodeposits. ? According to the conditions of deposition , electrolytic metal may be obtained in a soft , coarse-grained variety or in a hard form whose structure is so confused that Beilby was led to the conclusion that it is amorphous . Any gradation between these two extremes may also be obtained . If the harder varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very much after the manner of strainhardened metal . Beilby attributed this to the formation of crystalline nuclei in the amorphous metal . Later researches have shown that the hard electrodeposited metal is predominantly crystalline . There is little doubt that the hardness and recrystallizing properties are due to a very small grain size , just as they are in strain-hardened metal . It is sometimes said that the metal is deposited in a " state of strain , " which is correct if taken to mean a condition similar to that produced by plastic deformation . The essential feature in this state of strain is the great fineness of grain . Metal Powders . Growth phenomena in metals formed from powders are exactly the same as in metals which have been melted and cast , although some writers would place them in a separate class . It has been erroneously stated that metal powders will not sinter to form a coherent mass when heated unless the pressure is sufficient to cause fusion at the temperature used . As a matter of fact , tungsten powder can be sintered below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own weight . In fact , it is very difficult to see how pressing a metal powder briquet could have any effect on the melting point except to raise it . The particles of powder used in making tungsten briquets are crystalline grains formed by reduction from tungstic oxide . It is possible that , when strongly compressed , some of these grains // are plastically deformed . Any such strain hardening should be removed before sintering takes place , as the sintering tempera ture is far above that of recrystallization . Sintering therefore consists in the union of unstrained grains accompanied by such boundary migration as is necessary , and usually by distinct grain growth . The grain size of a sintered ingot is never less than the size of the particles from which it was formed . Grain growth here is clue to the usual causes ? namely , grain size contrast and initial fineness of grain . Germination. ? Consider the conditions of grain growth in the hypothetical case represented in Fig. 61 . The small grains are supposed to be nearly alike in size , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of causing grain growth when the metal is heated to a suitable temperature , which will be designated T2 . The small grains in contact with the few large grains are similar to those in the interior of the fine-grained regions . The growth force is therefore much greater at the boundaries of the large grains than in the interior of the finegrained regions and the large grains will grow at a lower temperature ; T1 . Now suppose the metal is heated to a temperature above T1 but below T2 . The few large grains will grow at the expense of the small grains until the latter are entirely absorbed and the large grains finally meet one another . Grain growth will then cease on account of the great resistance of the large grains to absorption , and the resulting condition is represented in l'ig. 62. // Suppose that , instead of being heated to between T1 and T2 , the metal is quickly heated to a temperature above T2 . The large grains will then begin to absorb the small grains as before , and at an even greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth will take place among the small grains , so that presently the large grains will no longer encounter the very small , easily absorbed grains , but will meet grains of more nearly their own // size , which have developed in the fine-grained regions . Grain growth may then cease , leaving the metal as shown in Fig. 63 . Conditions commonly found in metals differ only in degree from the extreme case just described . There are always some differences in growth force from point to point in the metal , and corresponding differences in the temperature at which grain growth will begin . If the metal is heated at a temperature sufficiently high to cause grain growth at some points , but not high enough to cause general growth all through the metal , conditions are favorable for the development of large grains . However , the points at which early growth begins may be so close together that the grains developed are no larger than those normal to the temperature used . On the other hand , if the centers of growth are far apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain grains to abnormally large size which is termed " germination . " All kinds of plastic deformation unavoidably produce local , if not general , strain gradients . The strain or fragmentation varies from one region of the metal to another , from grain to grain , and in different portions of the same grain . The greater the strain the lower is the temperature at which grain growth will take place on heating . Hence , in a uniformly cold-worked metal the points of greatest strain are the ones which act as the centers of germination . The grain size produced will be larger as these centers are farther apart . This condition is favored by slight deformation . Severe deformation tends to make the strain or fragmentation more nearly uniform throughout the metal , and brings the points of equal strain closer together . Abnormal grain growth is therefore most commonly obtained after mild deformation . Sauveur found that a piece of mild steel stressed in tension to 40,000 lb. per square inch developed unusually large grains on annealing at 650 ? C. If stressed to only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take place . This simply means that a stress of 40,000 lb. per square inch developed at a few points strain great enough to cause growth at 650 ? C. in the time allowed . At 38,000 lb. per square inch the greatest strain produced was not sufficient to cause grain growth under these conditions . If a slightly higher temperature or a considerably longer time had been used , germination would have resulted in this , case too . On increasing the stress to 42,000 lb. per square // inch and maintaining the same conditions of annealing , grain growth occurred , but the grain size produced was comparatively fine . The centers of germination were in this case close together . When a metal is heated rapidly through the germinative temperature , the preferential growth of a few grains is prevented because at the higher temperatures a very large number of grains are capable of growth . It might be said that they fail to attain abnormally large size because the competition is more keen . The method of Ruder for producing excessively large grains in silicon steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it very simple type of germination . The grain size of the starting material is sufficiently fine so that marked grain growth of the normal variety will occur at and above a suitable temperature , which will be called T. The metal is then heated so that one region is above this temperature T , but the major portion is below this temperature . In the region heated above T , grain growth will occur and there will be produced grains considerably larger than those in the colder or " inert " region , where no grain growth is taking place . ( It appears that a certain amount of mechanical obstruction helps to prevent the coalescence of the small grains . ) At the junction between the large grains of the growth region and the small grains of the inert region , conditions are ideal for the continued growth of the large grains at the expense of the smaller , exactly as in the hypothetical case described above in Fig. 61 . The metal is now moved through the heated zone at a rate less than that at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of the growth temperature T at a faster rate would defeat the production of coarse grains , just as does rapid heating through the germinative temperature . The samples from which the " Germinative " curve in Fig. 54 was obtained illustrate the effect of a temperature gradient nicely . When heated to an average temperature of 2,600 ? C. by electric current and maintained for about 10 min. , a few large grains formed about midway between the axis and surface of the rod . The hotter portion , near the axis , was composed of larger grains than the cooler surface portions . This shows that growth had taken place near the axis , but not at the surface . The few large grains were located at the boundary between the axial poll ion , which may be called growth raru , /c and the surface // // portion , or inert range . The inert grains were only inert in so far as concerns absorption by grains of their own size . Before heating , the grain size or particle size was uniform from axis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local differences , but no general differences . A mean temperature of 2,600 ? C. was proper to cause growth in the hotter axial portion , but not near the surface . There must then be a boundary between the growth and inert regions . The inert region is inert because of lack of grain size contrast . Some grains in the growth range at the boundary between growth and inert regions increase sufficiently in size to absorb the inert grains and hence greatly increase in size . These grains are the " germinant " grains . The grains well within the growth range are small compared to the germinant grains , because of lack of grain size contrast . When the germinant grains reach a size considerably larger than the grains in the growth region , the latter are absorbed . The germinant grains then grow toward the surface and toward the axis , eventually producing a very coarse-grained structure , as indicated in Pigs . 64 and 65 . The various grain sizes produced by varying the rate of heating through the germinative temperature range in these samples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 to 63 . If the temperature is lowered a little below 2,600 ? C. , the germinant grains form nearer the axis , and with mean temperature a little above 2,600 ? C. , they form nearer the surface . In the germinative conditions due to obstruction ( Fig. 55 ) it was observed that the germinant grains formed first near the surface of the briquet in the 2.5 per cent thoria sample , about half way between the axis and surface in the 3 per cent thoria sample , and near the axis in the 4 per cent thoria sample . The boundary between growth and inert ranges ( germinative temperature ) was thus at higher temperatures for the greater amounts of obstruction . It is evident that the presence of a strain gradient in a piece of metal may lead to germination even on uniform heating . When the strain varies continuously as in Chappell 's tapered bar ( Fig. 53 ) , there is some region where the degree of strain is just right to cause germination at the temperature used . After germination has taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that is , a region of very large grains bordering on the unrecrystallized region of very small grain fragments . // Grain growth will then proceed to some extent into this region , but will come to a halt when the strain decreases to a certain value . It should be especially noted that , when there is a strain gradient , germination may be obtained at any temperature within a rather wide range . When the strain is substantially uniform , there is only one temperature , or a narrow range of temperature , at which coarsening will take place . For this reason the chances of obtaining coarse-grained structures in industrial annealin , or under high-temperature service conditions is much greater when the strain is not uniform . The important effect of the obstruction factor on germination has been pointed out . It has been seen how germination in steel is most marked for a certain range of carbon content ( 0.04 to 0.12 per cent ) . In tungsten heated under certain conditions the addition of a small amount of thoria refines the grain . More thoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still more thoria inhibits growth to such an extent that no abnormally large grains are produced below the melting point . The same cycle has been shown to obtain on the solidification of a certain aluminum alloy under constant cooling conditions . The first addition of obstructing material refined the grain . A further addition caused marked coarsening , and a still further amount again refined the grain . It is not to be inferred front these examples that the progressive addition of obstruction always results in germination . Germination is , in fact , the exception rather than the rule . When germinative conditions are produced , however , the rule is that the progressive addition of obstructing material causes , first , refinement , then coarsening , then refinement . Often the first stage is not marked ? that is , the first addition of obstruction may not produce a grain size noticeably smaller than in the pure metal . The germinative stage is most marked , and the return to normal grain size on the addition of more obstruction is , of course , equally apparent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred , it is found that in Sauveur 's uniformly stressed bars the coarsening resulted from local strain gradients , while in the tungsten briquets temperature gradients are responsible . In the solidifying aluminum alloy , temperature and concentration gradients exist and there is unavoidably at any one time a difference in the size of the newly formed solid grains which corresponds to a strain gradient . These three cases therefore // involve the principal factors which at various times cause germination . The fact that the effect of progressive additions of obstructing matter follows the same law in all cases indicates a similarity of mechanism . Differential Growth Velocity. ? Any case of germination in the solid state depends upon the existence at some stage of a marked grain size contrast , as pictured in Fig. 61 or as described in connection with the Schaller process . This condition is always present when there are strain gradients , either general or local , since strain is equivalent to grain fragmentation . At other times , however , the grain size contrast is not present in the original material , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the germinative process . This is true of the Schaller process and , in general , of cases where germination is brought about by temperature gradients . Once this condition of grain size contrast obtains , it is necessary , in order for germination to proceed , that the metal be held at a temperature where the rate of growth of the larger grains is very great as compared with that of the smaller grains among themselves . The condition for germination may be stated as follows : The existence of marked grain size contrast in a metal at a temperature which permits absorption of the small grains by the larger , but not growth among the smaller grains . Germination thus depends upon a sharp difference in the rate of grain growth from point to point in a metal . It seems probable that the important effect of mechanical obstruction on germination is brought about through the establishment of such differences in growth velocity . It may well be supposed that a given obstructing material , present in given quantity and mode of distribution , exerts its maximum obstructing effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size . If such is the case , then the presence of obstruction may accentuate the differences in growth velocity already present because of varying grain size , and thereby increase the probability of germination . Suppose an obstructing material to be present in a metal to an extent of 1 per cent by volume , and to be uniformly distributed in the form of spheres having an average diameter of 0.0001 in . Assuming , for the purpose of calculation , a simple cubic distribution , the shortest distance between particles is about 0.0004 in. , or about four times the diameter of the particles . Now suppose the grains of the metal to he smaller in diameter than the particles . // It is obvious that the particles can have no important effect on the growth of such small grains , since so few of the grain boundaries come in contact with them . If the grains are about the same size , or slightly larger , than the obstructing particles , the interference with grain growth will also be small in the present case , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter is of the same order of magnitude as the distance between obstructing particles , a rather marked hindrance to growth may be expected . Grains of very much larger size should suffer less interference because the relative distortion of their boundaries by the obstructing particles during growth by boundary migration would be less . It is therefore reasonable to assume that the obstruction to grain growth due to discrete particles scattered through a metal is greatest for a certain range of average grain diameter which is approximately equal to the average distance between particles . According to this hypothesis , the first addition of an obstructing material to a metal would restrict the growth chiefly of the larger grains . Since these grains are already endowed with superior power of growth , the presence of such an amount of obstruction would decrease the difference in growth velocity between the larger and the smaller grains . The growth of grains of all sizes is opposed to some extent , so that the general effect may well be one of grain refinement . Upon further addition of obstruction , a point will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller grains upon which the larger germinant grains feed . Conditions are then most favorable for germination . Still further additions of obstructing material may so increase the general resistance to growth that all grains are kept relatively small . Formation of Nuclei. ? It has been stated above that , in the opinion of the present authors , no new crystalline nuclei are formed during recrystallization . There is no evidence that such nuclei are formed except on the appearance of a new crystalline phase , which occurs in the following cases : ( 1 ) solidification from the molten state , ( 2 ) allotropic transformation , ( 3 ) separation from solid solution , ( 4 ) electrodeposition . The first two of these are most important in connection with grain growth . Growth of the nuclei proceeds by two distinct processes . First , they feed upon the unstable disappearing phase ? that is , the molten metal or the unstable allotrope ( as the case may be ) . // Second , if the temperature and other conditions are suitable , the larger of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the processes of ordinary grain growth . The resulting grain size therefore depends both upon the conditions affecting nucleus formation and upon the conditions affecting grain growth in the new phase . l3oth of these factors are illustrated in the allotropic transforma tion of iron at A3 ( about 900 ? C. ) . Suppose a piece of iron at a temperature above A3 to be cooled very slowly from one end , so that there is a continuous temperature gradient toward the hotter end . As the cooler end passes A3 , grains of the new crystalline phase appear and grow at the expense of the adjacent disappearing high-temperature allotrope . If a sufficiently sharp temperature gradient can be maintained and advanced at a rate lower than the velocity of grain growth , the grains first formed might sweep the entire piece of metal , as in the Schaller process . Slow cooling through A3 , accompanied by temperature gradients , is , therefore , conducive to the formation of coarse-grained ferrite . Slow cooling alone produces distinctly larger grains than rapid cooling . This is attributable to grain growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rigidity of the metal at this temperature is so great that it is possible to completely form the new phase with a grain size much smaller than the equilibrium grain size . Any exposure to temperatures immediately below A3 therefore results in normal grain growth . Other conditions being the same , the grain size of the new allotrope formed on heating or cooling through A3 is roughly proportional to the grain size of the modification from which it was formed . This principle , which has been called " grain size inheritance , " is believed to depend on the fact that the nuclei of the new phase form most readily in the old grain boundaries . ' The fact that grain growth is seldom if ever observed on reheating single-phase cast metals is perhaps responsible for a rather general belief that there is no growth at the expense of solid grains during the solidification of metals . This belief leads to the conclusion that all of the crystalline nuclei formed persist , so that the number of grains in the solid metal is equal to the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a cat , metal is then held to be a direct , consequence of the laws .3f nucleus formation . This theory of the solidification of metals has been particularly developed byTamrnann.r The present authors have indicated above their opinion that normal grain growth , involving the absorption of solid grains , occurs during and perhaps shortly after solidification . On this basis , the number of grains left on cooling is very much less than the number of nuclei formed . There is considerable evidence that actual solidification is preceded by the formation in the liquid of groups of atoms which are essentially crystalline nuclei , and yet obviously some of these groups are absorbed by others ( luring solidification . Germination in a solidifying alloy may be explained in very much the same way as germination in a solid metal . In the case cited , the first addition of obstructing material caused general interference with growth , but with a maximum effect on the larger potentially germinant grains . A further addition pro duced germinant conditions by exerting a maximum obstructing effect on the smaller grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater resistance to absorption . I+'inally , the obstruction became so great that no grains could attain abnormally large size . The Distortion Theory of Grain Growth. ? Within recent years there has been developed , largely by Czochralski , 2 an interesting theory that grain growth is caused by varying distortion of the crystal lattice . It is known that when a metal is cold worked , internal stresses are left which must necessarily involve elastic distortion of the grains or grain fragments . It is also quite certain that the amount of relative distortion varies from grain to grain . The grains which are distorted the least are most stable and are , from the thermodynamic point of view , in a posi tion to grow at the expense of the more severely distorted crystal-line material . The distortion theory postulates that when such growth takes place the atoms added to a grain arrange them-selves in a lattice having exactly the same degree of distortion as that of the growing grain . Grain growth then involves a progressive decrease in the elastic energy of the metal due to lattice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium is reached . // On heating to higher temperatures , the decreased inertia enables more growth to take place , always with a differential distortion as the cause . This theory accounts very nicely for the absence of growth in unstrained castings , and fits in well with many of the grain growth phenomena . It depends , however , upon an assumption ( which appears to the present authors so improbable as to require quite definite proof ) that lattice distortion , and hence internal stress , exists in metals which have been fully annealed . The effect of heat upon internal stresses has been fully investigated in connection with the season cracking of brass , and it has been found that these stresses are reduced to a vanishing point by heating below the temperature of recrystallization . It does not therefore seem likely that at temperatures several hundred degrees higher any appreciable distortion can exist . The surface energy due to small grains is present at all temperatures , and can be reduced only by grain growth . On the other hand , cast metals can be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic limit and involving practically the maximum possible lattice distortion in some of the grains . This distortion can be removed on heating without causing any grain growth . Such considerations lead to the conclusion that surface energy is the principal cause of grain growth . General Propositions. ? 1 . Crystalline nuclei are formed only on the appearance of a new crystalline phase . 2 . Crystalline nuclei may grow by the absorption not only of the disappearing phase but also of each other , so that the final number of grains may be less than the total number of nuclei formed . 3 . Grain growth results from the tendency of metals to assume the form of greatest possible physical stability . 4 . The principal conditions conducive to grain growth are small grain size and grain size contrast . 5 . Grain growth is opposed by mechanical obstruction and by inertia due to low temperature . 6 . A condition of metastability as regards grain growth must be recognized , in which , while the metal is not in the most stable form , the forces tending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . As the temperature rises , this condition of apparent equilibrium approaches that of maximum stability . // 7 . Recrystallization is essentially grain growth on a submicroscopic scale . 8 . Germination consists in the preferential growth of certain grains favored by their large size . The necessary condition is the existence of grain size contrast and suitable temperature such that the larger grains can grow at a considerably more rapid rate than the smaller grains . 9 . There is a critical amount of mechanical obstruction which favors the establishment of this necessary difference in growth velocity , and hence germination . CHAPTER VI MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS Broadly speaking , the mechanical properties of metals are those properties which describe the behavior of metals in the mechanical arts . The conditions to which metals are subjected , both in service and iii the fabricating processes which precede service , are of unending variety , so the engineer is confronted with the problem of determining the suitability of metals for the various conditions of fabrication and of service . It is to meet this problem that the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the behavior of a metal under a given set of working conditions consists in the accumulated results of many trials under those conditions . Actual working conditions are often very complex , however , and the accumulation of such evidence is a long , slow , and costly process . It is , therefore , desirable to analyze the complex conditions into a relatively small number of more simple elements . The common tests of metals , such as the tensile test , are designed to determine these more elementary properties . Complexity of " Simple " Properties. ? A mechanical test is merely a mechanical operation in which the variables are controlled and the results quantitatively measured . The smaller the number of independent variables the more easily are they controlled and hence the greater the accuracy of the test and the more fundamental the nature of the property disclosed . Considering the " simple " mechanical properties of metals in this light , it is found that they are quite complex in comparison with the properties regarded as fundamental physical constants . The melting point , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical purposes to be regarded as absolute . Pressure and grain size exert a slight but negligible influence . The tensile strength , on the other hand , can not be stated with satisfactory accuracy , even for a pure metal , without defining the temperature , structure of the metal , form and size of test piece , and rate of loading . 140 // There is , therefore , a need for still further simplification in testing ? that is , for further analysis of the common mechanical properties and the defining of properties of a more fundamental nature . Such an analysis must be made with the assistance of all the knowledge afforded by metallography of the structure of metals , and the effects of deformation and temperature on structure . Attempts have been made and are unfortunately still being made to solve these problems by pure mathematics . The analytical method is , of course , limited . Even if it were possible to define all of the fundamental constants upon which the mechanical properties of metals depend , and to determine them , the synthesis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such difficulties that in many cases the empirical method of attack would be more easy and more certain . Such a knowledge of fundamentals would be invaluable , however , in classifying empirical information and in pointing the way to new knowledge . It is almost needless to say that a fundamental study of the properties of metals and alloys should begin with the pure metals . There has , nevertheless , been some tendency to give the properties of the pure metals less attention than they deserve , perhaps because of failure to recognize their true complexity . While it is true that metals are most widely used in alloyed form , it is also true that a fundamental understanding of the properties of the alloys requires an understanding of the properties of the pure metals upon which they are based . Classification of Properties. ? All of the mechanical tests consist in observing quantitatively the behavior of metals under stress , the various tests being differentiated by the type of specimen and the manner and rate of application of stress . According to the rate of application of load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " static " and " dynamic . " The so-called static tests include the ordinary tension , compression , torsion , and transverse tests , as well as the Brinell hardness test . The Shore scleroscope test for hardness would also probably be classified as a static test . The dynamic tests include the various types of alternating stress or fatigue tests and the single and repeated blow impact tests . ( Another division is sometimes made into static tests , repeated stress tests , and impact tests . ) The effects of stress are deformation and rupture . The mechanical properties of metals may be classified in a general way in // three groups , describing ( 1 ) resistance to deformation and rupture , ( 2 ) capacity for deformation without rupture , and ( 3 ) word ; of deformation or rupture . In the first group , which may be designated by the general term hardness , are included the elastic limit , elastic modulus , tensile strength , transverse strength , shearing strength , endurance limit under repeated stresses , Brinell hardness , scleroscope hardness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term plasticity , and includes the elongation and reduction of area in the tensile test , the relative compression without rupture in the compression test , the angle of twist in the torsion test , the deflection at failure in the transverse test , angle of bend in the bend test , as well as the general properties denoted by the terms " ductility " and " malleability . " The work of deformation and rupture is the product of the resistance to deformation by the amount of deformation , and can be calculated from the complete data of any test in which both load and deformation are observed continuously or at close intervals . It is represented by the area under the stress-strain curve . The only common test in which the work is measured directly is the single-blow impact test . In a test specimen subjected to simple stress , as tension or compression , the energy of deformation is applied uniformly to all of the metal under test , as long as the deformation is elastic . The energy is stored as elastic energy , recoverable on removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work expended in deforming unit volume of a material to its elastic limit is the modulus of resilience . When the elastic limit is exceeded , plastic deformation may take place in a fairly uniform manner , as when a tensile specimen draws out evenly without necking . The work of permanent deformation may then be calculated per unit volume of the metal . When the deformation ceases to be uniform , as when necking occurs , it is no longer possible to refer the energy to a definite volume of metal . Supposing the stress-strain diagrams of two tensile test bars to show the same total work of rupture , the maximum energy absorbed per unit volume of metal will be in the bar having the greater reduction of area . Cause of Hardness and Strength . Metals owe their resistance to deformation to the forces between the atoms . These forces // are both attractive and repulsive . The repulsive forces are manifested by the resistance of metals to hydrostatic pressure , by which the atoms are forced closer together in all directions . Under ordinary compression loading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compression , but apart in the direction of the secondary tensile stresses . Under direct tension the distances between atoms are increased in the direction of the load and decreased in the direction at right angles ? of the secondary compressive stresses . There is no condition of loading corresponding to a negative hydrostatic pressure , under which the interatomic distances would be increased in all directions . Any permanent deformation of a metal involves changes in the relative positions of some of the atoms , and , therefore , the breaking , temporarily at least , of some interatomic " bonds . " The rupture of any material , whether with or without permanent deformation , also involves the breaking of interatomic bonds . The greatest possible resistance that a material can offer to deformation or rupture is the summation of all the interatomic bonds on a plane through the specimen normal to the stress , a summation which may for convenience be termed the absolute cohesion of the material . Actually , such a summation of forces is never realized , because rupture always takes place by degrees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tensile strength of a material merely represents the maximum number of atomic bonds that come into play simultaneously during the test . Absolute cohesions of metals are far in excess of the values obtained for tensile strength . A qualitative illustration of this fact may be found in a consideration of some properties of pure iron . The tensile strength , after hot rolling , is about 40,000 lb. per square inch , a value representing , as usual , the maximum load divided by original cross-section . If the actual reduced area of the test piece is measured throughout the progress of the test and the stress computed on this basis , a value will be found for the maximum stress which is much higher than the tensile strength . The maximum stress will then be about 80,000 lb. per square inch . Severely cold-worked iron may show a tensile strength of 150,000 lb. per square inch . The maximum actual stress is again somewhat higher ( 165 ; 000 ) , but not in so large a ratio as in the case of the hot , rolled iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place by degrees ? that is , by a kind of tearing action ? so that the highest of these figures still does not represent the inherent absolute cohesion . Some very interesting tests of glass have been reported by Griffith . ' In ordinary fibers of 0.040 in. diameter the material had a tensile strength of about 25,000 lb. per square inch . The tensile strength was found to increase as the diameter of the fibers decreased , and in very fine fibers , carefully prepared , sur prisingly high values were obtained . The maximum strength recorded was 492,000 lb. per square inch at a diameter of 0.00012 in . Plotting the reciprocal of the tensile strength against the diameter of the fiber and extrapolating to zero diameter , Griffith found a value of 1,600,000 lb. per square inch , representing the theoretical absolute cohesion of the glass . Calculations based on the energy required to separate the atoms of metals by vaporization give values up to about 5,000,000 lb. per square inch for the " intrinsic pressure , " a quantity which is theoretically of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Griffith 's extrapolation and of values for cohesion derived from the heat of vaporization may be questioned . The actual numerical values reached are of little significance . The important thing is that metals possess very great inherent cohesion , greater probably than is ever realized in tensile tests of the pure metals or their strongest alloys . Looked at from this point of view , the problem of the hardening and strengthening of metals by various means becomes more simple . Instead of inquiring why metals are so strong , it may better be asked why metals are so weak . Nature of Plasticity. ? Permanent deformation of any material involves displacements within the material , during which the cohesion is overcome between the parts undergoing relative displacement . The property of plasticity depends upon the ability of such displaced parts to reestablish cohesion in their new positions . This ability is a conspicuous characteristic of liquids , . and the plasticity of many materials depends on the posses sion of a structure like that of liquids , or on the presence of some liquid , to preserve continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercooled liquid which at certain // temperatures is distinctly plastic . Even after cooling to temperatures of great rigidity , its structure is still that of a liquid , in the random arrangement of molecules . Clay , on the other hand , owes its plasticity to the presence of a continuous matrix of water which holds together the fine particles of non-plastic solid matter . According to the amorphous metal hypothesis of Beilby , metals preserve their continuity during plastic deformation by the generation of fluid amorphous films on the surfaces of slip . On this basis , the plasticity of crystalline materials depends on their ability to generate such amorphous films . It is quite conceivable , however , that crystalline fragments might adhere to each other without the intervention of a layer of undercooled liquid or vitreous amorphous material . Complexity of structure is opposed to plasticity . The molecules of a liquid establish cohesion bonds with each other easily , without the necessity of any particular arrangement . Hence , two bodies of a given liquid unite with each other on contact . When contact is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized structure , the establishment of cohesion is not so easy . When a piece of wood , for example , is broken in two , it is practically impossible to replace the parts either in their original positions or in any other positions in which cohesion is reestablished . In metals the structure , though crystalline , is relatively very simple . It is easily imagined that the fragments of a metallic crystal broken along a crystallographic plane might be brought into contact on this plane in registry so that the original space lattice , and hence cohesion , might be reestablished . Probably plastic deformation of metals involves both this type of junction and junction by more or less disorganized or amorphous metal . The monatomic condition of aggregation of the metals and their simplicity of crystalline structure favor both mechanisms . Common Properties of Commercial Iron. ? In Table VI are given the common mechanical properties of a very pure grade of iron , in the annealed condition after working . The tests were all made at ordinary temperatures and under usual conditions . Besides giving useful information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to illustrate a brief discussion of some of the mechanical properties . The elastic and proportional limits are practically identical . I ) i ! Terence in the values given reflects chiefly the difficulty of an // accurate determination ? the actual results obtained depend on the sensitivity of the measurements of extension . When metals are tested at temperatures well below that of recrystallization , the passing of the elastic limit represents the beginning of plastic deformation by transcrystalline slip . At temperatures near or above the recrystallization temperature , intergranular flow may take place and mark the elastic limit ; the stress required varies greatly with the time of application . The yield point is well marked in iron and mild steel , represent ing a considerable extension at nearly constant stress . During // this stage , movement on slip planes is general throughout the specimen ; the effect is visible on the machined surface of a test bar , which becomes dull . In non-ferrous metals the yield point is not nearly so well marked and can be defined only as the stress at which some arbitrarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal is not permanently altered by the application of the test load . Beyond this point , however , the deformation incident to the test alters the structure and properties of the metal . Elongation , reduction of area , and ten sile strength therefore depend not only on the original condition of the metal but also upon the effect of the testing operation itself . The mechanism and effects of plastic deformation must be consid ered in interpreting the results of tests in which the metal is plastically deformed . General and Localized Elongation. ? Most of the ductile metals draw down at the point of fracture , so that the relative elongation at this point is greater than the general relative elongation along the bar . Total elongation as measured is , therefore , made up of two parts , one a general elongation approximately uniform along the bar and the other a variable local stretch where the bar necks down . The maximum local stretch can be calculated from the reduction of area on the assumption that the volume of the metal remains constant ( which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , the per cent elongation on the constricted portion of the bar may be several times the per cent general elongation . Hence , on bars of the same cross-section , the per cent elongation , measured so as to include the fracture , is greater // she shorter the gage length ( see Fig. 66 ) . If the gage length ' mains constant but the test bars differ ill cross-section , then the ) er cent elongation is greater on the larger bar , as illustrated by , he values given in Table VI . The gage length is 2 in. in each ease . On the test bar the per cent elongation was 48.3 made up largely of the local stretch at the fracture . Wire of ) .025 in. diameter showed elongation of 23.7 per cent , representng almost solely the general elongation since the contribution ) f the small local stretch is in this case negligible . Reduction of area in tension is characteristic both of the metal Ind the conditions of test . General elongation is to a similar . xtent characteristic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , includes a factor which is proportional to redue , ion of area . Reduction of area and general elongation are not effected in the same way by changes in temperature and other Tariables . Since the measured elongation includes both factors , t will be found that the effect of temperature and other conditions legends largely on the ratio of gage length to cross-section . The dative elongation found by the tensile test is the most common riterion of ductility , the general elongation being probably a ) etter indication than the total elongation measured over a short age length . Ductility and Malleability. ? Ductility is capacity for being Irawn out , or plastically deformed , by direct tensile load without ? upture . It is a property which requires both plasticity and , ensile strength , and does not , therefore , necessarily reach a naximum value when plasticity is at a maximum ? most metals ave the greatest plasticity above the recrystallization tempera , ure , but greatest ductility below the recrytallization tempera , ure ; they have not sufficient tensile strength above the recrystallisation temperature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capacity for plastic deformation without upture by hammering . It does not require as much resistance o tension as does ductility , since the metal is not subjected to she entire deforming load in direct tension . Secondary tensile tresses are developed , however , of greater or less magnitude , lepending on such factors as the manner of hammering and shape ) f dies . Some strength is therefore required , in the absence of which the metal is said to be " tender . " The process of drawing nit by swaging in confined dies is less exacting on 1he strength f the metal than are most forms of harnrnering , aml can someMECHANICAL // times be carried out when successful working by hammering is not possible . There are no fixed standards of plasticity , ductility , and malleability . In fact , these properties are so loosely defined that they can not be expressed accurately even in relative terms . While the term " plasticity " refers chiefly to capacity for deformation , it also carries some implication of ease of deformation . Consider iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. At either temperature it can be plastically deformed to an almost unlimited extent . It is softer at the higher temperature , however , and would commonly be considered more plastic . Since it can be deformed more easily by hammering or rolling at the higher temperature , it would also be generally considered more malleable . Ductility refers more definitely to capacity for deformation by drawing , but there are various ways of estimating such capacity . Some of the older tables , in which the metals are arranged in the order of ductility , are based on the fineness of the wire which can be , or rather has been , drawn , just as the tables of malleability are based largely on the thinness of the sheet or foil that can be beaten . Another criterion is the total reduction in section , or extension in length , possible by drawing without intermediate annealing ; on this basis copper is much more ductile than iron at room temperature . Relative ductility is also sometimes measured by the maximum reduction possible in the first die or the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than copper . It will be noted in Table VI that the tensile strength of the iron wire is about 14 per cent higher than that of the - in. test bar . Presumably , the two materials are similar as to structure , and the difference in strength is in accordance with the general observation that tensile strength increases as the diameter of the material decreases . This has been recognized in standard specifications for wire . It is remarkable that this material showed an endurance limit under repeated stress about 60 per cent higher than its elastic limit in tension . Although there is no general law connecting endurance limit with the static properties , the endurance limit is usually less than the elastic limit in tension . It may be remarked in passing that the endurance stress of 26,000 lb. per square inch given in the table was calculated from the formula for a transversely-loaded beam , which depends upon the assum THE SCIENCE OF METALS ; ion of perfect elasticity , yet the calculated stress is well above the known initial elastic limit of the metal . Rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior ) f metals under stress . Thurston ' divided metals and alloys into two classes , according to whether or not they exhibited flow ender prolonged application of stress . At ordinary tempera-Aires , iron will sustain indefinitely any load which it will sustain or a short time . Many of the non-ferrous metals , however , especially the softer metals , like lead , tin , and zinc , yield gradually under constant load ; in the course of years , lead roofing will creep under its own weight . Variations in the rate of applying load in the ordinary tensile test have a marked effect on both tensile strength and elongation of soft metals , which are , as a rule , increased by increasing the rate of loading . Ordinary variations in the rate of testing have practically no effect on the tensile properties of iron and steel . Under extremely rapid loading the elongation may be increased . Some tests have been reported by Maitland2 on a steel which had a tensile strength of 58,000 lb. per square inch with an elongation of 27 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A speci men was screwed in blocks arranged so as to fall vertically in a slide for a certain distance , when the top block was arrested by stops and the specimen was broken by the momentum of the lower block . Broken in this manner the elongation was 47 per cent . The rate of loading was still further increased by driving the ends of the test bar apart by exploding gunpowder or gun-cotton . Under these circumstances the elongation was up to 62 per cent . Such increases by rapid loading are not always obtained . Instead of causing failure at a low stress , extremely slow load ing of iron causes a considerable increase in tensile strength . Wires broken after a gradual application of load during about 2 months gave a tensile strength about 25 per cent higher than that obtained in a quick test . This behavior , which is peculiar to iron in its magnitude , will be discussed later and correlated with other properties . Time plays an unimportant role in causing fatigue , especially in iron and steel . Thus the metal can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than its endurance limit under repeated stresses for a period of time greater than that required in the fatigue test . It is the reversal of deformation rather than the prolonged application of load that does the damage . There has long been a rather general belief that metals , particularly iron and steel , break more easily under suddenly applied load i.e. , shock or impact ? than under slowly applied load . Impact tests have been made on rails and axles as a matter of routine inspection , to determine their susceptibility to easy fracture by shock . Several types of impact testing machine have been developed ; the most common one breaks a notched bar by a single blow and measures the energy of rupture . It has been shown that for many kinds of steel the energy absorbed is practically the same whether the bar is broken in the impact machine or by slow bending . In other words , the test is merely a bend test of a notched bar . Some steels , however , appear to break much more easily by rapid than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes a point of division in the temperature scale of a metal ? at higher temperatures the metal is " hot " and at lower temperatures " cold . " Deformation at 250 ? C. is hot working for lead or zinc but cold working for iron or nickel . When the various ductile metals are compared at a fixed temperature , such as the ordinary atmospheric temperature , they are found to be widely different in mechanical properties , but if the comparison is made at temperatures similarly related to the respective recrystallization temperatures , the metals are found to be not so unlike . Below the temperature of recrystallization the structure of a metal is relatively permanent . Any change produced by deformation prior to a mechanical test or by the deformation incident to the test itself is cumulative . Above the recrystallization temperature , on the contrary , the internal structure is constantly subject to grain growth which largely wipes out the effects of deformation . Material at grain boundaries also possesses a much greater capacity for viscous flow under stress than at lower temperatures . The phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different classes . There is another fairly marked but not very definite point in the temperature scale of a metal . It is the temperature at which the metal becomes brittle on cooling . Iron in the annealed conthere is appreciable ductility158 7 ' 11E SCIENCE OF METALS dition is duclile at room temperature but brittle in liquid air ( - 185 ? C. ) unless very fine-grained . 1+:quiaxed tungsten wire is ductile at 200 ? C. but brittle at room temperature . Annealed copper , however , is ductile at the lowest temperatures at which it has been tested . In general , the temperature at which brittleness appears on cooling is highly dependent on the structure of the metal . This brittleness is often accompanied by low or erratic strength , due to the easy development of high local stresses by eccentric loading . It follows that values for strength are likely to be most dependable when the temperature of test is such that The temperature scale of a solid metal can thus be roughly divided into three regions : ( 1 ) A region of low-temperature brittleness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) An intermediate region above the temperature at which the metal becomes brittle due to cold , but below the tem-perature of recrystallization . It is in this temperature region that most metals are used . Mechanical working in this zone is called " cold working " and causes an increase in hardness and decrease in plasticity. ( 3 ) A zone of hot working , lying above the tem-perature of recrystallization . Metals possess little elasticity at these temperatures , but flow slowly under small loads . In this MECIIANICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS 159. zone mechanical working can be carried on to a practically unlimited extent . The strength and hardness of metals normally decrease on raising the temperature , while the plasticity increases . Figure 67 shows the effect of temperature on the tensile strength , elongation , and reduction of area of copper . The elongation was measured on a gage length equal to 80 times the diameter of the specimen , so the values represent general elongation practically unaffected by the local stretch at the fracture . The results obtained at the higher temperatures depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these curves are plotted were made in from 2 to 10 niin . Tensile strength decreases continuously from ? 185 to 950 ? C. , and is known to continue decreasing to the melting point ( 1,083 ? C. ) . Elongation also decreases continuously from - 185 ? C. to the melting point . Throughout the same temperature range the plasticity increases , but elongation depends on both plasticity and strength ; the decrease in elongation with rising temperature is due to the large decrease in tensile strength . Since the elonga160 THE SCIENCE OP METALS Lion has its highest value at the lowest temperature shown , it is obvious that the entire curve lies within the last two of the temperature regions mentioned above ? i.e. , the intermediate and the high . Copper probably enters the low-temperature zone of brittleness somewhere between - 185 ? C. and absolute zero , but no actual tests are known to the authors . Reduction of area increases slightly with rising temperature up to the temperature of recrystallization , above which it falls off sharply . Tensile strength , elongation , and reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the rate of loading when testing above the recrystallization temperature . Figure 68 shows the effect of temperature on the elongation of annealed rnolydenum . In these curves the low and intermediate temperature zones are represented . Recrystallization occurs at about 900 ? C. , the highest temperature at which these tests were carried out . It is to be noted that the fine-grained wire retained its ductility at lower temperatures than the others . Pressure. ? Metals are perfectly elastic under pressure applied uniformly on all sides ( under hydrostatic pressure ) . They are compressed as the pressure is applied but , on removal of the pressure , regain their original volume , except for the closing up of cavities . There is no permanent change in structure or properties . Hydrostatic pressure does not cause plastic deformation or cold-working effects . Hardness increases with pressure , especially for soft materials . When a metal is under great hydrostatic pressure , its resistance to deformation is greater than at low pressures . Metals are seldom used under hydrostatic pressures of any important magnitude , but such pressures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best example . The metal is confined in a receiver , usually of cylindrical form , and pressed out through a die by a ram . Pressure is exerted on the metal on all sides except at the opening through which it is extruded . When a metal is worked in confined dies , as in swaging , and to a less extent in pressing and forging , it is under hydrostatic pressure , although there are of course , other forces which cause the desired deformations . Hydrostatic pressure acting on the metal in these fabricating processes contributes to its plasticity by holding the crystalline fragments in more intimate contact ( luring deformation. 4 // Elements of Structure. ? The crystalline grains of a metal may vary as to size , shape , and orientation . Of these qualities , size ' is by far the most definite . Shapes are so irregular that they are not subject to more than qualitative description . The most apparent distinction is perhaps that between equiaxed grains and elongated grains . In this connection it must be remembered that the elongated " grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregates of very small grain fragments . In a strictly pure metal , recrystallization ordinarily results in the formation of equiaxed grains . When sufficient insoluble ( or soluble but segre gated ) impurities are present , there is a tendency for the grains to become longer in the direction of working . Elongated grains are also found in cast metal , especially after rapid solidification . Grains also differ in shape with respect to their boundaries ? whether made up of straight or of curved lines . Grain boundaries in ferrite ( Alpha iron ) , for example , are normally quite curved and irregular , although they tend to become more rectilinear after certain annealing treatments . In Gamma iron and the austenitic solid solutions formed from it , the grain boundaries are , as a rule , straight and regular . To describe the structure of a metal with reference to the orientation of its grains is still more indefinite . To begin with , it is quite difficult , or at least tedious , to determine the orientation of any particular grain . It seems that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffraction patterns show , however , that in severely cold-worked metals there is a tendency for the crystal fragments to assume a certain uniformity of orientation , which is found to persist after annealing . There is a peculiar type of " rectangular " brittleness sometimes encoun tered in annealed mild steel sheet which is attributed by Stead2 to a more or less uniform orientation of the grains . Fine grain is generally held to be a desirable structure , promot ing toughness , strength , and ductility . Strength and hardness increase as grain size decreases , at least in the intermediate temperature zone . At high temperatures , fine grain is a source of softness , especially under prolonged application of load , which leads to flow at the grain boundaries . In general , small grain // size contributes to hardness under conditions of temperature and rate of loading which lead to deformation by slip . Plasticity decreases with decrease in grain size , in the sense that more effort is required to bring about a given deformation and that the strain-hardening effect of a given deformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , however , because of the increased strength . Fine-grained zinc , for example , is malleable at ordinary temperatures , whereas coarse-grained zinc is brittle . Maximum ductility usually cecurs at an intermediate grain size . Alpha brass , nickel-silver , and copper show maximum elongation at room tempera ture after an anneal well above the lowest recrystallization temperature , but well below the melting point , and hence with medium grain size . The reduction of area seems to be greater the finer the grain , within the limits of our ability to produce fine-grained recrystallized structures . There must be a limit to the reduction in grain size beyond which further refinement of grain will produce less reduction of area . Deformation. ? It is now known that cold deformation pro duces refinement of grain in the sense that one original grain , after cold work , exhibits a mixture of orientations . ' This type of grain refinement is not the same as the refinement of grain produced by annealing at low temperatures . For example , a metal may be obtained with the same hardness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severely worked piece at a temperature which will produce small unstrained grains . Although the hardnesses are the same , the other properties may not be and usually are not the same . These and other considerations make it necessary to consider that cold working produces a structure unlike that obtained in any other manner . Even though there is refinement of grain by cold working , the directional properties of the crystals are never obliterated , and , in fact , extreme conditions of cold work actually produce directional characteristics , namely , a tendency for the crystal units to be oriented in a certain manner with refer ence to the direction of deformation . This condition has been described by Berger ' in very fine tungsten wire . // Inasuutcic as the structures produced by cold defornurtion are unique and are too minute for direct observation , the structural condition of cold-worked metals must be described in terms of the deformations to which they have been subjected . The general effect of cold deformation is to increase hardness and decrease plasticity . The yield point and tensile strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The capacity for further cold work is , of course , decreased . Annealing above the recrystallization temperature removes the hardening effects . Figure 69 shows the effect of progressive cold rolling on the properties of a very pure grade of copper . After being reduced cold 50 per cent in section , the metal was annealed at various temperatures , with the results shown on the right-hand side of the diagram . In general , the effects of hot working are very much the same as those of cold working followed by annealing above the recrystallization temperature . Although at high temperatures metals are capable of some permanent deformation by the process of viscous flow at the grain boundaries , and perhaps migration of the boundaries themselves , most of the deformation incident to hot working takes place by the breaking up of the crystals and the movement of the fragments along the slip planes . This type of deformation produces conditions favorable to grain growth . Immediately after a deforming operation , such as a hammer blow or a pass through rolls , grain growth takes place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformation , which again breaks up the grains . The final grain size of hot-worked metal therefore depends largely upon the finishing temperature . A very high finishing temperature is apt to result in excessively coarse-grained metal . If , on the other hand , working is continued until the metal has cooled down around the recrystallization temperature , a somewhat strainhardened condition may obtain . Fiber. ? Hot working creates " fiber . " Physical defects in a cast metal , such as blowholes , pipes , slag , or oxide films , are drawn out in the direction of working . The non-metallic impurities , being often brittle at the working temperature , are also to a large extent broken up and scattered . The result is a general improvement because of the greater continuity of the metal , and a special improvement in the direction of the working . The distribution of the impurities is such that their total crosssection on planes perpendicular to the direction of working is much less than on planes parallel to the direction of working . This may lead to quite appreciably lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in test bars taken at right angles to the direction of working , or " across the grain " of the metal . This effect is , of course , more marked the greater the amount of impurities present . Impurities also affect the shapes of the grains . A perfectly pure and physically sound metal would , after hot working , have substantially equiaxed grains . Non-metallic impurities generally obstruct grain growth and , because of their distribution in worked metals , the obstruction to growth at right angles to the direction of working is greater than the obstruction to growth in the direction of working . The grains of hot-worked metals , or of metals that have been cold worked and annealed , therefore tend to be elongated in the direction of working . Properties of Metal Crystals. ? A single crystal is an aggregation of atoms occupying ( or vibrating about ) definite equilibrium positions , to which they tend to return if displaced by the application of an external force . This gives rise to the property of elasticity . The mathematical exactness of the space lattice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies . It may follow that single crystals are perfectly elastic . Any deformation short of rupture produced by an external force disappears on removal of the force . Furthermore , the extent of the deformation remains constant under a constant force ? // that is , there is no flow in a single crystal . The rate of application and the duration of load , therefore , are of little significance , and return to the initial form on removal of load takes place very quickly with none of that " creep " shown by amorphous solids . Failure of crystals under load seems always to take place on crystallographic planes , which are to be recognized as planes of weakness . If the fragments adhere to each other , the crystal is said to be plastic , and the planes of failure are slip planes or gliding planes . If the fragments do not adhere , the crystal is brittle and the planes are called " cleavage planes . " In either case failure takes place by a shearing action , and the first failure marks the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is elastic . Therefore , the only " strength property " of a single crystal is its elastic limit in shear , which is , of course , different in different crystallographic directions . Hardness depends on the same property , since any method of hardness testing involves failure by shear . Conversely , the " strength " of single crystals , whether of pure metals or of metallic compounds , may be regarded as approximately proportional to their hardness . Crystallization of a metal from the molten state is accompanied by the sudden development of a definite shearing strength . This strength increases as the temperature falls in a manner which , so far as is known , is continuous , unless there is an allotropic change . The strength of a crystal is evidently due to the attractive forces between its atoms . Thermal vibrations of the atoms oppose these attractive forces , so that at high temperatures the crystals are relatively soft and weak . As the temperature falls , the amplitude of atomic vibration decreases and the interatomic forces become more and more assertive , increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a continuous function of the temperature , the increase in strength of a single crystal on cooling must also be continuous , as long as there is no change in the arrangement of the atoms ? that is , no allotropic change . The modulus of elasticity also increases continuously on cooling . The properties of crystals of the various metals depend on the characteristics of the atoms of which they are built and on the type of space lattice in which the atoms are arranged . Only three types of lattice , all simple , have been found in most metals . These are the face-centered cubic , body-centered cubic ( or centered cubic ) , and hexagonal close-packed . All metals known // to crystallize with the face-centered cubic arrangement are ductile throughout a wide range of temperature . Examples of this class are gold , silver , copper , and aluminum . The hexagonal arrangement appears less conducive to ductility , as illustrated by the metals , zinc , cadmium , and magnesium . Hull has pointed out that in the hexagonal arrangement there is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take place , where-as in the face-centered cubic there are four . Both ductile and brittle metals are found with the body-centered cubic arrange ment which seems somewhat less favorable to ductility than the face-centered . Amorphous Metal. ? There must , of necessity , be some dis-organization of the crystalline structure at the grain boundaries of metals and on most of the surfaces of slip . The degree of disorganization probably varies all the way from perfect crystal-linity to the completely disorganized structure denoted by the term " vitreous amorphous . " All such metal of disorganized structure simulates the vitreous amorphous materials in its mechanical properties . Fluidity is the important charac teristic of amorphous materials . Plastic deformation takes place by the same kind of flow as in ordinary liquids , except that at low temper-atures the viscosity is very great . Whereas the strength of a crystal depends on temperature and is practically unaffected by the dura-tion of loading , the resistance to deformation of an amorphous material not only varies rapidly with the temperature for a given rate or duration of loading , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duration of loading . In Fig. 70 the two curves represent qualitatively the effect of temperature on the " cohesion " of crystalline and amorphous metal . For this purpose , cohesion of crystalline metal denotes the stress required to cause failure by slip . That is , cohesion is measured by the elastic limit of the crystal . ( ' ohesion : of : innorMECHANICAL // phous metal is also measured by the elastic limit ? i.e. , the maxi-mum stress that can be sustained without permanent deformation . This quantity obviously depends on the time during which the stress acts . The curve , therefore , represents only one rate and duration of loading . It will be noted that the crystalline metal is represented as acquiring a definite cohesion at the time of its formation ? that is , at the freezing point of the metal ? but there is no discontinuity in the cohesion of the amorphous metal at this point . Below the freezing point the cohesion of each modification increases continu ously as the temperature falls , the rate of change being most rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature the curves intersect , indicating that the cohesion of the amor phous modification has become equal to that of the crystalline . This temperature has been called the " equi-cohesive tempera ture . " As indicated above , the actual temperature depends on the rate and duration of loading . In general , it corresponds closely with the temperature of recrystallization . Above the equi-cohesive temperature the crystalline metal has the greater cohesion ; below the equi-cohesive temperature the cohesion of the amorphous modification is the greater . This conception is believed to be useful and suggestive in interpreting the properties of metals , but it must be remembered that it is qualitative rather than exact . It may be considered that , in general , the relative amount of amorphous metal increases with grain refinement and with cold working . It may also be considered that , in a qualitative way , the greater the amount of the amorphous modification present the more do the properties of a metal tend toward those of a vitreous amorphous material . For example , the property which metals have at high tempera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at least in part ) to the viscous flow of the disorganized metal at the grain boundaries . Since the amount of this disorganized or amorphous metal is greater in a fine-grained metal than in a coarse-grained metal , it would be expected that the fine-grained metal would be softer at high temperatures and harder at low . Tensile Tests of Single Crystals. ? Sykesl has described some very interesting tests of molybdenum wire in which many of the // grains extended completely across the diameter of the wire ( 0.025 in . ) . At 200 ? C. and lower temperatures the path of rupture followed . the grain boundaries . At 300 and up to 900 ? C. , which is approximately the recrystallization temperature of molybdenum , the fracture was decidedly transcrystalline . In this temperature range , the wire drew down to a wedge at the fracture . The reduction of area was practically 100 per cent , but in one direc tion the diameter of the wire was scarcely reduced at all . This means that the deformation has been confined chiefly to two sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is illustrated schematically in Fig. 71 , wherein A represents a test bar of square cross-section , consisting entirely of a single grain of a ductile metal . It is further supposed that this grain has such an orientation that planes of easy slip are perpendicular to the plane of the paper and make angles of about 45 deg. with the axis of the test piece . Now if the piece is subjected to tension , shearing stresses are developed which reach a maximum value at 45 deg. to the tensile load , and hence parallel to the planes of easy slip . As these stresses increase , failure of the crystal will take place in the form of slip , or block movement , along one of these planes , ab , the loca tion of which will generally be determined by some local weakness ( Fig. 71 B ) . // Ductile metals possess the property of automatically limiting the extent of the movement on any particular slip plane . Instead of slip continuing on the first plane until complete rupture of the piece occurs , the movement comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as compared with the dimensions of the test piece . Resistance to movement along the first slip plane increases ; further slip is forced to take place on new planes . Let us suppose that the second slip is on a conjugate plane , cd , making an angle of about 90 deg. with the planes of the first set ( Fig. 71 C ) . It is readily seen how repeated slips of this character result in a general increase in the length of the test bar and a decrease in its diameter . Figure 71 D represents the test bar after rupture . The view on the left shows the same surface of the bar as in the three views above , and illustrates the multiplication of intersecting slip planes , especially near the fracture . The view on the right shows a face of the test bar at 90 deg. to that on the left . It will be noted that there has been no reduction in diameter on this face at the fracture . The test piece has drawn out into the shape of a wedge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported by Carpenter and Elam . ' These investigators worked with flat test specimens 1 by 0.125 in. and with round specimens having diameters of 0.564 and 0.798 in . With each type of specimen they succeeded in converting the entire parallel portion into a single crystal . The bars of circular cross-section , in which a single crystal occupied the entire cross-section , drew out into the form of wedges , as did Sykes ' wires . Because of the much larger size of the aluminum bars , the edge of the wedge was not actually sharp , but retained a well-defined lens shape at the fracture . Reduction in diameter in the other direction was very slight . Flat single-grain test specimens of aluminum assumed forms during deformation and fracture which varied widely with the orientations of the grains , as would be expected . In one type , the specimen became narrower , but retained practically its full thickness , while in a second type the specimen became thin , but retained substantially its original width . All bars were charac170 THE SCIENCE OF METALS terized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement took place , and by a uniformity of direction of slip in any one grain . Mark , Polanyi , and Schmid , ' in Germany , studied the deforma tion of single crystals by means of x-ray crystal analysis . They found change of orientation at slip planes produced during the ordinary tensile test in single crystals of zinc . Conditions for maximum elongation of single crystals of zinc were determined . Zinc crystallizes with a hexagonal space lattice . The plane of easiest slip is the base of the unit hexagonal prism . When this plane makes an angle of approximately 45 deg. with the wire axis , the crystals are very ductile . Single crystal wires broken in tension at room temperature have shown as much as 600 per cent elongation ; broken at 205 ? C. , elongations up to 1,700 per cent have been obtained . Although zinc is not regarded as very ductile , these values for elongation are the highest of any known metal . Unless the plane of easiest slip is at an opportune angle with respect to the wire axis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bismuth were tested at 200 ? C. and showed up to 300 per cent elongation . In this case also the plane of easiest slip must make an angle with the wire axis of about 45 deg. or the crystal will be brittle when broken in tension . During the process of elongation of the zinc single crystals , the round wire changed into a flat ribbon . The width of the ribbon was at first slightly wider than the original diameter of the wire . Slip occurred in a plane about 45 deg. from the wire axis and extended across the whole cross-section of the wire in such a manner that the intersection of each slip plane with the wire surface formed an ellipse . The slight widening of the ribbon was due to the rotation of the elliptical sections . As the elonga tion increased , the general orientation of the crystal changed , so that the angles of the easiest planes of slip became more nearly parallel with the direction of extension . In order that conclusions too sweeping may not be drawn from these phenomenal results on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of zinc and bismuth were less than about 2 mm. in diameter and comparable results might not be expected in large single crystals . Fine tungsten wires composed of single crystals are sometimes ductile at ordinary temperatures , // but larger single crystals have so far proved invariably brittle cold . Support at Grain Boundaries. ? The continuity of the planes of easy slip is broken at grain boundaries . Any movement of blocks or fragments of one grain is opposed by adjacent grains which , because of their different orienta-tions , can not yield easily in the same direction . Disorganized or amorphous metal which is probably present at the grain boundaries acts as an additional source of rigidity ( at low temperatures ) . Above the recrystallization temperature flow takes place at the grain boundaries , so that they are sources of weakness rather than of strength . The mutual supporting action of ad-jacent grains is shown clearly in Sykes ' molybdenum wires ( Fig. 72 ) , where the grain boundaries stand out like joints in a piece of bamboo . It is evident that the supporting action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A shortening of such grains would there-fore be expected to result in an increase in strength , even though they still ex-tended across the entire section of the wire . When the number of grains on the cross-section is also increased , the supporting action becomes still greater . Thus at 300 ? C. , Sykes obtained the following values for tensile strength vs. grain size : This increase in strength ( and hardness ) with decrease in grain size is characteristic of metals below their recrystallization // temperatures . The quantitative relation of strength to grain size varies with the metal involved , the temperature of test , the rate of loading , and the size of the piece , since it is not only a question of absolute grain size but also of the number of grains on the cross section . When the number of grains on the cross-section is fairly large , however ( say 1,000 or more ) , the absolute grain size is the important thing . In the tests reported by Carpenter and Elam , which were carried out at room temperature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent purity was found to vary from 6,270 to 9,180 lb. per square inch . The same material treated to produce an average grain diameter of 0.0667 in. had a tensile strength of 10,440 lb. per square inch , an increase of 66.5 per cent over the lowest and 13.7 per cent over the highest value for the single grains . A most thorough correlation of grain size and Brinell hardness , measured at room temperature , has been worked out for Alpha brass ( 68:32 ) by Bassett and Davis . ' This alloy consists structurally of a single homogeneous solid solution , and is quite comparable to a pure metal . Some typical values obtained in one series were : Observers are sometimes surprised to find that a very apparent difference in the grain size of two specimens is not accompanied by any marked difference in hardness . Referring to the second and third specimens in the table above , it will be seen that an increase in grain diameter of over 50 per cent has decreased the hardness only about 6 per cent . The difference in grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference in hardness would be noticed only by measurements made with rather more than ordinary care . On the other hand , a similar increase in grain size between the last two specimens is // accompanied by a marked difference in hardness . The effect of a given percentage difference in grain size is greater the smaller the grains . Grain Size vs . Hardness at Higher Temperatures. ? When ductile metals are broken " cold " ? that is , below their recry stallization temperatures ? fracture normally takes place through the grains and avoids the grain boundaries . At temperatures just under the melting point , metals are quite weak and fracture is intergranular . There is a range of temperature above that of recrystallization in which either transcrystalline or intergranular fracture may be produced at will by varying the rate of loading and duration of load . Slow loading and prolonged application of load favor intergranular fracture at low unit stress . Under these conditions the grain boundaries are sources of weakness rather than of strength . Accordingly , at high temperatures the relation between strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harder . There must then be an intermediate temperature at which strength and hardness are little affected by grain size . This is the " equi-cohesive temperature . " The following account of some experiments is taken from a paper by one of the authors:l Tests have been made on iron , tungsten , platinum , gold and silver . Small wires of these metals were drawn to a diameter of 7 to 8 mils in such a manner that the structures were fibrous ? that is to say , a con siderable amount of working on these metals was performed at temper atures below their annealing temperatures . Some pieces of each of the wires were heated by the passage of electric current , the temper ature and time conditions being maintained in such a manner as to cause recrystallization and to produce one set of each of the metals composed of small equiaxed grains and another set composed of large equiaxed grains . The fine-grained and coarse-grained samples of the same material were compared with respect to the resistance to bending at various temperatures . Small hairpins were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pair of silver wires as an example . The arms of each hairpin were 2 in. long and the distance between the two ends was ; i in . A clamp consisting of two steel bars was used to hold the hairpins . Two hairpins , one of fine-grained and the other of coarse-grained silver wire , were put in the clamp a short distance apart . It was found that a rider weighing 0.2 gram suspended on the ends of the hairpins would not cause a permanent deformation in either the fine-grained or coarse-grained samples at room temperature , but would // cause permanent deformation of the wires at slightly higher temper-atures . The steel clamp holding the two silver hairpins in a horizontal position was inserted in a muffle furnace and the temperature was gradually raised . At temperatures lower than 250 to 275 ? C. the finegrained silver wire was the stronger ? that is , it would hold the given weight with less deformation or bending than would the coarse-grained silver wire . Above 275 ? , however , the fine-grained silver wire had been deformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The conclusion is that the fine-grained and coarse-grained silver had the same resistance to deformation at 250 to 275 ? C. , that at temperatures less than this the fine-grained silver has the greater resistance to deformation , while at higher temperatures the coarse-grained silver has the greater resistance to deformation . These tests were performed with the other metals named and the results are given in Table VII . The iron and tungsten wires were heated with electric current in an atmosphere of hydrogen in order to prevent oxidation . The temperatures were measured with an optical pyrometer . The gold and platinum wires were heated in a muffle , the same as the silver , and the temperatures were measured with a thermocouple . The wires used for the hairpin tests were examined microscopically to make certain that the heat treatment had produced the desired grain size . The fine-grained wires were made by heating the cold-worked wires quickly to a temperature considerably above that of recrystallization and the coarse-grained samples were produced by heating slowly through the recrystallization range followed by heating to a temperature near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current through the wires . It will be noted that the equi-cohesive temperatures found for these metals correspond closely with their respective temperatures of recrystallization . This relation is a general one , having been found to hold for all metals investigated . Some experiMECHANICAL // ments on zinc , lead and tin , which recrystallize at or below room temperature , are interesting . Quoting again from the paper mentioned above : Some pure zinc , lead , tin and aluminum were cast in such a manner as to produce coarse-grained structures . One piece of each of the castings was tested for Brinell hardness as cast and one piece of each was cold-hammered , after which the Brinell hardness was determined . The cold-hammering of the zinc was continued until cracks began to form at the edges of the piece . In testing for hardness , 500 kg. pressure was used with the zinc and aluminum , 200 kg. with the tin , and 100 kg. with the lead . It was noticed with all of the samples with the exception of the aluminum , that when the load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balancing mechanism of the Brinell machine would very quickly fall . When the pressure was again brought up to that required , say for the zinc 500 kg. , the beam would again drop . This means that the pieces of lead , zinc and tin were gradually deforming under constant load . The pressure was maintained at the required amount until the beam at a constant position of the specimen table would remain in a substantially constant position . With both cast and cold-hammered aluminum , the beam remained in a substantially constant position after the load was first brought to the required amount . A very slight lowering was noticed , but the effect of increasing the time of exposure of a given load was practically nil on the resulting hardness . This slow deformation was the most marked in the tin . It was more pronounced in the cold-hammered samples than in the cast samples and the maximum effect was found in the cold-hammered tin . When the hardness tests were carried on in such a manner that there was substantially no further deformation in the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold-hammered aluminum was harder than the cast aluminum , whereas the cold-hammered lead , tin and zinc were all softer than the same metals in the cast state . To obtain an idea of the rate of deformation of the pieces of lead , tin and zinc , the diameter of the impression of the ball of the Brinell hardness machine was measured on each of the samples after the load had first registered the required amount . For example , the tests on zinc were made as follows : The piece of cast zinc was put in the Brinell machine and the pressure raised quickly to 500 kg . Then the piece of cold-hammered zinc was inserted in the machine and the pressure raised to 500 kg. , the rate of application of the load being the same in both cases . The hardness numbers were then calculated . It was found that the hardness of the cold-lianunercd pieces of aluminum , zinc , lead and tin was greater // when determined in the above manner than that of the same metals in the cast state . The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is known that the equiaxing temperature of zinc after severe cold-work is not far below room temperature , and the hardness results would indicate that the equi-cohesive temperature of zinc would be only slightly below room temperature . The equiaxing temperatures of severely cold-worked lead and tin are considerably below room temperature , and the hardness results given in Table VIII would indicate that their equi-cohesive temperatures would also be considerably below room temperature . The equiaxing temperature of severely coldworked aluminum is about 200 ? C. with 1 hour 's exposure at that temperature . The hardness results in Table VIII show that the equicohesive temperature of aluminum must be considerably above room temperature . The lead and tin referred to as " cold-hammered " were found by microscopic examination to be fully recrystallized , and therefore representative of normal fine-grained metal as distinguished from the coarse-grained cast specimens . It may be added that the duration of " sustained " load in the tests reported in Table VIII was about 15 min. for the aluminum and about 1 hr. for each of the other metals , while " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec . These results bring out in a striking way the fact that the equi-cohesive temperature , as well as the recrystallization tempm ? at , 111 , is dependent on the time factor . The temperatures // at which the Brinell hardness is independent of the grain size are , for lead and tin , above room temperature for rapid loading but below room temperature for slow or prolonged loading . The equi-cohesive temperature of copper has been found to lie above 950 ? C. for rates of loading producing rupture in about 3 sec. , whereas for very slow loading it is in the neighborhood of 300 ? C. In general , the equi-cohesive temperature is higher the more rapid the application and the shorter the duration of load . Grain Size vs . Elongation. ? The elongation found on singlecrystal test bars of aluminum by Carpenter and Elam ran up to 87 per cent , as compared with about 37 per cent on bars with an average grain diameter of 0.0067 in . When there were two or three crystals on the cross-section , the elongation was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fine-grained bars . In Sykes ' tests on molybdenum wires , on the other hand , the elongation was less on the wires composed largely of single crystals than on other wires of smaller grain size . These results are not contradictory , as the conditions of test were different . The gage length of the molybdenum wires was 80 times the diameter , and the elongation measured was the general elongation . Furthermore , the gage length included several grain boundaries , at which , as was seen in Fig. 72 , the deformation was relatively slight . Carpenter and Elam used test bars in which the ratio of gage length to cross-section was relatively small , so the measured elongation was greatly increased by the high reduction of area , and the gage length consisted entirely of a single crystal . If the elongation on the molybdenum wires had been measured over the single crystal in which the break occurred , the per cent elongation would have been much higher . Unfortunately , no tests have been made on single crystals having a sufficiently great ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be measured , unaffected by the local stretch . In general , the grain size conducive to maximum elongation is neither extremely fine nor extremely coarse . The actual grain size which will give the highest elongation for any particular metal depends on the size and shape of test piece , the temperature of test , and rate of loading . Curves given in Fig. 68 show how the relation between grain size and elongation in molybdenum depends on the temperature . The fine-grained wire , which had the greatest elongation at temperatures below 200 ? C. , had the least elongation at 900 ? C. // The effect of grain size and diameter of test specimen on the elongation and reduction of area of Armco iron is shown in Table IX . Lower elongation in small wire and thin sheet or strip is a general observation in metals . But , as shown in Table IX , a small grain size seems conducive to high elongation in small wire or thin strip . Brittleness. ? Brittleness in metals may be due either to brittleness of the grain boundaries or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks in a brittle manner at temperatures below 200 ? C. , the fracture taking place almost entirely at the grain boundaries . Individual crystals of tungsten appear to be somewhat plastic . The low-temperature brittleness is therefore due to brittleness at the grain boundaries , a condition which is consistent with the view that the grain boundary metal is // amorphous and that the amorphous metal increases in hardness and brittleness , as the temperature is lowered , more rapidly than does the crystalline . Coarse-grained zinc is but slightly ductile at room temperature , whereas fine-grained zinc may have an elongation as high as 90 per cent . In the coarse-grained zinc , the fracture takes place largely through the grains . Both finegrained and coarse-grained zinc are brittle in liquid air , the fracture again taking place chiefly through the grains . Brittleness in this case is therefore due to lack of plasticity in the crystalline grains themselves . In either case small grain size favors the retention of ductility at low temperatures . Reduction of Area. ? The first yielding of a tensile test bar of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stress intensity at this point is then higher than in the rest of the bar , which has not yet yielded . If it were not for the work-hardening effect of this slight local deformation , the reduced section would not be able to sustain a load sufficient to deform the remainder of the bar , so the section would continue to reduce , and rupture would finally occur at this point , without any general extension of the bar as a whole . A certain minimum rate of work hardening is necessary for general extension to take place . Suppose the first local yielding reduces the cross-section of the bar by 1 per cent . Then , unless the yield point of the metal is raised slightly more than 1 per cent by this deformation , the reduced section will not be able to sustain even the load which originally caused it to yield , and which was insufficient to cause yielding in the remainder of the bar . If the yield point is raised more than 1 per cent , then an increase in load will cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . This process results in general extension , or general elongation . Usually a stage is reached at which the rate of hardening is not sufficient to shift automatically the location of the yielding . The bar then necks down and breaks . As long as general extension is taking place , the load on the bar must be increasing . When necking begins , the load can no longer increase . It may remain fairly constant for a while and must then decrease . The load per unit area of the reduced section , however , may continue to increase . The total reduction of area at fracture is thus made up of two parts : ( 1 ) A reduction corresponding to the general extension
