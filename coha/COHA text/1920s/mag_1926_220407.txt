The franc slumped to 37 to the dollar . The cost of living was announced as having risen 10% in France within two months . Finance Minister Pret , disheartened at his failure to peg the franc , resigned . Deputies of the Right , theoretically foes of Briand , paradoxically continued to support his Left Cabinet lest the franc collapse . Deputies of the Left , angered at M. Briand 's disregard of their views , deserted him . Though M. Briand could and did obtain a vote of confidence by a majority of 114 , the situation had become a hopeless tangle . Stabilization of the franc could not be accomplished with the freak support of a Chamber " majority of enemies . " <P> An emergency solution lay in the formation of a " Sacred Union Cabinet* in which outstanding members of opposed parties should bury their differences to save the franc . M. Briand took a bold step , resigned , though still supported by a majority in the Chamber , promptly set about to build a Sacred Union Cabinet at the pre-arranged request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Raymond Poincar was heard . His incorruptibility is a byword . His energy and ability have enabled him to become a much sought lawyer , a self-made man of wealth , a statesman of primatical fame . He has been twice Premier ( 1911-13 ; 1922-24 ) and throughout the War and peace negotiations was President of France ( 1913-20 ) . It was felt last week that if M. Poincar would consent to assume the portfolio of finance , solidarity would be given at least to the fiscal policy of France . M. Poincar ( Right : ultra-anti-German ) signified his willingness to serve under M. Briand ( Left : conciliator of Germany ) . <P> With the prestige of Poincar assuring support from the Right , M. Briand turned to his confrere and rival of the Left , M. Edouard Herriot , for 21 years Mayor of Lyons , President of the Chamber of Deputies , leader of the Coalition of Left Parties , ousted from the Premiership ( TIME , April 13 , 20 , 1925 ) when it was rumored that he had connived at juggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the franc . <P> M. Herriot , most potent of French party-coalition leaders but widely discounted as a statesman , had it in his power : 1 ) To lend impregnable strength of a Poincar-Briand-Herriot government ; 2 ) To frustrate completely M. Briand 's efforts by holding himself and his cohorts aloof . <P> M. Herriot declared his unwillingness to serve beneath his confrere . M. Briand saw open before him the prospect of continuing indefinitely his struggles of many months to juggle a majority out of fluid and irresponsible Chamber blocs . In effect Aristide Briand threw up his hands , cried : " I am through ! Let Herriot see what he can do . . . . " <P> President Doumergue called upon M. Herriot to form a Cabinet . Forty-eight hours later the Mayor of Lyons was obliged to confess that strife within his own Left Coalition made it impossible for him to form a Cabinet . M. Briand the tale is told , had secretly hamstrung the Herriot Coalition from within .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
