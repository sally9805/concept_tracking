" I wish I were with you , baby , because I love you . God bless you . Dolores . " " Darling , you must get well because of my love for you . Dolores . " " I love you . Dolores . " <P> Published almost instantly in the papers of two continents , these and other messages from Dolores Del Rio , screen star , in Hollywood , to her divorced husband , Jaime , ill in Berlin , did not particularly impress a U. S. public accustomed to accept the quasi-private quarrels and love-making of picture people with the same scepticism usually roused by their screen depictions of the same kind of thing . <P> Few , therefore , took seriously the press accounts of the final , frantic cablegram to the German sanitorium which was not read by Jaime Del Rio since just before it came he had died of bloodpoisoning ; or the story about the way Mrs. Del Rio 's mother told her the news . <P> " It 's all over . " <P> " You mean-the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> " Mrs. Del Rio sought comfort by burying her dark head in her mother 's bosom . Her entire body was racked with sobs , " said a despatch which made cinema fans chuckle . <P> Friends of the Del Rios were less amused . The emotion , they knew , was real . They recalled how Del Rio , owner of 20 ranches in Mexico , learned to write scenarios so as to have a professional reason for being with his wife in Hollywood , how he was known there as " Mr. Dolores Del Rio , " and how , after a period of faithfulness regarded as unconventional by their colleagues , the Del Rios began to live apart , each denying estrangement . " Our careers have forced us apart . " <P> They were divorced in Mexico last June . <P> Three months ago in Paris Miss Del Rio asked her husband if she could come and see him ; after that they wrote to each other , the actress finally- " Keep up your courage , darling . I do n't forget you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I love you . " -a message ( it was the one the sick man did not live to read ) suggesting once more the odd fact that all emotions of a certain sort , whether real or assumed , can be expressed only in the language of subtitles .
