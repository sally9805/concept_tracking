" Both boys died in the Ann May Hospital here last night . Swathed ' in vaseline gauze and under the influence of a hypodermic , the boys , before their deaths a few minutes apart , refused to tell just what happened . Dick Forman , 16 years old , and Taylor Hubbard , 18. who , ' according to the police , are responsible for building the fire which caused the deaths of the younger lads , are under arrest in Belmar . The police at an early hour this morning were still questioning them . The hospital authorities got the impression from young Spindler and Hubbard that the older boys " had it in " for them . But the youngsters bravely laughed at any leading question and refused to the last to blame Forman or Taylor Hubbard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were going to have some fun with us and took us out and tied us to a tree , " the Hubbard boy said when dying .

The screams of the " victims " grew louder , but neither Forman nor the elder Hubbard could plunge through the ' dense smoke . So they ran to a brook and attempted to get water . But they had no pall or other contrivance in which to carry it . They did not know what to do . Meanwhile the flames leaped up , engulfing the two and burning the clothing from Spinglsr and Hubbard . Both soon were unconscious , burned from head to foot . Both wore caps , so that their hair was not touched , but the caps were nearly burned away . Then the ropes which held the boys to the tree broke and both fell to the blackened ground . Grass near them stilt was burning when the other two boys returned empty handed .
