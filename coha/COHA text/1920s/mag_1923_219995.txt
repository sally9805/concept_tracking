Pan American Conference <P> World Opinion . The eyes of the world are upon the fifth Pan American Conference now in session at Santiago de Chile . Secretary of State Hughes , in a message to the Conference , made a plea for a better understanding between nations , the removal of suspicion , distrust and hatred . Every chancellery in Europe it watching the deliberations at the Chilean capital with the keenest interest , with curiosity , with envy , with hatred . Opinion is graduated : there are expressions of genuine goodwill ; of mathematical what-will-it-all-come-to . Some see in the Conference the rich New World pitting itself against the war-ruined Old World ; others view an American League of Nations in direct opposition to the " European " League-and they are angry . They point to the " egoistic isolation " of the United States and say : " The power of the United States is great enough to prevent the Conference from doing anything which goes against their imperialistic interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine . " Canada . John Barrett , former Director General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada 's entrance into the Union has more popular appeal than any other point of the program . The entrance of Canada will make the Union actually Pan American and not " semi-American . " Uruguay . It was officially announced that the Uruguayan delegation will not move the formation of an American League of Nations , as was originally intended . The change of Uruguay 's attitude is said to be due to an informal communication to that country that the United States and a majority of the delegations were opposed to considering such a plan at the present Conference . U. S. Delegation . The American delegation headed by Henry P. Fletcher arrived at Valparaiso last Sunday morning , and left in the afternoon for Santiago .
