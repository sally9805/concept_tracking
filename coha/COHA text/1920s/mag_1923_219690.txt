Rumors persist that Ambassador Harvey will shortly resign his post as American Ambassador to the Court of St. James . Nothing definite is known , except that the report seems to rely for its authenticity upon a statement made by an American Embassy official that Mr. Harvey wished to stay in America at the time of the Baldwin debt negotiations ; and the Ambassador 's preamble to his now famous Pilgrim speech in London , when he said : " I am utterly destitute of the traditional weapons of diplomacy .
