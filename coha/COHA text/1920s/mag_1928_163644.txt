( See front cover ) <P> One man of Sam Houston 's 700 Texan patriots could play a tune on a fife ; one could beat a drum . They pooled their resources and sounded like a regimental band as Houston fell upon the Mexican Santa Anna on the bank of the San Jacinto . Texan vengeance for the massacre of the Alamo was satisfied ; Texan independence was guaranteed ; Sam Houston returned to lay out the city which bears his name , to become President of Texas , U. S. Senator when Texas entered the Union . It was an important battle hymn the fifer played over and over again at San Jacinto . Its lyric : <P> " Oh , come to the bower , my love , my love ; <P> " Oh , come to the bower I 've builded for you . " <P> The song was heard , last week , issuing from the capacious lungs of Jesse Holman Jones , 100 per cent Houstonian , who had dazzled the eyes of the Democratic Party to which he promised wealth unaccustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,089 delegates , together with their alternatives , wives and bosses , should convene at Houston to nominate a candidate for the President of the United States . Capitalist Jones had built the bower . He was ready for his love . <P> Bower . Houston ( pronounced Hews-ton ) has waxed prosperous since the U. S. dredged the Buffalo Bayou and brought the Gulf of Mexico 50 miles northward to the city ( TIME , Jan. 23 ) ; it has not succeeded in changing torrid June weather . Therefore , as the vast auditorium , seating 25,000 , rose on the ruins of what had been Houston offices and stores , thoughtful citizens planned how to beguile northern Democrats into thinking the Houston climate ideal . They planned : a suggestion to all delegates that Houston fashions will demand linen suits ; automatic water coolers as effective as nine melting tons of ice each day ( 15 Ibs. per delegate per day ) ; a heat-resisting roof ; eight large fans delivering hourly 36,000,000 cubic feet of air into the hall . <P> Bowers . Comfortably cool in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oratory . Traditionally , the party 's sessions have been marked by eloquent appeals to the memory of Thomas Jefferson , Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson . This year the keynote speech of Claude Gernade Bowers , historian and editorial writer for the New York Evening World , was awaited with more than usual interest . Keynoter Bowers had won great and sudden fame at a Jackson Day dinner ( TIME , Jan. 23 ) , by a brilliant attack upon the Harding " gang . " In an era when oratory rarely moves , he stirred righteous indignation in the bosoms of embattled Democrats . He was expected to eschew political pap , offer a program of progress .
