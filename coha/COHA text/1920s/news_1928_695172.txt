txt It 's a groat temptation to start an article on baby talk by writing a dozen lines of the affectionate gibberish that goes under that name , just to show how far it is from real language . But I will desist - because I do n't know of anything that looks more utterly ridicutous in print  --  and I bate to think of all the really nice , otherwise sensible and intelligent mothers whose one slip is baby talk , who might be made to squirm by seeing themselves in cold ' type . ? 4-. - I ant not for a system of rearing which precludes a show of affection or the use of endearing terms  --  but I must say I think talking baby talk to the baby is a. little hard on him ? or her . Of course we know it is instigated by an overwhelming sense of his littleness and lovableness . The strongest women will succumb to it when confronted with their own or other people's.babies . But talking baby talk to him is taking an unfair advantage of the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears your speech more than any one else 's  --  and it 's too bad when his first idea of certain words is a garble . For some subtle reason that we are not sure of , it is more difficult for some children to learn to talk than it is for others . One baby in our family did n't talk until she was 3 years old ? but when she did she jumped into full speech . Some children talk fluently and early but ca n't pronounce certain words  --  others have trouble with other words . There are the babies who say vewy for very , and ith for is , and there are those who talk a fascinating language unintelligible to every one but their parents . Why make it harder for them than we have to by giving them a wrong start by talking baby talk of our own invention , or by speaking back to them the , to us , endearing baby lingo that represents their best effort at the time ? It is taking in . unfair advantage of them .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
