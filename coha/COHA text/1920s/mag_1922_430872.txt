To-day , when perfume is regarded as purely a feminine accessory ? in Anglo-Saxon countries , at least ? it is surprising to learn that the Emperor Napoleon bathed his head and shoulders in eau de cologne , by way of preparation for the rigors of campaigning . His imperial consort , Josephine , was even more fond of scent than her warlike husband ; she used musk , the most penetrating odor known to perfumers . The story is told that the walls of her apartments at Malmaison Palace , in the suburbs of Paris , were so impregnated with her favorite scent that repeated washings and paintings failed to eliminate it entirely . Napoleon 's toilette occasioned little surprise in his day ; it was simple compared with that of some other kings . The Roman rulers , for instance , were prodigal in their perfuming , and drew heavily upon the Oriental countries under their domination for exotic scents . More perfume was consumed at the funeral of Emperor Nero 's wife , Poppaea , than was sent from Arabia in a year . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerts a powerful influence upon his nervous system , and with the first craving for luxury has turned instinctively to perfume . Men have a keener sense of smell than women . This may explain , in part , why to-day men do not like the stronger perfumes preferred by most women . But modern science has a more complex explanation , one that goes back to the savage days when men literally pursued and captured their wives . Whatever the explanation , women have always perfumed themselves , and centuries before the Christian era even the barbarous Scythian women were making a paste of bruised cypress , cedar , and incense-tree wood , which they coated themselves with one day and removed the next , leaving the body clean , and fragrant . The earliest perfumes were the dry , resinous gums of fragrant trees ? myrrh , frankincense , spikenard , galbanum . These were generally used as incense ; the very word " perfume " comes from per ( meaning " by " or " through " ) and fumare ( meaning to smoke ) . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient manner , by sitting near , or actually in , the smoke of a pan or slow fire of burning aromatic spices . Two thousand years before Christ the ancestors of these women were carrying on  | a brisk trade in perfumes with Egypt , then the mistress of the world . The Old Testament , in the story of Joseph and his brethren , relates that Joseph had been cast into a well , when there appeared " a company of Ishmaelites from Gilead , bearing spicery , balm , and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt . " In Exodus two recipes for a " holy anointing oil , " rich in perfume , were given to Moses . " A very great train , with camels that bore spices , and very much gold and precious stones , " accompanied the Queen of Sheba on her visit to Solomon , and her subjects , who furnished much of the ancient perfume , invented whopping stories to frighten off prospective competitors . Cinnamon , they said , was gathered from the nest of the dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird ; it was also found in marshes guarded by mys terious winged snakes . By the time Greece had assumed control of the known world , flower fragrances had been added to men 's store of perfumes . The iris , rose , crocus , and violet became popular . The Greeks also drew on the aromatic plants . Thyme and marjoram were favorites . The Greek exquisite used one scent for his hair ointment and another for his robes . With Roman conquest came a greater knowledge of perfumery , and under the Empire the far places of the earth were ransacked to give the luxurious Roman new and exciting perfumes . The nobles had a different scent for the different parts of the body : mint for the arms , palm oil for the jaws and heart , marjoram for the eyebrows and hair , ground ivy es- sence for the knees and neck . A guild of perfumers the " Unguentarii " ? arose , and a whole street in Capua , one of the most important seaports , was given over to them . Caligula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nero spent four million sesterces ( about $200,000 ) on roses for one festival . Shakespeare has Cleopatra sailing down the River Cydnus to meet Mark Antony in a barge with sails " so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them . " The Dark Ages of history were the dark ages of perfume . Rome went down beneath barbaric hordes that overwhelmed western Europe , and the pampered Roman noble , rosy and glistening from the bath , fragrant with a dozen perfumes , gave way to the shaggy medieval warrior , who bathed but accidentally , reeked of camp and chase , and would have been vastly improved by the use of one . Scented tapers and incense were used in churches . It seems certain that the women of that time found some way of perfuming themselves ; but , as with the other arts , perfuming flourished only among the Orientals . An Arab physician , Avivenna , discovered how to distill fragrant water from leaves . Fragrance and happiness became closely associated in the Mohammedan mind . The Koran promised the faithful a paradise peopled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musk . " The Crusades brought perfume back to Europe . Thousands of knights returned from the Holy Land with rare Eastern gifts for their ladies , among them perfumes . European apothecaries became familiar with these basic substances . But , like science , in those days of ignorance and persecution  | experiments had to be made in secret ; a discoverer stood in danger of being burned as a witch . Still paralleling general history in its course , perfuming had its real rebirth in Italy in the days of the Renaissance . When fourteen-year-old Catherine de Medici went to France to marry the Duke of Orleans , afterward Henry II , a Florentine perfumer , named Rene , was in her train . He established a shop in Paris , the pioneer in what has grown to be a huge industry . For years Italy led in perfuming ; it supplied the rest of Europe with sweet bags , perfume cakes for throwing on fires , fragrant candles and cosmetics , scented gloves and pomanders . The kings of France , however , drew the Italian masters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started on its way to supremacy . Single scents no longer sufficed ; perfumes were blended to produce true bouquets . The chemist came to the aid of the perfumer and uncovered new sources of fragrance . Flower farms were established in regions of favorable climate , principally in a strip of Mediterranean coastline , from Marseilles to Genoa , and in the southern part of France , in the neighborhood of Grasse , Cannes , Nice , and Monaco . The coastal region is free from frost and favorable to the growth of southern plants , while the country adjoining the Maritime Alps grows plants of other fragrancies . Before describing the making of modern perfume , it is necessary to tell why its essential substances affect human beings as they do . The nerves governing the sense of smell are not situated in the nasal passages , but in an area of sensitive membrane , about the size of a dime , high over each nostril . A part of the hair-like tips of the olfactory nerves terminating in this membrane receives the sense impression and conducts it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine , smells are pigeonholed in the brain as visual impressions .  | Each smell carries associations good or bad , and these associated images are brought forth by the brain when particular nerves are excited . Degenerate as the olfactory nerve sense in man has become through evolution , it still retains the marvelous ability to detect one part of camphor in four hundred thousand parts of air , and one part vanillin in ten million parts of air . Few realize that the lure of affinity , the temporary suspension of reason we call being " in love , " and even friendly sympathy , are intimately connected with odor ; yet man has inherited from remote and uncultured ancestors olfactory memories of experiences that react on him in much the same manner as what we call instinct in animals . It is because of these primitive experiences , and especially their connection with particular odors , that we instinctively like or dislike individuals until reason modifies our first impression . Were we familiar with the early history of mankind , we should be shocked probably to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sense of smell , which still occupies so largely the mental processes of the lower animals . It should not be surprising , then , to learn that what thrills one when enjoying a subtle bouquet , presumably manufactured by a clever perfumer , is really the artistically masked odor of materials derived from , or synthetically made to resemble , substances whose origin lies in the origin of sex , and is too delicate a subject for general discussion . But such is the case , and these substances ? musk , ambergris , civet , and castor ? are most important to perfumers . With them he " fixes " the floral odors . Unmixed , these substances are not pleasant to smell . The most important of them is musk , which comes from the musk deer of Siberia , Tibet , and China . It is worth more than its weight in gold , and is so strong and constant in odor that it can not be shipped in the same cargo with tea . Ambergris , still more val- uable , is perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamen whose fortunes have been made by the discovery of a floating gray mass , which turned out to be ambergris , are common . It is a secretion of the sperm whale , and is usually found in very small pieces in the warm seas . Civet is from the Oriental civet cat , castor from the beaver . A kind of musk is also obtained from the Canadian muskrat . The most interesting process of the perfumer 's art is the extraction of the delicate flower fragrances . At Grasse , a huddled hillside village , two score parfumeries concentrate the scent of countless flowers . The flower farms are in the near-by villages . From December until March the parfumeries work on patchouli , an East Indian herb , sandalwood , rosewood , and other nonfloral raw materials . In March , work begins on the fresh flowers : first the Parma violet ; then the jonquil , orange blossom , rose , jasmine , mignonette , tuberose , and cassia buds . In less quantities , heliotrope , myrtle , carnation , rose geranium , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour when their scent is strongest . The rose is gathered as soon as opened ; the carnation after three hours ' exposure ' to the sun ; jasmine immediately after sunrise . The late Czarina of Russia preferred her toilet water made of violets  | picked near Grasse at twilight . In one parfumerie alone , in one year , the following flowers were used : 2,400 tons of roses , 1,750 tons of orange blossoms , 132 tons of violets , 280 tons of jasmine , 70 tons of tuberoses , 15 tons of jonquils . These amounts are not-so impressive when one realizes that 11 tons of roses ? about 3,000,000 blossoms ? are required to make one pound of attar of roses . Wild thyme and lavender lose their fragrance if transported , so the stills are set up in the fields where they grow . Most flowers , however , will not yield their fragrance to the distiller , so other methods of extracting their odor have been developed : maceration and inflowering . Housewives who are familiar with butter 's tendency to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes , for they are based upon the odor-absorbing property of fat . In maceration , the fragrant parts of the flowers are slowly mixed in huge vats of melted beef or pork fat . When exhausted of odor , the flowers are drained off , and fresh ones added to the mixtures . This is kept up until the fat attains the proper strength . In inflowering , plates of fat-coated glass are covered with petals and placed in air-tight compartments . The flowers are renewed twice a day . This continues , sometimes for months , until the pomade , as the fat is now called , has reached the desired strength . The pomade is melted from the glass with warm water , and treated with alcohol . It is then ready for the perfumer . Some perfume oils , such as bergamot , orange , and lemon , are expressed in hydraulic or screw presses . Flowers for perfume come from every country and ever clime ; attar of roses from Bulgaria and Turkey ; rose-geranium oils from Algeria ; lavender and peppermint from England ; citrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Orient . Extensive experiments in growing scent-giving flowers are being made in California .  | To-day the chemist is able to analyze the odor-giving elements in flowers and reproduce them artificially . Many of the essences used in the making of soaps and cosmetics now come from the laboratory . The quality of these artificial essences has been so improved that high-grade perfumers also use them . But the best perfume will always be compounded from natural materials , for , while the chemist is able to detect and combine artificially odorgiving elements in flowers , he is unable to supply the slight impurities which complete nature 's formula . It is neither practicable nor possible to imitate nature 's laboratory methods . The highest art of the perfumer is exercised in the blending of essential odors to produce a perfume more pleasing than the natural unblended scents . Experience is his only guide . It is impossible to tell beforehand , from the nature of the essences that go into a perfume , what the odor of a blend will be . Septimus Piesse , an English authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odors as among sound , and he arranged them as in music , the sharp smells as the high notes , the heavier ones as the low . He held that in blending odors the same harmony should prevail as in music ; that a false odor would have the same effect as a false note in a musical chord . His scale of smells he called the odophone . Much is written on the subject of perfume and " personality , " and in the larger cities there are specialists that undertake to fit their clients with fragrance as a costumer fits them with clothes . In this , age , type , complexion , and other characteristics are the determining factors . But nature seldom makes mistakes , and most perfumers agree that women had best rely upon instinct to guide them in their choice ; it serves the woman of today , with a thousand scents to choose from , as unerringly as it served the woman of Egypt , who had but few .  |             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
