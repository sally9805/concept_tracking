There opened in Washington a women 's conference-an event not unusual . But it happened that it was a " peace " conference and yet none of the many women 's peace organizations was represented . The meeting was called the " Women 's Conference on the Cause and Cure of War " -a misleading title since " cause " and " cure " were not equal objects . <P> Nine national women 's organizations were each represented by 100 delegates and 100 alternates . They were : <P> The American Association of University Women . <P> The Federation of Women 's Boards of Foreign Missions in North America . <P> The General Federation of Women 's Clubs . <P> The Council of Women for Home Missions . <P> The National Board of Young Women 's Christian Associations . <P> The National Council of Jewish Women . <P> The National League of Women Voters . <P> The National Christian Temperance Union . <P> The National Women 's Trade Union League of America . <P> Care was exercised in excluding professional peace societies and organizations of " pink " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal " women to undertake a common-sense study of the problem of preventing war , with a view of arriving at some common plank on which all could stand , which the delegates could take back to 5,000,000 women whom they represented to start a great wave of public opinion against war . <P> The chairman of the conference was the renowned Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt , Honorary President of the National League of Women Voters , and leader of many women 's movements .
