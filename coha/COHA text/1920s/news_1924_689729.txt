txt Sixth Avenue Subway . The plan for a new subway to replace the present Sixth Avenue elevated will doubtless have the support of all good citizens of New York and will also have the approval of those countless thousands in all parts of the civilized world who are privileged to visit New York occasionally . It is proposed to meet the entire cost of ! this undertaking by an assessment on Sixth Avenue property along the route of the new Subway . The writer has no financial interest in Sixth Avenue property , but , from the viewpoint of an outsider , it would appear that title method of financing is not entirely fair to Sixth Avenue property owners . The transformation of Sixth Avenue will benefit the entire city . Increased property valuation will bring increased tax returns into the City Treasury . I would suggest the following as an alternative method for financing the new subway : Let the Sixth Avenue property owners pay one-half the total cost in the form of assessments over a period of years , the other half to be distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of an additional tax , payable in small yearly instalments .
