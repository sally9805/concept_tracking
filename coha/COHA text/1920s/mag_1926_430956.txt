 | DEAR NATALIA I shall always think of the sea trip from Colombo to Alexandria as one of the pleasantest I have ever taken . Every one who heard that I was to make it so late in the season sought to impress me beforehand with a sense of the discomforts I s ould endure , and the dangers I should run : the monsoon would blow all the way across the Indian ocean , I was told , and I should be flung from one side of my stateroom to the other if I tried to get out of my berth , so great would be its violence ; while the heat going through the Red Sea would not only prostrate me , but probably make me ill . I wonder why it is that no pleasant predictions are ever offered to travelers . For these , like most others I have heard , proved to be entirely without foundation . As I wrote Daisy last month , we left Colombo in the glow of a sunset under a crescent moon , sailed for days over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk past islands fringed with twinkling lights and in the white glare of noonday past the gleaming , precipitous coast of Italian Somaliland . Then , having entered the Red Sea , we found a fresh breeze ruffling the mirrored surface of its waters and blowing across the rosy cliffs of Arabia ? a breeze so cool that we shortened our afternoon swim and unearthed our almost forgotten coats to wrap around us as we watched the afterglow . Sinai was veiled in mist as we went by it , but I shared none of the disappointment of my fellow-passengers at seeing it that way ? for was it not so veiled when Moses spent his wondrous vigil there , with a " thick cloud upon the mount " ? And when we came to the place from which , in the distance , we could catch a glimpse of " Elim , where there were twelve wells of water and three-score and ten @#  | palm trees , " I wished that we might disembark and " encamp there by the waters , " as did those weary travelers centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to me . It appears to be an unwritten law that steamships should arrive in ports at ungodly hours in the morning ; and that the unfortunate passengers , roused from uncompleted slumbers , and consequently either somnolent or snappy , according to temperament , but all more or less disheveled , should be ranged against the inspection of the quarantine officers . Suez proved no exception to this rule ; at five clock a merciless gong summoned us to " pass the doctors , " and having done this , all of us , whether we were leaving the ship or not , were obliged to have our passports examined and stamped . 111y righteous indignation at all this , though great , was not sufficient to keep me from going back to bed and from sleeping again ; and two hours later I was roused again ? this time by Henry , with the information that we were entering the canal , and that I had better come on deck at once . Once there , I did not leave it all day , not even at meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dinner on the veranda ; and I shall be everlastingly thankful that I did not suffer myself to be persuaded to disembark at Suez for Cairo ? not only because all my friends who urged me to join them in doing so missed their train and , trying to make the trip by automobile , got stuck in the desert ; but because , in its own way , the Suez Canal is no less beautiful than the Panama Canal . This is a different way , of course , and the comparison between them is especially interesting . At Panama there are the great locks and sufficient breadth throughout for two huge ships to go @#  | abreast ; Suez is a sea-level canal . and at some places so narrow that one vessel churns up the sand on either bank on passing , and terrible tales are told of being tied up , often for hours , if another has the right of way . At Panama there are verdure , humidity , fertility , the loveliness of misty grays and greens , the depths of tropical jungles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are tawny sands , dryness , barrenness , the loveliness of clear , hard blues and yellows , the limitless expanse of the desert undulating on and on and on . Here and there , near the shore , are a tiny clump of palms , a cluster of mud cottages , camels " hobbled " and at rest , donkeys nosing among the scrubby cactus plants , draped figures coming and going . Farther off , caravans of other camels laden for a journey , led by other draped figures in slow and solemn processional , moving monotonously . Evening came , and on one side of us hung the round golden sun , on the other the round silver moon , equidistant from the horizon , equally effulgent and huge . Then the sun melted mysteriously away in a rosy vapor , the moon rose higher and higher , and we saw the lights of Port Said glittering in the distance . We lay at anchor that night without an opportunity of further testing the veracity of the person who had talked to me about monsoons and heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that Port Said was not only the wickedest but the filthiest city in the world . In the morning , however , we woke to find ourselves drawn up before a spotless water-front , lined with trim buildings facing a wide , well-paved street , our big boat surrounded by tiny ones whose owners were clamoring to take us ashore . We yielded to the importunities of one Mohamed Mohamed Ayad , who presented us with his business card , and whose white craft bore in blue letters the name of Jack Dempsey ; and selecting a dragoman ( guide ) from the throng who sprang upon us when we landed , secured ? for twenty-five cents ? his services . which included keeping all his colleagues at hay , showing us the sights , directing us to shops , carrying the bundles , and hiring two carriages each drawn by white horses ! Why Henry , who has a violent aversion to horses and never can be persuaded to ride on or behind one if he can help it , should have insisted on this touch , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was equal to it . Coffee and Ice Cream Al Fresco The pleasant impression which the first sight of the water-front had made upon us persisted , and we enjoyed our wanderings . But most of all we enjoyed sitting at one of the little green tables in the open-air cafe in front of the New Bar ( the most innocuous little restaurant , in this part of the world , is called a " bar " ) drinking piping hot Turkish coffee . thick and sweet , and watching the world go by . The New Bar is situated on one of four corners where to wide streets cross each other ; on the opposite coiner is the Splendid Bar ; and as pedestrians approach , the mustachioed proprietor of each establishment rushes forward and importunes the wayfarers to patronize his , rather than his rival 's . The commotion does not subside until the prospective guest is actually seated on one side of the street or the other , and is renewed upon the appearance of each new arrival . This diversion alone would keep the coffee sipping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-clad women pass by , their limpid eyes soft above the transparent veil fastened over the nose by a golden ornament which looks like a triple thimble : vendors of cooling drinks , with a piece of ice shaped like a huge stick of candy protruding 1 from the bottle of burnished brass slung across their shoulders , brass cymbals with which they advertise their wares in one hand , a brass cup  | in the other ; countless hawkers who strive to hang glass beads around our necks and thrust souvenir spoons into our mouths no matter how we struggle ; boot-blacks and fortune tellers , each in their own way trying to brighten our existence . Having drunk all the coffee we could , we shifted to ice-cream , which was packed rich and smooth and hard in tall silver goblets ; and still the gay , shifting panorama went on , until the afternoon was nearly gone , and we realized regretfully that we must rejoin our ship . We drove down the street in our ancient victorias drawn by the white horses , our host waving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good-bye , good-bye ! Come again ! Do n't forget the New Bar ! " Our dragoman , munificently rewarded with his twenty-five cents , handed over to us the trophies of the day : Turkish paste in a big round box , spilling with sugar ; an enormous bunch of top-heavy red roses ; a glistening shawl , a pair of tiny , tasseled slippers . Mohamed Mohamed Ayad in the Jack Dempsey was waiting to take us back to the President Harrison ; and soon we were slowly steaming out toward the breakwater , past the statue of De Lesseps , splendid and solitary on the long , narrow pier ? not the broken and conquered De Lesseps of Panama immortalized on the Plaza Francia , but the joyful , triumphant De Lesseps immortalized in the Suez Canal , in building which he united and divided , at one and the same time , the continents of Asia and Africa . Off for Cairo True to form , we arrived in Alexandria at half-past five in the morning ; nevertheless we missed the nine o'clock train to Cairo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tedious and difficult , Egypt takes the cake ? even away from the United States . In fact , we encountered so many difficulties that we became completely cowed , and with no strength left to lament that we had lost the nine o'clock , ended by feeling submissively thankful that we caught the twelve o'clock . Even the first sight of the Nile stirred our weary breasts to no enthusiasm , but fortunately the trip from Alexandria to Cairo takes only three hours ; and once settled in comfortable quarters at an excellent hotel and refreshed by tea , we reminded each other that the moon , which we had seen hanging round and brilliant over the canal two nights earlier , would be less round and brilliant with each succeeding night ; and that if we wished to have our first glimpse of the Pyramids beneath its radiance we should try to do so that very evening . Abdelkarim Aboud ? " contractor for upper and lower Egypt , " his card states , but I hasten to tell you that the " contracts " refer merely to guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was waiting , a snowy turban wound round his black head , a flowing robe of ultramarine sweeping about him . The half-hour 's motor ride across the Nile and out of the city seemed all too short ; it was something of a shock , also , to catch our first sight of the Great Pyramid above the top of a clanging trolley-car ; to see the wide , wellpaved road swing in front of a large , fashionable hotel and curve upward almost to the base of the mighty monument . Then , suddenly , all sense of disappointment ceased : we turned a corner , and the desert began to drift across the road ; the car could go no further . We got out , sinking ankle-deep into clean warm sand . The trolley line , the gay hotel . the glare and noise , miraculously disappeared ; the stillness , the immensity , the antiquity of the place which we entered engulfed us . Sitting down on the slope beside the Sphinx , we could see by the light of that huge , smooth moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyramids ? the three large pyramids which were the tombs of kings , and the three small  | ones which were the tombs of queens ? casting their long , soft shadows at our very feet , the Step Pyramid and the other pyramids of Memphis and Sakhara , small , perfect , black cones , rising clear-cut in the distance ; the pitched tents of some travelers , the huddled huts of a little , lighted village ; the graceful robes of our dragoman , blown out like bright , blue sails in the buoyant breeze , as he stood , silent and immobile , beside us ; and nothing else but that endless majesty of sand and sky , that dim divinity of the desert . How long we sat there , too much awed to speak , I shall never know . It must have been for hours , and still there came no jarring sound to mar that matchless stillness , that perfect sense of space . At last , obeying the tradition , we each whispered to the Sphinx the question upon the answer to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sphinx left us unanswered . Then we turned toward home . The ruins of the ancient city of Memphis and the tombs at Sakhara were both , to me , somewhat disappointing , but there is one beautiful sphinx at Memphis , entirely unin-paired , and surrounded by palm trees . This is extremely beautiful and has a most life-like and cheerful expression as indeed do many of the ancient statues here ; some of them are actually laughing ! ? while the great black marble sarcophagi of the Sacred Bulls are massively and gloomily impressive . We were satisfied , however , to make our first visit to them our only one , whereas we returned to the pyramids again and again . Near them , at the Harvard Camp , that great scholar and archmologist , Dr. Reisner , lives with his wife and daughter , and we were delightfully entertained by them several times , besides being allowed the rare privilege of seeing the remarkable discoveries in his recent excavations , the result of which are not to be made public until fall , and which vie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not describe these discoveries to you , since I was admitted to them under a solemn pledge of secrecy , but I think that not long after this letter reaches you Dr. Reisner 's own account of them will be published , and you must not fail to watch for it . I am sure that it will be delightfully told , as well as important in content , for he has the faculty of making ancient history glow with vitality . Dining Beside the Pyramids It gave us a strange thrill to dine there beside the pyramids and the desert , in such a peaceful , and at the same time such a stimulating way , but we attended many other social functions which we enjoyed no less . The time has never come ? and probably never will ? when I shall cease to enjoy putting on my best clothes and going to a party , simply because it is a party ! And there have been such wonderful parties to go to here ! There was , for instance , the dinner which the American Minister and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we dined on the roof above the noise and dust of the city . Among the other guests were the Persian Minister , M. Djalal , and his pretty English , wife , and the King 's Chamberlain , Hassanein Bey , a noted explorer and a charming gentleman , with the rare gifts of a perfect conversationalist . There was also the all-day fete of the Prince and Princess Lotfallah , held on one of the great Egyptian holidays : a mammoth tent , open at the sides , the top made of that . wonderful , multi-colored material , hand-applique , upon which we see the tent-makeers working in their tiny shops , supported by poles of twisted red and white , set down in the midst of the famous rose-garden . Here more than two hundred persons were served with lunch , Mrs. Howell , who had kindly taken me with her , and I being seated at the table with the Greek Minister and his wife , and the Swiss , Swedish , and Turkish Ministers .

Cairo . is a most attractive city , with hard , bright sunshine and with more personality than any in which we have stayed since Peking . The districts of Garden City and Gezireh are adorned with fine residences , surrounded by lovely flowers and trees , and palaces set down in the midst of private parks , while there are many public parks as well . The broad avenues are bordered with blue jacaranda trees , just now in full bloom , and the wide modern streets are intersected with circles and squares , much as similar streets are intersected in Washington . The narrow ancient streets wind their way under carved arches between the tiny open shops of tent-makers and vendors of priceless rugs ; the Nile , flowing through its midst , is fringed with jaunty houseboats . The Sights of Cairo Aside from its beauty , the city teems with such a variety of sights and interests that it can not fail to charm the stranger within its gates , no matter what the stranger may be seeking .

He may go tip to the citadel at sunset , passing in the course of his ascent through a narrow slit of a streey with a mosque on either side , square and massive , with slender , gray turrets , delicately carved , showing fine as silver lace but strong as tempered steel against the azure sky ; and when he has reached his destination , he will enter the -. courtyard of the Mohamed Aly mosque , where the five hundred Mamelukes ( white male slaves from Turkestan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so cruelly slaughtered ; and the mosque itself Cat A where the designs of the stained-glass windows are reflected in the priceless carpet . and the crystal globes and prisms of myriad lamps ate gleaming , and all is still and spacious and serene . Then he will go out to the parapet aim a and see on one side the never-failing quarries from which the stones for the pyramids were taken , and , on the other , the whole great city patterned below him , and all about the endless desert and the endless sky . Or he may find his way to old Cairo , to see the spot where Moses was found in the bulrushes , and the still holier one where Mary and Joseph and the Young Child took refuge after the Flight into Egypt . now sheltered by a Coptic Church . Most of us do not think of Egypt as a Christian country , yet there is historical ground for its claim that it has the oldest Christian church , in the world , founded by St. Mark , and the I one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . The early Coptic Christians were descended directly from the early Egyptian kings , and their own descendants . though numbering only about one-tenth of , the present population of Egypt . are among the finest , the most representative , and the ' most influential of all classes of people .  | The first Egyptian house which I entered in Cairo was , as it happens , the beautiful home of such a Christian family , the Khayatts . Habib Khayatt Bey is a member of the Egyptian Senate , and his lovely wife is one of the leading feminists of Egypt , being prominently associated in that movement which her niece , Madame Fahmy Wissa Bey , also the wife of a Senator , who was visiting her aunt when I was entertained by the latter and with whom I was fortunate enough to have more than one good talk later on . The educated Christian women of Egypt discarded the veil about sixty years ago , and neither Madame Wissa nor Madame Khayatt leads a life any more secluded or restricted than yours or ' nine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American Senator 's wife , to compare notes with them , as Egyptian Senators ' wives ! Madame Khayatt 's three vivacious and attractive young daughters , who have traveled widely , speak three or four languages perfectly , and discuss the literature and events of the day with as much knowledge and intelligence of any one I have met in the course of my world-trip , also dance and play bridge and golf with as much skill and as much unhampered merriment as any American or European girl of my acquaintance . - Two Egyptian Feminists I am sure you will remember my telling you of the profound impression which the Egyptian delegates to the International Suffrage Convention in Rome three years ago made not only upon the conference as a whole , but upon me personally , and therefore you will understand my delight that the second Egyptian house which I was invited to visit was that of Madame Charaoui Pasha , the moth er-in Jaw of the present Egyptian Minister to Washington , whose niece . Mlle. Ceza Nabouroui , the editor of the feminist magazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two greatly admired delegates ! Madame Charaoui and 1 Mlle. Aabaroui are Moslems ; and though the Moslem women have been slower to appear unveiled and to receive men than the Christian women ? many of them , of course , still do not , though as it happened , I met few of these ? the boys were included in my invitation , and we found our hostesses awaiting us , clad a la Parisienne , in a drawing-room which , might easily have been mistaken for a Parisian salon ; while the fact that the conversation was carried on entirely in French still further strengthened the illusion . The Egyptian ladies whom I have met-have been , almost without exception , beautifully dressed and beautiful themselves , with clear , camellia-like complexions , soft , limpid , dark eyes , and a graceful poise and carriage ; and Madame Charaoui Pasha , whose youthful charm would certainly never lead you to believe that she is the mother of grown children , is one of the loveliest of all . At the time of the.conference in Rome , the feminists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government : a law that would specify sixteen as the minimum age for a girl 's marriage ; and a law providing equal educational opportunities for boys and girls . They were almost immediately successful in their attempts , and , thus encouraged , they have turned their attentions to other needed reforms ? woman suffrage , the extinction of polygamy , equal divorce laws for men and women , and laws providing that women may have better guardian rights over their children . Since my arrival in Cairo , they have presented themselves in a body to the Prime Minister , Ziwar Pasha , with their new petition , and have been most favorably received ; and I have no doubt that they will be as successful this time as they were before . The second time that I saw Madame Charaoui Pasha she told me of the feminists ' favorable reception by the Prime Minister . She @#  | took me that day to see a small model factory for the manufacture of ceramics ? an art lost in Egypt for more than five hundred years , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has built and which she maintains herself outside the city . Lovely plates and jars in beautiful colored designs , all original , are being made there , and ' she had the pleasant idea of inviting a party of friends to see the process of manufacture . She has built herself a small apartment on the upper story of the factory and furnished it with exquisite taste , and from time to time she goes there to stay quietly and rest from her numerous activities in Cairo . After her guests had been shown the ceramics in all stages of their creation ? even to watching the baked vessels being taken from the furnaces ? we were served with a delicious collation in the little drawing-room , our hostess a perfect vision of loveliness in a snow-white plaited chiffon dress , over which she wore a black chiffon cape , and a long veil , which did not cover her face but fitted her head cap-fashion , and floated out behind her . Tea with the Prime Minister I found it easy to understand her satisfaction at the Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most genial person . I had been invited by him to tea and was escorted to the private dining-room in the Continental-Savoy hotel , where the little 1 party was to take place , by our Minister , Dr. Howell , who . I must tell you , is startlingly like the late President Harding . of whom he was an intimate ' friend , in both appearance and manner . - We were received by His Excellency 's young secretary , Ali Bey Ismail , and a moment later Ziwar Pasha himself appeared . The usual courtesies having been exchanged , he overwhelmed me by demanding suddenly , " Oil sort z os enfants ? " ( Where are your children ? ) I had not understood that the boys were included in the invitation , and I had them hastily summoned . Fortunately they were only upstairs ? for we have been staying at the same hotel ? and soon they were being presented in their turn . and plied with jam and eclairs and other delicacies dear to the heart of youth . In fact , the Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go hungry than with anything else ; and they as well as I will always remember him as a perfect host , rather than as the man who , for some little time , has been one of the leading figures in the Egyptian Government , while the high praise which he , a Mohammedan , gave to American Christian work in Egypt , was also most gratifying . The feminist movement in Egypt is , almost entirely , the outgrowth of the national movement for an independent Egypt , for it was not until they had shown their mettle by working side by side with their fathers , sons . and brothers in behalf of liberty that the women either attempted or asked to obtain other benefits . In 1882 Egypt , which for many years before this had been a tributary state to Turkey , though with an independent sovereign , succumbed to British occupation ? an occupation rendered necessary , according to a British writer , " by the insecurity of the lives and property of the European Communities and Christian minorities subsequent to the Alexandria massacres . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier the country " became so insolvent that Great-Britain and France , as the two most interested powers . took it upon themselves to depose-lsmail the Khedive ) with the concurrence of the Porte. and Monsieur de Blignieres and Major Baring ( subsequently Lord Cromer ) were appointed Controllers . " This occupation was - at first supposed by the Egyptians to be temporary ; at the beginning of the World War , however , not only it was still in force , but a British Protectorate was declared over Egypt . Siam this Protectorate was also considered a @#  | temporary measure , made necessary by the war , no great exception as taken to it : but when neither the Armistice nor the months following the Armistice brought it to an end . Egyptian feeling against British rule became very tense . And when the Egyptian leader . Zaghloul Pasha , and three of his co-workers in the cause for independence were arrested and exiled to Malta , public indignation burst into flames . - It was then that the women exerted themselves . High-class Moslem ladies , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cairo as a token of their protest , and their Christian compatriots joined them . The following day the leaders of the Independent Movement met and formally thanked the women who had formed the procession . Thus encouraged , the women decided to organize a patriotic society . The result was the New Woman 's Society , of which Madame Charaoui Pasha became the honorary president ; and in 1919 the " Women 's Central Committee of the Egyptian Delegation " was formed , with Madame Charaoui Pasha as president , Madame W'issa Bey as vice-president , and Madame Khayatt as treasurer . Three years later , Lord Milner 's Project for Egyptian Independence was rejected as being unsatisfactory by Zaghloul ( who had meanwhile been released from Malta on account of the uproar his detention had caused ) ; but he was soon afterwards exiled again , this time to Seychelles . Delegations of women belonging to the Central Committee appeared several times before Lord Allenby , the British High Commissioner , asking for his release , protesting that his health was being impaired by his captivity , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was contrary to the Egyptian constitution to detain him . Madame Wissa Bey was especially active in Zaghloul 's behalf , and in the end he and the other political prisoners were all released , with public feeling running extremely strong . That much credit was due to the little band of devoted women . An Audience with Zaghloul Pasha Small wonder , then , that the feminist movement has flourished apace in Egypt ; small wonder , too , that I was pleased when I was told by Madame Khayatt that Zaghloul Pasha would be very pleased to meet me , and that she would take me to see him . He was suffering , she explained , with a chronic bronchitis , so that he and Madame Zaghloul Pasha would be obliged to receive us upstairs , in their private sitting-room . But if I would not mind that ? ? Explaining that I felt the honor to be all the greater under the circumstances , I accepted . Madame Khayatt called for me in her limousine , and soon I entered another beautiful Egyptian drawing-room , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of crystal birds . A serving-woman entered , and taking our hands in turn within her own , kissed them and lifted them to her forehead . Next came a Swiss lady-in-waiting , who conducted us upstairs , where Madame Zaghloul Pasha , a handsome woman elegantly dressed in magenta-colored crepe , and wearing magnificent pearls , met us and presented us to her husband . This intrepid leader and former Prime Minister , generally conceded to be one of the most remarkable of living men , was sunk in a deep-cushioned chair from which it was obviously an effort for him to move , clad in a gray silk dressing-gown , a gray silk skull-cap on his head . He received us kindly , and entered into a cordial conversation . A cool , sweet drink , candied fruit , and hot sweet coffee were served in turn , while the exchange of trivialities continued ; then , rousing himself to sudden animation , he entered into a minute and illuminating exposition of the state of public affairs in Egypt today from the Nationalist 's point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violent coughing and becoming more and more vehement with every word he spoke . These affairs are , indeed , in a most extraordinary situation ; the famous " Declaration of February " issued by the British in 1922. stating that the British Protectorate over Egypt is terminated , and Egypt is declared to be an independent state , goes on to remark : " The following matters are absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Majesty 's Government until such time as it mar be possible by free discussion and friendly accommodation on both sides to conclude agreements in regard thereto between His Majesty 's Government and the Government of Egypt : " The security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt ; " The defense of Egypt against all foreign aggression or interference , direct or indirect ; " The protection of foreign interests in Egypt and the protection of the minorities ; " The Sudan . " Pending the conclusion of such agreements the status quo in all these matters remains the same . " All this is , of course , equivalent to saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is independent so long as it is bound to another by such agreements , and the convenient time for " free discussion and friendly accommodation " has not yet , in the opinion of Great Britain , arrived . The Egyptian Parliament , strongly Zaghloulist ? that is , proindependent ? was dissolved in November , 1924 , by the King , who has the power to do this , because of the ultimatum of the British following the Sirdar murder , which , as you probably remember , was couched in harsh terms . New election laws , held by the Zaghloulists to be unconstitutional , were framed by the Ziwar Ministry , and a new election was held in March , 1925 ? resulting again , in spite of all efforts to prevent it , in another overwhelming victory for Zaghloul ? a victory in which the Egyptian women took a notable part . Again Parliament met and was dissolved the same day . Politics in Egypt All the political parties in Egypt today ? the Zaghloulists , or Wafds , as they are also called , the Radadans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Liberal Constitutionalists , who though no less desirous of independence than the other two believe in milder measures to obtain it ? have united against the Ziwar Ministry , representing the Unionist Party , which is , they insist , entirely subject to British dictation . On the twenty-second of May ? that is , during the course of my stay here ? national elections were held . again ; and again Zaghloul emerged from them triumphant . The city was tense with excitement , and though no disorders occurred , the very air seemed charged with hostile feeling . It looked for a few days as if Zaghloul himself might form the new Ministry , in spite of his age and infirmities and the hostility of the British , who have never ceased to insist that they hold him morally responsible for the murder of the Sirdar of Soudan , a crime which they contend was committed to stir up antiBritish feeling : The court decision , acquitting certain adherents of his who had been accused of this crime , greatly strengthening his own insistence that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British judge whose opinion in the matter had not coincided with that of his Egyptian colleagues , added fuel to the already leaping fire . So did the published news that one British warship was already on its way here , and others were in readiness to start . But little by little the tension lessened . Zaghloul and Lord Lloyd , the British High Commissioner , who had never consented to meet each other before , held a conference at the Residency . A great luncheon  | in Zaghloul 's honor took place at the Continental-Savoy , at which he was enthusiastically acclaimed , but at the end of which it was disclosed that the new Cabinet would be headed by Adly Yeghen Pasha , a Liberal Constitutionalist of brilliant attainments more acceptable to the British in that position than Zaghloul himself ; that the Cabinet would contain both Liberal Constitutionalists and Zaghloulists ; and that Zaghloul himself would become President of the new Senate . Shortly afterward the Ziwar Ministry resigned , the Royal Proclamation convening Parliament went forth , and two days later it opened amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend this opening was actually in my hand , I gazed at it first with rapturous excitement and then with a sinking heart . " The President of the Senate , " I read in French , " has the honor to beg Mrs. Henry Wilder Keyes to be present at the ceremony of the opening of Parliament , Thursday , the tenth of June , 1926 , at nine A. M. , Box No. 6 . " So far , so good ; but underneath all this appeared the fateful words , " Full evening dress . " For two days the thermometer , which had not registered below ninety since I could remember , had stood at one hundred and eleven in the shade , and the idea of going forth without a hat in that frightful heat , let alone of feeling extremely conspicuous and unclothed in the merciless morning light on the way to the House of Parliament , was most disconcerting . However , the thought of the much worse predicament of the boys , who were also invited , afforded me some solace ? say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black broadcloth . I hastily collected the requisites for the elaborate toilette , dressed in them at seven-thirty in the morning , and , an hour later , motored in state down the cleared streets lined on either side with soldiers , past the palace with its brilliant guard in white uniforms , arrived without mishap at the Parliament Building ; and parting with the boys at the first floor ? since the box reserved for the ladies of the Diplomatic Corps , where I was to sit , in the center of the second tier , had on either side of it a box reserved for the ladies of the harem , no gentlemen sitting anywhere near it ? took up my point of vantage , and looked about me . Parliament Convenes It was a beautiful sight . The Parliament Chamber is circular and very high , with a domed ceiling , which , as well as the walls , is exquisitely carved and painted white . Directly opposite me , on a raised platform , stood the golden and crimson throne surmounted by a tall draped canopy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , also on the platform , were the seats for the Princes of the Blood Royal , and for the members of the new cabinet . Below sat the Senators and Deputies , some of them in full evening dress , others in redingote and tarbouch ( fez ) , others in flowing robes and kafiehs ? the flowing headdress of the desert dweller . We recognized Senator Khayatt with pleasure as he took his seat ; and when Zaghloul came in and took his seat in the front row , thrilled with the applause to which the chamber rocked . In the galleries the uniforms of other Egyptian officials and the members of the Diplomatic Corps glittered and sparkled ; the Queen 's brother sat , slim and elegant , in a balcony box , surrounded by a brilliant , changing group . The harem ladies , wives of ministers , lightly veiled in either white chiffon or black lace , a thin network very like that of a cage in front of their boxes , laughed softly and chatted with each other , discussing the birth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen the day before . In the box with me sat Mrs. Johnson , the wife of our charge d'affaires ( the Howells having left for America the day before ) , in petunia-  | color and crystals ; Madame Hurban , also an American by birth , the wife of the CzechoSlovakian charge , in white and crystals ; Madame Sactouris , the wife of the Greek Minister , in gold brocade and gold lace ; Madame Djalal , the wife of the Persian Minister , lovely in pale green and pearls ; " numerous other distinguished ladies , all beautifully dressed . Suddenly the sound of a salute of cannon , announcing that the king had left the palace , boomed forth ; and leaving their boxes , both the ladies of the Diplomatic Corps and the harem ladies went out on a little balcony leading from the corridor directly opposite , to watch the procession as it drew near . We made ourselves very comfortable there , for it was shady and comparatively cool , and lemonade , sandwiches , and little cakes ? indeed welcome considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were appetizingly set forth on a little , white-covered table in charge of a maid . Soon a stir of excitement announced the approach of the High Commissioner . Preceded and followed by dashing outriders , with numerous cavasses , gay in their baggy scarlet trousers and tight-fitting. scarlet , gold-braided jackets , in attendance , he whirled up in an open car and descended with considerable eclat , attired in a full-dress uniform which might have served as the " glass of fashion and the mold of form " ? for he is always very smartly turned out ? and accompanied by aides and secretaries , all sufficiently impressive in their appearance to enhance the elegance of his own . There was a short intermission ; then the mounted police , riding superb brown horses and carrying fluttering pennants , appeared , followed by a squadron of the Royal Bodyguard , splendidly mounted on white horses . There were several state coaches , driven by coachmen and flanked by footmen in glittering livery , and filled with Princes and Ministers ; and in the midst'of them progressed the royal state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containing His Majesty , King Fuad , the First , attired in a magnificent white uniform , and accompanied by Adly Yeghen Pasha , the new Prime Minister . The troops lining the street presented the royal salute , the Egyptian national air rang out , and the Egyptian flag , a white crescent and three white stars on a green ground , was raised on the Parliament Building and the adjoining Ministries . The Speech from the Throne Having seen the King ? a stout man with a small mustache ? alight , we hastened back into the Chamber , and an instant later he entered and took his place upon the throne . There was a slight pause ; then he coughed and handed a long rolled document ? the Speech from the Throne , as it is officially called , though the King neither writes it nor reads it ? to the Prime Minister , and leaned back comfortably , coughing from time to time , while Adly Pasha read the address . His reading was interrupted by frequent applause , led by Zaghloul , who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , apparently wrapped in thought . Since the address was in Arabic I-could not , of course , understand what the applause was about at the time ; and though translations of it have appeared since , I am still equally in the dark , for it seemed to me to contain only pleasant platitudes and genial generalities . The ceremonious reading being completed , the King took his departure ; the High Commissioner followed , displaying the same eclat with which he had arrived ; and , a few minutes later , the brilliant company had completely dispersed , and the Parliament had settled down to routine business . I can not close this already long letter  | without a very high tribute to the British High Commissioner for Egypt , Lord George Lloyd ( do not let the name confuse you ? it is not Lloyd George ! ) , a man probably no less remarkable than his adversary , Zaghloul Pasha ? each must have found the other a " foeman worthy of his steel . " I discovered him to be a delightful host , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly sort of tea , with bread and butter and plum cake spread out in the peaceful shade of the spacious garden back of the Residency , to which the boys and I were bidden without other guests , and sat visiting in comfortable kindly fashion through the calm length of an undisturbed afternoon ; and at the " Searchlight Tattoo , " held in honor of the King of England 's birthday ? the most superb display of horsemanship and military maneuveres that I ever saw ? when we sat in his box , next to the King of Egypt's. and at which he himself received one of the most tremendous ovations I have ever seen accorded to any individual . But in the course of two long talks which I had with him myself , unconnected with any social event , and in the course of six long weeks in Cairo , when he was frequently the subject of the conversation of others , I discovered him to be much more than that . The British High Commissioner He is a very young man ? a little over forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already has a notable record as Governor of Bombay behind him . Slight , dark , at once dignified and dramatic of presence , he is almost startlingly magnetic of face and expression . He talks rapidly , with great wealth of allusion . and a thorough knowledge of world affairs . revealing at one and the same time the tireless student , the skilled executive , and the finished diplomat . He has an unfailing genius for guessing not only what is in your mind ? what you meant to tell him ; but what is in the back of your mind ? what you did not mean to tell him . And when he has extracted from you the truths which you in your vanity supposed to be skilfully hidden , he does not pay you back by making you uncomfortable ; he recognizes the fact that your frankness is not meant to be offensiveness , and that it is , moreover , the result of his own insistence . That I by no means agree with everything he said is a minor matter ; he not only convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . he gave me a new and beautiful conception of patriotism , which touched me very deeply . His handling of the present situation has been masterly in the extreme ; the Empire is built by men ; it in turn builds them . Honor to whom honor is due ! I believe that if my hope of going around the world once more five years from now , visiting those places which I have not seen on this trip , comes true , I shall meet him again ? in Del fl ? and that his title then will be Viceroy of India . " Egypt , " wrote Amr el Asy , the Arab conqueror , many centuries ago . " is a dusty city and a green tree . Its length is a month and its breadth is ten days . The Nile traces a line through its midst ; blessed are its early morning voyages and its travels at eventide . At one time Egypt is a white pearl ; then golden amber ; then a green emerald ; then an embroidery of many colors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits upon this land ! " Blessed indeed ? and blessed also those who. even if only for a little time , have sat beneath the green tree at eventide , with the embroidery of many colors flung about their shoulders , smoothing the milky radiance of the white pearl . Always affectionately yours , Frances Parkinson Keyes
