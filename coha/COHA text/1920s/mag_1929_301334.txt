Children of the U. S. can count glibly , " five pennies are a nickel , two nickels are a dime ; " but children of the Irish Free State must become even glibber . They must count in the following strange fashion : <P> " Two sows are a hen , three hens are a hare , two hares are a wolfhound , and two wolfhounds are a cow . " <P> Such counting was actually studied last week by Irish tots , fingering and counting bright new Irish Free State coins , each adorned with a harp on one side and on the other animals as follows : <P> Denomination Approx . Value Animal <P> Florin $2.91 Salmon <P> Half Crown 60 Horse <P> Shilling 24 Cow <P> Sixpenny-bit 12 Wolfhound <P> Threepenny-bit 6 Hare <P> Penny 2 Hen <P> Halfpenny 1 Sow <P> Farthing Woodcock <P> <P> Throughout the week Irish Free State news-organs published hundreds of letters from irate citizens , most of whom wanted to know why neither St. Patrick nor the Shamrock appears on any of the new coins . The Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by symbol-loving Poet William Butler Yeats , winner of the Nobel Prize . Shrewd Poet Yeats offered no explanation or defense of the coins , merely observing that the designs were made by Sculptor Percy Metcalfe of Yorkshire , England , who triumphed in competition with such Masters as Paul Manship and Ivan Mestrovic.
