North Carolina Justice NOBODY is to be indicted for the murder of Ella May Wiggins , the " poet laureate of the union , " who was shot down on the highway between Gastonia and South Gastonia , N. C. , on September 14 . I hardly imagine there is anybody who expected that the Grand Jury of Gaston County would return a true bill for the wanton assassination of this unfortunate woman . Certainly I did not expect any such result as I sat in the little court room last month and listened to the coroner 's inquest into the affair . County Solicitor Carpenter himself made it clear enough what the ultimate result would be . His examination of the men charged with pursuing the truckload of Union organizers , forcing it off the road and then shooting into the crowded truck , was distinguished by such sharp and remorseless questions as " You did n't have a gun with you , did you ? " or " Were n't lookin ' for any trouble , were you ? " One of the International Labor Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men , was told to " keep out of this . " The manager of the ManvilleJenckes Company went bail for all . Everybody was happy . The unionites , however , postponed the funeral of Ella May for fear of another shooting . Murder is sometimes a crime in North Carolina . A " speakin ' " by union organizers always is . This strange lack of proportion pervades the whole attitude of North Carolina toward this labor ' disturbance . At Marion , where a sheriff and his deputies ruthlessly shot down more than a score of strikers , who do not appear to have been armed , Judge Harding sat as a court of inquiry , and eventually held some of the deputies for the Grand jury . But , although he addressed a few conventional rebukes to violence as a glittering generality , he was positively catonic in his denunciation of the horrid crime of standing at a mill gate at six in the morning and urging honest toilers to refuse to go to their toil . Sheriff Atkins and his brave deputies had covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evidence of provocation was so nebulous that the whole episode must stand as little short of deliberate assassination . Yet it was the " right of men to work " which most concerned Judge Harding after he had listened to the brutal story . Or go back to the investigation into the flogging of Ben Wells , C. D. Saylor and C. M. Lell . Witness after witness took the stand and told Judge Shaw that he had heard " they was goin ' to be a speakin ' " and that Officer Sams had deputized him to go ' down to the mill where the speakin ' was to take place and " see that there were n't no trouble . " When Officer Sams , the deputizer , took the stand , " did Solicitor Carpenter ask him how long since it had become a crime in North Carolina to attend a " speakin ' , " or whether he did n't think that union organizers had rights which he , as an officer , was sworn to protect , or where he had learned that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such questions would be regarded as incompetent , irrelevant and immaterial in North Carolina . Solicitor Carpenter contented himself with making the alleged floggers look as respectable as possible , while he impeached his own witnesses with such remarks as : " Oh , yes , Mr. Lell . I remember representing you in a little matter , do n't I ? Some trifling misdemeanor , was n't it ? " And so on . Judge Shaw did his best to find out something of the facts by examining the witnesses himself , but even his fairness was unable to make him see the absurdity of disqualifying Wells as a witness because of his disbelief in an avenging Deity . In North Carolina , by judicial fiat , the mob may beat and torture an atheist to its sadistic satisfaction and be immune so far as their victim 's testimony against them is concerned . The floggers have now been acquitted altogether , the jury being persuaded that the Communists walloped each other to create sympathy ! Of course , no such solicitude is extended to crime in North Carolina when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accented in Tarheelia ) and union organizers . The death of Chief Aderholt has been avenged by long prison sentences for seven men , in spite of the fact that any ordinary group of men in similar circumstances would have had small difficulty in convincing a jury that they had shot their assailants in self-defense . As Gerald W. Johnson summed it up in The Baltimore Evening Sun , " They are striking cotton-mill hands . They are outside the law . " He continues : " If they arm themselves and resist , as they did at Gastonia , they get seventeen years in the penitentiary . If they do not arm , and resist , as they did at Marion , they are shot down by the police . If they go unarmed and make no effort to resist they may still be killed on the public highway . That is how Mrs. Wiggins died . " Her death is a matter of public indifference , but Chief Aderholt is avenged and , although the judge on the bench has been widely and , I think , deservedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his longest sentences were meted out to Fred Beal and Clarence Miller , whose connection with the shooting was only vaguely established , but whose connection with Communism seemed very clearly proven . Whatever may have been Judge Barnhill 's idea in giving them longer sentences than he gave to the other men , less important in the unionizing movement but more closely , Noventbcr 6 , 1929 THE NEW Identified with the events surrounding the shooting Of the chief , his distinction is the very one which all Gastonia has insisted upon from the First . Convict heal anyway , has been their slogan . Hence all the circuitous evidence concerning Beal 's precise official status at the strikers ' camp . Judge Barnhill may have - fallen in with the conspiracy theory , in spite of the palpable evidence that the strikers were a little quick on the trigger because they had just before the fatal night been attacked and beaten by a crowd of drunken rioters . Policemen and rioters are often indistinguishable in mill towns . Perhaps Judge Barnhill really believes the conspiracy theory , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as " fair " as the jury was in finding them all guilty of the same kind of murder , even though some of them came from the North , and others were radical leaders of some note , and still others had no theology acceptable to the Fundamentalists of the South . And it would have been more comforting if Judge Barnhill could have seen , as Judge Stack did in the flogging case at Concord , that to impeach a witness on account of his lack of religious conviction is an effective denial of the funkIamental civil rights of an individual . Once during the trial Judge Barnhill remarked , in commenting on the Sacco-Vanzetti case , that " sometimes an environment has an effect upon a judicial ruling . " I wonder if he meant that to be nasty about Old Webster Thayer , after all . No , it is difficult not to accept Mr. Johnson 's conclusion that , for all practical purposes , a striker is outside the law in North Carolina . Judge Shaw was Indignant over the flogging of Wells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aderholt defendants for murder and not for radicalism . Nevertheless , neither of these jurists was able to see the absurdity and injustice of the religious qualification , and Judge Barnhill 's sentences of the convicted murderers of Aderholt at least coincide with the popular belief that blood guiltiness varies directly with the defendant 's degree of radicalism . Judge Stack courageously barred the examination of witnesses ' religion and Political ideas , but the jury freed the floggers just the same . The Charlotte newspaper man who told me that there was going to be a whipping every time there was a speakin ' had substantially the right information . " The people over there in Gastonia are n't going to tolerate these Red bastards and you can put that in your paper , " he told me . " And nobody Is going to be convicted for these whipping parties , " he added . " You might as well have all the fun you can out of these hearings because that 's all there 'll , be to it . " It is unreasonable to demand moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could report that this was said at least with regret over the state of mind of a community which has so succumbed to frenzy that it has come to regard soapbox oratory as a high crime , and murder as a misdemeanor which can be forgotten when " everything blows over . " But my journalistic friend was n't horrified at all . He was like most of the people you meet down there , who talk to you superciliously on this question just as they talk about the Negro question ? as if an outsider could n't understand their " peculiar local problem . " To think that after all these years of the radical menace in " foreign cities , " we should have to go to North Carolina for instruction on the way to meet the radical movement ! Another newspaper man , also a North Carolinian , ran squarely against Gastonia respectability when he tried to provide a bail bond for a girl among the unionists who had been arrested on the charge of possessing liquor . The bail bond was for $100 , and the scribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the town knew him and his responsibility was unquestioned , he was not allowed to write a check to accompany the bond . The court had to have the money . And when he told people what he wanted a check cashed for , several refused to cash it and accused him of being a Red himself . In order to get this young girl out of the Gastonia lock-up , my friend had to go through more red tape than it would require to merge Standard Oil of New Jersey with Helena Rubenstein , Inc . . . . Those accused of slaying Ella May were released on a few flourishes of the fountain pen by the manager of the Foray mill . Sometimes I wish I could believe that the North Carolina mob was really out of hand . Mob spirit is fearful to contemplate , but it is passionate and uncalculating . The bourgeoisie of Gaston county tell you the population is so inflamed with hatred of the Communists that " anything may happen . " I do n't believe it . I have seen the proletariat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflamed on any subject more serious than the number of flapjacks necessary for breakfast . It has required some healthy blow-torches to set those embers glowing . The Gastonia Gazette , with its constant references to the Christ-like patience of Gastonia in the face of provocations , which it then proceeded to describe in incendiary fashion , doubtless contributed to the continuation of mob rage , and some of the gentry who told me with long faces how hard it was to " hold the boys in " had their fingers crossed . One such reminded me , after Ella May had been killed , " how much worse a thing like that looks in the paper than what it really was . " He said that in the courtroom , which was full of his fellow-citizens who were accused of wantonly shooting down a helpless woman . He might have said , " What 's all this fuss about a striker ? " He chuckled and said , " You ca n't tell what the boys 'll do when they get all rared up , " as if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Samuel Butler , I believe , who wanted to know why sexual immorality in English fiction is so much more seriously condemned than homicide . North Carolina might ask herself by what processes of mind has she come to consider a ragged little Union meeting so much more criminal than murder , kidnapping , flogging , false arrest and arson . I do n't see how her citizens can ask themselves such a question without seeing the necessity of a quick march out of the bog of ethical confusion in which these labor troubles have mired them .
