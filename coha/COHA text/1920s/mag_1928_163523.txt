The man 's name is Heinrich Langkopf . His demeanor is upright and engaging though his eyes are haggard . He is 54 and has now been certified by Berlin police physicians as " entirely sane . " Last week , he convinced a large section of German public opinion that there are circumstances in which a private citizen is justified in enforcing his claims upon the State by means of a bomb . <P> The public career of Heinrich Langkopf began in Berlin last week , when , with a stout tin box under his arm , he called at the office of Privy Councilor Hugo Bach . Arriving early , he was kept waiting until a few minutes after noon . Ushered in at last by a page who discreetly retired , he approached the desk of Privy Councilor Bach , placed the tin box upon it , and spoke crisply : " I have here 15 pounds of high explosives . Unless you are willing to give me 112,000 marks , in cash , for reasons which I shall explain , this building will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuse and I shall set off the bomb the moment my request is refused . " <P> Privy Councilor Bach , with cool presence of mind , reached for and lit a cigaret . Leaning back in his swivel chair , he puffed a moment , then quietly remarked , " I will hear your explanation . " <P> Since both men are solid , rational Teutons , there ensued argument and negotiation which continued for one hour , two , three , three and a half . Herr Langkopf , without ever removing his finger from the detonator of his bomb , stated passionately a case which was soon to rouse the sympathy of almost the entire German press . <P> Finally Dr. Bach broke the deadlock by appearing to yield . He would order the golden marks paid , if Herr Langkopf would accompany him to the Cashier 's office . As they rose , the nervous finger of Herr Langkopf accidentally depressed the detonator , but all that ensued was a slight " ping . " Dr. Bach , seeing his chance , dashed for his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb which still failed to explode . An instant later strong hands collared him . <P> Once in jail , Heinrich Langkopf made his great apologia on the basis of the following facts : 1 ) In 1914 he was established in German East Africa as a planter ; 2 ) Immediately upon the declaration of War , he enlisted , fought , lived to see his whole property confiscated by the Allies ; 3 ) For the past eight years he has been in Berlin with his wife and child , seeking the indemnity which is due him from the German War Indemnification Office , of which Privy Councilor Hugo Bach is chairman ; 4 ) Due to bureaucratic delays , he has received only 9,000 marks , although promised 41,000 ; 5 ) Last week , unable to get work , and with his wife and child ill from undernourishment , he tried the bomb . <P> When these details were known German editorial writers passionately cast the entire blame upon the Allies &; The Dawes Plan . Had not the Fatherland been unjustly oppressed , they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation , would not have been driven to the last extremity .
