The anticipations for this year 's National Automobile Show ( in Manhattan ) were , a week or so ago , for a very usual exhibit . Barring minor gossip concerning changes in models and the likelihood of future prices , there was no news . Then suddenly a leading make of quality cars announced price reductions on closed cars ranging from $640 to $840 which would bring the prices of these models down to a level with those for open vehicles . Another make of quality cars adopted a similar policy . <P> The result has been to put car exhibitors in an unhappy frame of mind . They have for years had only to demonstrate the superior quality of their product to sell it . Now they are expected to have a quality product and to sell it cheap . The business , after being a runaway affair , has now become grimly competitive . Big sales mean quantity output , lower costs and a chance for a profit . Small sales mean high unit costs and either no profit or a loss in operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> A second lesson derived from this latest explosion in the automobile world is the growing demand for closed cars and the effort of manufacturers to get them into quantity production . If this can be done , unit costs in a closed car can be kept even with an open model , despite the greater material and workmanship called for by the former . Enthusiasts now prophesy that in a few years open cars will be built only on special order-as closed cars were when the motor industry first started .
