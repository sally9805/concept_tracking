Bulgaria 's War-time Prime Minister , Vasil Radoslavoff , has spent the past eleven years in exile , with his son-in-law 's spare bedroom at Berlin as his base . Last week Exile Radoslavoff , who fled his country when Tsar Ferdinand was forced to abdicate the Bulgarian throne in 1918 , was unofficially told that he might return to Bulgaria . The Bulgarian Sobranye ( Assembly ) had passed the third reading of a bill pardoning those ministers who were condemned to life imprisonment by the government of Alexander Stamboulisky , spectacular peasant , in 1922 . <P> Chief reason for the flight of Vasil Radoslavoff was his connection with fox-bearded German Tsar Ferdinand . In 1923 , Peasant-Prime Minister Stamboulisky was overthrown by a coup d ' tat and assassinated while trying to escape . Disgust with Stamboulisky brought renewed respect for Radoslavoff . People forgot that he had been prosecuted for corrupt practices before the War . <P> It was Prime Minister Radoslavoff , always pro-German , who took Bulgaria into the War on the German side when most Bulgarians were in favor of neutrality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who refused ( he now says ) to declare war on the U. S. against the earnest entreaties of temperamental General von Ludendorff . <P> " That attitude paid well , " chuckled Dr. Radoslavoff last week . " When the victorious Balkan States wanted to divide Bulgaria among themselves at the Neuilly Peace Conference it was the United States who protested and saved Bulgaria . " <P> He told what he would do next : <P> " My opponents in Bulgaria have made all kinds of false accusations , such as that I intended to put back the Tsar Ferdinand on the throne . That was not true , because Ferdinand is always able to return to Bulgaria . He vacated the throne voluntarily and was not expelled from the country . <P> " I am for a democratic form of government , or rather for the constitutional monarchy as it exists at present under King Boris , but I am opposed to any dictatorship from Left or Right . When I return I shall re-enter political life as a member of the National Liberal Party . " <P> Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Liaptcheff had foiled assassins when he returned to Sofia last week , by train instead of automobile , from ceremonies at Kritschin . Detective Phileon Alexandroff , who followed with the Prime Minister 's car , drove into a hail of rifle bullets near Philippopolis , was killed .
