It is now some years since Ferruccio Benvenuto Busoni , Italian master-pianist and modernist , startled the musical intelligenzia by advocating an entirely new musical scale . It was to be composed of quarter-tones , the pitch of each two adjacent tones being only half of what it is on a piano . It was then already noted that music played on a quarter-tone piano would only sound " out of tune " - and that this would be no novelty at all . Quarter-tone effects , it was added , were achieved by every Hawaiian guitar-player when he executed that lugubrious wailing slide along his seductively twanging strings . <P> Since then , futuristic string-quartet composers have used quarter-tones , and really achieved genuine new effects with them . Expert violinists can manage them , with a little practice ( beginners without any practice at all ) . At last , however , a quarter-tone piano keyboard has been invented , by one Alois Haba , a young Czech pupil of the daring Franz Schreker . His instrument was the chief exhibit at the International Music Festival held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riot of modernistic delicacies . Arnold Schpnberg , Florent Schmitt , Sergei Prokofiev , Ernest Bloch , Arthur Honegger were all well represented by new works , guaranteed to irritate unaccustomed ears . A new composer of unquestioned merit was also brought to light oh this occasion . He is Alexander von Zemlinsky , an Austro-Czecho-Slovakian . His Third , or " Lyric " , Symphony was performed ; its seven long movements are all built around a single leading motif : the theme of " a man bent on conquest and adventure , to whom love is but an episode in a life of combat and struggle . " Zemlinsky used a baritone voice and many kettledrums to bring home with emphasis his dominant idea .
