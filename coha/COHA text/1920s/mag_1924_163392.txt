Edna Ferber <P> Edna Ferber 's So Big is an unusually fine novel . A portrait of a boy and his mother , with a finely sketched background of Chicago , and a fundamental theme which shows the development of various attitudes toward the beauty of life-it stands out as unforgettable . <P> Miss Ferber is at once finely intuitive and keenly observant . She is that most unusual person , the interpretative reporter ; for she can not only see the events which are tramping about her ; she knows well the souls of events . She is eager , tender , possessed of a magnificent tolerance , in spite of a firm ethical creed-and her artistic creed is similar ; for , while she might permit herself to experiment , she never gropes , is never sloppy in her style . <P> Her humility and her positive terror that she will not do good work , are unusual in an author of such standing . Her sister tells me that while she is at work on a story she is often miserable for fear she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of her ability , the effect she wants . She is constantly studying life . She has friends whose viewpoints greatly vary , yet I am sure that she is sympathetic with all of them , and with perfect sincerity . She is dramatic , yet simple , and she does not overdramatize events . <P> At present Miss Ferber is living in Manhattan and working on a play with George Kaufman . She has taken a fairly long lease on an apartment which overlooks Central Park . There she lives with her mother , a genial , happy person who takes much delight in entertaining Miss Ferber 's friends . <P> Miss Ferber has lived most of her life in Michigan , Wisconsin and Illinois . She began her career as a reporter at the age of 17 . She made her great reputation as a short story writer . <P> Apprenticeship to the sort of short story Miss Ferber has written-often slightly plotted , delicate character sketches in which the drama is of emotions rather than events-is splendid training for the writing of a novel . Compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Hurst 's book has passages of genius . Analyzed , however , it is a collection of sketches around a single theme . So Big , however , is in no sense a book written by an author wedded to short story technique . It is a fine novel . It moves steadily through its technical parts and its emotion value is strong . J.
