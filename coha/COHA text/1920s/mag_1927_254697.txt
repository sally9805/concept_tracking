Seventy-five women asked the Chicago city council last week to pass an ordinance requiring women to wear more underwear , as a matter of public health , when they try on dresses in the city stores . Councilmen were astounded , promised to investigate , learned that many a woman now wears under her dress only a pair of bloomers and a brassiere . The waist line , as well as the neck and arms , is bare .
