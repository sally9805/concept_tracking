W.D . Howells Secreted Literature , Like Ivory or Pearl <P> The Man . Some 88 years ago , in Martin 's Ferry , Ohio , there arrived a boy whose Welsh father and Irish-German mother caused him to be called William Dean Howells . The boy played a little , went to school a bit , then learned to sit long hours on a high stool in a printer 's shop setting type . When he could , he went home and sat alone " in a windowed nook under the stairs , " tirelessly schooling himself in literature , languages , composition . He loved his family with a deep reserve ; he guarded his thoughts ; he pursued youth 's ideal of beauty . <P> He became a reporter in Columbus and a realist . His later reading and travels embraced Europe widely . He edited The Atlantic Monthly . He was an intimate of Longfellow , Whittier , Hawthorne , Emerson , Holmes . He became an editor of Harper 's , an honorary Doctor of Literature four times over ( including a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American letters . " In 1920 , full of years and honor , William Dean Howells died at his Manhattan home . <P> While still in his thirties , this man began a " quiet outpour , or rather efflux " of novels and tales that was scarcely slackened by the masses of miscellaneous writing that he did . " The deposition of literature in his case was unceasing because it was organic ; he secreted it like ivory or pearl . " <P> This Book What of Howells ' cast of mind , the nature of his work ? Others having collated the external revelations of Howells ; a patient , discriminating scholar has now set to work upon the vast cumulus of Howells ' literary secretions , as would a paleontologist upon the ponderous remains of a dinosaur . He spreads them out , classifies them ; then pores , probes , weighs , analyzes , to educe both a composite picture of the author and a meticulous evaluation of the cumulus itself . <P> Nature : In appearance , Mr. Howells was chubbily Lloyd Georgian ; carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the autobiographical works , Mr. Firkins finds that he was athletic only in boyhood , a nonsmoker , fearful of dogs yet fond of them , as fond of birds as Spencer and Stevenson , partial to public spectacles , keen of nose , " respectful " toward dress ; that " he observed the habit while he deplored the custom " of giving tips ; that his visits to churches " commonly involved the Baedeker rather than the Prayerbook . . . . He distrusted Eddyism Christian Science . . . recoiled from what seemed to him tasteless and tawdry in the external fashions of the Salvation Army in England . . . " Philosophically , Mr. Howells was a benevolent realist ; economically , a Utopian . His humor was courtly ; and though others have thought that it sometimes trailed off into tenuous banality , Mr. Firkins will not admit a fault here . He calls it " irony of the salon . " The Howells whimsy was multiform and pervasive , given to grotesque impersonations and rollicking image-jugglery.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
