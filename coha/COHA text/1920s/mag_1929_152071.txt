Representatives of every nation of any consequence , including the U. S. and Soviet Russia , met in Geneva last fortnight to take up the work of the League of Nations Preparatory Disarmament Commission where it was left last year ( TIME , April 2 , 1928 ) . Chairman was a Dutchman , gruff , able , patient Jonkheer J. Loudon . Presently the delegates were asked to express individually their approval or disapproval of the following general principles : 1 ) Appreciable reduction by all nations of their existing armaments ; 2 ) Acceptance by each nation in proportion to its size of a proportional degree of disarmament ; 3 ) Adoption of a mathematical formula for determining the proportion . <P> In specific terms the application of these general principles would mean that the Great Powers , being proportionately larger than the Minor Nations , would make deeper slashes in their armaments . The U. S. , Great Britain , Russia , France , Italy , Japan , for example , might cut their armaments in half . Such lesser lands as Chile , Siam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a given category such as " Great Powers " would reduce their armaments by the same fraction . The strengths of the Powers relative to each other would then be exactly the same as before the scrapping took place . The advantage to the taxpayers concerned would lie in saving the operating and replacement cost of the scrapped ships . <P> Eighteen months have passed since virtually every Government in the world received officially a copy of the plan outlined above . However , when the delegates were asked their opinions , last week , they nearly all sat silent . After a considerable pause General Alberto de Marinis , representing Signer Benito Mussolini , expressed approval for the first point of the plan only . " We stand ready to reduce our armaments , " he said , " to any figure , even the lowest , provided all other nations do the same . " <P> Ambassador Hugh Simons Gibson , representing President Herbert Clark Hoover , smiled and said nothing . Baron Cushendun of Great Britain frowned in silence . Outside the Commission room they both expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for publication . " The plan was not worthy of criticism or consideration , they indicated , because they believed it had been " offered in bad faith . " They did not offer any alternative plan , perhaps because the Commission long ago became almost inextricably entangled in its so-called Draft Convention for a Disarmament Conference ( TIME , April 4 , 1927 ) . <P> The tainted and unmentionable plan was and is , of course , the one presented by Comrade Maxim Maximovitch Litvinov , Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union . When he first went to Geneva ( TIME , Dec. 5 , 1927 ) he said that Soviet Russia was ready to completely disarm within one year , if all other nations would do likewise . Since then , plump , indefatigable Comrade Litvinov , who looks like a squirrel with a nut in either cheek , has been slowly learning that whatever plan he may offer will be pigeonholed , at least for some time to come .               @ @ @ @ @ @
