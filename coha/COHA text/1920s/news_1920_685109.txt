txt What will be the effect of the decision refusing dis- solution of the Steel Corporation , on the strikingly similar suit to dissolve American Can Co. ? United States vs . Amertan Can Co. is in the October , 1919 , or present term calendar of the Supreme Court , but not yet set down for argument . If argued , on what grounds will it be differentiated front the Steel suit in the discussion ? On what grounds of policy or equity will this industry be destroyed , or reallocation of its assets among constituents long since dead , now decreed judicially possible ? Ought American Can Co. be dissolved ? This is- the only question in the pending appeal of the Government from a decree entered August 17 , 1916 , refusing dissolu- , Lion in the suit brought by it against the company in the United States District Court for Maryland . As in two other " anti-trust " cases , the bill of complaint was not dismissed but jurisdiction retained for future judicial action , should some future state of facts call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclaimed by the Court . The development of the proceeding covered nearly three years . It grew into - a record of 8,700 pages of testimony of 862 witnesses , with 1,500 exhibits beside . But by retaining jurisdiction whatever dormant equities lay in the inanimate past of twenty years ago were thus inexpensively preserved . While there is economy of both cost and convenience , it may well be that when the obsolete Sherman law shall have fallen apart from sheer old age a new legislative policy may provide more definite procedure than is found in somewhat vague rules of chancery practice . American Can Co. was organized in 1901 , eleven . years after the Sherman act , and twelve years before the Government invoked its constrictive provisions . American Tin Plate Co. , seven other corporations and numerous individuals were made co-defendants . The suit haS been dismissed as to a number of these . The company , . with a stock capitalization of $82,466,600 , half common and half preferred , acquired 95 plants , covering 90% of the American can output then manufacthred for sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 3,000 miles of Chicago for fifteen years . Two-thirds of the plants purchased were closed . It was held by the lower court , ( Judge Rose ) , in two judicial labor-saving opinions ( 230 Fed . Rep. 859 , and 234 Fed . Rep. , 1019 ) , that the American Can Co. ought not be dissolved on the case as made out . But this was without prejudice to the renewal of the . application " if it be made hereafter to appear from other facts subsequent to the petition that the size and power of the defericint brought about as they originally were , are being used -- to the injury of the public , or whenever such size and power without being intentionally so used , have given to the defendant a dominance or control over the industry or some portion of it so created which make dissolution or other restraining decree of the court expedient .

Its competitors now sell a third of the man-e. - factured output , another third is made by the consumers . The defendant makes and sell the remaining third of the can output of the country . Its original units being all now defunct , return to its original component parts would bo impossible . It was ruled that the fact that the company 's size and power do not restrict its operations as they would if it were smaller or weaker , does not justify its dissolution .

The decision is clear that the mere size and power of the Can Company do not alone call for relief . The potential capacity for harm is more than offset by the greater potential force of economic conditions as they exist . By 1900 the country had outgrown the Sherman law . By 1916 it had outgrown the can-making industry of 1900 .
