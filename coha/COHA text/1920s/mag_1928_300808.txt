THE ISLAND OF CAPTAIN SPARROW-S . Fowler Wright-Cosmopolitan ( $2.00 ) . Young Foyle is cast upon an imaginary mid-Pacific island-not to found the new social order , but to encounter thrilling adventures among relics of four races : satyrs who mate with human beings , ruka-birds of uncanny intelligence , high-minded followers of the Priest of Gir , and the low-born descendants of a pirate crew . Satyr hunts , cannibalistic orgies , hair-raising escapes are in order . But Author Wright will rather be remembered for the swift ingenuity of his unique Deluge .
