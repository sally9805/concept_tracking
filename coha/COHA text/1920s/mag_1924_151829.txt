Edward Winterborne , pastor of the Faith Tabernacle of Lebanon , Pa. , is leader of a most curious and obstinate flock . Diphtheria is ravaging his congregation . Seven have died . Fifty others are seriously ill . And yet a Mrs. Roth , whose husband and two children died last week , announced with infinite faith : ' I would rather have my children and myself dead and on our way to Heaven than to be saved by medicine and go to <P> Hell ! " In response to an edict of The Faith Tabernacle , the entire sect has refused the services of local physicians ; medical science is barred from the homes of all its members . The local health authorities have quarantined both the Tabernacle itself ( a $60,000 brick structure ) , and the homes of nine families . Legal action has been started on the count that they disobeyed the State law in not having their children vaccinated before school age . Alderman Miller : " I am sorry that I can merely hold Winterborne for court on the State charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calling of physicians as nothing short of murder ! "
