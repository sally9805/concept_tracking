In a big building between the studios of Famous Players and R-K-0 in Hollywood a man was running a spool of film through a polishing machine . Something went wrong with the machine . A spark flew from a whirling gear and set the film on fire . A few seconds later every film in the room was on fire . Burning gas exploded and blew out the door , the flame rushed into other rooms . People staggered out of blazing doorways . Some were taken away in ambulances . One man died of his burns . All day the building-a laboratory of Consolidated Film Industries-burned like a pine torch while a crowd watched and fire-engines drenched the studios on each side of it with water . When the fire was over no one for a while could open the red-hot doors of the vaults in which " master " films were stored . <P> Few Hollywood producing companies print or develop their own films . They have such work done by the Consolidated laboratory , biggest company of its kind in the U. S. In bottle-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rolls of celluloid are kept like vintages . Some of those in the burned building were unreduplicable parts of pictures now in production-the whole negative of Jazz Heaven , two days work on Dance Hall , the complete negative of The Vagabond Lover ( starring girl-crazing Rudy Vallee ) and Night Parade . Every existing negative of Douglas Fairbanks ' and Mary Pickford 's The Taming of the Shrew was rumored to have been destroyed . Then somebody found they had been taken out just before the fire . About $2,000,000 worth of prints made from the stored negatives were burned up , but that was all . Assured that burning cinema film breeds no such dreadful gases as X-ray negatives did in the Cleveland Clinic last spring ( TIME , May 27 ) , searchers opened the hot door , entered the vaults , found the vintages of romance , adventure and claptrap , safe on their racks .
