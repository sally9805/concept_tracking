The clangor of Judgment Day 's last trumpet dies away in the remotest pockets of space , and time comes to an end like a frayed ribbon . In the nave of creation the diaphanous amphitheatre is already building for the trial of all flesh . Several miles below the surface of the North Atlantic , the spirits of the drowned rise through the water like bubbles in a neglected wineglass . A WOMAN ( To the gray weeds of whose soul still cling the vestiges of color , some stained purples and some wasted reds ) At last I could struggle no longer . My head and lungs were under intense discomfort by reason of the water with which they were filled . I said to myself : " Only think , Gertruda , you have actually arrived at the moment of death ! " Even then I was unwilling to believe it , though my lungs were on the point of bursting . One is never really able to believe that one will die . It is especially difficult for sovereigns who seldom , if ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Gertruda XXII , Empress of Newfoundland from 2638 to 2698 ? A STOUT LITTLE MAN Your Imperial Highness 's experience is much like mine . I lived about five hundred years before Your Imperial Highness . I had always dreaded the moment of extinction , yet mine was less painful than a headache . A WOMAN We know now that the real pain comes to us in the ages that have passed since then . Have you too been swinging in mid-ocean , tangled in a cocoon of seaweed , slowly liberating your mind from the prides and prejudices and trivialities of a lifetime ? That is what is painful . p. 3 A STOUT LITTLE MAN I was a Jew and very proud of my race . Living under what I took to be the aspersions of my neighbors I had nourished the arrogant delusion that I was notable . It has taken me five hundred years of painful reflection to disembarrass myself of this notion . I was a theatrical producer , and thought myself important to my time  --  wise , witty and kindly . Each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of losing a limb . Now I am reconciled to the fact that I am naked , a fool , a child . A WOMAN In my life I believed fiercely that everything of which I said MY had some peculiar excellence . It was impossible to imagine a citizen proud of any country save Newfoundland , or a woman vain of any hair save the golden . I had a passion for genealogies and antiquities , and felt that such things merely looked forward to myself . Now these many years I have been wrapped in barnacles , divorcing my soul from all that it once loved . Even my love for my son and my son 's love for me have vanished through sheer inconsequence . All this is the second death , and the one to be dreaded . I was afraid that when I had shed away my royalty and my beauty and my administrative talent and my pure descent and my astonishing memory for names  --  I was afraid that there would be nothing left . But , fortunately , under-neath all this litter I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare we say the Name ?  --  But what was yours ? p. 4 A STOUT LITTLE MAN Horatio Nissem . A WOMAN Speak to that man who is rising through the water beside you . A STOUT LITTLE MAN Who are you , and what particular follies have you laid aside ? A TALL THIN DREAMY MAN I was a priest of the gospel and a terrible time I have had taking leave of my sins . I tremble to think how but a few moments ago I still retained a longing for stupidities . Yes , sir , for the planets . I felt sure that they had personalities , and I looked forward after my death to hearing their songs . Now I know that sun and moon and stars have fallen like dust into the lap of their maker . I told myself , also , that after death I should sit through eternity overhearing the conversation of Coleridge and Augustine and Our Lord  --  there I should embrace my loved ones and my enemies ; there I should hear vindicated before the devils the great doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been delivered from these follies . As I swayed in the meteoric slime I begged God to punish me for certain sins of my youth , moments I well remembered of rage and pride and shame . But these seemed of no importance to him : he seemed rather to be erasing from my mind the notion that my sins were of any consequence . I see now that even the idea that I was capable of sinning was a self-flattery and an impertinence . My name was Father Cosroe : now my name is Worm . p. 5 A WOMAN We still cling obstinately to our identity , as though there were something valuable in it . This very moment I feel relics of pleasure in the fact that I am myself and no one else . Yet in a moment , if there is a moment , we shall all be reduced to our quintessential matter , and you , Mr. Nissem , will be exactly indistinguishable from me . God Himself will not be able to tell the Empress of Newfoundland from the Reverend Doctor Cosroe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am afraid . I refuse to give myself up . A WOMAN Do not cry out , fool . You have awakened all my rebellious nature . O God , do not take away my identity ! I do not ask for my title or my features ; do not take away my myself ! A STOUT LITTLE MAN Do you hear ? I refuse to give myself up . O God , let me not be mistaken for a Gentile . A TALL THIN DREAMY MAN Your screaming has aroused my madness . Let me keep my particular mind , O God , my own curious mind , with all I have put into it ! ( The three panic-stricken souls reach the surface of the sea . The extensive business of Domesday is over in a twinkling , and the souls divested of all identification have tumbled , like falling stars , into the blaze of unicity . Soon nothing exists in space but the great unwinking eye , meditating a new creation. )                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
