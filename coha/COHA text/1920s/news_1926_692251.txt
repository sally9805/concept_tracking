txt Mr. HYLIN 'S departure has removed two obstacles to new subways for the city . These obstacles were Mr. HYLAN himself and the Republicans at Albany , to whom the ex-Mayor was a gift from Heaven . The majority at Albany was free to oppose to its heart 's content so long as opposition was against a Subway policy that was no policy . at all , but a conglomerate of demagogic battle cries ind obstructionist tactics . But Republican legislators have realized the change that has come with the advent of Mayor WALKER . He has no malefic " Interests " to club over the head in the defense of the " People . " He admits that before subways can be operated they must be built ; that the building process is a matter of years ; and that while subways are building we may develop a set of clarified ideas on the final problem of operation . This is a common-sense position which the Republicans , if only for partisan reasons , dare not oppose . A bond issue is itself not a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of two years . To be sure , with the bonds made certain it would be possible for the city to anticipate part of the proceeds by drawing on its present resources , stinting itself in other respects in order to set subway digging going . On the other hand , it is certain that the proposed bond issue will not cover the entire cost of the city 's trait-. sit needs . The lifted tax limit , if availed of for subways , will mean curtailment on schools and other municipal improvements . Yet here , too , the best way of learning is by doing . Mayor WALKER has departed from the Hylan procedure by inviting the Transit Commissioners to confer and advise instead of calling them crooks and bidding them be silent . With the disappearance of bluster and muddle front the City Hall it becomes possible to talk sense about new subways and how to pay for them . There is just one way in which to pay for subways and just one In which they are paid for ; and that is by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumerates six ways to secure money for subway building : increased realty assessments and strict enforcement of the personal property tax , a special assessment on real property benefited by new transit , appropriations from current taxation , &c.; They resolve themselves into one thing  --  taxation , which is ultimately passed on to every one in the city . The interest on a bond issue will come from the rentpayers of the city . Special assessments on new transit territory will be paid by the rentpayers . The city 's present deficits are paid by the rentpayers . Ultimately it is not a question of who pays fir the legitimate costs of transportation ; on that there can be no difference of opinion . It is a question of bookkeeping . It is truer still a question of whether the citizen shall pay for transportation out of his left-hand pocket or his right-hand pocket . Suppose Mt . HyLAN 's evil dream comes to pass , and the city is converted to an eight-cent fare . A family with two wage . earners daily using the subways will pay $36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway costs on new transit territory , and Is there any doubt that the ' family rent in the new territory will contribute an extra $3 a month to pay for the special assessment ? The final arithmetic works out to the same answer in evert case . Those who use the subways will pay for them , directly or Indirectly . The essential point Is to provide the people with subways to pay for .
