Unitarian Charles F. Potter 's contribution to the headlines last week was a proposal for an All-American Bible wherein American heroes and heroines would be substituted for Jewish , and wherein the writings of great Americans would become canonized . Thus for Jesus , substitute Lincoln ; for Deborah ( prophetess and campaigner against social wrongs ) , substitute Jane Addams ; for Isaiah , Tom Paine or Thomas Jefferson ; for the Psalms , our native verse . " If we are to have the Bible taught in our American schools , let it be the American Bible ! " This proposal became at once the butt of many a merry jest . <P> When John Roach Straton , pastor of Calvary Baptist Church , Manhattan , learned that Dr. Potter was planning to radio-broadcast his principles he cried : " If that fellow Potter keeps on I 'll have to get out a warrant for his arrest on a charge of grand larceny . He cribbed my idea of a Christian hotel and , like young Lochinvar , ran boldly away with it before we even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the project . Now he has just dodged into the limelight with the idea of broadcasting the Bible . We originated this at Calvary Church some months back . Potter is a pilferer ! "
