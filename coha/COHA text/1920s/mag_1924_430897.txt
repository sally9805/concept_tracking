PATRICK HENRY , our eloquent forefather , in common with most orators , not only of the then , but also of the now , was wont to enunciate , in all seriousness , platitudes whose obvious bathos was equalled only by their truth . " I know of no way of judging the future ? is but by the past s like saying with a perfectly straight face , " Water is wet . " Yet despite the evident verity of the former , how few of our million of gentle optimists will even seriously consider it , to say nothing of believing it ? The magazines scintillate with articles intending to show that the colleges are not giving the students what the students want . What the students want ! Many writers have made wild guesses on this head . Now I wish to advance a platitude fully as banal from its utter obviousness as this memorable epigram of Patrick Henry 's , and just as little accepted . I know of no better way to find out what the American college student wants than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide whether or not we are giving him what he wants and whether what he wants is worth giving him at all . This is fundamental and should precede any discussion as to curriculum and methods of instruction . That all is not well with our colleges , anyone who has anything at all to do with them will readily admit . In those few institutions where the generally chronic malady of intellectual atrophy is only spasmodic , one finds new committees being created to devise new courses of study , to suggest new methods of conducting classes , to investigate the feasibility of the tutorial system , and so on ; frequent indignation meetings of the faculty to discuss the distressing problem of undergraduate indifference  | to things intellectual ; protests from the antique members that if we will only keep quiet and let well enough alone , everything will come out right , according to God 's will , in the end ; and frantic cabals of the young instructors in which we learn that it 's all a question of faculty salaries . But these always come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the logic by which this touching conclusion is reached . A few nights ago I heard an erudite professor reason : " The difficulty is simple ; and I am confident that our students ' distaste for intellectual interests can easily be remedied . I have found we accomplish nothing by class discussions . If you let one empty-headed student argue a point with another emptyheaded student , you get nowhere . What we need is a return to the lecture method . I predict we shall return to it . I am very hopeful . " In other words , though two empty-headed students , though a whole class of empty-headed students , give the professor no intelligent answers , they do give him an optimism , naive and quite touching . I am in hearty sympathy with a searching scrutiny of our courses and our methods of teaching , but I repeat these are auxiliary , not basic in our problem . If I remember rightly , it was Carlyle who said the true university is a collection of books . I myself believe that the real value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required courses than in his voluntary reading . And our students do n't read . The reasons they do n't read are not because we do n't teach them properly ; the reasons are more fundamental than this . If an American college educates its students today , it is absolutely in defiance of the students themselves . This is the main trouble with our colleges . The students go to college for everything but what the college exists to give them , ? an education . Our problem is fundamentally a problem of student attitude . During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries American college students were recruited mainly from the professional class . They came from homes which , albeit often in the throttling clutch of Puritanism , still possessed some slight degree of culture and a wholesome respect for abstract knowledge . In our own day , however , all that is changed ; the colleges have increased  | in both number and size almost beyond comprehension . This increase has not in proportion been an increase of students from the professional class , but from the mercantile class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of people , you know , but not in the slightest degree cultured . Because a family owns a Victrola , and buys the record , " Sextette from Lucia , " at the invitation of an advertisement , does not mean that the family understands music . It generally means that you have one more case of " crowd-mindedness . " It means that the man next door probably has the same record too , and probably appreciates it just as little . The colleges today are deluged with students to whom real culture , a pleasure in knowledge for its own sake , is as foreign as the aesthetic sense to a Methodist clergyman . I know of many cases in which families have positively resented an instructor 's stimulating intellectual interests and appreciation of books in their sons . They did n't send the boy to college to read Balzac , or George Moore . They did not know such authors existed . They sent their boy to college because all the other families in their golf club were also sending their sons to college . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college have been entirely wasted , a student catches on to the idea of education , and by commencement has learned what any sophomore should know . It is because of these rare cases that the faces of gentle college professors sometimes beam with a certain fatuous brightness . But these cases are few . And in any event this boy 's first two years have netted him nothing . In the last twelve years I have studied in five American universities and have taught in three . I have always asked students why they were there . Several times I have required them to write themes of this subject . Their answers have always been delightfully ingenuous and , I believe , true . With a few inevitable exceptions , students come to college today for four reasons , no one of which has the least bearing on the acquisition of a liberal education . The students tell me they go to college to make friends , to enjoy the social advantages a college affords ( such , for example , as dancing ) , to take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist them to make more money in busi- ness when they get out . In other words , these young men regard college as a glorified combination of country club and vocational school . This is what they want . Now , although most of the state universities have made frantic , conscious efforts to satisfy this demand , to offer courses in the preparation of a duck for the oven or a third rate story for the silver screen , a few of the old , endowed colleges in the east , still cling pathetically to the illusion that they exist for the purpose of giving their students a liberal education , and the faculties of these last run hither and thither , pass recommendations , shriek and beat the air , because for the first two years they experience difficulty in thrusting upon their students exactly what , of all things , the students do not want . And there is something to be said for the student point of view . If a student goes to college with the idea that the faculty is primarily interested in encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York for a series of intercollegiate dances at the Ritz , to wear himself out every afternoon on the gridiron or track so that he ca n't study in the evening , to teach him a sure-fire method of selling life insurance , he may well be indignant when he discovers that none of these things is the main concern of the official life of the institution to which he has been lured , but that the main concern is with something absolutely different , with something of which even the very existence is a shock to him , with the affording him the opportunity of a liberal education . Of the idea that a man can wish to know things merely for the pleasure of making his own life-experience and that of others richer , the college freshman has never even heard . Of the idea that to know the truth and beauty in the world is pleasant in itself and may possibly be made profitable in effecting a balance between the conflicting forces of life to the greater happiness of us all , he has not even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no immediate relation to the particular branch of commerce they expect to enter seems to him perfect folly . This is the average American undergraduate of today . Like most healthy young men , he is a good fellow . But the only respect in which he is differentiated from his less fortunate brother who wears overalls and nails up packing cases in a factory , is by  | the fact that he has more money , or has come from an environment in which money is relatively more plentiful . In intellectual attitude he is entirely the same , and in manners and morals not so different as one might suppose . The reasons why the student goes to college with the discouragingly indifferent attitude toward the best thing the college can offer him are few and almost self-evident . I have mentioned already the character of the home from which he comes , its utter lack of culture . Then the college alumni are largely at fault . Though a few alumni , in contrast to the great majority who are interested only in athletics and the preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshmen , ? are genuinely solicitous for the preservation of the intellectual life of their college , they do not , when encouraging prospective students to go there , ever stress this aspect . Scholarship does not , it is true , furnish such enlivening matter for conversation as the story of how a certain gentleman , now a supreme court justice , filled the chapel organ with alarm clocks , or how the old team , entirely because of a spirit peculiar to that particular institution of higher education , were able to score three touchdowns against the traditional rival in the last eight minutes of play . If a sub-freshman does n't learn from his parents that a college exists for the purpose of educating him liberally , he seldom learns it from an alumnus . And finally , the colleges themselves are largely at fault . They make comparatively little effort to place their educational purposes and activities before the public from which their students come . The presses groan under stories of track , baseball , football achievements , of million-dollar stadiums , of dramatics , dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by articles explaining the new plan for student selection of major courses , of the reorganization of these courses and why , of change in teaching methods , and of other infinite activities which make up the serious side of college life . And it is not because the public wo n't read such material . It is not because newspapers refuse to print it . It is because the public is not clamoring for it , because , for this reason , the newspapers are not spending money to secure it , and because the colleges , still in a sort of nineteenth century unawareness to the changes of this century , do not take the trouble to organize  | adequate publicity bureaus to take care of their advertising . The anti-saloon league issues propaganda , the breweries issue propaganda , the churches issue propaganda , all organizations except the colleges issue propaganda . The colleges think that because they get more students than they can handle they need not advertise their purposes . But there are not nearly enough students who go to college for what the colleges exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educate the public to appreciate the purposes of education . This might result in the applications for admission decreasing to a number approaching that which the colleges are actually equipped to handle . This certainly would be some gain . At any rate , the colleges would not be receiving students under false pretenses , as they are now , and students would have a more sensible conception of what college really is.  |
