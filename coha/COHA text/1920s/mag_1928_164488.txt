Over mountains , down dales , through spreading forests and along hard rutty roads trudged hundreds of Rumanian peasants and then thousands , last week , to the old Transylvania walled town of Alba Julia . The peasants were responding to the pied piping of their great political champion , Dr. Juliu Maniu , not long since a peasant himself . They know , for he has told them , that the aristocratic cabinet at Bucharest derives its power from a parliament elected by corruption and police : bullying of the voters . Therefore the trudgers were converging upon Alba Julia to take a great oath and hurl a potent warning at the Prime Minister of Rumania ; massive , aristocratic , inflexible Vintila Bratiano , whose great political family has dominated Rumania for two decades . <P> When 200,000 peasants finally streamed into small Alba Julia , Pied Piper Juliu Maniu told them to make a hearty supper upon food which they had brought , said that although the hotels were full the streets were theirs to sleep upon , and finally instructed that all should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants ate , slept , rose and assembled under the supervision of their priests to take the following great pious oath : " We swear to the great and good God to fight a righteous fight against the Government which is a plague to the country and which was nominated by a decree wrung from King Ferdinand on his deathbed . We swear that a new Rumania shall be created which shall stand for freedom and justice to all of Rumania 's brave sons . " <P> Having sworn , the caucus approved a resolution calling upon the regency-which reigns for six-year-old King Mihai-to dismiss Aristocrat Vintila Bratiano and call to the Prime Ministry onetime Peasant Juliu Maniu . <P> Much to the disgust of foreign observers , the immediate intentions of Pied Piper Maniu seemed to have been realized at this point . He had not urged his docile horde to do anything . He dared not , because upon the rooftops of Alba Julia were planted machine guns , and quietly massed at strategic points were well-paid troops apparently loyal to the Bratiano regime . In these circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alba Julia and himself sped to Bucharest where he presented their resolution to the Regency. * The regents refused to request Premier Vintila Bratiano 's resignation , but agreed to permit the peasants a demonstration . So next day , preceded and followed by a detachment of Rumanian cavalrymen and shaded fitfully by esquadrilles of bombing planes , 5,000 peasants began a decorous parade from Alba Julia to Bucharest . <P> Anxiously watching the strange Rumanian drama of last week from Godstone , near London , King Mihai 's ineffectual father , Prince Carol ( eldest son of Dowager Queen Marie ) , who would be King at this moment had he not chosen to abdicate ( TIME , Jan. n , 1926 ) and live abroad with a titan-haired Jewess , Mme. Magda Lupescu . Carol , who now aspires to regain powers which he too lightly cast away , said last week : " I did n't leave my country for love of Mme. Lupescu . It 's all a lie to say so. + What man would renounce a throne because of a woman ? "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
