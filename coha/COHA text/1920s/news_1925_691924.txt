txt Announcement is made of the appointment of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the coal industry promised by Prime Minister BALDWIN when the coal subsidy was voted . It is within the power of the commission to make any recommendations it sees fit . Its scope will obviously be wider than that of the Court of Inquiry which was in session during the recent coal crisis . In that investigation the- miners refused to participate , and therefore the question of nationalizing the mines did not come up . The subject is not mentioned in the list of proposals which the miners did submit to the court . On the contrary , the idea of nationalization would seem to . be eschewed in the statement that- " the " workmen are not satisfied that the " present organization of production is " not capable of improvement under " the existing ownership of the mines . " The subject , however , is bound to receive attention from the new Royal Commission . Not only in Labor quarters is the August victory of the mine workers regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which recommended Government ownership of the coal industry by , 1922 , is certain to reappear in the discussion . Labor in this country is far from the state of mind of only a few years ago when the unions were engaged in al serious flirtation with the idea of Government ownership . The Plumb Plan for the railroads , of which nothing is heard now , was for a time all the vogue . In the coal industry , nationalization was not so busily discussed ; but the attitude of Labor then was certainly not the attitude revealed a few days ago by the President of the United Mine Workers ' comment on the proposal to put into effect the recommendations of the Federal Coal Commission of two years ago . " Press " accounts reviving discussion of the " nationalization of the coal Industry , " gloats Mr. Lcwis , " do not originate with the mine workers . " And it might be a wicked capitalist and not a Labor leader who rejected the idea of " semiregulation " or who characterized the revival of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Congress to feed upon . If nationalization of the mines is a live issue in England and a dead issue in this country , the reason is not in economics but in politics . One would imagine that so fundamental a change in industrial philosophy and practice would be unaffected by tactical considerations of the moment . But with Government ownership as with other " basic " problems men are too often swayed by the expediencies of the moment . Labor will lean to Government ownership if it sees a good prospect of Labor control over Government . It will shrink from Government ' ownership if the chances are that the other fellow will be the Government . In this country Labor does not feel itself as strong at Washington as it did immediately after the war ; and it will take no chances upon surrendering the right to strike against a Government that owns the mines but that is not under the thumb of Labor . In England , on the other hand , Labor does feel itself to be at least as strong as it was six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to be an issue if it were demonstrated that the Bx-ltish Government during the next ten years will be in non ! Labor hands .
