txt THE TRAPPING OF ANIMALS . The Feelings and Actions of the Beast In the Grip of the Steel . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I have a word in the discussion of the deadly steel trap ? There seem to be two sorts of people in this matter of regarding the feelings and reactions of animals . On one extreme is the Mexican . whom I have seeh mount a horse whose back was so sore that it sank to the ground under the weight of the rider . On the others the sentimentalist , who credits animals with at least a large percentage of all the creditor 's own feelings And reactions . Surely there is some reasonable ground between these extreme viewpoints . Have you ever seen a child . suddenly restrained , almost or quite hysterical , frantically struggling to ; free itself ? This is a very close human comparison to an animal freshly caught in a steel trap  --  excepting possibly some of the cat family . Animals lack imagination , at least in any such degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them live constantly in the shadow of death and only instant reaction to a glimpse of the shadow insures continued existence . When the jaws of a trap close the animal reacts and he brings to the struggle a co-ordination of nerves and muscles of which few humans have the least conception . The result is usually a complete wrecking of everything the jaws of the trap are in contact with  --  even bones may be broken  --  and when the victim reaches the point of starting to cut himself loose he has only numbed material to work on and his greatest discomfort during the cutting process is probably when his teeth grate on the metal which is holding him . Animals are not susceptible to shock in anything like - the degree that human beings are so affected and it is doubtful if they feel great pain . during Use initial struggle wigs the trap any more than the small boy ' suffers much from his missing teeth and his bloody nose while - the fight is still in progress . What comes afterward -- if the trapped animal la not of the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking , the tasty part of the matter ; the slow swelling of the injured part . the thirst  --  all the rest of it  --  but at that the poor brute is spared the pangs which human Imagination would InflictI once escaped , by the narrowest possible margin . the clutch of a sixty-pound bear trap  --  the sort with the long , dovetailing spikes on the jaws . It happened miles from nowhere and no one would even have known where to look for me from that day to this because I had wandered far from a trail which I had been told not to leave . 1 learned later that the trap bad been abandoned by the owner because it was in such a rough part of the mountains that it was not worth going after . From that time on , in those mountains . I carried a pair of clamps which would open such a trap . but at the time I had only a gun , not sufficiently powerful to break the springs with a bullet . and a man in the clutch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the use of levers is concerned  --  even granting that he keeps his head about him . Now , if that trap had n't missed me I do n't believe I would have thrashed about as an animal does . Neither do I beUeve I would have sat calmly down-to await the inevitable as I have seen a big bobcat do with a little marten trap fast to one of his toes , when he could easify have jerked free with ode lunge . Whether a trapped bobcat Is a philosopher or a quitter I leave to the sentimentalist to decide . In either case he shows little imagination , and if I had got caught in the bear trap I am sure that my imagination would have been my heaviest liability . I do n't know whether I would have cut my foot off to free myself  --  had I been able to do this ? but I do know that I could n't have gr. ' anywhere in that country on one foot ? it was difficult enough to get about on two feet . But to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a callous sort of game , but so long as your wife and mine like to wear fur coats , what are you going to do about it ? SHIRLEY C.
