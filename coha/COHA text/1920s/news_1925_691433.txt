txt Pedestrian Traffic . Pedestrian traffic , especially in certain quarters , is congested enough without being made much more so by the fact that about 20 per cent . of the pedestrians , notably those of East European birth or immediate descent , go to the left , causing collisions and unpleasant encounters .
