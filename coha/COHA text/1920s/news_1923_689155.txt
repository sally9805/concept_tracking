We would hardly advise you to sell your Marland Oil around these prices , considering that the stock at 38 is off more than 20 points . It recently sold as low as 3614 indicating that it has gone through most of its reaction . General oil conditions still are not good due to overproduction and while this affects Marland Oils earnings because of fouler prices , company has the saving situation of having large contracts with Standard Oil of N. J. and Atlantic Refining Co . Because of these it has not been . affected by pro-rating of crude oil runs and can run all its crude and more besides to these two organizations .

The Interborough readjustment plan given the system a more elastic financial structure than it formerly tamscssed , in that the Manhattan dividend is hereafter to be paid only when earned .

We do not think Interborough has too much bonded indebtedness , Current earnings of Brooklyn Rapid- Transit system appear to warrant the capital readjustment provided in the reorganization ; they indicate capacity to pay all annual fixed charges , including sinking fund on new 6% bonds , and to meet preferred dividend reqUirements with more than $2 left for common . Earning prospects are better than Interborough 's .

It would be unwise to count on dividends , even on B. M. T. preferred , before the end of 1926 . The reorganization plan provides that sinking fund payments of 2-3 of 1% shall begin on the Rapid Transit Security 6s on January 1 , 1927 , but if dividends he paid on common or preferred before that . date then sinking fund payments shall commence not later than the date of such dividend payment . 0/ future earning prospects B.

It is , of course , impossible to " say with certainty that Manhattan will earn 4% next year . Earnings have shown sonic improvement , although in year ended June 30 last , Interborenigh was unable to pay the full 3% di ? idend rental called for in the readjustment plan .

Are you not mistaken in this ? The ' Protective Committee of the Nassau Electric bonds states that " the holders ' will rereive the bonds theretofore deposited by then , , with all the couDons maturing after July 1 , 1923. or an equal princ.ipa : amount of bonds . issued and Secured by a new mortgage . with equivalent lien on the same properties bearing the same rate of Interest and !

The position of the bonds has been properly stated in our paper several times since promulgation of the plan ; it is , of course , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted by you in your letter to us . These bonds are included among the numerous underlying issues reinstated with interest accumulations paid partly in cash and partly in new B. M. T. preferred stock .
