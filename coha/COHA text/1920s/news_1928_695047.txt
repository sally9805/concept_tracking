txt After being prosecuted in magistrate 's courts throughout the , city for nearly a year on a Complaint of the Rev. John Roach Straton , pastor of Calvary Baptist Church , Charles Lee Smith , President of the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism , was found guilty in Special Sessions yesterday of violating Section 551 of th ePenal law in sending letters and literature to the minister with intent to cause annoyance . Smith 's bail was continued at $500 . He will be sentenced on Monday . He can be fined or sentenced to a term not exceeding three years . In spite of frequent admonitions from Justices Healy , and Direnzo to confine their answers to the legal questions before the court , both Dr. Straton and Mr. Smith repeatedly wedged in personal comments on religious issues . Once Dr. Straton was interrupted in an elaboration of his beliefs by Justice Healy 's remark that " this is one place where you must answer ' yes ' or ' no . ' " Dr. Straton , first to be called to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Smith " and some of his associates " on the evening of Oct. 19 , 1926 , and of a conference with them the next morning in his study . The subject of the meeting was a discussion of " the damaging statements " which , Dr. Straton said , were made against Uldine Utley and her backers as " religious profiteers . " Mr. Smith , he said , promised to retract his statements . ? Dr. Straton then , he said , got a file of papers relating to activities of the Atheist society . " I entered an emphatic protest against him sending me any vile literature like that , " the clergyman said . " The reply he made was a sneer I walked over to him and told him if he 6id not stop using my name and church I would take whatever steps I found necessary to stop it . " The next day and . for several months , the minister said , Mr. Smith continued to send him letters and literature dealing with sex . birth control and irreligious subjects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Straton started , Assistant District Attorney John J. questioned the right of Mr. Smith to examine the witness . the Court decided , in view of Mr. Smith 's statement that he had been admitted to the bar in Oklahoma , to allow him to conduct the examination . Dr. Straton , under Mr. Smith 's questioning , said that he had decided to take action against Mr. Smith after .. conference with John S. Sumner , Sup . rintendent of the Society for the Suppression of Vice , about six- months after the conference held in his study , and said that the reason for his delay was that he was " much engaged with parish duties and was waiting to see how far you would go . " " Is n't it a fact that you are prejudiced against atheists ? " Mr. Smith asked the witness . " I am very pitiful toward them , " the clergyman replied , and added , " I am not Prejudiced . " " Have you read the ' Age of Reason ' by Thomas Paine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and Voltaire and ? " Justice Healy cut the reply shert . Smith Denies He was Warned . A. H. Utley , father of the child evangelist , said he was present at the conference in Dr. Straton 's study . Dr. Straton , he said , pointed his finger at Mr. Smith and told him if he did not stop sending him annoying letters he would take steps to have him stopped . Mr. Smith , he said , " kind of laughed . " Mr. Smith , on the stand , denied that Dr. Straton requested him to stop the letters and said the minis- ter " preached to me for about two hours . " " What he said about asking me to stop , " Mr. Smith declared , " is a falsehood . " Sought to Convert Straton . Mr. Smith insisted that he was carrying on a religious controversy with the minister and that he had hoped to convert him to atheism and " sex sanity . " " I 've sent literature to all the leading clergymen , " he asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have sent me and I have nev . r made any objection . " Mr. Smith declared that his controversy with Dr. Straton had started when the Atheist Association was founded and Dr. Straton denounced it . His objection to Udine Utley was in the use of a child " to exploit religion . " If the Atheists had used such a girl , he said , the Board of Education would have interfered . Mr. Smith explained that he wanted to get Dr. Straton " away from the woman-hating philosophy of the New Testament , " and denied that he ever intended to annoy the minister . " It would have been a great thing to the cause of atheism , " Mr. Smith declared , " if we could have converted an outstanding character like Dr. Straton to our association . " He added that he was trying to appeal to " Dr. Straton 's esthetic sense , if he had any . " A motion by Vincent Mannino , counsel for Mr. Smith , for dismissal of the case was quickly denied . Justice Healy , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no passing on the merits of the religious controversy , but only on the legal points as they affected the mailing of literature . The Court was convinced , he said , that Mr. Smith was requested to stop sending the literature and that he had failed to do so . The trial was the outcome of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in March , in favor of the District Attorney in an appeal from the action of Supreme Court Justice Crain who had previously dismissed the clergyman 's charge against Mr. Smith .
