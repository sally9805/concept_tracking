The sooty raven of hard luck creaked again , last week , at poor Edouard Herriot . His toboggan from power has been likened to that of David Lloyd George . Both men are time servers , gambling on the turn of the mob . The undoing of M. Herriot began when he dared to duel politically for the Prime Ministry of France ( TIME , July 26 , 1926 ) , with wily Aristide Briand , who has held that office nine times . When Briand and the mob were done with Edouard Herriot he had been turned out of the Prime Ministry , after an incumbency of two days , and skinned out of his previous lucrative post as President ( Speaker ) of the Chamber of Deputies . Since then he has eaten humble crow by accepting the portfolio of Public Instruction and Fine Arts in the present Cabinet of Sacred Union , wherein Raymond Poincar is Prime Minister and Aristide Briand retains his pet post of Foreign Minister . Thus it came about that Edouard Herriot had to go out to Pons , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicate a statue of such controversial and inflammatory sort that it plunged him headlong into the gummiest kind of political mess . <P> The Bishop of La Rochelle had denounced the erection of this monument as " a public sin . " Reason : the statue represented the most famed and also infamous son of Pons , the late Prime Minister Justin Louis Emile Combes 1903-1905 . Due to his efforts the Roman Catholic Church was disestablished in France , and ever since Combes has been a hero to the parties of the Left and to the Clericals a dastard . As Edouard Herriot prepared to pull the unveiling cord , he was conscious that a crowd by no means wholly friendly surged around him . Raising his deep timbred voice in sonorous appeal the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts cried : " After a lifetime of bitter struggle , Emile Combes declared : ' I never expect justice from my adversaries ! ' May this monument assuage those bitter words . May it be said that the enemies of Emile Combes did not pursue their grudge beyond his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fine , lionesque presence had their effect . The crowd quieted . After pulling the cord , M. Herriot departed amid an escort of police . But before the cavalcade was out of sight some 20 youths raggedly clad surrounded the statue , and one with a sledge hammer knocked off the nose and ears and smashed the face in . <P> At such moments policemen should be calm . One of the Pons policemen , said to be a relative of Emile Combes , lost his head utterly . Drawing his revolver he trained it on the clerical iconoclast with the sledge hammer , pulled trigger , shot the youth dead . Cooler policemen rounded up the tattered mob men and then discovered to their horror that they were disguised Royalist followers of famed Leon Daudet , son of the great novelist Alphonse Daudet , stubborn and wrongheaded champion of Roman Catholicism and the Royal House of France . The Pope has excommunicated Leon Daudet and his followers ( TIME , April 9 ) . Their cause is irretrievably lost on all counts ; but still they struggle quixotically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Roman Catholic royalist .
