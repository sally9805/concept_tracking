WE have followed with un- flagging interest Chicago 's campaign against the British Empire . To our notion it is a long step ahead in municipal administration , this business of having a civic foe . Without a definite purpose , such as the abolition of England , a city like Chicago merely wallows along , yawing and falling off like a rudderless ship . Let New York profit by the Western sister 's example . Let us pick out a good substantial country ( we will say Denmark ) and let us get awfully mad at Denmark . This is fairly easy . Then appoint some official with a pleasing personality , some glorified Whalen , to be chief book-burner , destroying by fire all printed matter that mentions Denmark . Without this tangible goal , the town is getting nowhere  --  just making money , and what does it all amount to ? MEN and organizations come and go in this town , making scarcely a stir . Horses are more invigorating . There has been quite a flurry of horses in our midst lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the Horse Show . Early one morning recently , a drove of them clattered and clopped through one of the cross streets off Park Avenue , and we were pleased to note that every window in an apartment building was flung open to see what was the matter . Incidentally , we have observed that the easiest way to get into society nowadays is through the good graces of a horse . The procedure , simple enough , is to buy a horse for your little child . enter the two of them in a show , and from then on all is clear sailing . An unmounted child is worse than useless . XT 0 sooner had advertising writers discovered that women smoke than the Vassar faculty underwent the same rude awakening . Although Poughkeepsie 's snow-clad hills seem remote and far away from our yel-lowing canyons , we see a great signifi-cance in the new smoking-room which has been provided for Vassar seniors . For one thing , it spells the end of what to us has always been a tenderly humorous spectacle in our public din-ing halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the open and not quite sure of herself ; the half closing of the eyes as she draws in the smoke , the strained look as though of intense physical gratification , the curious worldly puckering of the lips as she blows forth a little stream straight from the tonsils . With a public smoking-room on the campus , it wo n't be long before Vassar girls coming to town will look much like anybody else with a cigarette . WE have heard a good many peo- ple attack the Sixth Avenue " L , " and in one or two instances have seen more impulsive persons try to knock it down . It now appears , however , that the " L " has a purpose after all  --  it is to hang traffic lights on . There is a light at every block along Sixth Avenue , of the familiar red and green . The only material effect of all this signalling , so far as we have been able to notice , is that certain night-owl drivers who have a passion for weaving in and out among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour to fifty-five miles an hour . A pedestrian can still come as near death in front of Jefferson Market as ever he could before , if not nearer . More About Morrow UR recent anthology of stories OU Mr. Dwight Morrow 's absent-mindedness has inspired our readers to send in a dozen others , but many of them , alas , we first heard in connection with Chauncey Depew or Joseph Choate . We relate one , however , as authentic , since a relative of the Ambassador is the source . Mr. Morrow left his office one morning to catch a train . A few hours later he called his secretary in New York over the long-distance phone . " SpringCr , " said he , " why am I in Philadelphia ? " His secretary 's voice showed anguish . " You should have gone to Princeton , sir , to make a speech , " he replied . Mr. Morrow got to the college on time , but he barely made it . As For Music IF you are all ears now that the music season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthcoming recital events . There should he a mark beside the date of November 27 , when Geraldine Farrar ( who says she 's through with opera ) will return to concert at Carnegie Hall . In December the round table in the northeast corner of the Gotham Hotel dining-room , known as Paderewski 's table , will be regularly occupied by that gentleman , whose first concert here , however , is not until March 24 . He starts on tour in January . Jascha Heifetz is scheduled for an appearance ( the first since before his operation here last year ) , To balance these " comebacks " there will be at least one farewell : Madame Schumann-Heink 's , at Carnegie , December 10 ( prior to a seven ty-fi ve- farewell-concerts tour of the nation , after which she will teach singing ) . Chaliapin , now making records in London , has two recitals here in January . Mary Garden will reluctantly leave her warm Riviera to give a concert at the Plaza , November 15 . December dates include de Gogorza , Alda , Josef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring Sophie Braslau , Mary Lewis ( March 11 ) and Kreisler , the latter in two concerts , the second on St. Patrick 's Day . One of the more likely new Europeans is Andres Segovia , who plays the guitar , we are told , as well as Kreisler fiddles . Among other first invaders likely to he interesting , we hear , are Yelli d'Aranyi , a young violinist ; Vladimir Horowitz , a Russian pianist , and Heinrich Schlusnus , a German baritone . The orchestras have already started their cycles in Carnegie , of course , among them the Beethoven Symphony , once an alias for Philharmonic men having a night off , now with a personnel of its own . The New York Symphony is enjoying a visit from Herr Fritz Busch of Dresden , and the Philharmonic is having a seventh ( and very full year ) with Mynheer Willem Mengelberg of Amsterdam , Mr. Busch will be succeeded , in turn , by Damrosch , Ravel , Gabrilowitsob and Enrique Fernandez Arbos , a Spaniard who played a fiddle with the Boston Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduc.or here . Those to follow Mengelberg are Sir Thomas Beecham ( also to be guest conductor for the Philadelphia and Boston orchestras ) , Bernardino Molinari , and Toscanini ( who begins in February and continues until April ) . The only change in the usual invasion by out-of-town orchestras will be Fritz Reiner and Pierre Monteux as conductors of the Philadelphia Orchestra , Stokowski being on leave . Much interest is manifested in a new organization , the Musical Forum , led ht Kurt Schindler . Our informant looks upon him as one of the few who , dedicated to the discovery of rare works , really discovers them . The modernists seem to have lost the International Composers ' League ( reported withdrawn ) , but those whose season is ruined unless they can hiss and stamp at an evening of new music - 17547- # ) 4,4- - will have the League of Composers as hold as ever . Madame Schumann-Heink , by the way , has an opera farewell too , in March ( bits from her Wagnerian roles and Galli-Curci will join the Metropolitan after Christmas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptown speakeasy the other night with the news that a similar rendezvous a block away was being raided , the proprietor immediately jumped into his hat and topcoat and ordered all the guests and the employees  --  including the busy bartenders  --  to do likewise . The order was obeyed and everyone waited an hour or so thus clad . Finally the excitement died down and the street garments were abandoned . A guest ventured to ask the proprietor why he had issued the order . " Well , " he said , " if they had come in here , we all of us could have said we were just guests and no one would have been pinched for running the place . " Horse Power , Old Style WE heard a gentleman at the Horse Show the other evening say to his small son , " Heigho , a horse and carriage , lad , observe it well . It is a fancy that has passed " ? or words to that effect . This disparaging generalization , we are pleased to report , fails to reckon with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have none of your newfangled automobile . There is , for one , Miss Sarah Cooper Hewitt , daughter of Abram S. Hewitt , once mayor of the city , whose brougham is regularly seen before her home at 9 ' Lexington Avenue ; and a familiar bit of local color about Washington Square is Mrs. Frank Spencer Witherbee 's brougham ? or victoria if it is fine weather  --  into which she is handed at the same hour every day by an old coachman whose boast is that he can out-trot an automobile up the Avenue any day . Confidentially , this is because of the friendliness of the traffic police . There is , so far as we know , but one man who still appears about town in smartly turned-out equipages . He is Mr. Harris Fahnestock . In Newport East year another gentleman , Mr. J. Laurens Van Alen , had ordered his seven carriages re-upholstered , and fourteen horses were brought from Europe to draw them , when his death occurred . Now only Mrs. Roderick Terry is said to drive a carriage in that city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their carriages at the turn of the century , have clung to them by keeping them in storage . Most of these vehicles are in the warehouse of Charles C. Tough in Seventy-third Street , and many of them represent the craftsmanship of Brewster , the noted carriage maker . His grandson , William Brewster , gave up the making of carriages in 1907 and turned to motor car bodies . About thirty five carriages in storage at his Long Island City plant when the war came had to be moved to make way for airplane building . Thus Mr. Tough 's warehouse became their present resting place . Last week we went up to look at them and found the visit well worth while . Notable among them are several belonging to the Misses Elizabeth and Mabel Hyde , who have kept them in storage for the last twenty-two years . One is an old opera bus , with a door in the back , all glass-enclosed , and richly upholstered , seating eight persons . A coach , belonging to Mr. George R. Read , kept downstairs because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbo in a freight elevator , is equipped with wine boxes and an icebox , and the dust has not completely dimmed the sparkle of a beautifully wrought watch , plate-glass mirrors and silver-belled coaching bugles . The equipage bears a gold plate with the names of passengers of a forgotten coaching trip through France , and the time made from one city to another . Heat and cold have split the panelling of many of the carriages and they are dusty with disuse , but the owners still send annual cheques for their upkeep . XTO new carriages are being built 11 in America , we were told . The last one by Brewster was made in 1912 as a favor for Mr. Mortimer L. Schiff . It was a runabout to use in the horse show ring . There are many private depositories for old vehicles , among them Mr. Clarence H. Mackay 's stables in Roslyn , where he keeps all his old equipages in immaculate order , with coverings over the carriages and harness hung on the walls , as if in readiness for use . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places in Latin America , where folks still go riding a great deal . Not long ago a Bermuda hotel-keeper came to town shopping for old buggies . In Westchester he unearthed several rare finds in the stables of Stuyvesant Fish . He bought every carriage in the place for about three hundred dollars , although one of them alone cost three thousand dollars when new . This was the famous domo victoria of Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish , for driving with four horses and postillion . It is now a tourist bus in Bermuda , where they say it is more NOVEMBER . 5 , 19 27 Late Reward NOT all of those who pass the City Hall in their travels may know that the rock on the lawn just west of the building has an interesting history . Most of those of whom inquisitive youth asks an explanation mumble something about glacial deposits . Nevertheless , it was placed there by the hand of man . Originally it lay in the Swamp District , on a farm then owned by Jacob Leisler , once governor-general , who was German born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedition . Subsequently it was discovered that there had been a mistake , but things had then gone too far . Ten or twelve years ago a new building was being erected on the land that once had been his and when the boulder was dug up some German-American citizens decided to honor the martyred official with a bronze tablet . The rock was placed in City Hall Park , but before the tablet was mounted upon it the World War came and the project was abandoned . Strange People EVEN out of season , circus freaks are a major interest with us , none more so than Eeko and Iko , whose mother , we read , turned up the other day in Roanoke , Virginia , to the con-sternation of the hig-top management . The two strange twins had been billed as " ambassadors from Mars , " and the appearance of a maternal relative in a grand old state like Virginia natur-ally threw the circus into confusion . Even Eeko and Iko , we understand , too well pleased to get : Or ' " Let 's eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home cooking . " ? ? evening dress with a brilliant red ribbon across their shirt fronts . This alone would have sufficiently amused and contented them . With Eeko and Iko their unusual flaxen hair was their principal distinction . It looked like cotton and grew in conical clumps . They were said to shed it from time to time , as a chicken moults . Scientists pronounced them subnormal ; their reflexes were slack , and they dithered as they walked . Their eyes did n't quite focus . They appeared to be Albino negroes , although it was intimated that they were picked up on the slopes of Mount Everest , or thereabouts . The twins loved monkeys and kangaroos . After the main show at the Garden , a visitor could always discover the two companions in front of the monkey cage , swaying back and forth , laughing . One of them seemed to be a shade brighter than the other , but they were equally affable . The duller one looked to his brother for conversational guidance . If you said " Hello , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the other would immediately pipe up , " How do . " If Ecko said he was feeling fine , Iko would thereupon furnish the same report . Eeko once went into private life and attended a social function . It was the hairdressers ' convention some three or four years ago . As we recall it , the purpose of the visit , as conceived by an imaginative press agent , was to have Eeko 's hair permanently waved . It was a sporting proposal . If the waving machines on exhibition at the convention could wave Eeko 's ropy locks , they could wave anything , even a telephone switchboard . But it never happened . The freak remained happily in a corner with a plate of ice cream . The press department remained happily in another corner with a bottle of Scotch . The hairdressers never had nerve enough to try the machine . The evening wore away and at length Eeko dithered off with a dithering escort . Stigma NTO day passes without fresh evi- dence that the taxi-driver fraternity is the greatest group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent pride . Two quite peaceable gentlemen were in a great bustle to get to the theatre . After entering a cab , one of them noticed that it was a 20-and-10 , instead of a 15-and-S . " We 're in a gyp cab , " he remarked , casually . Unfortunately the driver overheard , and shortly he set up a great mumble-grumble in the front seat . " S'gyp cab , eh ? I suppose that 's my fault . I 'm a gyp , too , I guess . Yeah ? S ' a gyp outfit . " This for the entire distance . At the theatre the fares got out , pink and frightened , and one of them reached for his wallet to settle . " So I 'm a gyp , am P " said the driver , moodily . " Well , you can keep your damn money . " Off he went , grumbling and rumbling , into the swirling night . Dean 's WITHWITH a certain satisfaction we notice that Dean 's is rounding out eighty-eight years of untroubled existence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , when there were really bachelors , it was fashionable to drop into Dean 's after the theatre for a plate of ice cream and a dish of sponge cake . Those were the days when a whole cold salmon was society 's supreme gesture , and when Mrs. Henry Dean herself baked cakes of strange goodness . The Rhindanders , the Goulds , the de Forests , the Scherinerhorns , and the Livingstons clustered about Washington Square and ate the cakes . Today the establishment is under the management of the third generation of Deans , in the person of George Hamilton Dean , who seems entirely inured to the legend that his forbear  - -  the original Henry -- was dubbed Crazy Dean because , in 1839 , he established his confectionery shop as far uptown as Astor Place . Later the business was moved to Fourteenth Street and then to 846 Broadway , where it flourished for twenty-one years under the watchful eye of the second Dean , Charles . Salmon went out after the Civil War , and the taste swung sharply to creamed oysters and blanc mange in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charlotte russe were marshalled in great quantities by Dean 's for society 's functions . Ward IVIcAllister dropped in frequently , stirring his ice cream till it was reduced to soup , and lending tone and authenticity . Then , in 1901 , the present Dean moved to Fifth Avenue , above Forty-second Street , amid sedate brownstones . He also got the famous cake recipes down in writing ? hitherto they had been passed along jealously from chef to chef . Ten years later he again moved , this time to the Schlev residence , opposite the present site of the St. Patrick 's Cathedral . Mr. Dean seems to occupy a position of counsellor as well as caterer . On one known occasion he was advising a mother and daughter in regard to the correct delicacies for the girl 's wedding breakfast , and he included  --  along with his advice on what to serve ? the observation that in his opinion the young lady was not in love with the young gentleman and that therefore the wedding breakfast should not be held at all . His advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , Dean 's moves again this month  --  this time to East Fifty-seventh Street . Professional TT came as a surprise to a passenger 1-on one of the eastbound liners recently when he met the steward , whose name turned out to be Blank . " That 's funny , " said the passenger . " I have been buying my liquor from a man of that name who says he 's a steward . " " Sure , that 's me , " replied the other . " And you 're really a steward ! " cried the startled traveller . " Gosh , I thought you were just a bootlegger ! "
