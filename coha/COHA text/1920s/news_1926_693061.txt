txt Workers and the Company Union . In my opinion , the statement made in today 's editorial entitled " New Unions , New Ideas , " that " if the company union has been making such rapid program , its members probably believe that It Is not without profit to themselves . " Is not the true explanation of the ready acquiescence which labor In many plants makes to the company union when it is proposed by the management . I have had long experience with American wage-earners , both union and non-union . I know that In economic matters they show the American trait of Individualism and also that , as they regard the giant corporations with which they have to deal , they feel relatively powerless . Organized labor is very weak In numbers in the United States on account of both of the above reasons . When a large Industrial undertaking proposes a company union the lemployes adopt the plan that is offered , partly because they are indifferent and partly because they feel that there is nothing else to do . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other benefits which may come to them from the company union , but they do this incidentally . They are interested primarily in holding their sobs , and they are unwilling to endanger their positions by refusing to enter a union that the company wants them to enter or by demanding that the company negotiate with a union it refuses to recognize .
