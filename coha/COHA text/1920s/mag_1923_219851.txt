The Chrisian Science Monitor is in favor of Prohibition , and for that reason it hates to print anything that would lead a reader to suppose that legislative rulings pleasing to the " drys " are not being received with acclaim the world over. * <P> Take this matter of the recent Supreme Court ruling on liquor on the high seas . <P> Headlines The Monitor : " Foreign Anxiety over Dry Ruling is Disappearing . " <P> But contemporary quotations from the British press are : The London Star : ... " Unjust and unreasonable interference . " <P> The Westminster Gazette : . . . " Threatens to affect the liberties of citizens of other countries . " <P> The Morning Post : " Why should we not solemnly declare that in the interests of good fellowship , international solidarity and the true happiness of mankind no vessel which does not carry one case of champagne or the equivalent in whiskey or beer for each passenger and each member of the crew can enter a British port ? " <P> The Daily News : " Interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce . " <P> The Daily Express : " Were it not for the suggestion that the Supreme Court is the last word in dignity and probity it would be legitimate to assume that these high and austere judges had their tongues in their cheeks when delivering this Solomon- baffling judgment . " <P> The Evening Standard : " A striking breach of recognized international courtesy . " <P> The Pall Mall Gazette : " When once you pass a silly law like prohibition you have to go on being silly all the time . " <P> Under the headline " British comment on Liquor Decision , " all of the above statements are " summarized " by the London correspondent of The Monitor thus : " The Press here gives considerable prominence to the United States Supreme Court 's decision on the question of a ship 's right to bring liquor into United States ports . " <P> He does n't say whether the " considerable prominence " is in favor of the ruling or against it . That seems to TIME to be unfair and a deliberate mispresentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Monitor 's platform for a better and a brighter world is the World Court . <P> On May 4 it published an article bearing this headline : " California for World Court Mr. Lenroot 's Tour Reveals . " The justification for this headline was the first paragraph of the article below it : " <P> California is overwhelmingly in favor of a World Court and sentiment is running strongly against ' those isolationists who , in a spirit of intense egotism and narrowness would wrap the American flag about them and cry " economic , industrial peace , " when there is no peace . ' Irvine L. Lenroot ( R. ) , Senator from Wisconsin , told a representative of The Christian Science Monitor here . " <P> In other words , there was no justification for the headline " California for World Court " other than Mr. Lenroot 's say-so . An honest head would have been " Lenroot says California Favors World Court " - or words to that effect , properly padded or contracted so as to fit space .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
