The youth and ominous " past " of Dictator Josef Stalin of Soviet Russia are kept shrouded in perpetual mystery by his iron censorship of all Soviet information sources . The very names of his wife and child are well-guarded secrets . Stalin dwells in the seclusion of an Oriental Potentate , because , say his friends , his parents were Asiatic and the reticence of the East is his birthright . Naturally the enemies of Comrade Stalin tell another story . <P> Last week the " other story " was told at length by the Berlin newspaper Tageblatt , a renowned Independent organ . The Tageblatt 's informant , one Essad Bey , a purported friend of Stalin 's youth , wrote : <P> " Twenty years ago , in a poor saloon on the outskirts of Baku , near the factory quarters , one could meet a badly dressed young man with crooked nose , low forehead and coal-black hair . He was a Georgian , the publisher of the workmen 's paper . He called himself Koba , Nischeradse , Tschischikov , Ivanovitsch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili . <P> " In the evenings , Georgians , Ossets , Inguschs and Armenians used to assemble in front of the bar in their colorful costumes , and in the morning the workmen 's newspaper was better informed about the events in Caucasia than the larger papers in town . . . . " <P> All this was at the time when the transCaucasian " activists " were first forming themselves . " Their members belonged to small nations from all over Caucasia , mostly wild illiterates , nomads , warriors who could remember the days of the holy Imam Schamil . . . . <P> " The real Marxists in Russia used to frighten their opponents by mentioning the transCaucasian activists . Soon Stalin , the ' unconsecrated , ' became leader of the activists . <P> " Stalin is no theorist of communism , he was never a dreamer or a romantic hero . He is a cold-blooded man of deeds , uneducated in manner , and disliked by the European communists . He never considers anything which does not concern the near future . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Dzhugashvili , whom Lenin nicknamed " Stalin " " Steel " , was five times exiled to Siberia by the Tsarist regime for various high crimes and misdemeanors , but he five times escaped . In the war of " Whites " and " Reds " which followed the Russian revolution Comrade " Steel " valiantly defended the town of Tsaritsin , which is now called Stalinsk.
