One day last week , a large boulder obstructed traffic on the Lincoln Highway at Menlo Park , between New Brunswick and Metuchen , N. J. The boulder was not directly on the cement , nor did it lean menacingly over it . Motorists could have passed by comfortably , save that before the boulder , ranged in rows upon the highway , were some 600 chairs of the folding variety used for church sociables , political meetings and open-air exercises . <P> Upon the chairs sat notables , upon a platform more notables . Across the boulder rippled two U. S. flags , behind which , fixed in the stone , a bronze tablet mutely announced : " On this site-1876-1882-Thomas Alva Edison began his work of service for the world . . . . This tablet is placed by the Edison Pioneers . . . . " <P> Near Mr. and Mrs. Edison on the platform was John W. Lieb of the New York Edison Co . He dedicated the tablet and presented it to Governor George S. Silzer of New Jersey as a state monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President John G. Hibben of Princeton then perorated , with interruptions by a rumbling freight train and a youthful Edisonian who leapt to the fore to declare he would never go to college. *Samuel Insull terminated the speechmaking . <P> Mr. Insull , when he came to this country from England in 1881 , became the private secretary of Mr. Edison . <P> Today he is a living example of the revolution which Mr. Edison has made possible in modern living - for he is President of the Commonwealth Edison Co. , which furnishes all of Chicago 's electric light , master of a great group of public utilities in the West - many of them grown up out of Mr. Edison 's inventions - President of the Chicago Civic Opera Company and in general a magnate of the Middle West . He , with others-aids and witnesses of wholesale changes wrought by Edison inventions-did honor to the inventor . ' Through it all a big white head nodded modest appreciation , a pair of bright blue eyes twinkled with pleasure . <P> To the assemblage , no recital of Inventor Edison 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ohio youth inept at books , fond of dabbling with chemicals , both greengrocer and publisher in his teens , boxed on the ears ( and deafened for life ) by a furious conductor because a stick of phosphorus started a fire in the mail car in which he traveled with his printing office and chemicals ( he was selling magazines on trains at the time and had a laboratory in one end of the mail car ) , and later of the young telegraph operator with the itch for invention . <P> The accomplishments of his life speak for him : <P> Improvements for the telegraph and for Dr. Bell 's telephone of 1875 ; the electric pen or telescribe , and the mimeograph ; the megaphone ; an instantaneous vote-recording machine which Congress rejected because " one of the greatest weapons in the hands of a minority to prevent bad legislation . . . is the roll-call " ; the microtasimeter , for detecting slight changes of temperature ; the world 's first " talking-machine " ; carbon filaments for incandescent electric light bulbs ; the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera ; metal filaments for bulbs ; the taximeter ; an electric street car and numerous minor contrivances that have brought the number of U.S. patents in his name to over 1,000.
