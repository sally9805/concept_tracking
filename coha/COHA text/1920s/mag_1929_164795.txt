MARRIAGE AND MORALS-Bertrand Russell-Horace Liveright ( $3 ) . <P> The Thesis . Bertrand Russell displays present-day laws and ideas about sex as an extraordinary potpourri* obtained from savages , ascetics , Roman lawyers , Manichaean heretics , Teuton romanticists . All of them , says he , are based upon the idea of indissoluble connection between coition and conception , which is practically no longer true . Showing the disastrous effects of this makeshift state of affairs , he then considers various other possibilities , from the standpoint of the state , the child , the adult . His own proposal goes a step further than companionate marriage-as the family is of importance chiefly to the child , a man and woman should not be considered bound until her first pregnancy . <P> Much of this has been said before , but Marriage and Morals is valuable for being at once fundamental and clear , unbiased and persuasive . Author Russell tries to go to the root of each of his ideas , to explain asceticism , romanticism . He takes nothing for granted , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a humanist , defending the happiness of man against many moral prejudices , advocates his changes lucidly and wittily . <P> Sample epigrams : " Jealousy and love are both instinctive emotions , but religion has decreed that jealousy is a virtuous emotion to which the community ought to lend support , while love is at best excusable . " <P> Of Saint Paul 's view of marriage as a preventive of fornication : " It is just as if one were to maintain that the sole reason for baking bread is to prevent people from stealing cake . " <P> The Author . Bertrand Russell is heir presumptive to an earldom , but he shares with his famed sister-in-law the honor of making people forget his title and remember his work . He is known for books on mathematics , philosophy , sociology , education . He formerly held a fellowship at Cambridge , but was deprived of it during the War for his writings against conscription , for which he was for a time imprisoned . He says of himself : " I like the sea , logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inhuman , the others because they are absurd . " <P> <P> *French : " rotten pot . " <P> Elizabeth , Countess Russell and von Arnim , authoress of Elizabeth and Her German Garden , The Enchanted April , known to the public as " Elizabeth . "
