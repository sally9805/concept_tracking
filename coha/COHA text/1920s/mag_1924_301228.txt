Republican Presidents Johnson , Grant , Hayes , Arthur , McKinley , Taft , Harding , Coolidge , were mixed up in a paragraph by Franklin D. Roosevelt and despatched to Manhattan to be read at the annual Jefferson Day dinner of the National Democratic Club . Wrote Mr. Roosevelt : * <P> " May I renew your attention to an interesting historical fact which deserves consideration by the American people ? During the period since the Civil War the administration of President Johnson was marked by impeachment proceedings against the President himself ; the administration of President Grant was marred by grave scandals reaching into the Cabinet itself ; the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes and Chester A. Arthur were filled with such serious patronage scandals that civil service reform was forced through by an indignant country ; the administration of President McKinley saw the graft and rottenness of the War Department and other bureaus during and following the Spanish-American War ; the Administration of President Taft stirred the country with its Ballinger episode , and that nation is now shocked by the events which have occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ledger , both the first and second administrations of Grover Cleveland were marked by the efficiency and honesty of the government service , and the eight years of leadership of Woodrow Wilson gave the country the highest and cleanest administration it had ever had . <P> " This is a record of over half a century which will help to cause a victory for clean Democracy in 1924 .
