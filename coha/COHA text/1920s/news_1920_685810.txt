All ' were veterans of the early days of The Star , when Mrs. Harding had them in charge . Those were the days when Warren G. Harding , struggling to put his small country paper on its feet , was- his own editor , reporter , advertising manager and at times makeup man and composito ? . Mrs. Harding , who had been disowned by her father , Amos Kling , then one of Marion's. wealthiest men . for marrying a poor country publisher with apparently no other future , took charge of the circulation department of The Star . For fourteen years she worked in The Star office . laying out carrier routes and organizing squads of newsboys . Slie ruled the " newsics " with a firm hand , and looked after their morals as well .

Among theta was " Jimmy " Wood , whose punishment nearly caused an insurrection in The Star-office . It developed that most of the chastisement had been administered to-give moral encouragement to lazy newsboys who balked at delivering Papers over dusty or muddy road. -3 with no sidewalks on the outskirts of Marion .

Second , an unfortunate political mistake might he committed , and , third , there is always danger , of course , of a new issue or a roorback affecting the campaign at the last moment . " Representative Julius Kahn of California , Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs of the Houae , stopped at Marion yesterday to pay his respects to Senator Harding . Mrr Kahn probably will spend the entire month of October in stumping for the national ticket in the Eastern States and the Middle West . He has no contest in his own State . Both Democrats and Republicans have nominated him , for reelection to Congress . ? Mr. Kahn made the following statement before leaving : " There is no doubt that Harding and Coolidge will carry California by an overwhelming majority . I believe that the figure will run as high as 200,000 . I know of hundreds of Democrats whp have never voted for a Republican candidate for President who state emphatically that at this election they propose to support Harding and Coolidge . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rem : Veit . ? I find that among the laboring classes in California there is an overwhelming sentiment for the Republican nominees . Dozens of working men and women with whom 1 spdke told me emphatically that they did not want the League of Nations or Its repnesentative , the Democratic nominee . Thek seem to be alive to the danger that will /befall the United States if I ? e become entangled by an alliance with the nations of Europe or Asia . . They realize that in the European countries the inhabitants of thee* ? ambles are racially and ethnologically different from their Leigh bars . " All of these countries have sons and daughters who have become loyal and patriotic American citizens . The World War demonstrated the fact that they arc ready to die for the United States of America if need he . However , deep down in the corners of their hearts they have a little love for the land in which they first saw the light of day . ? And the moment we begin to interfere in. the affairs of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we throw apples of discord among American citizens . That seemed to be the trend of the talk I had with a great many of the business men and of the working men of California . "
