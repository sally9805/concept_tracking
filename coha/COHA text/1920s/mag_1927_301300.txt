For the 56th time in 100 years and the 17th time since 1900 , the moon 's course last week intersected the imaginary line between the earth and the sun at a point close enough to the earth , so that the sun was blotted from the sight of earth-dwellers . The moon 's shadow , an oval patch of twilight some 40 miles wide , fell first on the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Ireland , sweeping across Liverpool and Hartlepool to the North Sea , across Scandinavia and Siberia , disappearing over the Aleutian Islands off Alaska . <P> A few moments before-as the moon 's age is reckoned-such an event would have caused cowering , ululations and doomsday prophecies among mankind . But last week , instead of scurrying into caves or cellars , mankind made merry and flocked to the totality belt for observation , lay and scientific . In the British Isles there were eclipse houseparties and a national holiday . Scandinavians , accustomed to staying up late at this season of the midnight sun , redoubled their nocturnal festivities to view a sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1961 , by England until 1999 . <P> Clouds and fog thwarted observers in many places , but not in Giggleswick , England ( pop . 950 ) , whither gathered 70,000 and Sir Frank Dyson , Astronomer Royal . Shortly before the time that the eclipse was due-which scientists miscalculated by three seconds-the clouds over Giggleswick parted , making way for the heavenly two-ring circus . For 23 seconds , the sun was totally obscured by the black disc of the moon . When the sun is in this condition , its pearl-white corona is visible , with vivid scarlet flames streaming from it . The corona was once thought to be only reflected sunlight , but modern observers know it has gaseous structure ; contains an unknown element which gives a green ray in the spectroscope . This element is called " coronium " for convenience . <P> Said Astronomer-Royal Dyson : " I believe science was well served today and I am looking forward to the eclipse in Siam in 1929 . " <P> Grimy Manchester reported : " The sun was eclipsed here as usual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . But at Fagernas , Norway , thick clouds made useless the efforts of Dr. Samuel A. Mitchell of Leander-McCormick Observatory ( University of Virginia ) , head of a large U. S. expedition . <P> In Germany , cameras clicked at the cause of a greyish-green hue covering the landscape , recorded huge spots on the portion of the sun remaining visible from that angle .
