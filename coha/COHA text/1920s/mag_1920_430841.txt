 | MOST of us remember the romance called " Frankenstein , " written by Mrs. Shelley . In that romance there was created a symbol of a human being . Frankenstein had bone and muscle and sinew , and all the outward and visible form of humanity except life , and then at the proper time it was found that this creature was alive . But instead of being subject to those who had made it and under their control , it became a monster , their master , and a violent destructive agent . That romance , " Frankenstein , " may be taken to illustrate what has happened during these past hundred years in the building of a great government . We have been laying rails and felling trees and building bridges , inventing and constructing machinery , and doing a thousand and one things to develop and enhance the value of the material resources of the world , and finally we wake up to find that this great creation so stupendous in its extent , so fundamental in its importance , so widespread in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alive . We are face to face with a problem of adapting ourselves to a comprehension in terms of human feeling , human aspiration , human conduct of this great system which we have been accustomed to dwell upon as purely mechanical and purely material . It is to be hoped that we shall solve these great question it a spirit of human kindliness and of patriotic Americanism . But the condition of our so doing is that we understand precisely what the problem is , and that we do not conceal its difficulties from ourselves by any  | veil of words , or by any attempt to compromise with the great fundamental principles of morals and of politics . We find now that those who work with their hands , like those who work with their brains and those who work with their savings , are human beings ; that they have wives and children and other dependents to support ; that they have aspirations to study and to know and to enjoy the beautiful and good things of life . We find , too , that a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something concealed , something hidden , something odd and curious about our political system that prevents their full enjoyment of their human opportunities and their human rights . The specific question which we have to answer in this country , and which we shall answer , is how to solve our industrial problems in terms of human feeling , human kindliness and human aspirations , without destroying everything which has made our Republic possible . OUR PROBLEM A HUMAN PROBLEM WE ARE on the way , just so soon as we have comprehended that we are dealing with a human problem ; that we are not dealing with cogs upon the wheel of a machine ; that we are not dealing with spokes in a wheel ; that we are not dealing with numbered and tagged units ; but that we are dealing with human beings . The moment we see our problem as a human problem , we are face to face with the opportunity of those of us ? and how vast their number ! ? who are convinced believers in the Republic ; those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity and of justice , the opportunity to tell that story to those whose eyes are blind and whose ears are deaf to the story of America . The difficulties of democracy are the opportunities-of education . The very purpose of these problems is that we may tax ourselves to our very best and finest and most splendid expression in order to solve them . We are confronted , not alone by the duty but by the splendid opportunity of telling again for the hundredth time the story of America , and telling to these human beings like ourselves  | who are anxious to know , anxious to improve , anxious to better their condition in the world , that only in and through and by America is there any chance for them whatever . ( We have got to say that the whole of human history shows that any other door leads to a blind alley of chaos and darkness ; that the door of individual opportunity , which assures to every man the full control of the just product of his own labor , is the only known way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress ) One difficulty at the present time is that we have not yet wholly recognized how largely the problem that confronts us has been artificially created . Consider how many men there are who make their living by going up and down this country telling other groups of men that they ought to be discontented , that they ought to be unhappy , that they ought to be dissatisfied , and that they ought to make trouble for their fellows and their comrades ! There are thousands upon thousands of such men , many of them speaking our language with difficulty , who are going up and down this land , day by day , adding to difficulties , embarrassing the Government of the Nation and of the States , stopping the wheels of industry , impeding production , increasing the cost of living , because they ? these comparatively few agitators ? are the heralds of a revolution . A REVOLUTION OPENLY FOMENTED WE ARE face to face , not with a secret revolution , but with a revolution openly fomented , openly preached , whose message is falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americanism to treat it as it deserves . The following record of testimony before a public officer is instructive . The examining public officer : Q. What do you mean by social revolution ? A. Social revolution means the overthrow of the existing system . Q. In what way ? A. That is immaterial , but it is not to be the methods of the ruling class , that is plain . Q. What other way ?  | A. By organizing the revolutionary workers , making them class-conscious . It is like the depositors in a bank . So long as there is a feeling that the bank is stable , they will deposit their money , but so soon as a doubt comes in their minds , there is a mass movement , and a panic seems to enter them all at once and they all rush pell melt to draw out the money . The workers will be in the same position as the depositors in the bank toward the present government . They will feel that they have lost all faith in it through our propaganda , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Wages will not rise to meet it and they will feel that they are always on the ragged edge . When that condition prevails , and we can instill into their minds doubt and distrust and lack of faith in the present capitalistic methods , even in the Plumb plan , to meet the tremendous reforms necessary ? when that stage has been reached and breakdown of industry comes , the revolutionary organizations will spring into existence and will take over the control of your government from the capitalistic class . The reforms generated in Germany under Bismarck , they did not do any good . We have to show them that all social reformers are worthless and that the only thing they must do is to organize for communism . That is testimony under oath before a public officer . Frank , unconcealed and highly valuable because it points to precisely the cause that need give us concern , namely the ability of the agitators to spread abroad distrust . If we can instill into the hearts of our fellow Americans , whatever their occupation , whatever their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent or religious belief ; if we can instill into them by our personal relations , by our industrial methods , by the administration of justice and by the contact of our governmental agents with them in the discharge of daily business faith , in America , you have the answer to the propaganda of distrust . The question is between faith in America and carefully propagated distrust of American principles , American laws and American ideals . MUST AMERICANIZE OUR ALIENS WE FORGET in our easy-going optimism how many there are who have come to our shores to take places in our industrial life and to share in our political responsibility to whom our traditions are meaningless . We forget how many there are to whom the names of Washington and of Lincoln are as remote as the names of Nebuchadnezzar and of Nero . We forget how many have come to  | us under conditions of revolt and violent dissatisfaction with government at home and who have carried with them that distrust of government , all ready to furnish quickening soil for the seed of the agitator when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the autocrat or of the tyrant in the homeland they had left . We forget how earnestly we must address ourselves to the task of making sure that these newcomers , from whatever land , do see the meaning of America , do get a chance to understand America , do learn the history and the opportunity of America . And we must do it quickly ; because it has now been discovered by great masses of men that we are so closely intertwined in our lives , that we are so interdependent in our interests , that a very slight dislocation of the social and industrial order may bring untold ruin and loss in its train . Out yonder on the track of a great railroad there will be standing tomorrow morning a great engine , complete in every part , carefully inspected , all ready to move , so soon as the skilled hand is put upon the throttle , and to carry the passengers with safety at a rate of sixty miles an hour . Let someone withdraw from that engine a pin , only partly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve an inch or two in diameter , and that great engine is helpless . It stands before its task paralyzed and broken , as if it had been torn to pieces . Just so it is with our industrial and our economic life . e have now come to a point where our great national civilization is so complex , so highly ordered and so completely interdependent , that this organized and simultaneous withdrawal of the co-operation of a relatively small group will bring the whole nation to a standstill , / That means that we must find the arguments of persuasion that will make men understand their interdependence , make men understand their duty and their opportunity to their fellows as well as those of their fellows to them , and see that the solution of these difficulties and differences is to be found , not in the methods of industrial war and by violent attack  | upon the nation or its government , but by the methods of American reasonableness , of conference , of debate , of examination and of judicial determination of rights , wrongs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other is the barbarous way . The one is the way of progress and construction ; the other is the way of reaction and destruction . We must remember that this interdependence is yet on y partially appreciated by the great body of our citizenship . It seems never to have occurred to a great number of Americans who are wage-earners that they are also wage-payers . Every one of them who wears a coat , every one of them who wears a pair of shoes , every one of them who has a shovel or a pick or an axe has helped to pay the wages of some other American whose labor has entered into the making of those articles . We are all wage-earners , and we are all wage-payers , and our interdependence is so complete that unless we are prepared to understand it and to act upon it , it is within the power of any relatively small element of our great community to bring its life to a standstill . What we are combating is , then , a wrong idea and a wrong state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE AGITATOR WE CAN NOT combat such things with force . Force is the proper instrument for repression and punishment of improper and illegal acts ; but force can not reach a wrong idea . The history of the world is that ideas flourish when attacked by force , be they good or bad . The only instrument that will combat a wrong idea , a wrong state of feeling , is a right idea , a right state of feeling . We have got to reach these propagandist doctrines on the plane in which they move . We have got to reach them by instruments that are like in kind , and we have got to prepare our selves and exert ourselves by reflection and by action to institute in this country so great , so overwhelming a propaganda for America that the voice of the agitator will be stilled in this  | land . In no other way can we meet the situation that confronts us . It is , of course , quite impossible that civilization should go on if men withdraw their co-operation in industry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attempted in Great Britain , it has recently been threatened here ; but all must see ? and it is so plain that it must be easy to show it to everyone ? that if men withdraw their personal co-operation in the productive work of civilization as a means of forcing a political policy , it is , to point a pistol at the head of this Republic . It is to say to the Republic . " Stand and deliver , because I have in my power that which will make you uncomfortable , and will perhaps bring disaster to you and your families ! " No civilization can last on this basis . No government can be maintained with that absence of consent and cooperation . And , do not forget that it is perfectly possible to destroy civilization . Civilization has been destroyed before , and it has taken a thousand years to repair the damage done in a generation or two . Civilization might conceivably be destroyed again . It would be destroyed again if enough men were to become so filled with this selfish notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a class struggle and a class consciousness , that they started to make war on all their fellows in order to advance that notion . It would be perfectly possible to wreck civilization , and none would suffer more when the pillars of the great temple should fall and its roof should cave in , none would suffer more than the very men who would have brought about that destruction . It is not a question of majority . We are a hundred million , and there may be only fifty thousand of our nation 's enemies ; but put the fifty thousand in confrol of a strategic point in our economic and industrial life , and they are as powerful as fifty thousand armed men marching among the hundred million unarmed women and children . It is not a question of numbers . It is a question of the points in our social and economic organization where the influence can be brought to bear . But I repeat , I am not of those  | who believe that we shall fail to meet this situation , because whenever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clearly put before them , they have never failed to decide it for America .
