txt So that more students may participate in athletic sports , Barnard college has abolished trained varsity teams , it wa sannounced yesterday at Columbia University .

The number competing in swimming had doubled in the last two years , it is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1923 , compared with 101 last year . Tennikoit end archery are also being developed at Barnard .

For seven years prior to 1924 Barnard had a varsity squad in all sports , which concentrated on contests with Teachers ' College . True enough . the few who were on the varsity squads got excellent practice , but what was happening to the larger group of girls who had to sit on the side lines ? " Are we to benefit as far as health is concerned by sitting on the side lines and cheering a varsity ? Out of the ten hours a week possible for practice a squad of twelve girls received four hours , while the remaining group of nearly 1,000 in college received six hours . " The new system gives every girl a chance to take part in the track meet . No matter how little she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In basketball and baseball every girl is on a team which plays in six class games , two odd-even games , and perhaps in the all-star faculty or all-star alumnae games . In this way we handle a minimum of seventy-two girls a day in competition . "
