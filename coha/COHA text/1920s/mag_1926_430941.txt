At dawn the harbor of Casablanca stretches welcoming arms toward the incoming ships , and all at once there is France , proud of what she has made out of a strip of sand and the ramparts of dead centuries . Phoenicia built Anfa here and , in the long ago , Rome 's legionaries dreamed of a continent beyond the Atlantic . Here also was a fortress of the Mereide sultans which fell to Dom Ferdinand of Portugal and his armada of fifty ships . Now France acclaims a signpost of her patriotism . " Here is a city a 1 Americaine . In ten years , out of nothing , we have created , we have achieved ? " A line of camels sways through thyme-scented streets . Their bells murmur of deserts and their loads are wrapped in carpets hand woven in the women 's tents . Behind them a troop of small boys follow a donkey whose striped saddlebags are so swollen with golden fruit that ( " Allah is generous ! " ) some will surely overflow . A shapeless thing slips by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress as discreetly as the muffling folds of finest white wool . Here is a very grand lady , for the amber eyes are lowered , the long henna-stained fingers hidden , and only the tinkle of jeweled anklets , the embroidery on the red slippers , childishly small , a scent as elusive as time , show a descendant of the great . It is pride , not humility , which veils the Eastern woman , and the nobler the race , the more delight does its daughter take in baffling the curiosity of the vulgar ! Outside the Marrakesh gate a group of Senegalese appear as a frieze against the sky line , high priestesses of the sea , each with a basket of fish on her head . There are horsemen in white robes with impossibly curvetting steeds , story tellers with voices as magic as their ancient tales , the Thousand and One Nights . There are snake charmers ,  | jugglers who swallow swords and divide a hen into half a dozen fluffy and quite unsurprised chickens , and there are Jews with financial noses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with desire to add just one more coat of whitewash or gold wash to all the mellow jumble of colors that the years have painted . But this is not French Casablanca , " the cuckoo 's egg laid in the nest of a changeless Morocco , " with its population of roo , 000 , its yearly millions spent on development and improvement , its hotels , where the plumbing is American , the chef is Parisian , and only the azure tiles and saffron-frescoed domes are African . From the Place de France many-cylindered , balloon-tired cars glide out to the roads that lead to a sunlit pageant of legend and romance , of chivalrous endeavor , of old glamorous hopes , frustrated o achieved . First we come to Rabat , the imperial city where France has made boulevards and gay lit t1 cafes with rows of checked tablecloths and th yard-long breads of the Midi . Above the music ? tango on the terrace of the hotel , drum , audh and lute in the blind dancing houses of the markets ? towers the castle ( Kasba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of these , the conqueror of Granada and Toledo , was killed in battle in Castile and his body brought , with all the complicated ceremony due to a living monarch , to be buried in the Atlas Mountains . This is a place of history , for the dismantled guns of Philip III stand by the gate and there is a room full of silks and velvets from Damascus , of muslin from Mosul ( the origin of the name ) , of medieval chains worn by the Christians captured by pirates of Sale ? those very white houses across the estuary . From the walls the whole town spreads like a patchwork quilt of domed mosque and minaret ; flat roofs , where the women dream away hidden , contented lives ? " their feet are too curved for rough ways ; " palace arch and court ; mysterious warren of markets , and the happy little gardens that are France 's contribution . On the edge of the uplands is the tower of Hassan , most faithful of lovers , who shut himself into a solitary chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could achieve , for fifteen years until the death he was too good a Moslem to insure by violence allowed him to rejoin his beloved . If it is Friday the sun will flash from a thousand bayonets , as the sultan leaves his palace for the mosque in a golden coach , which must have come out of a fairy tale , since it is shaped  | like Cinderella 's pumpkin . Musicians with fifes . : nd drums stand by the royal gates . The Black Guard line the route . The nobles on white mules with crimson saddles pass through a crowd of the faithful who cry , " Allah is great and great is our lord the sultan under Him , " prostrating themselves with foreheads in the dust at the creak of the toy coach 's wheels . It is all unreal . Scimitars catch gleams of reflected color in their curves , and recall the compliment an Arab poet once paid to his beloved , " Your smile is like the sunshine flashing on swords drawn in battle . " Inside the coach there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a symbol of power , guarded by shereefs in the green robes won by a Meccan pilgrimage , by youths waving muslin scarves , by fan bearers , shield bearers , crown bearers , by all that insignia of state which has long since crushed this particular commander of the faithful . He loved mechanical toys and gold cameras , bicycles with large front wheels , fireworks , jewels and rows and rows of scarlet-painted carriages , but the French Government gave him maps and industrial treatises and insisted that the four hundred imperial kitchen maids must wear red cotton instead of red satin , which , as everyone in the palace knew , was most derogatory to their dignity ! A curious , delicious fairy-tale country is Morocco and unchangeable even by those long , smooth , perfect roads and the quaint vinewreathed inns where you eat such delicious fat olives and sip any aperitif you like , or merely the elixir of sunshine and sparkling air , with your feet in a welter of convolvulus and your eyes on the snows of the Atlas . From Rabat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago and to all those sultans who passed between the two capitals with their armies so great a multitude living on the land that their passage was known as " the burning . " First there is Shelia , whose walls might have been chronicled by Froissart , but they were old before Hercules was known and first breached when the fall of Carthage gave Morocco to Rome . Sale , home of the corsairs , is new beside it , though she is sacred ground , full of mosques , medersas(colleges) and zawiyas(schools) of the order of El Tijani , whose last grand master , aged eighteen , exchanged a spiritual kingdom for the smiles of a little French bourgeoise whom he saw in Bordeaux when visiting the cardinal archbishop . A more authentic saint of Sale was Sidi ben Hasen , whose followers objected to his retreat in the half-island city . When they came , begging him to return , he filled a gourd with sea water and asked , " How is it that this fraction of the ocean is now at  | peace ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been withdrawn from the turmoil of the sea . " " A wise answer , " said the seer , and his disciples left him in the court of a thousand tiles , whose exquisite sea colors remain as blue and green to-day . Meknes draws the great road down from the uplands , fifteen hundred feet above the sea . This fabulous city , with a triple girdle of giant walls , is the African Versailles , a stupendous , barbarous jest of the Sultan Mulai Ismail , who aspired to wed the Princesse Conti , daughter of The Sun King ( Louis XIV ) by the exquisite La Valliere . Hearing that her would-be suitor already had 4,000 women at the disposal of his arrogance and was the father of 867 children , the French princess asked why the sultan needed another wife . " Madame , because in you he finds assembled in one all those qualities which in Morocco are divided among so many , " replied the ambassador . The princess regretted she could not leave Versailles , so 6o,000 slaves , Christian captives from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to build another Versailles , with stables for 12,000 horses and twice that number of slaves and grooms to wait on them . Mulai Ismail mu , : have been the victim of his own prodigioc imagination , for he planned double walls between Meknes and Marrakesh 300 miles is length , was obliged to pull down the first court of his palaces to provide material for the other and killed some 36,000 persons during his mani .. for construction . Yet time has dealt kindly witr. his orgies , turning them into dreams , unfinished as the great towers of Meknes , blurred at th edges with the gold of creeper and lichen . From Meknes of the half-deserted courts and fabulous palaces the road mounts to Volubilis , the Roman city whose ordered restraint Mulai Ismail robbed of column and altar , leaving it a web of scattered pavements , with here a trace of street or temple and there a well-head or a carving too insignificant for the sultan 's feast of stone . Here there is an inn kept by a Frenchman who can make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or New York , while his children tell solemn tales of Romans and fairies , offering fragments of age-old pottery lamps or some coins found among the ruins . And at last there is Fez , the ultimate jewel , set in hills , cushioned among olives . It is one of the few perfect cities of the world . The walls of the Almohades sultans , so sun-mellowed that they are like 6 apricot velvet , enclose the originality , the sim plicity , the mystery , the serenity of Fez , all the ingredients of its charm , so subtle and so rare that each traveler must come away , as I do , who have seen it many times , in silence . The essence of its wonder is that it is intangible . Of course it has all history to draw on . Here every age and creed has left its mark . It has bred warriors and dreamers ? sultans and saints have arisen to build its palaces and slender emerald minarets . It is the final expression of human fecundity . The narrow streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balconies , eddy with life . From the heart of the vine-roofed markets comes the unceasing hum of a hive . Yet the crowds have no special character . They are of all Eastern castes and types , a web of magnificent imagery wherein is woven all the glamour and enchantment that legend has given to time . Every house is Bluebeard 's , with its massive carved doors locked with a wooden key as large as a flute , its lantern borrowed from Aladdin , its shuttered tower , from which peeping slaves survey the roof pageant in search of gossip . There is Mulai Idris , among the world 's most sacred shrines , always perfumed with aloes , amber and musk , though no such scents are ever used in it . It is a place of refuge , from which no law can claim its prisoner , and from its precincts the refugee may safely claim audience of any officer provided he attend it bearing with him the Loha , a slate used by Mulai Idris as a child , and accompanied by one of the Mogaddams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Kairouin University , which has sent its preachers to all the deserts of the world , and it is here the wise men , wrapped in white woolen robes , teach philosophy , history and religion to pupils of all ages , in courts that are like emeralds , with fountains playing among the tiles . There are the shops of all industries , where each family uses its own inherited secrets to produce the glaze on such tiles , the orange in pottery that looks like fruit , the dye in leather tooled with gold and silver , the stiffness or the suppleness of harem silks . There is a market of birds where every root and branch of vine , every post or bench adds to the orchestra of sound . When night falls each cobbled path twisting by doorways like sudden glimpses of old tales is an Arabian Night 's adventure : follow one to an Arab cafe and watch the Negro musicians with their cymbals and the great gourd drums . Sip the bitter liquid , which a slave pours into a tiny handleless cup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should drink with you and bring you bad luck , while some girl of the 8 desert , supple and dark and indifferent , dances the oldest of all measures to the pulse of the girth 's heartbeating . Follow a little farther to palace , white-walled and shuttered , tiled , frescoed and flower-terraced , and here is a hotel which is so much a part of the dream that even - : efficiency is effortless . Back now the great road swings along the foot of the Atlas , with cedar forests in which the whole of Fontainebleau could be hidden , to the Oum er R'bia . This is the river boundary between North and South , the rubicon of invading armies , so that when the last of the sultan-pretenders ruling at Marrakesh crossed its waters , drums beating , banners flying , all Morocco knew he wanted the throne . By many a Berber castle of sun-baked bricks and mud walls and a dozen crenelated towers we slip down to the sea in those leviathan cars of the West to Mazagan , sixty miles from Casablanca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely honest English merchant " who made no money because of his virtues until the night before he left the town for good , when all the Moslems unexpectedly came hurrying in with their bags of money to pay their debts of fifty years . " So good a man must not go away empty , " they said . Safi has an incredible castle which looks as if  | it could never be taken , but the fall of Agadir in 1541 left it a Portuguese and Christian anomaly in a land reverting triumphantly to Islam . Strange people came to the markets of Mogador from snow-bound valleys in the Atlas , from desert oases , and France greets them with her hospitals and her schools , the weapons by which she has won the best of Morocco . Mogador is new among Moorish cities , but in the one hundred and fifty years of her history she has looked always across the desert , out of whose sands her red-gold palaces are built . On that road lies Agadir , exotic with its medley of races ? their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blacks and browns and all indeterminate shades . Agadir was the battlefield of Portugal and Islam , when , nearly four hundred years ago , the Castilian governor was captured and his daughter sent to the harem of the Moorish victor . It was a potential battlefield again when Germany sent the " Panther " to make good her claim to the coveted rich valleys of Sous , but , since 1917 , the peace of France has prospered it and , with hotel life , tennis courts and golf , excursions to historical Tarudant , falconry on the uplands , ostrich hunting in the Sahara and a perfect climate , it should be as popular as Algiers or Tunis . Marrakesh at sunset is the climax of artistic frenzy . Here nature is theatrical , surcharging the effect of red sand , red walls and palaces with the emerald of unnumbered palms and the icy blue of her mountain summits . If Fez holds all the beauty of storied time , Marrakesh is the triumph of nature in her most fabulous mood . Rose-red , with the passions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her sunshine , she combines and contrasts the life of a great desert oasis trading in dates and camels , with the imagery and taste of Andalusia , whose students once learned philosophy within her gates . Here is a nomad city of tents and caravans , of dark gypsy folk , bold of ornament and beauty , and within their scattered miles of canvas are the towers and battlements , the mighty gates and palaces of an imperial city which once ruled western Islam . All races of Africa , from blacks to pallid northern Arabs or the blue-eyed Berber descendants of the Vandals , mingle in the great market place . Every trade and pleasure , every rite and custom meet here in the brilliance of sand and sunshine which is the heart of Africa , and , from this heart , the western roads go forth over the edge of the horizon .  |
