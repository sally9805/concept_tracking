There is a small , dark , steelyeyed , supple man , whom statesmen often dub " the first diplomat in Europe , " whose accomplishments would stagger belief were they not chronicled in post-War history books . Dr. Edouard Benes* ; was an essential instrument in : 1 ) The partition of Austria-Hungary after the War . 2 ) The creation of Czechoslovakia as a state . 3 ) The drafting of the League Protocol . And in the creation of the Little Entente ( See INTERNATIONAL , p. 9 ) his was the master hand . <P> This Czechoslovakian superdiplomat returned to Prague last week , summoned in haste from a meeting of the Little Entente . There dinned upon his ears the demand of his party ( Czech National Socialist ) that he resign as Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia-as right hand man of patriarchal President Masaryk . <P> The reason for this astonishing demand was of a nature dear to politicians . The Czech National Socialists are engaged in attacking the government 's Grain Duties Act , a salutary bourgeois measure perhaps a trifle too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman of international stature to stumble upon this domestic molehill ? Dr. Benes , interviewed by pressmen , seemed disconcertingly cheerful . <P> " Suppose I resign ? " he asked quizzically . " Then , gentlemen , I might enjoy perhaps a year 's vacation-almost my first , and I am 42 . ... <P> " Why not ? Retirement has its uses for the man of many contacts . Small breaches heal or become clean cut . Afterwards the way is sometimes clearer . . . . <P> " My resignation from the Foreign Ministry would not disturb our international relations or the Little Entente . As an alternative I might resign from my party . My membership in a political party is somewhat of a technicality , since my policies are those of the state as a whole . . . . " * <P> Baffled by this superbly plausible and quite noncommittal interview , the news gatherers welcomed an apparently unequivocal statement by President Masaryk that he would under no circumstances accept the resignation of Dr. Benes . <P> A peasant 's son , a bad boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masaryk , later a starveling pamphleteer at Paris , Dr. Benes was one of the first men to guess which way the World War would jump . <P> In the fall of 1914 he sought Professor Masaryk with a fully drafted Czechoslovakian war program . Together they organized the Czech Mafia , a secret band of patriots who spied throughout Austria-Hungary during the War , providing Benes with material which he made the substance of dickers with the Allies . It was Benes who secured the recognition of the Czechoslovaks by the Allies ( 1917 ) as a people to be liberated from foreign rule . In 1918 he obtained from Balfour and Clemenceau recognition for Czechoslovakia , as " an Allied and Belligerent nation . " At that time French publicist Fournal wrote : " Benes has destroyed Austria-Hungary . " <P> Naturally this activity pivoted upon the Masaryk-Benes-initiated Czechoslovak revolutionary movement which they directed from Switzerland during the War . It is customary to regard Masaryk as the soul , Benes as the brain of their great achievement . <P> * Pronounced Benesh.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
