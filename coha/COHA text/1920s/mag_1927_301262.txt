3,500-Foot Insects <P> Sirs : That 's all applesauce about no flies or mosquitoes where the Coolidges are vacationing because it 's above the 3,500-foot elevation ( TIME , June 20 , p. 5 , last col . ) . There 's a big grizzly mounted and some pictures in the Smithsonian Institution that prove it . The pictures show where the bear was killed by Pete Peterson , Cascade mountains , elevation , 7,000 . The pictures also show on the grizzly , not 15 minutes dead , FLIES-LOTS OF ' EM . Farther east you go , the worse the flies are . As for mosquitoes , they are one of the joy-killers in mountain climbing . They will be found right at the snow on the edge of the glaciers , LOTS OF ' EM . The farther east you go the worse they get The only places I ever found either absent is where it is fairly breezy or pretty confounded dry . As for rattlers , they 're where you find ' em . But why worry ? It 's a rare thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of the victim dying . Autos are far more deadly . You 're a stickler for the truth , that 's the why of this letter . <P> F. J. CLIFFORD Spokane , Wash . <P> Sirs : TIME has been on my list of magazines ever since I got the first copy several years ago . I do not like it to print misleading statements so call attention to TIME , June 20 , p. 5. about flies and mosquitoes not being above 3,500 feet . The worst swarms of both I ever encountered were on Rabbit Ear Creek , tributary of Troublesome rivers , 20 or more miles north of Kremmling , Grand Co. , Col. , at an elevation of 8,000 feet . <P> T. JULIAN SKINKER Denver , Col. <P> Sirs : <P> ... I am curious to know on what authority TIME has discovered an " insect-line " at 2,500 feet above sea level . I have been plagued with the ordinary house fly in South America at altitudes above 12,000 feet , when there were horses to furnish the manure in which the flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME s " insect-line " and only wish it were as effective in Arizona as in one spot in South Dakota . I say " one spot , " advisedly , because when I was in the Black Hills at Lead , I can assure you the existence of a mythical line at an elevation of 2.500 feet , did not stop the inhabitants from screening the doors and windows . I will admit the general paucity of mosquitoes , but that was due , not to the elevation , but to the great lack of stagnant water in which they could breed . Unless the President bars all horses , except the " famed " electric horse , from the State Lodge , he would be wise not to tear off all the window screens from the kitchen . <P> H. C. HOPKINS Jerome , Ariz . <P> Sirs : TIME , June 20 , p. 6 , col. 3 says " no flies . . . can bother the President . At 3,500 feet . . . flies . . . cease . . . mosquito weakens . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Mt . Washington ( 6,293 ft. above sea level is the-summit ) . Fortunate ones spend time brushing away cinders , black flies , mosquitoes . The writer killed a very bloody mosquito 5,500 feet above sea level . Black flies penetrate far above timber line . Scientists may disagree , but I had " bites " to prove my case . Keep the red cover . It will aid newsstand sales . Red-white-blue cover would be unsatisfactory , I believe . <P> BUELL W. HUDSON Sugar Hill , N. H.
