At Newport , a banished king put on something of his former splendor . This was " Little Bill " Johnston , holder of the national championship in 1915 and 1919 . He deposed Harvey Snodgrass , 1923 winner of the Newport Casino invitation singles and , paired with C. J. ( " Peck " ) Griffin ( his former national doubles championship partner ) , seemed about to dismiss two other Californians , the omnipresent Kinsey brothers , from the doubles . That match had gone ding-dong for four sets and nine games when Robert Kinsey , on a stretching " get " , was crippled with cramps , had to default . <P> . . . <P> At Chestnut Hill , Mass. , tennis court-keepers put by their weeding-knives , rollers , mowers and whitewash carts . Out of the Longwood Cricket Club house came many pairs of players in white shirts , white flannels , white shoes . Play began for the men 's national doubles championships. * <P> * The national singles championships begin August 25 , at Forest Hills . L. I.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
