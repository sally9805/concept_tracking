WHEN the congregation is assembled , the Service begins with the singing , by ALL THE PEOPLE , of Felicia Hemans 's familiar hymn " The Pilgrim Fathers . " @x AS the strains of this Hymn are ceasing , a sturdy FIGURE enters the dimness of the left aisle at the back of the church . All in gray , clad in wide hat and long heavy CLOAK over Pilgrim 's garb , he bears in his right hand a heavy STAFF and under his left arm A GREAT BOOK , bound in old vellum , closed with an iron clasp . With pace of quiet power he strides up the aisle toward the Pulpit , but stops midway as A DEEP VOICE calls softly from the obscurity . THE VOICE Pilgrim ! ( The FIGURE pauses to listen ; the Call is repeated more loud . ) Pilgrim ! THE PILGRIM Who calleth from the dark ? ( He moves forward again toward the Pulpit . ) THE VOICE Pilgrim !  --  Pilgrim !  --  Whence have ye come hither ? THE PILGRIM From a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter blew the weather . THE VOICE Why have ye come , forlorn and famine-shod ? THE PILGRIM I seek .  --  I seek .  --  THE VOICE What seek ye here to find ? THE PILGRIM Freedom I seek : freedom to serve mankind ; Freedom to worship God . p. 4 Act 1 , Scene 2 SECOND ACTION ( The One in Black ) FROM shadow beyond the Pulpit , left , appears ONE IN BLACK , clad as a Pilgrim of the Middle Ages , in long robe and cowl . He approaches the PILGRIM IN GRAY , and speaks with the same voice that has been heard from the dark . THE ONE IN BLACK Ha , comrade ! Little have ye changed , I vow , Since first we met . THE PILGRIM * Removing his hat at this speech , the PILGRIM lays it near the Pulpit , where it remains till he takes it again at the final recessional . God save thee , friend ! But who art thou ? THE ONE IN BLACK I am anotherWho goes on pilgrimageIn every clime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Do ye not know me ? THE PILGRIM ( Astonished ) Nay . THE ONE IN BLACK Can ye forgetOur gracious garden , and that pleasant dayWhat time we woreNo cumbering weeds of drab and black , as nowOn this bleak shore , But all was endless MayUnder the green-and-golden apple bough ?  --  Now ye remember ! p. 5 THE PILGRIM ( Staring more close ) Nay . THE ONE IN BLACK Since then ye have wandered long and far away , And always I have trod upon your trail .  --  Once on your pilgrim shieldYou bore a Cross , to seek a shining grail ; Once in a lonely fieldYe labored , with bowed back , To bear uphill your heavy pilgrim 's pack , While ever , before end of day , I overtook you .  --  Ye recall now ? THE PILGRIM ( Turning to move on ) Nay . THE ONE IN BLACK Full soon ye shall . But stay  --  What stubborn device is this your right hand hath ? THE PILGRIM This is my Staff of Faith , to clear my path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And , lo , this garb which formsYour staff so brave appurtenance ? THE PILGRIM This is my Cloak of Strength against the stormsOf circumstance . THE ONE IN BLACK Your pardon if I look:There in your left hand  --  what is yonder Book ? p. 6 THE PILGRIM This is my Lantern in the starless night . THE ONE IN BLACK Ye show a lantern , but where shines the light ? THE PILGRIM Inward it guides the way . Behind this claspBeacons a double flame  --  the Old and New , Both testifying Truth , and burning throughBoth  --  shineth Revelation . THE ONE IN BLACK Let me graspThe Book , and break its hinge in two , And loose this hidden glory . THE PILGRIM Nay , Here force can find no way , Nor cunning pick the lock:They first must knockTo whom it shall be opened . THE ONE IN BLACK Yield it , pray , To me , for well I know a knock shall shake itAsunder.  --  Yield me here the Book , I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy threat I yieldThis holy Book , which many a yearI have in secret fended and concealedFrom Persecution . Dear , more dear , It still hath grown beneath all ban:Yea , like a spring , A living spring , its waters ranDown through the Valley of the Shadow of Death , ReplenishingPools of life among the parched rocks , Where , midst the lilies in the morning 's breath , The young bright Shepherd feeds his hallowed flocks . ( While the PILGRIM has spoken , from the dimness right has appeared the form of A DARK ANGEL , with locks of gray , and stern , cold face , bearing in his hands a cord-like chain . Stealthily , at a gesture from the ONE IN BLACK , he approaches the PILGRIM from behind. ) p. 7 THE ONE IN BLACK Brother , ye have a misconceitImagining ye can outwitThe wiles of Persecution . Haply yeAre most in jeopardyEven now and hereWhen ye are least in fear . THE PILGRIM How should that be ? For I have won now to a new-world shore , And brunted tide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rock , The Commonwealth of Freedom . So , no moreI dread old Persecution : let him standBefore me now ,  --  this staff of my right handShall cope with him . THE ONE IN BLACK The blindAre they who see before , but not  --  behind ! p. 8 Act 1 , Scene 3 THIRD ACTION ( Persecution ) WITH sudden swiftness , the DARK ANGEL plucks from behind the PILGRIM 'S cloak and staff , and throws about him coils of the tightening chain . THE PILGRIM ( Cries out . ) Who plucks my cloak ?  --  Ha , now ! Who binds me close , And rapes my staffAway ? What sudden ambush of my foesAm I now fallen in ? THE ONE IN BLACK ( Looks on , in deep laughter . ) Ah-ha-ha-ha ! THE PILGRIM ( Bewildered ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what art thou , to laughUpon thy brother in his sore chagrin ? THE ONE IN BLACK Ha , verily ! That ancient foeYe feared no more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so zealously bestowFreedom on a new world , now your own soulItself  --  behold in bondage ! THE PILGRIM Yea , alack ! Old Persecution , is it thouHast crept behind my back ? Release me ! For I dread lest my own browGrow pitiless as thine . p. 9 THE ONE IN BLACK ( TO PERSECUTION ) Nay , bondman mine:Keep him still fast ; and takeYon stick and tether him as to a stake , Here kneeling down . So let him seeWhether his Staff of Faith shall set him free . ( PERSECUTION obeys.Fixing the Staff upright in the floor , he binds against it  --  back to  --  the PILGRIM , who kneels with face toward the Pulpit , whence he turns his face right to speak to THE ONE IN BLACK . ) THE PILGRIM And art thou , then , my brother ? THE ONE IN BLACK &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea , The pilgrim partner of your way , Who now that ye are well bestowedWill ease you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No , no , not this ! Take allSave this ! THE ONE IN BLACK &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so ye may recallYour brother pilgrim by the brighter hueThat erst ye knew  --  Behold ! ( Flinging off his Cowl and Garb of Black , he stands smiling in long ROBE OF BRILLIANT RED , his locks of coppery gold bound with a shining Serpent . Staring , the PILGRIM murmurs aloud : ) p. 10 THE PILGRIM Satanas ! THE ONE IN BLACK Aye , and Ahriman , Asmodeus , Apollyon , Sammael , Lucifer ,  --  by all these ye name me well ! And now , by all my powers and conjuring namesYour holy Book would ban  --  Yield me the Book ! ( At his sign , PERSECUTION tears the Book from the PILGRIM , who utters a deep cry . ) THE PILGRIM Dear God ! Thou hast forsookThy Pilgrim ! SATANAS ( To PERSECUTION ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : bring here again . ( He takes the Book himself and , standing aloft in the Pulpit , holds it tauntingly above the PILGRIM beneath . ) Here , brother , lift your gaze ; For , lo , this lantern of your starless nightNow shall I break in twain , And let its double beacon blazeFull on your sight  --  And Revelation shine , to showIn the Shadow of Death , by the parched rocks , Waters of life , where the lilies blowAnd the young bright Shepherd feeds his hallowed flocks.Ah-ha ! Behold now , brother ! p. 11 THE PILGRIM Nay ! Desecrate it not ! SATANAS ( Tearing the Book in two , holds upward the two halves. ) * See Comment at end of volume , page 62 . Behold , your Ark of Light is void and smotherAnd cloven darkness ; yea , its holy visionIs even as a clotOf blindness , and its voice , a dumb derisionOf all your cry and yearning to be free . THE PILGRIM Ah me ! Is there no testament of libertyMy soul can cleave unto ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desire:The soul itself is doubt and quenchless fire ! Yea , even as this volume , tornIn twain , ' t is racked by inward feuds forlorn.So , Pilgrim , pray alone to your own shames.Farewell !  --  And thou , Bondman , bear forth this Book before me now.Pilgrim and Book are kindling for my flames ! ( Following PERSECUTION , SATANAS departs at the center . ) THE PILGRIM O God ! Now am I fallen , and thy frownIs over me . Now am I all alone  --  and down . p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 4 FOURTH ACTION ( Revelation : the Old Testament ) FROM beyond the Pulpit , at center , A GLOWING OF CANDLES begins to dawn , while clear the bird-sweet VOICE OF A BOY begins to choir in solo. * Concerning Music for this solo , see page 67 . THE VOICE He that is down need fear no fall , &nbsp; &nbsp; He that is low , no pride ; He that is humble ever shall &nbsp; &nbsp; Have God to be his guide . ( And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle , appears A RADIANT FORM , at right and left of whom two Choir-Boy CHERUBIM in blue bear in their hands TWO OPEN BOOKS OF GOLD . While the Three come forward , the BOY on the right continues to sing : ) I am content with what I have , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Little it be or much ; And , Lord , contentment still I crave &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because Thou savest such . Fullness to them a burden is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That go on pilgrimage:Here little , and hereafter bliss , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is best from age to age . ( The Three pause above , in front of the PILGRIM , who gazes up at them. ) p. 13 THE PILGRIM O music , that dost heal the wounds of wrong ! Spirit ! Art thou a voice made visible , Or some meek vision melted into song ? And thou , whose presence dawneth to fulfilMy faith  --  what art thou ? REVELATION &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE PILGRIM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whence rose thou here ? REVELATION Out of the Book , wherein I still do lieEver to rise again , and banish fearFrom the downfallen . THE PILGRIM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the Book was castInto the fire . REVELATION &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fire was but a blastTo waken me . THE PILGRIM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he , Satanas , rentThe holy Word in twain. p. 14 REVELATION &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The twain  --  behold ! Are risen even as I  --  each TestamentBy fire repurified to finer gold . THE PILGRIM That golden music  --  didst thou breathe it throughThe soul of one of these ? REVELATION These are the reedsOf my eternal organ : the Old , the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower in childhood . These are CherubimWho bring to set you free , with Word and Hymn , The Book whose truth is freedom . But the firstTo testify shall be the Old , whose voiceRevealeth those of yore who knew the thirstOf Persecution 's bondage , and made choiceAgainst the Oppressor 's chain , to succor lawOf liberty  --  to objurgate the aweOf power  --  and purge the intimidated throngWith psalmd speech and sacraments of song . THE PILGRIM So shall my chain be loosed , and I restoredTo freedom ? REVELATION &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes ; but only if the WordThose testify be kindled in thy willTo emulation . Therefore , Pilgrim , tillThe Three , whom I invoke , convene their Laws , Prophets , and Psalms , here to befriend thy cause , Kneel on , and pray , and quicken in thy heartResponsive choirs.  --  So will I departNow with the New , and let the Old presideOver these rites , for which  --  the first to speakIn witness  --  I summon him who from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 Act 1 , Scene 5 FIFTH ACTION ( The Laws ) WHILE REVELATION and the SPIRIT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT withdraw at center , the SPIRIT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT  --  placing his Gold Volume open on the Pulpit  --  chants with Choir-Boy Voice . THE OLD TESTAMENT Ye , who were the strength of my peopleIn the wilderness , Ye Laws , and Moses who leadeth you , Succor now this Pilgrim !

Long ages had his earth-born child &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wandered to rob and kill ; But now God spake , to guide the wild &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Digressions of his will . God spake , and on his tablet sealed &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With sign of his First CauseThose great commandments which revealed &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The grandeur of his Laws . p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 6 SIXTH ACTION ( The Psalms ) AT the expiration of this hymn , the SPIRIT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT chants again above the kneeling PILGRIM . THE OLD TESTAMENT Ye , who were the consolation of my sorrowsIn exile and pain , Ye Psalms , and David who leadeth you , Comfort here this Pilgrim !

My tears they call me , day and night : &nbsp; My soul , where is thy God ? Why art thou , O my soul , cast down ?  --  &nbsp; His countenance shall shine . Deep calleth unto deep , amid &nbsp; &nbsp; Noise of thy waterspouts , And all thy waves and billows are &nbsp; &nbsp; Gone over me , O Lord ! Yet shall thy lovingkindness be &nbsp; &nbsp; My rock in the daytime , And in the night thy song shall lift &nbsp; &nbsp; My prayer to thee , my life ! p. 18 Act 1 , Scene 7 SEVENTH ACTION ( The Prophets ) ON the conclusion of this Processional Hymn , the SPIRIT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT chants once more above the PILGRIM in prayer . THE OLD TESTAMENT Ye , who were trumpets of my aspirationIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who leadeth you , Rouse ye up this Pilgrim !

Our Lord , who tore the sultry void &nbsp; &nbsp; With whirlwinds of his thunder-stone , He cleanseth too our spirits cloyed  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; He is our paean and our moan .

After a moment of silence , very low , the organ begins to play ; and now , while it continues , * Through all the speeches which follow , till FEAR OF DEATH enters , the organ continues to play very softly . the PILGRIM speaks . THE PILGRIM Ye , which are present in my prayer , And compass me about with choirsOf holy hymns , forbearAwhile your ministry of song , and nowQuicken me with your living Word : yea , thouMoses , that from the mountain fetched the firesOf God to purge our bondage , succor me !  --  How shall I cleanse my soul 's captivity ? ( Answering from his place in the body of the church , among the LAWS , MOSES speaks to the PILGRIM . ) MOSES Lo , it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity , and will rejoice over thee for good , If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God , to keep his commandments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law , and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.For this commandment which I command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee , neither is it far off.It is not in heaven , that thou shouldst say , Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it and do it ? Neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldst say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it and do it ? But the Word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayst do it . p. 20 THE PILGRIM Nay , is my help so nigh ? Yet , in my heartI have denounced the forgers of my chains , And cursed their sore corrupting smart , And said  --  There is no succor for my pains ! ( From his place amid the Group of the PSALMS , the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) DAVID The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God : They are corrupt , they have done abominable works , there is none that doeth good ! But fret not thyself because of evildoers , neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity , For they shall soon be cut down like the grass , and wither as the green herb ; But the meek shall inherit the earth , and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace . The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God:But I waited patiently for the Lord , and he inclined unto me and heard my cry ; He brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my foot upon a rock , and established my goings.And he hath put a new song in my mouth:The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want.He maketh me to lie down in green pastures ; he leadeth me beside the still waters.He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil ; for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God:But the earth is the Lord 's and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein ; The heavens declareth the glory of God ; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork.Therefore , rejoice in the Lord , O ye righteous ; Praise ye the Lord ! Praise him , sun and moon ; praise him , ye stars of light ! p. 21 THE PILGRIM Yea , stars of light , and sun and moon , They praise him with immortal lips , O David ; yet in night and noonMy soul still struggles with eclipse , Half darkling in a torpid shroud , Half shining free:Ah , Wind of God ! When wilt thou rend the cloudThat cumbereth me ? ( From his place among the PROPHETS , ISAIAH makes answer to the PILGRIM , in kindling tones . ) ISAIAH Awake , awake , put on strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and come unto me : hear , and your soul shall live ; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you , even the sure mercies of David.Behold , I have given him as a witness to the people , a leader and commander of the people.Even so the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me ; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek ; he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.Awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the Lord ! Where is the fury of the oppressor ? The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed , and that he should not die in the pit.But I am the Lord thy God , that divided the sea , And I have put my words in thy mouth , and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand ; I , even I , am he that comforteth you.For a small moment have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee ; The mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed ; For as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater ; So shall my Word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void ; For ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.Therefore , awake , awake , stand up , O captive ! Break forth into joy , for the Lord hath comforted his own !

THE PILGRIM Now are my shackles loosed , O gracious Lord ! Now am I free again and strong.And ye , dear elder brothers of the Book , Prophets of Law , and Righteousness , and Song , I give you thanks , who have restoredMy cloak and staff , and tookMy chain away.Henceforward , come what may , Now can I go my path aloneAnd have no fear of life . ( As MOSES , DAVID , and ISAIAH are returning to their places , * Here the organ begins again very softly to play , continuing till it swells to a crescendo at the burst of radiant light and reappearance of REVELATION . the voice of SATANAS is heard calling low  --  this time from the shadow on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PILGRIM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What toneEchoes once more from some dark place of dread Concealed ? p. 24 THE VOICE Pilgrim !

THE PILGRIM Ah me ! Lo , I am overtaken hereBy Fear of Death .  --  Now is there none shall freeMy vision to behold the light again ? SATANAS ( Appearing , from the right , in front of the blindfold PILGRIM ) Nay , evermore shall ye be shut withinThe dark of your own soul , to share with SinA charnel of the blind , and grope in vainTo escape the creeping hand of Death , his clutchAbout thy heart .

THE NEW TESTAMENT Come unto this Pilgrim , Ye , who have spread the gospel of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , St. Paul:Yea , bring him life eternal ! ( Enter now in procession , with symbol and vestment , the GROUP of the APOSTLES , led by ST . PAUL , who wears a Fillet with a Cross . These come singing , and take their places during their Hymn , in which ALL THE PEOPLE join . ) HYMN VIII ( Sung by ALL , to the tune of Coronation ) All hail the power of Jesus ' name ; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let angels prostrate fall ; Bring forth the royal diadem , &nbsp; &nbsp; And crown him Lord of all . Let every kindred , every tribe , &nbsp; &nbsp; On this terrestrial ball , To him all majesty ascribe , &nbsp; &nbsp; And crown him Lord of all . Oh that , with yonder sacred throng , &nbsp; &nbsp; We at his feet may fall , And join the everlasting song , &nbsp; &nbsp; And crown him Lord of all ! p. 32 Act 2 , Scene 7 FIFTEENTH ACTION ( The Star , St. John , St. Paul ) TO all the assembled Groups and Congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more REVELATION , who speaks from above , in the Pulpit . REVELATION Shepherds , Disciples , and Apostles , yeWho come to join your shining companyUnto the Laws and Prophets and the PsalmsOf old , bestow ye now the healing balmsOf your New TestamentUpon this Pilgrim , pentIn yonder shroud of dark adversity . ( As REVELATION withdraws at the center , the SPIRIT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT  --  approaching , below , the covered form of the PILGRIM  --  stands beside it and chants with choiring voice . ) THE NEW TESTAMENT Now under his black pallThe Pilgrim hearkenethThe tidings of the Angel of the Star . THE ANGEL OF THE STAR ( Speaks from his place , in the body of the church , amid the SHEPHERDS . ) Now in the days of Herod the King , behold , wise men from the east came to Jerusalem , saying , Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and are come to worship him . And when Herod the King had heard it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared . And he sent them to Bethlehem , and they went their way ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was . And when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy . And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother ; and they fell down and worshiped him . ( The form of the PILGRIM stirs , and partly rises underneath his Dark Cloth , while the ANGEL continues without pause : ) Then took they down from the cross the body of Jesus , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth . Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden Joseph 's new sepulchre hewn out of rock wherein was never man yet laid . There they laid Jesus , and rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre.And when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying , Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre ? for it was exceeding great ; and looking up , they saw that the stone was rolled back . And entering , they saw a young man arrayed in a white robe : And he saith unto them , Be not amazed : ye seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who hath been crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : Why seek ye the living among the dead ? And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy , and ran to bring this word to the disciples . ( As the ANGEL concludes , the SPIRIT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT draws back the Dark Shroud , revealing there the blindfold PILGRIM having risen to a kneeling posture , from which he cries out , with upclasped hands : ) p. 33 THE PILGRIM A voice ! A voice of light ! I heardA shining and a healing Word .  --  Whence came that Light ? Whence rose that Word ? ST . JOHN ( Speaks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . In him was Life ; and the Life was the Light of men . And the Light shineth in the darkness , and the darkness overcame it not.And the Word became flesh , and dwelt among us , full of grace and truth ; for the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.And then it came to pass , as Jesus was teaching the people , that they were all astonished at his teaching ; for his word was with authority . And they said , Whence hath this man this wisdom ? Jesus therefore answered them and said:The words that I speak unto you I speak not from myself ; but the Father abiding in me doeth his works . The word therefore which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's who sent me . If ye abide in my Word , then are ye truly my disciples ; and ye shall know the truth ; and the truth shall make you free.In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have overcome the world.For I am the resurrection and the life : he that believeth on me , though he were dead , yet shall he live ; and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die.Verily , verily , I say unto you , he that heareth my Word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath eternal life.Wherefore , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awake , thou that sleepest , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And arise from the dead , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Christ shall give thee light . p. 34 THE PILGRIM ( Rising to his feet above the Black Garment , speaks aloud . ) Behold , I am awakened , and once moreI rise , seeking the light:But what immortal breathShall thaw this freezing band before my sight , Which Fear of DeathHath bound my brows withal ? Yea , I who erst was thrallTo Persecution , now to Fear , what newCommandment of the Word can liberateFear unto faith , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Answers from his place among the APOSTLES : ) Lo , my beloved , bless them that persecute you ; yea , bless , and curse not ; For all the commandments are summed up in this word , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . Love worketh no ill to his neighbor : love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.For though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I am become sounding brass , or a clanging cymbal.And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing.Love suffereth long , and is kind ; love envieth not ; love vaunted not itself , is not puffed up , doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not its own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ; rejoiceth not in unrighteousness , but rejoiceth with the truth ; beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of Christ ; for in Christ Jesus naught availeth anything save faithful work through love . So , beloved , ye were called for freedom , for where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty ; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh , for flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.Behold , I shew you a mystery . For this corruption must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality.So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory.O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ? ( As ST . PAUL concludes , All the Assembled GROUPS and the CONGREGATION break forth into singing . During their Hymn , the ANGEL OF THE STAR , ST . JOHN , and ST . PAUL gather beside the PILGRIM , where the ANGEL OF THE STAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black band is handed by the ANGEL to the SPIRIT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT , who  --  with the SPIRIT OF THE OLD , carrying the cord-like chain  --  retires at center , where soon both are to reappear . while the other two restore his Staff and Cloak. ) p. 35 HYMN IX ( Sung by ALL , to the tune of Amsterdam ) Rise , my soul , and stretch thy wings , &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy better portion trace ; Rise from transitory things &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward heaven , thy destined place.Sun and moon and stars decay , &nbsp; &nbsp; Time shall soon this earth remove ; Rise , my soul , and haste away &nbsp; &nbsp; To seats prepared above ! p. 36 Act 2 , Scene 8 SIXTEENTH ACTION ( The Commonwealth of Man ) TURNING to the assembled GROUPS and their LEADERS , the PILGRIM speaks to them .
