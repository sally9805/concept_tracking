It is reported from Rome that Pope Pius XI will soon hold a consistory ( senate composed of Pope and Cardinals ) . It is uncertain whether he will create any new cardinals . <P> It is stated , however , in Vatican circles , that no American will be given the Red Hat . If any new cardinals are elected , they will in all probability be Italians .
