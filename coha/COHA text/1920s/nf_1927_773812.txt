txt I O RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION Not only does the normal man have this capacity for experiencing the sense of the sacred , but he demands its satisfaction . This may come through the services of an organised Church , as is shown by the Russian peasants who in many places are insisting on building new churches in place of those official Bolshevism has destroyed or turned to other uses ; or through artistic expression ; or through a religiously-felt morality , the necessity of which to some minds has been so finely put in Romola by George Eliot that I can not forbear from quoting : ? " The highest sort of happiness often brings so much pain with it , that we can only tell it from pain by its being what we would choose before everything else , because our souls see it is good . " I use the term " sense of the sacred " or " sense of the holy " for want of a better . Had it not been overlain by all sorts of alien and irrelevant ideas , religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers that are behind Nature ; the mysteries that confront the inquiring mind ; the great moments of man , his birth , his marriage , and his death ; the revelations of art and knowledge ; the moral ideal and the practice of good ? all these and many others may be objects of religion , but are not so of necessity . They only come within the ambit of religion in so far as they are touched with sanctity by the mind , in so far as they are thought of and felt as sacred . So we may have holy joy and sacred sorrow ; sanctified revenge , religious war ; sacred rite and sacred art ; morality tinged , not simply with emotion , but with this one particular emotion or sentiment of sanctity ; intellectual acts which , because // fused with a feeling of awe , are religious ; any and every activity of man , whether cruelty or kindness , love or hate , bigo - ry or enlightenment ; bestial rite or most lovely expression of thought , may be experienced as sacred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become and be religious . The sense of the holy is a highly complex frame of mind . One of its chief psychological accompaniments is awe , which is itself complex , with fear , wonder , and admiration all entering into it as ingredients . Reverence , into which there also enters submissiveness as an element , is a frequent if by no means invariable accompaniment . But mystery may probably be regarded as its real essence , with awe as necessary , and reverence as common , ingredient . The mystery may be merely the vulgar mystery of the unusual or strange . The mysteriousness of this may be wholly removed by education and knowledge . But be it noted , comprehension , in the ordinary sense of understanding the past causal sequence by which such and such an event or organism came into existence , or of analysis of event or organism into its component parts , with an understanding of how they work ? this does not by any means necessarily rob the being or thing considered of mystery ; but now it is a mystery which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated sense . Precisely the same thing , of course , is to be seen with art . Many birds and animals are attracted by bright colours ; so are savages and children , who also love the bizarre and the crude , indulging their fancy without reference to any consciously or unconsciously held body of principles . With the maturing of the mind , however , taste changes . It finds raw or F // trivial what delighted it before ; but , though it may despise that by which it was once captured , it finds new beauties to love , and , what s more , still loves them by means of the same faculty ? only newdisciplined , matured and entered into relations with reason , experience , and other emotions ? which in childhood loved a bright patchwork of colours or in adolescence the most sentimental of pictures . Another characteristic of the sense of mystery in the disciplined mind is that it tends to find its objects more and more in the familiar , less in the merely unusual . This , too , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncompleted phase of art which gives us programme-music , subject-pictures , the purely narrative poem or story , the building which is striking at all costs . The great artist can make a kitchen table contain more beauty and meaning than a second-rate hand can infuse into a picture of the greatest event in history ; and the finest works of art deal often with the simplest and most familiar human verities . So with religion . The gaping spirit which needs to be stimulated by extravagance , miracle , or catastrophe , gives place to the insight which finds in the commonest facts material for reverence , wonder , or love . As Wordsworth put it , describing his wife and his love for her : " She was a phantom of delight When first she gleam 'd upon my sight . " Later , with full knowledge , " And-now I see with eye serene , The very pulse of the machine . . . . ... and yet a Spirit stall , and bright With something of angelic light . " // When the fact of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for miracle in the vulgar sense . There is still another point in which religion resembles art : good intentions are not enough . A man with a good natural taste , or with one that has been well trained and disciplined , will find certain attempts at artistic expression definitely wrong ; they are to him not merely crude or immature or incomplete ? those qualities can be readily forgiven ? but they arouse in him a definite feeling of hostility or distaste owing to their stressing the lower at the expense of the higher , or distorting the whole scheme of values so as to become , to him , without value or even with a negative value . When sickly sentiment takes the place of genuine feeling , when vulgarity takes the place of humour , when unreal motives are exalted at the expense of the strong reality of every day ? then the result is intolerable to the man who knows better , in the same sort of way as it is intolerable to hear or see something which to us is supremely valuable greeted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole religions , as well as the religious views of many individual persons , to which the man who is acute or sensitive in his religious perceptions and emotions reacts simply by a feeling of repulsion , so incongruous or so pretentious do they appear . Precisely the same is true of their moral aspect ; and no amount of sincerity can condone , to those who have higher standards , the sanctification of evil through religion . For one or other of these reasons , many religions and religious actions are bound to // seem repulsive or wicked to the developed religious consciousness . Nothing can make the religious sacrifice of human beings by the Aztecs seem anything but evil to us . We are filled with horror when we find that they took pleasure in representing , in their sacred art , the victim biting clean through his tongue in the moment of agony , presumably since the greater the pain of the victim the more would the God appreciate the sacrifice . On the other side , those who feel anything of the austerity of religion can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by certain representatives of certain Christian bodies , of a religiosity of sentiment , especially among emotional women , which takes the undisciplined overflow of adolescence and sexual feeling , directs it on to religious objects , and in so doing not only encourages morbidity but degrades the objects of worship themselves . The chief ways in which religion has been moulded seem to be somewhat as follows . In the first place , man demands some sort of explanation of the world and of his place in it . He dislikes to leave a mystery completely unexplained , though he rather prefers le a.mg it with some mysteriousness , and not wholly explained in a banal way His attempts at intellectual explanation of facts which give rise to religious feeling are theology . First of all , these attempts are either crude rationalisations or else myths ? in other words , they are attempts to provide rational support for a desire without having real evidence or reasons at hand . In the case of myths , the desire is primarily the desire for explanation itself ; there may also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gratify other desires , such as that for immortality . Logic and experience both then set to work on these " explanations , " and proceed to improve them . Logic improves by attempting to make them more complete , by trying to remove inherent contradictions ; experience tries to mould the explanations into greater conformity with observed facts . It is true that in origin religion has nothing whatever to do with belief in a God or Gods , or with abstract good as against abstract evil , or with the salvation of souls , or with obedience to this or that revelation . These are all later growths , more elaborate dwellings for the religious spirit . But it is equally true that , inevitably and universally as man 's accumulated experience grows and his logic comes into play , he will find certain things and ideas to which this quality of sacredness seems of necessity to adhere . The sense of the sacred is only the root of the matter . Religion as it developed ? perhaps even from the first ? has involved intellect and morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has attached its feeling of sacredness to all sorts of objects and ideas . Logic and experience do not always tend in the same direction , since logic will very often take certain premisses for granted as self-evident ( e.g. , that a personal God exists ) and then draw conclusions from them . The conclusions may bear no relation to facts , or may even contradict experience ; but such conclusions of logic are often preferred by humanity to the conclusions of experience . One process which from the beginning makes // itself felt is the transference of the feeling of sanctity experienced in relation to certain objects or , events , to the explanation later advanced to account for the objects or events . This is due to the principle of association so fundamental in the human mind . So theology becomes sacrosanct , taboo to altera-tions , in a way not found with scientific doctrines . This accounts for the fact that there is such irrational but strong resistance , on the part of religious people , to theological changes ? the proposals made are not weighed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling . In addition , the force of authority is introduced . This comes about in two ways . For one thing , the mere fact of immemorial tradition becomes in itself sacred , and the fact that things have been done in one particular way for generations in the past becomes a valid reason for continuing to do so in the present and the future . And , secondly , the desire for reinforcing the sanctity of beliefs lead frequently to the assertion that they have been revealed , directly or indirectly , by supernatural authority . Religious conservatism is thus aided both by the authority of tradition and by that of revelation . The foregoing shows how two separate bodies of explanation of phenomena can grow up side by side ? theology and natural science . The one has grown up round objects experienced as sacred ; the other has grown up round common objects , not regarded as worth consideration by religious intellects . But , unfortunately , explanations can not be kept to localised regions of reality . Conclusions drawn from sacred science or theology overflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while natural science , pursuing its // humdrum methods , eventually comes to apply them to objects regarded as sacred as well as to ordinary ones . It is thus probable that in the development of civilisations there will always come a time when science and theology will find themselves in conflict . Science and theology start in different regions of experience ; the men who pursue the one are generally of very different type from the devotees of the other ; and the emotional backgrounds of the two are quite different . But they inevitably grow , and therefore inevitably invade each other 's territory . The only possible solution , save an indefinite prolongation of the conflict , is for religion to admit the intellectual methods of science to be as valid in theology as everywhere else , while science admits the psychological basis of religion as an ultimate fact . The first point we have made is that the process of association can and does bring intellectual explanation , or at least certain attempts at a certain kind of intellectual explanation , into connection with religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific religious quality of sanctity . In precisely the same way , moral ideas can and do become linked by association with religion , and therefore sacred . Morals appear to acquire religious associations in several separate ways . In the first place the " negative sacredness , " of which taboo is the developed form , becomes directly attached to actions which are found to shock one 's own feelings or those of the community ; these will include actions calculated to disturb any accepted sense of I68 RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION sacredness , like laughing in church , or quarrelling at a graveside ; and also actions which run counter to the accepted standards of the community , as ' when a member of a warlike tribe shows cowardice , a member of a respectable Puritan family obtains a divorce , or a member of an aristocratic clan , in the days before the war , expressed a desire to become an actor or a professional violinist . Thus a great deal of what we may call tribal morality and custom , merely for the reason that it is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , comes to have a certain religious sanctity attached to it , although without necessarily being thought of as having any connection with supernatural beings . Meanwhile , however , the belief in supernatural beings is in existence . If they exist as personalities in any way like us , they too must have their morality ? they are responsible for the governance of the world , they cause events to take place in accordance with their wishes . The more man 's reason gets to work on his religious problems , the more difficult does he find it to ascribe low moral motives and insight to his Gods . At any particular time in history the moral character of his Gods comes largely to reflect his own moral ideas ; but various peculiarities are added . Logic gradually compels the idea that the moral , like the intellectual and other qualities of God are absolute and complete ? that God is not only more powerful , better , and possessed of more knowledge than we , but all-knowing , omnipotent , and absolutely , good . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge to the moral SOME FUNDAMENTALS 16q character of God . Two tendencies have , as a matter of fact , resulted from these two aspects of the problem . Either man , in his theology , prefers to see a God of absolute good perpetually in conflict with a Devil or supernatural being of evil nature ; or else ( which better satisfies the desire for logical unity ) , he ascribes to God wisdom and kindness infinitely transcending our own , so that evil of all sorts , including pain and misfortune , but especially moral evil , which seems so intolerable to us and so repugnant to our moral sense , is to God 's absolute knowledge a necessity for our spiritual development , to his transcendent wisdom an obligatory move in the working out of the cosmic plan . The two ideas are combined in an extremely curious way in Milton 's Paradise Lost . Satan is a prominent personage of the cosmic drama , but the conflict between him and God is not a fair fight , like that in Persian theology between Ormuzd and Ahriman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Devils do not know with certainty , that the Almighty is omniscient and omnipotent , and that all the machinations of the Fiend are therefore fore-doomed to failure as certainly ( though for a different reason ) as those of the villain in a good old-fashioned melodrama . It is this hard incongruity which makes Milton 's great epic take rank below Homer 's or Vergil 's or that other great poem of cosmic scope , the Divina Commedia . Freud believes that the reason why the forces of Nature are personified as a paternalist ruler or divine father is to be sought in a universal infantile father - complex . The matter does not , I confess , seem so straightforward to me . On the other hand , // once theistic personification has been accomplished , it would be natural for transference of any ideas and emotional forces which might arise from infantile complexes concerning parents , to the theological sphere . I think it very probable that certain views about and still more certain feelings towards God may owe a great deal to this cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to acquire connection with religious feeling in several different ways . It has frequently been maintained that religious belief is needed as a buttress to both private and still more to public morality . Matthew Hales , a noted judge at the close of the seventeenth century , could write : ? " To say that religion is a cheat is to dissolve all those obligations whereby civil societies are preserved . " This idea has been , however , so often exploded that it is not worth while slaying the slain and going over once more the ground so well covered by Lecky , Westermarek , and others . I will content myself by quoting E. S. P. Haynes ' dictum , that " if morality did really depend on other-worldly sanctions , the religious changes of the last fifty years would by now have dissolved society at large . " But apropos of the question of divine personality it is worth while recalling , with Santayana , that " what makes for righteousness , the conditions of successful living , need not be moral in a personal sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be themselves on fire . " And let us also remember that the undue association of morals with religion has tended to surround morality with such a coat of untouchable sanctity that too often for this very reason // moral progress has been much slower than might otherwise have been the case . The final upshot is a compromise . By the time morals begin to be thought about instead of accepted as necessary tradition , the idea of a supernatural being in control of religious affairs has come into being . Logic , applied to man 's developing moral sense , tends to make this supernatural being a model of moral perfection . On the other hand , the facts of life , including the problem of evil , had long previously claimed attention and demanded , if possible , some explanation ; and various theological myths had been invented for this purpose . Very frequently these myths involve actions or ideas of deity which are hardly consistent with a more developed morality . In these cases there is a cleavage between two views of God , a logical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often simply slurred over . In the Book of Job the difficulty is faced . It is the problem of evil in its simplest form , in the form in which it haunted the practical mind of the early Hebrew , set upon this life rather than the next , upon national success and survival rather than any personal immortality . Why do the wicked prosper , wax fat and kick ; why do misfortunes fall upon the innocent or those who have done their best to be upright ? Job poses the question as applied to his own plight . His three friends answer , with the simple but crude faith which believes what it thinks ought to be so , " because you have deserved it . " But job knows this is not so . He appeals to Jehovah himself . And he is answered by Jehovah himself . The answer is as simple as that of the three comforters ; it is not // much more comforting : but it is sublime instead of puerile , it symbolises a true fact instead of a false hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord ; because my ways are not your ways ; because you can not understand the divine purpose ; because ulti-mate reality is and always will be a mystery , to be feared as well as loved . " ' On the other hand , sublime as this idea may be , it still involves all sorts of difficulties on the theistic plane which are avoided if religion does not per-sonify its objects of worship . In this chapter I have attempted to advance two main ideas , both of them unfamiliar . One is that the , Essence of religion springs from man 's capacity for awe and reverence , that the objects of religion , however much later rationalised by intellect or moralised by ethics , however fossilised by conven-tion or degraded by superstition or fear , are in origin and essence those things , events , and ideas which arouse the feeling of sacredness . On this point , with the testimony of anthropologists and archbishops to back me , I hope to have convinced my readers . The other is that the idea of supernatural divine beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , is an intellectual rationalisation which was necessary , or at least inevitable , at a certain primitive level of thought and culture ; which was then , the crucial assumption once made , worked on by man 's intellect and by his ethical sense to give such high conceptions as that of the God of the Jews from // after the Exile , or the God of most modern Christian churches ; but which now must be abandoned if further religious progress is to be made . Further evidence for these views will be found in the two subsequent chapters , especially in that on comparative religion . These ideas , I know , are unfamiliar to the great majority . I know also that when a man has been accustomed to approach a problem from one angle and is then asked to approach it from another wholly different angle , the result is usually bewilderment , or annoyance , or both . The mental constructions we have built up have their foundations and top storey , their roots and branches , their feet and head : to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house on its side before living in it , or to make our ideas go about standing on their heads . None the less , the history of thought shows clearly enough that thus to turn an idea upside-down may be fruitful and necessary , and that it is of the greatest importance that humanity should now and again take out its beliefs for spring-cleaning . In pure science an example is afforded by Mendelism , which makes the idea of invisible units the startingppoint in a study of heredity , instead of thinking backwards from the visible characters of the plant or animal . Darwin 's great idea of Natural Selection was another case of reversal of current thought ; the delicate adaptation which was previously hailed as proof of purpose in a divine artificer was now approached from the other side and seen to be the necessary outcome of non-purposeful variation and selection . The present position in philosophy , arisen largely through the development of Einstein 's // relativity theory , is another case in point . Most people are so used to taking space and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of their thought shattered when asked to think of them as relative and as a method of thinking rather than as externally real . Or , to take an example from the ethical sphere , to the average barbarian , the average Jew , or the average Roman , at the beginning of our era , maxims such as the duty of loving your enemies must have seemed complete topsy-turvydom . It was the duty of the good tribesman , the good Jew , the good citizen to hate his enemies . The Jew at least had plenty of divine authority for smiting them . And yet even opponents of Christianity would be compelled to admit that the world , however incompletely it has carried out the precept , has found it to contain deeper truth than its opposite . But if religion is not essentially belief in a God or Gods and obedience to their commands or will , what then is it ? It is a way of life , an art like other kinds of living , and an art which must be practised like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Religious emotion will always exist , will always demand expression . The ways in which it finds expression may be good or may be bad : or , what seems hardly to have been realised , they may be on the whole good for the individual worshipper but bad for the community . Man 's scale of desires and values , his spiritual capacities , dictate the direction of his religion , the goal towards which it aspires ; the facts of Nature and life dictate the limits within // which it may move , the trellis on whose framework those desires and emotions must grow if they are to receive the beams of truth 's sun , if they aspire above creeping on the ground . It is our duty to know those outer facts truly and completely , to be willing to face all truth and not to try to reject what does not tally with our desires : and it is our duty to realise our own capacities , to know what desires are to be put in command , what desires are to be harnessed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling and will under the joint guidance of reverence and reason . In so far as we do this , we prevent the man of devout religious feeling from being subordinated to a system which may organise the spirit of religion in opposition to discovery or necessary change , or may discharge its power in cruelty and persecution ; and we help religion to help the progress of civilisation . But in so far as we neglect this , we are making man a house divided against itself , and allowing the strong tides of religious feeling to run to waste or to break in and devastate the fruit of man 's labour . And the choice is in our own hands . Tantum religio potent suadere malorum. ? LUCRETIUS . There 's naught , no doubt , so much the spirit calms As Rum and true Religion . ? LORD BYRON , Doll Juan . The life of Reason alone is free from Magic. ? PLOTINUS . The diversity of the world is natural . Yet not less natural is this liability to accept its own diversity . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Nature becomes diverse , fantastic , seemingly artificial . It is by that same limitation that these diverse forms can not accept each other . I recall the critical , disdainful gaze of a small terrier as he stood still to watch a great goose pass by .

A God , like a man , can only be judged by the standard of the age to which he belongs ; for experience seems to show that the ethical code of a deity is seldom superior , and may be distinctly inferior , to that of his human contemporaries. ?

Parson Thwackum , in FIELDING 'S Tom Jones . // Conparative Religion IT will be as well to give some further account of religion from the dispassionate point of view of the student . There are those who have a genius for religion , as others have a genius for poetry , or for lawn-tennis . They will be saints as surely as the others will be poets or champions . But religion differs from the other activities we have mentioned in that it is not exhausted in its own performance , like a game , nor is it even like art , whose direct efforts are confined to its own sphere . For it is not only individual , but social ; and it is not only emotional , but overflows in action . In these respects it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man may be a great scientist although his scientific beliefs are in the main erroneous . He will be great in so far as he has seen some new fact or principle hitherto hidden . But the logic of his discovery ( sometimes true logic , sometimes false ) will be embodied in action by lesser men in ways of which he never dreamed ; and these logical principles all the time demand new checking , new facts , new vision . The alchemists were rightly excited over the transmutation of one substance into another wholly different substance in their crucibles under the influence of heat or of mixture with some other material : but the conclusions which they drew 177 // from this ? that the elements were indefinitely transmutable , and that materials existed capable of turning any base substance into a noble one ? these resulted in an extraordinary waste of human effort and expense . Pasteur was one of the greatest men of science who have ever existed . His full proof that not even microscopic life was generated except from existing life , his discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or microscopic animal parasites , and his further discovery that immunisation against bacterial disease was possible ? these opened the door to a vast and beneficent increase of control over human suffering . But time alone will show whether the pushing to their extreme of the conclusions to be drawn from these discoveries , at the expense of other avenues to discovery , may not have led to a very considerable waste of time and energy , and even in some directions have led to loss of health and life instead of to gain . The stressing of the parasite as " the cause " of disease , and of artificial immunity as the best protection or cure , led to the comparative neglect of all other causes , prominent among which are the variations in disease-resistance due to variations in health and physiological state and those which are congenital . At the present moment , for instance , huge sums of money are being spent on a frontal attack upon cancer , inspired in the long run by Pasteurian ideas . It is , however , at least possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical physiology , or in t - le study of heredity , and that dietetics or even eugenics may one day turn the flank of the enemy . Time alone will show . // So ( though of course with a difference ) in religion . Religion is in one sense an individual illumination ; it is a holy and a beautiful way of living one 's own life . But the individual illumination can only light up what is there ; the bright light in the soul lights up the room in which the soul lives ? its time and place , the thought of that time and that place ; and the picture thus made , by illumination and thing illumined , is what influences other men . Indeed , it is more than that , for the illumination itself is not something absolute ; its very character has in part been derived from itq surroundings . Like science , too , religion is never complete . It advances : and a religious advance is like a scientific advance ? the " revelation " is the discovery of something both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of the complete good . However , the thought of the time , with all its limitations , sets itself to push conclusions to their furthest possible limits ; and , just as in science , these conclusions often turn out to be wrong or impossible , simply because they take no account of other truths and other aspects of reality which had not then been discovered or recognised . Thus , if a religious life is in one way like a great work of art , expressing to others just its own uniqueness and value , in another way it is like a scientific discovery , which compels to further theory and full working-out , and in still another way like a political principle , which must express itself in the organisations and institutions that confine and mould daily life . And for all these reasons it is imperative that the bases of religion should be dispassionately analysed , ISO RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION for only so shall we have the hope of utilising the driving-power and the fertilising flow of its current to the best purpose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which such an analysis will be profitable are by a comparative study of religion in different people at all possible levels of culture : by some attempt at an understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying religious experience ; by an examination of theology , which aims at being reason 's scaffolding for religion , with reason 's fullest freedom ; and by an inquiry , in the light of all our experience and our whole scheme of values , of the place which religion ought to take in the life of a community of civilised people . This is a formidable task ; and in this little book I can do little beyond introduce my readers to a few leading ideas and lines of thought , and then refer them to the works of the authorities on the several subjects . But so great and so rapid is the accumulation of knowledge , so extreme the specialisation of thought at the present time , that even this twisting together of threads of thought must be of value if it is rightly done . Without it , the threads lie loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; but if the loose threads be twisted into cords , and one day the cords into a rope , that rope may be strong enough to bear the weight of those who , for lack of any rope of thought , are unable to climb out of chaos . Comparative religion is the study of the religious beliefs and practices of mankind , conducted in the same spirit as comparative anatomy , which is the comparative study of the structure and plan of animals and plants . It notes the facts ; the differCOMPARATIVE // ences and the resemblances between one religion and another ; it seeks to trace the family history of beliefs and rites , their evolutionary origins ; to explain the presence of this or that practice as a survival from past times ; to correct the theorisings of those who lay down what religion ought to be by showing them what it actually and in hard fact is . Taylor and Frazer are perhaps the classical figures in this field ; but they have had helpers and rivals too numerous to cite . What demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study leads . In the first place , then , as we have already set forth , to the idea that religion has grown out of , and indeed originally consists in , the activities of mind and body aroused by the feeling of sacredness . Further , that this sacredness need not and does not at the start have the restricted meaning which we give to it , of " good-sacred " only , but may include " badsacred " also ( e.g. , the powers supposed to be invoked in black magic ) . In other words , that this feeling which we are trying to describe is in its pure original form unattached to moral ideas , may either attract or repel , or both at once , may be either positive or negative in respect of goodness . Various words exist in primitive languages to denote this sacred power , such as the Polynesian mana , the North American manitou and ' nave , the West African njomm , the Moroccan baraka ( see Westermarck , Ritual and Belief in Morocco , 1926 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theologian has coined the word " numinous " to denote all that falls into this category . An example of how the word holy may even in modern English be applied to something morally I82 RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION neutral is afforded by Coleridge 's description of the site of Xanadu : " A savage place , as holy and enchanted As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon lover . " On the combination of admiration and fear , fas-cination and horror , in the feeling of sacredness , little need be said . We need only remind ourselves that one of the great achievements of Chris-tianity , or rather of Jesus , was to show how this fear could be cast out or transmuted into the nobility of awe ? by being dominated by an admiration raised to the higher level of love . True that it has been the perverse triumph of sect after sect to render this achievement of little account by their hideous emphasis on a real Hell of eternal torture ; but this does not lessen Jesus ' great discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of this religious feeling are essentially or primitively beings of the nature of gods . Some things , some events , some ideas are sacred , numinous , full of mane ; : that is all . Their relationship to the later concept of gods lies solely in the fact that something of spirit , in the broadest sense , is supposed to inhere in them : but , so far as we can gather , primitive man prefers to interpret most phenomena in terms of spirit , projecting that nature with which he is most familiar ? his own ? into all other natures . ' One of the best-known examples of " negative mana " is taboo , that sacred prohibition which in // many primitive tribes attaches to various places and actions . Taboo is more than usually prominent among the Polynesians . The sacredness of a chief is such that he was dangerous to touch , being as highly charged with sacred power as is a high-tension wire with electricity . This sacredness even communicated itself to what he had worn or touched or eaten from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his inferiors ? they would bring disease or danger . In Hawaii , if a man 's shadow fell on the King or even on the King 's house , he was put to death . It is of some interest to find that when the Polynesians are converted to Christianity their habituation to a life of taboo shows itself in their exaggerating every possible taboo in their new religion . The Tongans become , for instance , the most virulent Sabbatarians , and they even invent new taboos , ascribing such sanctity to the house of worship that they are frightened to use any water from a church roof . Very numerous are the food taboos of primitive religion . A number of these are set forth in Leviticus and Deuteronomy . We , to-day , are not without our taboos ; and a study of them is not without interest . The greatest of our taboos is on the discussion of sex . The child who begins to ask awkward questions and to display its perfectly natural curiosities on these as on all other matters , is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a shocked voice . Thus , on the one hand , is the natural desire of curiosity , on the other , repression by authority , and by authority mixed up with ideas of right and wrong . Thus here , in a sense // artificially , are attraction and repulsion combined , and there is generated a mystery which at one and the same time both fascinates and frightens . Later , when inevitably morals and religion become intermingled , this other mystery , of God , will come in to reinforce the first . But there will be a mystery even if the child has been fortunate enough to have parents who have not added ideas of God and supernatural anger to the inevitable burden on his unfledged mind . Even without this a taboo will have been brought into existence . It would appear that the taboos of early religion range from some such vaguely mysterious social prohibitions as this , up to those which are armed with all the supernatural force of Godhead . Another constant feature of primitive religion is its belief that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do influence it for good or evil . The relation of these forces to objects which are sacred is not always quite clear . Sometimes the sanctity or mana is itself the force , which can be made to discharge itself in this way or that . This is so with the sacred stones of certain Polynesians , which , according to them , have power to make crops grow ; and , at the other end of the scale , with miracle-working relics , round and on which the supernatural force is supposed to have accumulated . At other times , the supernatural forces are supposed to be hovering round , waiting for the chance of exerting their power ; this they can do more readily at certain special times , such as birth or marriage , when the soul for one reason or another is exposed to spiritual danger . A very large collection of facts concerning the supernatural dangers which are // believed to be run at marriage , and the steps taken to avert those dangers , is to be found in Crawley 's Mystic Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which possesses some mysterious " negative sanctity " ( as well , often , as sanctity in our positive sense ) ; and the powers which can at this time do harm may be as neutral , from the standpoint of sanctity , as the bacteria which invade a man when his resistance is lowered . They may be regarded just as we may regard luck , with superstition but without reverence or awe . On the other hand , the powers may be themselves endowed with mana ? ghosts of the dead , mysterious nature-spirits , bad luck deified . This whole attitude has its watered-down counterpart to-day in all kinds of superstitions concerning luck , and is based on a very simple psychological reality . The psychological reality is that when we are undertaking an unusual or unique event , or making a decision or embarking on a venture of importance , we are inevitably wrought up in one way or another , unusually receptive to outer impressions and strange inner thoughts . Whatever general system of ideas about our life and its relation to the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will influence us at this moment . How many superstitions of good and bad luck still crowd round the wedding-day in twentieth-century England ; how seriously some of them are taken ; and how difficult it is not to take some of them seriously ! This brings us on to the question of magic and its relation to religion . There are authorities who deny that magic has any real , essential relation with re186 RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION ligion , and see in it rather the prelogical germ of science . Most , however , who have considered the question carefully , although they may be prepared to admit that the fountain-head of magic may reside rather in the region of intellect ( however incomplete and distorted ) than in that of religious feeling , insist , and I think with reason , that primitive magic and primitive religion were from the first so intertwined , and so gradually did the connection between them loosen , that it is both difficult and unprofitable to attempt their separation . Most magic is based on the idea of sympathetic influence . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie a knot , or have their clothes tightly laced : to do so would impede easy delivery . In Rossetti 's poem , " Sister Helen , " the woman makes a waxen image of the lover by whom she has been deserted , and by slowly melting it , brings about his death : this magic method , in one form or another , is extremely widespread both among savages and in moderately civilised societies , such as that of classical Rome or the European Middle Ages . Many of the so-called Nature-Festivals seen to have been in their origin ceremonials for inducing fertility of the soil by sympathetic magic . Quite obviously of this type are many of the rites practised by hunting tribes to secure success in hunting . One of the most remarkable objects left to us by prehistoric man was found in a cave in the Pyrenees . It is the headless body of a bear , modelled in clay : in its neck is a hole , as for a stick , and between its paws lies a real bear 's skull ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can with considerable probability // be assumed that this object originally had the bear 's skull attached to it , that the whole was then covered with a bear 's skin , and that to the accompaniment of some ritual , the hunters pierced the counterfeit bear with their spears to ensure success in their hunting of the real cave-bear , which was one of their main sources of food , perhaps zo , 000 years ago . The Australian natives practise magico-religious rites to-day to ensure the multiplication of their food-animals and success in hunting . Dr. Marett , in his Primitive Religion , gives an illuminating discussion of the probable origin of the belief in sympathetic magic and its efficacy . He further shows how , in a world like that of primitive man , magic could not fail to borrow sacred or religious power from the reservoir of mystery and mana which the savage feels all round him , any more than religious feeling could help borrowing the ideas and methods of magic to help it in the task of propitiating the sacred powers . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sympathy have grown up . So was cemented the alliance between magic and religion , the alliance which is by no means yet broken . Exorcism is magic : the Rumanian poltergeist medium , Eleonore Zugun , whose case was recently investigated in London , was the subject of exorcist rites by Rumanian priests . Belief in the miracle-working power of relics or holy places is belief in magic . Cures of certain types of disease may be effected through such agencies , but this is by means of the suggestibility of the patient , not through any mysterious supernatural power emanating from the objects or places themselves . // The evil eye is magic : a stranger can not pry inquisitively round the streets of Naples without having the sign of the horns , infallible warder-off of the influence of the evil eye , made at him . Witchcraft is magic : in 1926 a Devonshire farmer so firmly believed that a neighbour had bewitched his beasts , that he assaulted her , and was tried and sentenced for it , protesting the truth of his assertion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the French Revolution , states that the more he goes into the history of the time , the more is he convinced that only a small minority of the French nation were either devoted Catholics or devoted adherents of the Religion of Reason or of Patriotism : the bulk of the people , if left to themselves , would simply have relapsed entirely into the beliefs in paganism and witchcraft , a magico-religious system which , even under a veneer of Christianity , they had for centuries chiefly practised and lived by . I have spoken of one or two general features of primitive religion ; but a few particular examples will be the best way of enabling my readers to gain a more concrete view of the subject . I am forced by the exigencies of my space to give but the bare bones . For the details my readers must look in the original authorities or in larger treatises on the subject , of which a brief list is given at the end of the book . But the very scantiness of detail may serve to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realise is that religions , like living animal and plant species , are the product of evolution . Again , like animals and plants , they have // evolved into a number of bizarre and wholly unexpected and unpredictable forms . The old story of the yokel who , after seeing a giraffe for the first time , exclaimed that he was now confirmed in the belief that there was no such animal , has its real applicability . A giraffe ; a deep-sea angler-fish ; a giant spider-crab ; a stalk-eyed fly ; a praying mantis ; a matamata Terrapin ? these and many other creatures are really very improbable ! ? much less like fact than fiction . And the same is true of religions . The Toda religion , of which more anon ; the whole amazing elaboration of totemism ; a revival meeting ; prayer-wheels ; whole societies dominated by religious magic ; monasticism run mad , as in Tibet or Mount Athos ; asceticism run mad , as in the Thebaid or in Indian fakerism ; human sacrifice ; sacred self-mutilation ; temple prostitution ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange to be believed . And yet they exist , and , what is more , exist wrapped in ? the odour of sanctity . It should , of course , never be forgotten that the selective processes in evolution will not do more than ensure survival in existing circumstances , any more than economic pressure ensures that an object manufactured for sale shall be the best of its kind or even good of its kind . All that economic pressure ensures is that the object shall somehow sell itself ; all that biological pressure ensures is that the animal or plant shall survive and reproduce itself ; all that social pressure ensures is that a religion shall somehow or other satisfy to a reasonable extent the religious needs of its votaries . Nearly a million species of animals are already // known . Of these , only a few thousand are endowed with anything which can be called intelligence , only a few tens with high intelligence , and only one with conceptual thought . In the same way , there arc hundreds of known religions ; it had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which can be called high religions . Animal evolution witnesses to a central upward trend of biological progress ; it also shows us the retention of low types along with high , the throwing out of blind-alley side-branches of specialisation at every level , and sometimes even degeneration . Religious evolution also shows a central progress ? but equally the production of bizarre side-branches , the permanent confining of the religious spirit in low-level embodiments , its projection into every conceivable cul-de-sac , its too frequent bending over from upward to downward growth . Flaubert , in his Tentation de St Antoine , gave an amazingly vivid picture of a thousand-and-one fantastic manifestations of the half-baked religious spirit jostling each other in the morning of civilisation . Frazer 's great Golden Bough gives a portentous scientific resume , carefully documented , of similar but , on the whole , more primitive manifestations . Here I can do no more than throw a few head-lines on the screen , choosing as great a variety as possible of racial and geographical difference . For my first example I choose the Todas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern India . They have been repeatedly investigated , notably , and with fine insight and accuracy , by the late W. H. Rivers . // They live in a wooded upland region , and are entirely dependent on their herds of buffaloes for their support . They possess a vague and elastic mytho-theology , which , however , plays very little important part in their religious life . For all practical purposes their religion centres round the milk of their buffaloes . Throughout India the cow is a sacred animal , and there are all sorts of religious prohibitions ( taboos ) upon the use of fresh milk , which is usually converted into buttermilk and a kind of butter before being used for human consumption . Among the Todas , cows are unknown , and thus the buffalo has naturally taken the cow 's place ; but the sanctity of the animal itself has been reduced ? to be , however , concentrated in its milk . The Todas believe that to drink the milk from the sacred herds would be to die ; Rivers was solemnly assured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few minutes . And yet they are dependent upon the milk for their existence . Their religion has accordingly come to be concerned mainly with a desanctification of the holy milk , to render it , in its new form , fit for public consumption . To this end there is a whole network of what must be described as temples ? in other words , buildings which serve both as dairies and as places where the holy ritual of lactic desanctification can occur ? over the countryside , usually at least one in every small hamlet . These dairy-temples , like their associated herds of buffaloes , are of various grades of sanctity , and each has its own priest-dairyman . The buffaloes are milked by the priests into sacred vessels , and the milk is then taken into the inner or sacred of the two // compartments into which the temple-dairy is divided . Here also is stored , in a vessel which is the Toda ark or holy of holies , some of the buttermilk from the previous churning , known to the Todas as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh milk before it is churned . The pep is thus the sub-stance which assures continuity in the sacred ritual . Each holy ceremony is performed with the aid of pep from the ceremony of yesterday , and so on back into the mists of antiquity . This should not surprise us , for similar methods for ensuring the continuity of holiness , either by material means , or through the transference of an assumed spiritual power by some symbolic act , are to be found at very various levels of culture . The sacred fire of the Vestal Virgins is a familiar example from classical Rome 9 and the necessity for the ordination of priests by a bishop , and in particular the whole idea of the apostolic suc-cession , are precise parallels to this simple symbolic magic , on the symbolic plane . ' The conversion of the not-to-be-eaten sacred milk into the harmless butter and buttermilk is carried out to the accompaniment of a rigid ritual and prolonged " prayer . The prayers consist in adjurations to various spirits or powers to keep the worshippers and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object or sacred formula . It seems likely that these adjurations , even in their origin , were on // the level of magic rather than true petitionary prayer , based on the belief that the supernatural powers could be coerced to do the will of man by incantations or spells . Even to-day in various Christian churches similar spells are employed , though against evil spirits only , in the rites of exorcism . At the present time , the Toda prayer-magic has suffered the frequent fate of ritual in hide-bound religions ? it has largely degenerated into a rite the original meaning of which has been forgotten , its efficacy now being supposed to depend merely upon its due performance in the precise traditional way . For instance , the appeals to the deities or spirits are now usually omitted altogether ; but the long list of magical adjurations which precede them are repeated with the utmost exactitude , although , of course , the one has really no meaning without the other . Whatever the origin of the rite , whether as prayer or magic , its present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the category of meaningless magic , mere mumbo-jumbo . This , again , is not unknown in other and higher religions . To put your prayers on cylinders and to regard the turning of these by the hand of the worshipper , or even by wind or water-power , as a method of acquiring religious merit , as is done by the Tibetans , is to make the essentially magical assertion that the value of praying is in the form of words , not in the spiritual state of the worshipper ; and the same is true , though the case is not quite so extreme , when the mere gabbling of so many Ave Marias or Paternosters is supposed to be a religious act of spiritual value to the performer . G // When the milk has been churned in the Toda dairy , the butter and buttermilk are placed in an intermediate vessel which stands on the line dividing the sacred from the profane compartment of the " temple . " From this it is later removed into definitely profane vessels in the outer compartment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dairyman , alias priest , in conformity with his function of ensuring the proper removal of a tremendous taboo , is himself hedged round with taboos and prohibitions . He must not marry or even enter a hut which contains a woman ( women in their turn being completely excluded from all contact with the dairy and its holy ritual ) . Any contact or association with a corpse is forbidden ; he must not cut his hair or his nails ; he must not communicate with laymen except on certain days , and then only according to a specially prescribed form of salutation and conversation . All sorts of taboos are also prescribed in connection with the kind of food he may eat and the way in which it must be cooked . Here , again , parallels can be drawn from all kinds and grades of religion . The precautions which hedge round the life of the priest-king , on whose sacred safety the safety of so many primitive communities is supposed to hinge , are summarised at length in Frazer 's Golden Bough . Leviticus and Deuteronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a common prohibition , a good example of a religious practice in which taboo is combined with more rational factors , and in the Middle Ages Christian priests were subject religion becomes largely negativist and prohibitory , human nature finds means to evade them . Either evasion is generally winked at , as has often been the case with the frequent evasion of celibacy by Catholic priests , especially in the more decadent periods of religious history ; or some elaborate rationalising method of saving face is devised . The most amusing example of this latter method in Toda religion concerns the injunction against the priest 's entering a dwelling in which there are women . Should the priest desire to visit a woman in her home , the ritual prohibition may be evaded by a ritual fiction . The grain-pounder , the sieve , and the broom are put outside the hut by the woman . These are the Toda emblems of womanhood . Consequently , once these are outside the hut , the human being inside is no longer " really " a woman ; and the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , examples of the same rationalising circumvention of religious injunctions can be multiplied from the life of other peoples . Some of the most extraordinary come from the Pacific , where the Polynesians had built up a religion of which the foundation was taboo piled upon taboo , the whole interwoven with a rigid caste system . For instance , among the Tongans , any common person who had , even accidentally , touched one of the aristocracy was " infected " with the dangerous spiritual power inherent in the chief : he could not then , for example , use his hands to feed himself without incurring the danger of disease . This is the perfectly logical outcome of their central belief in // transmissible supernatural power . As , however , such accidental contacts must have been not infrequent , and as it would be awkward to have any considerable proportion of the population incapacitated from feeding themselves , a counter-belief grew up to the effect that if the man touched the feet of his chief with the palms and backs of the infected hands , this would remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always be available when wanted , touching one of the chief 's feeding-bowls , themselves also sacred , came to be considered sufficient equivalent . The analogies with the charging and discharging of electric power are interesting . Or , again , in order to be able to rid themselves of unpopular rulers without incurring the taboobreaker 's curse ( " there 's such divinity doth hedge a king 1 " ) , the Samoans had produced the convenient rationalistic fiction that a sprinkling with cocoanutwater effectively washed away the ruler 's sanctity , upon which he could be safely put out of the way . There is a certain high hereditary Mohammedan potentate to-day who is , of course , by his religion debarred from partaking of alcoholic drink . On the other hand , it is indubitable that he consumes it ; and equally indubitable that this causes no scandal to the faithful ? why ? Because he is so sacred that the champagne or what not is changed into water as he drinks it ( but not , we may hope , until any agreeable sensations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest themselves ) . And the same processes may be seen at work in other spheres of religion , as when the slaughter of an animal is substituted for human sacrifice , or water-power made to say the Buddhist 's prayers . // What I have here narrated is merely a sketch of the kernel of Toda religion ; for , be it noted , there are innumerable details of ritual which I have not mentioned , and many complications consequent upon the grading of dairies and buffaloes and priests in an ascending order of sanctity , with a sort of pope-dairyman , if I may be pardoned the phrase , or dairy-archbishop , at the summit . I may conclude with a couple of apposite quotations from Dr Marett 's references to the Todas in his little book Anthropology : ? " The reason why it ( the milk of the sacred buffaloes ) may not be drunk , anthropologists may cast about to discover , but the Todas themselves do not know . All that they know , and are concerned to know , is that things would somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit such a sin . " The irrationality of pure taboo and yet the firm belief in the sin involved in its infraction and in the dire consequences which in some unspecified way would follow such a sinful act , could not be better put . Then , after pointing out that the whole of the Toda ritual is " essentially precautionary " and that the general tendency of such a negative type of religion is to pile precautions on precautions , he concludes : " Further , there is something rotten in the state of Toda religion . The dairymen struck Dr Rivers as very slovenly in the performance of their duties . . . . Indeed , it was hard to find persons willing to undertake the office . Ritual duties involving uncomfortable taboos were apt to be thrust on youngsters . The youngsters , being youngsters , would probably violate the taboos ; but anyway that was their look-out . " . . . and so on . // " Now , wherefore all this lack of earnestness ? Dr Rivers thinks that too much ritual was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too much negative ritual . ' A religion that is all dodging must produce a sneaking kind of worshipper . " So even primitive religions may have their periods of degradation , in this , too , affording parallels to religions of a higher type . From a religion based chiefly on sacred prohibitions we may turn to one which is mainly concerned with the more positive but more evil beliefs of pure magic . The religion of the Ekoi , a tribe of Nigeria and Cameroon , is typical of many West African religions in its horrible insistence upon sorcery . The same motives which are to be seen in most primitive religions are present here too ? the recognition of mysterious or sacred power , the belief in a host of minor spirits and a few not very sharply defined spiritual beings worthy to be called gods , in magical potency of objects , of spells , of divination , of sacrifice , ancestor-worship , fear of ghosts , belief in visions , in the non-natural causation of disease , the existence of taboos ? these and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they are differently weighted in different religions . While visions are especially prominent in North American Indian religions , taboos in Polynesia and among the Todas , " white " magic or magic with socially beneficial aims among certain Melanesians , here in West Africa black magic , with its sinister implications , is the dominant note . // As in many negro peoples , the idea of a natural cause for disease seems to be unknown . All disease and death are assigned to spiritual agencies , either of evil spirits of a ghostly nature , or of magic practised by living persons . This belief is so potent that the whole life of the people is distorted by it . So great is their fear of sorcery that it is no uncommon thing for a man to accuse his own wife or daughter of attempting to bewitch him or his children , and the fear of being bewitched or of being accused of witchcraft hangs over life like a shadow . As with our own miserable lapses into belief in this superstition , witches and wizards are credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume the form of a bird or animal . When a person is accused of witchcraft , the recognised process of trial is one combining two other magical procedures ( one of which was familiar enough in Christian countries during the Middle Ages and even later ) ? Divination and the Ordeal . If the divining witch-doctor accuses one of the people of sorcery , he or she then has to undergo an ordeal , either by having boiling oil poured over the hands , or by drinking a potion made from a poisonous bean . In the latter case , a too small dose is not fatal , a too large dose produces vomiting , and previous boiling prevents a fatal termination ; thus , as so often , scope is given to accident or to control of the result by the authorities . There appears to be no doubt that in general the belief of the people in the whole theory of magic underlying these practices is sincere enough , although , undoubtedly , cases occur where the diviner or some other responsible personage may help out zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because bribed , or for reasons of personal spite . We should not forget that a precisely similar combination of general , popular belief combined with partial or total fraud on the part of interested persons was found in Europe in the seventeenth and even the eighteenth centuries with regard to precisely the same imaginary crime ? witchcraft . Belief in witchcraft or black magic bears the same relation to belief in personal supernatural beings capable of interfering with the course of Nature in answer to prayer or sacrifice as does the belief in harmful supernatural power or " mana " to that in good mana or supernatural spiritual virtue . The one is simply the obverse of the other , the minus to the other 's plus . So long as religion is intellectually crude , so long does it run the risk , and indeed invite the certainty , of having its powerful forces harnessed to stupid and morally hateful ends , as when belief in the miraculous in seventeenth and eighteenth-century Europe led to a campaign against witchcraft , the complete lack of whose objective existence did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenceless women ? . But we must return to West Africa . Most of the religious activities of the Ekoi are concerned with this black religious belief , these logical results of following out the ideas of primitive supernaturalism to their conclusions on the side of evil . In addition COMPARATIVE RELIGION 20I to magic , and the steps to be taken to avert and detect it , much of their religious practice is concerned with the averting of evil spirits . Most of these seem to be conceived as of the nature of ghosts , but the low animistic level of thought also assigns " souls " to inanimate objects , both natural and manufactured . Finally , there remains a considerable degree of animatism among the Ekoi , leading them to believe in impersonal supernatural power ( which they call " njomm " ) ; this , as with the Polynesian mana , is apparently conceived to exist as a sort of reservoir of potency , to be tapped by favoured persons or by special charms , and led down into inanimate objects , plants or animals , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negro life that in their case " njomm " is mainly utilised either to facilitate or to antagonise the spells of the sorcerer . Ekoi theology is mainly myth . It shares with that of many primitive religions which are dependent upon oral tradition a considerable vagueness and fluidity . Disputes or persecutions over details of dogma can hardly arise before there is written lan-guage . The two main divinities of the Ekoi are the god of the sky , who is on the whole cruel and male-ficent to man , and the god of earth , who is on the whole beneficent . The two deities , however , are not , like Ormuzd and Ahriman in Zoroastrianism , personifications of good and evil indulging in a cosmic struggle . They are not conceived of as opponents at all ; and the evil or the good which they cause men has nothing to do with their morality , but both alike behave thus " for ' t is their nature to . " We are here introduced to a very frequent conception of early religion ? the conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " natural man " of primitive societies : morality has at this level not yet become linked with the idea of God . This primitive idea of God as non-moral power tends to survive in the background of more developed religions , and to peep out in this or that attribute of divinity , this or that story of divine behaviour . Westermarck in his little book , The Goodness of Gods , and his large work , The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas , has collected a number of examples of this from various religious levels . Belief in the existence of hell , and in particular the dooming to eternal torment of unbaptised infants or of the most virtuous men who happen not to be Christian , is an obvious example of the persistence of belief in God as an arbitrary , revengeful , and powerful being , in spite of its gross inconsistency with the higher ideas of God as loving and all-merciful . The inconsistency is to-day more and more being realised , and with the gradual fading of the belief in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking in general , belief in eternal torment is happily diminishing . But the fact that it can have persisted through nineteen centuries of Christianity is a good example of the power of logical and moral contradictories to persist side by side in religious belief . In addition to the two main tribal gods of the Ekoi , there is a goddess who is mainly worshipped by the women ? a cruel goddess , sometimes woman , sometimes crocodile , who demands sacrifice , even human sacrifice . The most interesting feature of Ekoi ritual is the existence of numerous religious or semi-religious // societies , which give dramatic and dancing performances on various ceremonial occasions ? at funerals , for instance , or during tribal gatherings , or merely on their own ceremonial days . The most powerful and the most religiously important of these is the Egbo , a secret society combining religious , legal , and state functions . It contains seven grades of membership , each grade having a higher entrance fee than the one below . Every village community has a special house built by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual are practised ; and special performances are given from time to time in public by the various grades , with the deliberate object , it would seem , of inspiring supernatural terror of the organisation in the lay breast . The central performer in these dances is got up in fearful guise , masked , or with only eye-holes in a flowing robe , to impersonate a terrifying deity . At these ceremonials the Egbo emulate the Fascists by administering a good beating to those with whom they have chanced to disagree . If Toda religion is chiefly a matter of ritual prohibitions and irksome taboos , that of the Ekoi , apart from a few of the dances , is almost wholly a thing of fear . To the more enlightened Christians , it must seem religion turned inside-out . This obsession with fear , whether of sorcery or of an arbitrary deity or deities on whose caprice good or evil fortune depends , is only too frequent a form of religion . Many of the popular cults of early Imperial Rome had degenerated to this level ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they practised led philosophically-minded men like Lucretius to outbursts against religion in general , // the only religions that he knew having " so often perpetrated criminal and impious acts " that he could hurl back the charge of impiety with interest . The North American Indians , bred in a climate which favoured energy and to a life which necessitated bravery and hardiness , have developed a type of religion which , though in many respects primitive , is not hampering like that of the Todas or sinister like that of the Ekoi . There is a good deal of difference between the religion of the Indians of different regions , such as West Coast and Plains for instance , and even between different tribes of the same region ; but certain common traits run through all . A brief summary of the religion of the Crow Indians , chiefly derived from the investigations of Lowie , will serve as example . Most of the elements which we have already found characteristic of undeveloped religion in general are observable here ; but , once more , the emphasis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with solitary visions , both of youths when they are desirous of becoming initiated to manhood , and of adults . The man who sought a vision repaired to some lonely place , such as a mountain-top , and fasted for four days ( four being the sacred number of the Crow ) , invoking the spirits . In most cases some propitiatory self-torture or self-mutilation is practised , the commonest being cutting off one of the fingers of the left hand . Lowie found that only a small proportion of the elder men of the tribe still had all their ten fingers . ( In passing it is interesting COMPARATIVE RELIGION 20$ to note that not only do various Australian tribes practise finger-lopping , but that it seems to have been prevalent even in Paleolithic times , fifteen or twenty thousand years ago . In the Pyrenxan caves men held their hands against the walls and then painted round them ; and these ancient imprints very often lack one finger . ) Those to whom visions are vouchsafed usually report that a spiritual visitant in human form appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gives him good advice or definite directions for achieving success in his affairs . Although most men succeed in seeing a vision , there are some who , even after repeated trials , never do so . One such regretfully said to Lowie : " All who had visions become well-to-do . I am destined to be poor ; that is why I had no visions . " It seems certain that ( as the foregoing quotation testifies ) the majority of the tribesmen fully accept , in all good faith , the genuineness of the visionary experiences . When , in addition , it is remembered that Crow religion is one of those few in which no organised priesthood exists , it is further clear that the exploitation of a confiding laity by unscrupulous priests for private or ecclesiastical gain in no way helps to account for the facts . The four days of abstention from food and drink , together with the solitude and the worshipper 's expectation of a visionary experience , undoubtedly combine to put the mind into a state in which hallucinations or visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand a state of suggestibility and receptiveness , on the other an exalted physical state , combined with a weakening of the normal controlling part of the 2o6 RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION mind , which will allow full play to lower-level activities of the mind . We all know how these latter tend to work by means of symbols and stories instead of by means of conceptual thought and logic ; we have proof of it every night in our dreams , and the whole science of abnormal psychology bristles with examples of other types . There remains , however , the possibility of what we may call benevolent fraud . The receipt of a vision is , in one way or another , almost necessary to success in Crow existence ; further , the whole religious life of the tribe ( and therefore its social and military life and general vitality , since at this level of culture religion is so intimately bound up with all other activities ) hangs on the experiences vouchsafed in visions . It has been asserted that relatives of the worshipper , anxious for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigil and there impersonate supernatural visitants ; or that the same trick may be played by elders of the tribe so concerned for its spiritual welfare that they do not scruple to do evil that good may come , and to help out the visionary experience by deceit . The fact that the visionaries sometimes produce feathers or other objects which they say were given them by the supernatural visitor argues strongly in favour of this view . It may be impossible to prove the fact in this case ; but there is nothing improbable in it , the world abounding in every grade of this apparent self-contradiction , benevolent fraud , from the slight helping-out of a miraculous rite which does not quite come off ( or of a lecture-experiment in a science class , for that matter ! ) to complete self-delusion on the one hand or complete fraud on the other , through various // degrees of admixture , one of the lower levels of which Browning has immortalised for us in " Mr Sludge , the medium . " However , whether or no fraud of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many , probably the majority of cases , there is a real vision ; and further that these visions are the culminating experiences of life for many of the Indians , and have a remarkable effect both upon individual behaviour and upon tribal life and customs . If , for instance , the vision promises invulnerability in war , the worshipper ( as in a definite case known to Lowie ) , though not previously much of a warrior , would become recklessly brave and establish a great reputation for his daring and his success in battle . Or the vision might reveal the uses of some herb , upon which the worshipper might set up as a physician and achieve riches in this way . Or the worshipper might be shown some new form of ritual , which he would then introduce to the tribe . This would be a source not only of power but of profit , since the Crow ritualistic organisations demand heavy entrance-fees from their members . It should not be supposed , however , that all visions are taken by the tribe at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare that only certain visions and experiences are from God , but others , especially those of ambitious novices , are from evil spirits ? in other words , that a vision , just because it is a vision , is not therefore necessarily good ? so the Crow are often sceptical about visions . The proof of the pudding is in the eating ; and if a vision promises the finding of horses , or success in war , the Indians often prefer to await the event ao8 RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION before accepting the genuineness of the experience . In other cases , however , the personality of the visionary seems to play the main part in deciding whether he can impose a belief in the truth of his vision on others . There is thus here a loophole by means of which the rigorous validity of the religious system may escape unimpaired in spite of failures of particular religious manifestations . Such loopholes are familiar enough in every system of thought . They are indeed necessities for any incomplete system , whether true or false , for without them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are of course still more necessary for a system built on false bases . In systems based on a belief in sorcery , the failure of a spell is reasonably enough set down to a stronger counter-charm having been pronounced by some hostile magician . When prophecies , like that of the Delphic oracle , are in vogue , apparent falsity of the prophetic deliverance is ascribed to faulty interpretation . I have myself heard an Italian peasant , who was telling how branches blessed on Palm Sunday and kept in the house would preserve the vines from hail , explain ( in answer to my query why , then , they also insured the grapes against hail ) that the sacred branches were only efficacious if every one in the house possessed complete faith ? another loophole , not uncommon in various forms in Christianity , and of course having a true basis when applied to the so-called miraculous cures of faith-healing . In modern spiritualism , if results do not come , it is because one of those present exerts a disturbing psychic influence ; in Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though duly commissioned and paid for , do not cure the patient of " error , " it is because some one has been indulging in evil thoughts about him ; and so on , ad libitum . In these examples the " explanation " is usually a mere rationalisation , which can not be tested . It should be noted , however , that similar explanations of failures may be true reasons . When , for instance , Sir William Ramsay , in his work on the analysis of atmospheric air , found that he could not account for certain minute residues , he ( if you like ) invented a loophole by asserting that these represented various hitherto undiscovered elements . But this " loophole " could be tested ; and the test showed that Ramsay 's assertion was perfectly true . In general , the loophole of the scientific system , when fact does not agree with theory , is to assert either that the observation or the experiment was badly conducted , or else that the discrepancy is due to the existence of some hitherto undiscovered substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loophole and the others we have mentioned is that the assertion can be , in any individual case , tested ; and that the test will give a definite answer . But we must return to the Indians . Any objects which happen to have been associated with the vision acquire sanctity . Lowie writes " Never shall I forget how an Indian once prodded my curiosity by offering to show me the greatest thing in the world ' ; how he reverently uncovered one cloth wrapper after another ; and how at length there lay exposed a simple bunch of feathers ? a mere nothing to the alien onlooker , but to the owner a badge of his covenant with the supernatural world " 2I0 RELIGION WITHOUT REVELATION ( though in all probability presented to him by an Indian masquerading as a spirit ) . Exactlythe same nothingness to the alien onlooker , but the same " everythingness , " if I may coin a word , to the worshipper steeped in the traditions of his cult will , of course , apply to any apparently ordinary object which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association ? whether the charge of sanctity has become accumulated through symbolism , or through actual association with the specially sacred event . The Crow Indian in his primeval state , though thus capable of deepest reverence , would naturally find the symbol of the cross , or even a fragment of the True Cross , " a mere nothing . " One other psychological aspect of the visions is well worth a moment 's consideration ; and that is the striking uniformity of the type of vision and even of its details . There are , to be sure , numerous interesting variations . ' While most worshippers report true visions , others experience auditory experiences , others feel things happen , others again find themselves acting a part in a drama ; these differences are doubtless correlated with differences in mental make-up , and are exhibited according as the man is of a predominantly visual , auditory , tactual , or motor type . But apart from this , we find all sorts of details recurring with curious constancy . The Crow visions are mostly seen by youths or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fourth day of their fast ; and four is the Crow sacred number . In most cases the supernatural visitant adopts the worshipper , and does so , moreover , in the same COMPARATIVE RELIGION 2II form of words . Almost every visionary includes the hearing of a song among his experiences . Trees or rocks often become transmogrified into enemies ; a vision symbolic of one or other of the four seasons of the year ( which is taken to denote that the visionary will live at least to that season ) is also very frequent ; and so on . There can be no doubt that this common form for the visionary experience is the result neither of coincidence nor of fraud but of suggestion . These are the sort of things which a man is expected to see in a vision ; he grows up from childhood in an atmosphere of this expectation ; and when the time comes , he sees them . ' Other Indian tribes have a tradition that visions should be seen in childhood , or postponed till adult life ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear with its seven stars is a prominent object of reverence , either it , or the number seven , or both , frequently figure in visions . A very interesting analysis made by Starbuck , of conversion in Protestant sects in the United States , shows how precisely similar factors may be at work in higher religions . There are some Christian churches and sects which more or less demand an experience of conversion during adolescence as a prerequisite to full church membership ; others , on the contrary , lay no stress on conversion . Not only do we find that in the one case conversion is almost universal , in the other very rare , but where it does occur , the broad lines and even the details of the experience follow the accepted tradition of the sect in a striking way . This , of course , is not to say that the experience of conversion ( or the Crow vision ) is // not of spiritual value . It does , however , warn us to be cautious about the interpretation which we give of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other points demand our notice . As so often in primitive religions which lack sacred books , their theology , if the word may be used of the sacred myths which are current , is vague and often self-contradictory , and the supernatural beings concerned in it are not of a very high moral order . The Sun is their chief spirit ; and " Old-ManCoyote " is the chief hero of their folklore , these playing the part which is taken by Uncle Remus ' Brer Rabbit in the legends of the Southern negro , or by the Spider in the Jamaican negro 's folklore . But there is a constant tendency to identify these two prominent beings , and this in spite of the fact that the Sun is on the whole thought of as a high type of being , while Old-Man-Coyote is the successful buffoon and trickster dear to folklore . This tendency to identify originally separate beings is constantly to be found in the history of religion , though it is of course most prominent when , by migration of peoples or diffusion of culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the early Old Testament history concerns the attempts by some to identify , by others to keep distinct , the Hebrew tribal God Yahveh and the Canaanite tribal God Baal . Religion in the early days of the Roman Empire was a welter of crosscurrents of such identification , partial or total , between Greek , Roman , Syrian , Persian , and Egyptian deities . In various cases pagan deities were not overthrown on the introduction of Christianity , but // their worship was simply fused with that of personages of Christian theology ; near Naples , for instance , there still exists a local cult of the Madonna which has grown directly out of the worship of Artemis . Apart from visions , the most interesting feature of Crow religion is their ritual societies . The most prominent among these is the so-called Tobacco Society . The tobacco after which this is named is not the one which we and the Indians smoke , but another species which is grown solely for religious purposes . The whole Society originated from a vision ; later , new visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old rites , or the founding of new Chapters of the Society . As already mentioned , novices must pay heavy fees to the original visionary or to the Chapter ; and are then instructed for several months in the songs and rites . The special rites are first , a dance , the Tobacco dance , which is performed for long hours on end ; and , secondly , the planting of the sacred seed . In addition , there is the Sun dance , the most impressive of the Crow ceremonials , danced before the whole tribe by a votary desirous of vengeance . I have no space to describe this here , but must refer my reader to Lowie , only mentioning that extremely interesting features are to be found in it , such as the dancing before a sacred doll or idol until a vision of the enemy 's downfall is granted ; and the fact that the dance is so sacred and religiously exciting that many young men will seek visions or mutilate themselves in public on the occasion of a Sun dance being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of // interest in the Crow religion , they would seem to be as follows . First , the importance accorded to individual vision and to social-religious ritual , and secondly , the unimportance of creed or dogma , together with the absence of any organised priesthood . As is usual in primitive religions , little attention is paid to the life to come , and it is a matter of very little emotional interest to the living . All ideas of a moral retribution or judgment in the next world are absent . Morality and ethics are in part , but only to a slight degree , associated with religion . Most of the commandments proscribed in visions , and for the most part implicitly obeyed by their recipients , are either irrational taboos or ritual injunctions . What we should call the sense of sin attaches much more to the infraction of one of these commands than to any ordinary moral transgression . Finally , in spite of the importance of the individual vision and the ease with which , in obedience to new visions , ritual may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very narrow limits . The scope for individual initiative is probably greater than in most primitive religions ; none the less , it is rigidly confined , and all its details are dictated by tribal usage . I can not sum up better than by using Lowie 's words : " Thus even the most extreme subjectivism may merge in abject servility , not to the authority of a personal dictatorship , but to the impersonal , though none the less real , dominance of folk-belief and folk-usage " ; I would merely like to add that these words do not hold only for Indian tribalism , but are too often applicable in our modern civilisations .

TAWNEY , Religion and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? concluded As a picture from a wholly different region and level , we may look briefly into Greek religion during the historic period . This is of great interest owing to the rapid intellectual changes which were then going on ; and also owing to the anticipation , by many of its later cults , of practices and ideas which we are accustomed to look on as solely Christian . The close of Greek pre-history may be put at about i000 or 900 B.C. Our chief sources of knowledge on this period are Homer and Hesiod , with some works of art and inscriptions . The early Greek civilisation of this time seems to have been a blend , arising from the southward immigration of fairhaired " Nordic " tribes into a land already inhabited by people of Mediterranean race with a welldeveloped culture which we may call MinoanMycenxan . Dr Farnell comes to the conclusion that the northerners ' religion was mainly concerned with Gods , such as Zeus , Apollo , and Poseidon , who were already of more than local or tribal significance ; and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern Mediterranean ( from which probably spring Athena , Artemis , and Aphrodite ) to give the first truly Greek polytheism . This , if we take Homer as our guide , was . soon organised on an advanced plane ; the 217 // separate divinities preside over different departments of life and are themselves under a head , the high God Zeus . The clear-cut humanism of the Greeks tended ( as against the Mediterranean culture ) to represent the Gods in ideal human form . Numerous contradictions still survive , however . The gods and goddesses reveal various human frailties ; they dispute with each other ; they are at one moment spoken of as omniscient or omnipotent , while at another even Zeus may be portrayed as in ignorance of important facts . They are on the whole upon the side of morality , though by no means always so , at other times being merely selfish , or jealous for ritual . In addition to the heavenly pantheon , there existed the Chthonian powers of the underworld , who were largely concerned with the sanctity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ritual , even after death ; and also a host of minor spirits ( also usually conceived in human form ) , such as nymphs or oreads . Places might be sacred ( like the hearth ) without any special personification ; or local sanctity might end in the dedication of a town ( as in the case of Athens ) to a particular deity . Civic and religious life was inextricably intermingled ? no question of what we should call separation of Church and State had arisen . On the other hand , although professional priests existed , sacerdotalism was markedly absent . The ritual of worship consisted largely in the making of animal and plant sacrifices at an altar , sacrifice being probably derived from a primitive communion-meal with the deity , with the idea of propitiation superadded . More gloomy rites were practised in sacrifice to the earth-deities , although // the classical Greek never seems to have been obsessed with ghosts or with evil spirits . The cult of ancestors , especially in the form of the partial deification known as hero-worship , was definitely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with birth , . death , etc. , was also present , but seems to have quickly begun transforming itself into ethical impurity , giving rise to the sense of sin , with need for purification . As is almost universally the case , all sorts of very low , primitive , or degenerate manifestations of religion survived alongside of this fairly advanced polytheism . There seems no doubt that superstition of the nature of magic and of fetishism was prevalent enough , and that human sacrifice was regularly though not very frequently practised . In addition , the cult of animal deities or monstrous compounds of animal and human were not uncommon ; and also the mention of vague spirits associated with particular types of action recalls the " functional " spirits ( miscalled deities ) of the early Romans , and represents an animistic stage of thought , as do the records of sacrifice being offered directly to thunder or to a river . Certain conceptions , such as humility ( as opposed to moderation ) , self-sacrifice , faith in the Christian sense , God-fearingness , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been almost wholly absent . In the early historic period , say to about 500 B.C. , the chief tendency to be noted is the firmer establishment of the polytheism , with the elevation of the religious ideas concerning the separate gods . // The anthropomorphising tendency of the northern invaders won the day , and the visible image became the chief object of worship . The artistic spirit of the Greeks , working on this , was able to raise the image of divinity to unsurpassed heights , and so to take purely anthropomorphic religion to levels of humanism not elsewhere equalled . The defect of pure anthropomorphism , of course , is that as thought develops , many objects of religious veneration are seen to be of the nature of general ideas or eternal principles , and so utterly to transcend the single individual . Once this is realised , the image becomes an idol , and hampers religious development . Another remarkable phenomenon was the constant introduction of new cults . This is much easier in a polytheistic than a monotheistic system , and became very prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian , Greek , Roman , and other divinities so overcrowded the religious stage as to make it impossible for a philosopher , or indeed any one with a craving for unity or an aptitude for clear thinking , to take religion very seriously . But so early as about the tenth century B.C. the first of these new cults invaded Greece ? the cult of Dionysus or Bacchus . This introduced various somewhat new tendencies into Greek religion ? a tendency to pantheism or at least towards the idea of immanent divinity ; the aiming at achieving communion with the divine by a ritual devouring of him , primitive prototype of the Holy Communion service ; the idea of death and rebirth of the God , primitive prototype of the belief in the Resurrection ; and the deliberate introduction COMPARATIVE RELIGION 22I of orgiastic rites to encourage religious frenzy . The ritual was in early times barbaric enough : at best , the God was symbolised by a goat or bull , which was rent limb from limb and devoured in order to achieve sacredness ; at worst , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ritualistic cannibalism having been thus in existence . This religion or cult steadily extended its influence ( luring the succeeding centuries , shedding many of its primitive barbaric features in the process ; and Dionysus was definitely adopted into the official pantheon . The chief contribution which this cult made to official or public religion was the sacramental idea , which , with the strong emotional tone of Bacchic ritual , was largely absent from the ordinary Greek polytheism . On the other hand , an even more potent influence of Dionysus worship was exerted through private or esoteric brotherhoods . These worshipped Dionysus under various secret or mystic names , and called their worship Orphic . Here I can not do better than quote Farnell 's words . " The preachers of the Orphic doctrines are the first propagandists or missionaries that we can discover in the pre-Christian Mediterranean world . For they had a definite message , and ignoring the Gentile and civic barriers of the old political religion , they preached it , if not to all mankind , at least to all the Hellenes . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek mythology and religion , that the soul of man is divine and of divine origin ; that the body is its impure prison-house , where it is in danger of contracting stain ; that by elaborate purifications and abstinences the soul // might retain its purity , and by sacramental and magic methods the pure soul might enjoy in this life and in the next full communion with God . Preoccupied with the problem of the life after death , the Orphic mystics evolved the concept of Purgatory , a mode of posthumous punishment , temporary and purificatory . " These new ideas first made themselves felt in the seventh or sixth centuries , but came into full prominence in the fifth century . As will be seen , they bear points of resemblance to the doctrines of Buddha , which were spreading in the East at the same period ; and also anticipated a great deal of Christian belief . It seems possible that there was actual diffusion of Buddhist ideas from India to Europe ; and certain that Christianity later borrowed from Orphism . The Eleusinian mysteries had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were concerned with the fate of the soul after death , and offered a happy immortality to the initiated . Their ritual is obscure , for their secret was well guarded . But it . seems sure that their kernel was the performance of what must have been comparable to a very impressive Mediaval Passion Play , representing various episodes from the lives of Demeter and Persephone ( themselves symbolising earth and the seasonal cycle of Nature ) , and probably portraying also scenes expressing the mysteries of birth , death , and marriage , and their spiritual counterparts , mystic union , sin , and rebirth . While these cults of sacrament , initiation , and mystery were spreading , another tendency was altering Greek religious thought in a different direction . That was Greek philosophy , which first // introduced the atmosphere of truly free speculation into Western civilisation . In general , and without going into detail , it may be said that philosophy was either hostile to current religious views , or , perhaps more often , tended to enlarge those views and place them on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculations the Greek philosophers often adumbrate those of modern philosophy , tending to think of God not as a person but as a name for the First Cause , or for the spiritual principle at work in the universe . But these speculations suffered from the same weakness as later metaphysical approaches to religion : they were too intellectualist , and all the vitality of the actual religions of the time and the warmth of the religious emotion experienced by the common man tended in them to evaporate , so that they often killed where they sought to liberate , and were on the whole either neglected by the people at large and by the organised cults , or else regarded as hostile to religion . On the other hand , they could not but leave a powerful impress upon all thought . Since there were no sacred books in Greek religion containing old myths fossilised to dogma under the deposits of the sacred feeling of generations , the philosophers ' speculations about the physical universe met with no such opposition as confronted Galileo or Lyell or Darwin . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , the free use of the intellect and its employment upon the most general problems possible ; and after their time all Greek thought was always aware of new and vast horizons , to which all primitive cultures and religions are strangers . In the fifth century , however , the polytheist // religion reached its highest point , fostered by the pride of city-states and ennobled by a great and pure art , its vitality as yet untouched by the scepticism deriving from civic or national disillusionment or from scientific or philosophic speculation . What is more , the Persian danger and the triumph of the Greeks consolidated the national spirit , even more in the religious than in the political sphere . However , in spite of the triumphs of classic art , of philosophy and science , of free interest in political theory , of literature and the drama , and in spite of the interpenetration of all these with a sane , humanist , and ennobled polytheism , even the fifth century presented , behind the glorious facade which is all most of us are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbaric medley of thought and practice . Infanticide was regularly practised ; civilisation was based on slavery ; the primeval beliefs and practices of animism and magic continued through the countryside , and in the towns superstition was rife and various emotional and speciously stimulating cults commanded their worshippers ; not only phallic worship , but even human sacrifice , of victims who were regarded as scapegoats for society , was still to be found . Greek science was for the most part what we should call scientific speculation . The second great master-key of intellectual progress , experimental testing accompanied by publication of the evidence , had not yet been discovered , so that no organised body of knowledge comparable with modern science had come into existence . Nor had a moral code come to dominate ritual . In the event , the marvellous edifice could not // endure : there was too weak a structural framework ? political , intellectual , or moral . In the absence of such a framework , intellectual freedom was apt to engender scepticism and to prove a disintegrating force . That it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euripides , too , reveals a blend of noble humanism and baffled questioning . After the exhaustion of Hellas through the Peloponnesian wars and the later triumph of Macedon , one of the chief trends to be noticed in religion , as might be expected in days of intellectual enlightenment but political failure , was the growth of the personal element . The tribal , local , and political ideas associated with , say , the cult of Athena in Athens waned in their influence ; the private brotherhoods , dedicated to some particular deity , with sacred practice usually centring round a ceremonial meal , became increasingly important ; and the barriers between citizen and foreigner or slave , between Greek and barbarian , tended to break down . By the end of the fourth century a marked cosmopolitanism of spirit had invaded Greek thought , as is exemplified by the fragments of Menander which have come down to us . On the ethical side , many notable anticipations of the teachings of Jesus are here recorded , in spite of the fact that the current polytheist theology is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ever stronger the tendency to Syncretism , in other words , the introduction of originally distinct ' cults from all the points of the compass into the religion of the land , accompanied frequently by an actual fusion of two deities and their cults into one . This was doubtless a broadening influence , but also one I-I // tending to lower the general level of religious thought to a lowest common denominator of the various cults or sects . For instance , the worship of Aphrodite was undoubtedly sensualised by the introduction of elements from the worship of oriental goddesses , and the occasional identification of Zeus with Jehovah must have diluted both the Jewish and the Greek religious spirit without conferring any corresponding new strength . Meanwhile , the regular schools of philosophy , such as Stoicism , Epicureanism , and Cynicism , were becoming stronger . At first they did not have any much greater influence on popular thought than did the early philosophers : but gradually the itinerant sophist came into being , and seemed to fill a popular need . It would seem that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primitive level of mytho-theology , of elaborate ceremonial of propitiation , and of magic-mystic sacramental rites , the more educated , feeling the need to connect their religious feelings with ordered morality and intellectual speculation , sought refuge in a moralising philosophy . This tendency did not culminate until the Alexandrian age , but the public debates on philosophy initiated in the public places of Athens in the fifth century were the first beginnings of a steady growth in this direction . It is worth noting , perhaps , that the only private library hitherto excavated at Herculaneum consists almost entirely of second-rate but morally edifying philosophical works . One interesting new worship deserves mention , as it is in one way so purely Greek , while in another it recalls many of the modern religious cults which // centre largely round physical health . This was the cult of Aesculapius , the healer , who combined the functions of patron saint of medicine with those of a mystic saviour of the Orphic type . Associated with his worship were not only sacramental mysteries , nor only miracles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true school of medicine . The interest to comparative religion of a study of Greek religious thought and practice is manifold . The student assists at one of those comparatively rare phenomena of history , a period of rapid unfolding of the human mind . He sees religious development accompanying the development of art , science , philosophy , and political theory ; but whereas all these other activities of the Greek mind have continued to be potent influences down to the present day , Greek religion , in spite of certain contributions to Christian thought , may be said to have collapsed in ruins and to have left little posterity . Its fate is thus very unlike that of early Hebrew religion , which we can trace in the same way , making painful steps upwards from a barbaric level ; for Hebrew religion has not only survived in strength to the present day , but has been part parent both of Christianity and of Islam . The reasons for this are not easy to determine ; but one of them , and I should say probably an important one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong tendency to anthropomorphism . This made it difficult for abstract and general ideas , both intellectual and ethical , when in due course of Greek development they came on to the scene , to become linked up with the orthodox religion . Further , the existence of numerous not too abstract // deities made it fatally easy for other divinities from other regions to be introduced into popular favour ; in the absence of any written tradition or of a central supreme God , this had as inevitable result the dilution and transmogrification of religious belief , and a lowering of its general level . We may perhaps conclude that a strong tradition , based upon a sacred book , and a belief in a single supreme principle , whether conceived of as a personal God or other spiritual being , or , as in Buddhism , as impersonal , is necessary for the raising of religion fully from the primitive level to its next position of stable equilibrium . Once that is attained , quite other methods may be desirable for further progress ; but that is another story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent influence to Greek religion , it should be emphasised once more that without certain currents of Greek religion which had been incubating and developing in the Eastern Mediterranean for several centuries , the development of Christianity would have been quite other than it was . It could never have spread among the Gentiles as it did without the preparation of Orphism and other mystery religions , nor could the ideas of personal redemption and happy immortality or of the value of purity have so taken possession of its doctrines . It would have lacked the idea of the Logos , and would never have been able to achieve the intellectual heights of its later theology without Greek philosophy . In all probability the Lord 's Supper could never have become the central feature of Christian ritual without the numerous similar Greek rites that were its forerunners . In the words of an authority on the subject : // " It has been the result of much modern research to reveal the truth that the indebtedness of Christian dogma and ritual to the later Hellenic paganism was far greater than used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my capacity , as well as beyond my space , to give even a brief account of the religion of the early Jews in this chapter , I can not refrain from touching upon a few points . A study of Hebrew religion is perhaps the most intellectually interesting which can be undertaken . One reason is its intrinsic importance , as one of the main channels through which the idea of pure monotheism entered the world . Another is , of course , its historical importance , as affording both the soil out of which Christianity sprang , and part of its background until the present day . Finally , it is interesting as providing to us of Western Christianised civilisation the most forcible example of the various ways in which particular creeds or sacred books impose themselves upon a civilisation , for reasons largely independent of their intrinsic merit , and refuse to be shaken off . I may perhaps deal with this last point first . The fact that the Old Testament is still in regular use throughout Christian countries is one whose familiarity alone saves it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent observer could be found who should discover this fact for the first time , he might well be pardoned for asking what the inhabitants of modern Europe or America could find of such special import in the religious history of a primitive Semitic tribe , in its passage from barbaric nomad life to the establishment of a // small pastoral-agricultural kingdom , during a period from about 4000 to over z000 years ago ? Neither the social not the economic condition of that tribe , nor its intellectual , artistic , or moral outlook during any part of the period , was at all similar to that of any modern nation ; what is more , even the religious spirit was radically different . He would find that many leaders of thought , even of religious thought in those same religious organisations which employ the Old Testament in their services , repudiate large parts of this scripture . Its accounts of creation are by those religious teachers thrown overboard as myth , the history of its patriarchs and the accounts of later miracles largely dismissed as legend ; most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Leviticus and Deuteronomy are recognised as the irrational taboos and equally irrational ritual of the primitive religious spirit ; the bloodthirsty sentiments ascribed to the Hebrew God are repudiated as the outcome of savage mentality . Why then , in God 's name , our hypothetical inquirer might well ask , does this body of writings continue in the twentieth century to be used in Christian churches ? The simple answer , and the one given unhesitatingly by most men until recently , was that which asserted that the writings were inspired by God , and that the Hebrews claimed our special interest , not only because Jesus sprang from among them , but because they were , in a literal sense , the Chosen People of God . But both these statements would again be refused literal acceptance by the majority of educated people , both within and without the Christian Church , COMPARATIVE RELIGION 23I to-day . The true answer is that so much sanctity has gathered round the scripture in the course of centuries , and so much has been said about the uniqueness and sacredness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove this almost idolatrous regard for the Bible , even the Old Testament , from a central place in the Christian scheme . The whole is cemented together by this mortar of sacredness ; and to remove one large part would be to run the risk of bringing down the rest . Historical research and the study of the text of the Bible has made two very important facts evident . In the first place the whole account of the early history of the Jews , as embodied in the Pentateuch , was not only not composed by Moses , but is the work of several hands , all of them of much later date . The same is true for other parts of the scripture , both narrative books and prophetic ( for instance , Isaiah ) . The different narratives were woven into more or less coherent wholes by various compilers working at different times , but probably none of them before the eighth century B.C. , and several of them after the Exile . What is more , these compilers did not hesitate to remodel the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ideas prevalent in the compiler 's period , nor to tell the story with their own religious bias , prophetic or priestly as the case might be . Thus the whole of the early history of the Jewish people , from the time of Abraham ( about 2000 B.c. ) to after Boo B.C. , is distorted in the Old Testament , and their religion is there given a false veneer derived from the more developed ideas of later ages . // The social and religious life of these early centuries of Jewish history was , as a matter of fact , very primitive . What we can safely deduce about the period before Moses ( i.e. probably before the thirteenth century B.C. ) is limited . We can regard it as probable that the various races and tribes of Hebrews and their near relatives of Moab , Edom , and Ammon had each separate deities of their own , deities which were regarded as purely tribal , and even in the case of the Jews , not universal ; and that the intercourse between the tribes tended towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly inveighed . The Teraphim were probably images connected with ancestor-worship ; and there is abundant evidence of sorcery , divination , and other forms of magic , and the attribution of disease to evil spirits . The original significance of the passover rite , with the smearing of lamb 's blood on the doorpost , as a safeguard against the Lord smiting the first-born , was doubtless a magic precaution against pestilence ; very similar rites , as Westermarck assures us , arc still practised in Morocco to-day . Taboos of the same nature as that on drinking milk which has not been de-sanctified among the Todas , existed with regard to the ark of the Covenant . For instance , the maim or dangerous sanctity of the ark was so great that when Uzzah ( z Sam . vi . 6 ) touched it in a praiseworthy attempt to prevent it from falling , he immediately died . Circumcision was a sacred rite with an import both religious and national . The Hebrews shared this with other Semitic tribes and with the Egyptians ; it is practised by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // A tendency to concentrate on Yahveh as the only true tribal God led on to the more definite mono-theism associated with Moses . This , however , far from being a divine revelation vouchsafed only to the Jews , or even their exclusive discovery , seems undoubtedly to have been adopted by them under the influence of the monotheistic tendencies ( perhaps of separate growth , perhaps mutually reinforcing each other ) which we now know to have been operating both in Babylonia and in Egypt . In Egypt , Akhnaton , Tutankhamen 's father-in-law , a strange character who combined pacifism with ardent monotheism , ruled in the earlier part of the fourteenth century B.c . Babylonian influence over Palestine was very strong from 2000 to 1400 B.C. , and various inscriptions testify to the tendency among the more advanced minds of Babylon to interpret their polytheism in a more or less monotheistic way , by explaining the various deities as so many mani-festations of a single more permanent , more real divine essence . Let us , in passing , remember that all these events took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other will help us to remember what a vast gulf divides them from our own times . It is impossible to do more here than mention a few striking points in the subsequent history . Settling as agricultural people in Canaan after the Exodus , the Jews came under new influences . With their mode of life , their outlook was altered . There was a tendency ( seen commonly all over the world when one primitive people comes into intimate contact with another ) to take over the local Gods . The sacred shrines and rites of the Canaanite Baal // ( a term which merely signifies " Lord " ) and of Ashtaroth were largely taken over by the Jews . The two most prominent features of this local ritual were worship before stone pillars , which were anointed with the blood of the sacrificial animals ; and the worship of trees ( " groves " ) . The Canaanite worship was accompanied by various pagan rites , of which the most extraordinary were those associated with sex , including temple prostitution . The long struggle against " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Jews setting their faces against these undoubtedly more primitive modes of religious expression . It is curious to note how , during this struggle , war , although it degraded the character of Yahveh by intensifying his purely tribal aspect and ascribing to him ideas of cruelty and vengeance , was yet the main purifying force , while peace permitted free-and-easy amalgamation of religious beliefs , and the turning of the Jews towards other Gods than their own . It is strange to see how Solomon and his Temple have been admired ; if the luxury and virtual polytheism of Solomon had continued , with the essen ' tially pagan spirit which built the glories of the Temple , all the qualities for which we value Jewish thought would never have come into existence , and it is safe to prophesy that , without the subsequent wars and national humiliations , the religion of the Hebrews would have become a hodge-podge polytheism like that of Imperial Rome , and have gone the way of forgetfulness with all other such systems . The reason , of course , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polytheism was that Jewish thought had // not yet reached that high level on which Yahveh could be considered not merely as the sole God of the little Jewish nation , but as a God of universal significance , who might have chosen out the Jews as his own people , but who was first and foremost the God of righteousness , only in second place the God of Jewish fortune . It can no longer be maintained that the Jews were the only or even the first people to whom this noble idea dawned , any more than it can be maintained that the Greeks were the only or the first people to whom came the idea of freedom of intellect or of art . None the less , just as the Greeks are our type , in the Western world at least , of the first great actual achievement of intellectual freedom and of the fullness of artistic expression , so the Jews are , in that same world , the people who first achieved a full linking of ethical values with religion . And this could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single God , even if that single God was at first parochial and far from any heights of morality . The most important agency both in the triumph of the single God idea and in its later ethicalpurging was constituted by the so-called prophets , whom to-day we should more accurately call Dervishes . They first came into prominence in the eleventh century B.C. , and seem to have existed in guilds or organised bands ; they were not confined to the Jewish nation , but , of course , as the Old Testament repeatedly testifies , existed also in connection with the Phoenician and Canaanitish religions . They practised rites conducive to the attainment of religious ecstasy or frenzy , as do Dervishes to-day , and also the // " Medicine - men " of various North American Indian , Negro , Eskimo , and other tribes ; and combined this with intense patriotism . In parenthesis , it should be remembered that all the religious fervour which in , for instance , Mediaval Christianity was expended on the idea of a future life , was in early Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our modern sense was not aspired after , and the dead ( as is usual in early religions ) were conceived to lead a shadowy and unsatisfactory if not miserable existence in a dim limbo of an underworld . Even Elisha , although his message was shot through with high ethical ideals , did not , as we may see from the story of Naaman , escape the tribal view of Yahvch , with the accompanying notion that foreign success in battle meant not only temporal defeat , but the overthrow of the national God by another God of the same kind who happened to be more powerful . Amos , Hosea , Isaiah , and their successors , however , succeeded in introducing a new conception ? that Yahvch was a name for the one true God , and that temporal defeat implied that the Jews had not fulfilled their part of the bargain , which was righteous living . As natural corollary , these later prophets denounced the formal ritual of sacrifice , and exalted the claims of justice and righteousness and of a contrite and humble spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering of merely patriotic religion , defeat could become an earnest of ultimate hope instead of only despair ; for out of defeat could and did emerge the Messianic idea . On the other hand , the increasing level of culture // led to the codifying of the legends , beliefs , and practices of the Jewish religion . This appears to have been first attempted in the eighth century ; and in the seventh century a further step was taken by the compilation of what we call Deuteronomy . This was put together more from the standpoint of the priest than of the prophet ; and the existence in book form of the mass of rules and enactments which it contains was the beginning of the excessive attention to ritual which ever since , in varying degree , has characterised Hebrew religion . The scribe was added to the priest and the prophet . In spite of the fact that the Psalms are still officially allotted to David , there is no doubt that they were not written until after or at earliest during the Captivity ; and they reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jews , driven in upon itself by the external disaster , could achieve . The Book of Job , dating from about the same time , shows us a people concerned with the great problems of suffering and of sin ; and , on the return from captivity , the raising of the purely ceremonial idea of expiation on to the ethical plane , typified in the great stress laid upon the Day of Atonement , shows us how this far-reaching idea of spiritual purgation had taken permanent root among the Jews . In the Greek period , from the middle of the fourth century onwards , new ideas emerge . The deity becomes more remote ; the idea of a final but fardistant day of judgment comes into prominence ; the Messianic hope became stronger , but more and more interwoven with the apocalyptic ideas of the // day of judgment ; the reverence for every jot and tittle of the now elaborately codified and annotated Law became fantastic ; belief in a world of angels and devils grew strong ; and the conception of the Divine Wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other semi-mystical , semimaterialistic manifestations of God , paved the way for Philo and his doctrine of the Logos , and so for the philosophico-religious ideas embodied in the Fourth Gospel . This necessarily brief and most inadequate summary of some of the chief changes of two thousand years may at least serve as a reminder of a few important facts . As everywhere , we find even in highly developed theistic religion the survival of legends , practices , and superstitions from cruder times , which have become embalmed under a coating of sanctity so that the higher conceptions of a later age were unable to shake them off . In addition , we can see how even upward steps may involve certain downward consequences . It is a good thing to have a code of morals and of laws ; but if we are not careful , codification will bring formalism , and formalism is a kind of idolatry . If it is true that certain of the extremer Protestant sects have merely substituted the worship of a book for that of a graven image , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious Jewry has obscured the vision of God by giving the place of honour , in their actual practice , to the worship of a code of ritual . We find that the Jews , far from being the recipients of a unique and sufficing revelation , had to achieve a slow progress , and shared many of their // religious ideas with other peoples . Sir James Frazer , in his Folk-Lore in the Old Testament , has given us a measure of this sharing of ideas we find that not only myths and legends , like that of the creation and the flood , but many superstitions , taboos , and rituals of Jewish law were common property to many tribes on the same level of development . The Jews succeeded in raising an ethical monotheism to be the central point of their theology ; but they received the necessary impulse to this from Babylon . The doctrine of the Messiah , " the Anointed One , " grew , under the force of adverse fortune , out of the primitive notions , common to so many early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea would seem to have been projected by hope into the future , and to have been applied to that pre-eminently holy one who would again become a sacred king in a restored Israel . This idea became sharply-defined at the time of the Maccabees , present politics and past history conspiring with the Jewish religious temper to raise up the idea of a personal deliverer , sprung from the line of David , as the future saviour of the nation . The chief interest of early Jewish religion to the present-day world is an historical one ; we can witness the emergence of a noble religious idea from the swaddling-bands of barbaric thought , and then see it , instead of continuing its progress , become in large part hidden again under new wrappings of legalism and tradition . But even to obtain a true view of this process we have to supplement the Old Testament with an impartial history , partly because much of the Old Testament is national propaganda ,                  @ @ @
