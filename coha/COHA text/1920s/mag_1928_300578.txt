Abraham Lincoln in the nude appeared last week as a statuette at the Ainslie Galleries , Manhattan . Rough blobs of bronze compose a gaunt , strong figure of a rail splitter leaning on the haft of his axe , his head thrown backward in revery . The sculptor is Merton Clivette . <P> Said Galleryman George H. Ainslie : " Some will condemn it on the ground that it is undraped . . . that is unessential criticism . . . only by stripping the figure could the artist tell the story he has told ... it expresses the inward idealism of the emancipator in terms of the physical - in the torso emaciated by labor but muscularly overdeveloped by the same toil . The crossed feet seem to grow out of the earth and the strange pose , at once nave and striking , suggests ancient statues of Christ . "
