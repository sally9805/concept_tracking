txt And lel there was great confusion in the Tem pile and the sound of many . . voices . The Oontribs end the Readers together with the Guards of the Temple ran . hither and thither in great confusion . Arid there was lainentation and Much distress . " A Stranger in the Temple ! " they cried , as with One Yeice. hat us cast him , hence into outer dark nesa . " " He is btirStittg open the CannerY , " 8/witted mans ! voices : " Game , we shall find him in the Cannery . " He hath taken the , Valve Handle Wheeze , ' cried another In agony , " , and he hath hurled it to the ' floor and shattered it to a thOuscind pieces . " " He is teaching the gasket containing the Verses Of Saint Later ' , " cried another . " zet thunderbolts from Heaven deatroy hint ! " He hath gone into the Inner Temple , " shrieked the Vestal 's , " he is. tearing I from ther niches Saint Coningsby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bring the Centurions and the Men in Arrn'ort Seize him and feed him to the lions ! " Then a Soft Voice floated through all the Temple and the maddened tumult was stilled . " He doth but bow In reverence to all within the Temple , " esatd the Soft Voice . " He seeketh Saint Latins that he may bend in sackcloth and ashes at her feet . The noise ye heard from the Cannery was he putting new looks and stronger bars on the Great Door . He sought Habit Coningsby and Paint Guylee and Saint Pop and Saint Doug to implore their help . And he doth ask of all Of ye that ye bear with him and that ye aid him that the great Column of the Temple shall endure . Then arose a Joyful cry and they played on the hescgag and the cymbals and the instruments of brass . And they joined hands and danced . ' - . And the Stranger crawled tremblingly from his hiding place under the CanAery . " Goals , " said the Stranger , " Gosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best transportation in Chicago , aside from the steam suburban roads , is the eleVated . It is better than the surface service because it is faster . It is out of the way of . trallic , it operates , with trains instead of single cars and even the local trains make station stops instead of corner stops . The elevated has built up more outlying business sections than any other agency In Chicago . Many business men In outlying sections object to a subway because they think it would be InjuriOus to them . Would they take , the elevated down ? If they would take it down , would they return to horse cars on the surface lines ? If they would not impair the transportation which exists why do they fear transportation which would be better ? At what precise point in the increase in comfort and speed which would be provided by subways does the subway become dangerous to their interests ? If the elevated Is not dangerous , but beneficial , how much better could the subway be without being dangerous ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow transportation down ? ' If so , what degree of speed and comfort will they grant to the car users ? How rapidly . would they permit a ioats-1 senger to travel ? Five , ten , fifteen or twenty miles an hour ? How many people do they think ought to stand in the aisles of a car ? Is a car carrying twice as many people as it should and traveling . one-fourth as rapidly as it should a municipal asset ? Is this condition one which should be maintained and , if It is strange how the legend lingers that the United States during the war , was growing rich through the troubles of Europe . The truth is that , . however strong acquisitiveness of Americans may have been , the thing- wast impossible , because Europe had no wealth to bestow . As millions of its ablebodied were withdrawn from productive industry , and as the fruits of industry were being destroyed by war , Europe was forced to draw from other parts of the world such real wealth Ss food and steel . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , of course , ran Into debt heavily and made the United States a creditor nation . But if the latter country hopes to have the debt paid it must accept in its turn real wealth  --  that is , the products of the factories of a Europe restored to prcisperity . No doubt some great fortunes were made in the United States during the war , At all these must have come out of American resources and American labo ? ? certainly not out of European labor or resources , which were not available for export . The war made Europe poorer , but it made no other part of the world richer , except in promises to pay . It produced some apparent prosperity in the United States and also in Canada , but as greater numbers of dollars were passed from hand to hand the Purchasing power of the dollar declined . In both coup . tries an era of high wagos.and profits has been fol. lowed by one of unemployment . Growing rich at the expense of an Impoverished country Is an impossibility . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States all stand to gain by the reetoraUon of Europe .
