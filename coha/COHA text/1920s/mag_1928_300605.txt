Caught in the Fog ( talkie ) is an uneasy and mildly sarcastic attempt to parody Crook Cinema which , in various disguises , has constituted nearly half of the recent output of Hollywood . Lots of crooks , including May McAvoy , a lady crook , sometimes dumb , sometimes stabbing into speech , come through Florida fog to a deserted houseboat on which the mother of a millionaire 's son has left a pearl necklace worth $200,000 in cinema money . Boob detectives supply most of the comedy and Conrad Nagel 's voice the best vocal sequences of a gentle melodrama which is parody only by afterthought . <P> Behind the German Lines . Diagrams are usually dull , including those which patriots and students kept during the War , marking on maps with little pins the lines of the combatants . It was hard to remember which pins stood for which side or what the irregular graph of a strategy meant in terms of life and death . In this picture , which UFA began to make in 1915 , the lines of the diagrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor a story , it is a history of the War , seen from the German side , but impartially ; most of the battle scenes were taken in battle and the captions are excerpts from official reports . Moving maps give unity to shifting offensives , tiny cavalry in the huge honeycomb of the Carpathians . German soldiers grinning and eating apples as they marched to an imaginary banquet in Paris , airplane battles , mine explosions , Von Hindenburg chewing his mustache , the Kaiser , with his dwarfish , withered arm held sideways , looking gingerly through a telescope , Russians annihilating a last nest of snipers in a taken town ; you find to your surprise that diagrams can be more exciting than even such an excellent War-picture as The Big Parade . <P> The Barker . George Fitzmaurice directs intelligently and movingly the consequences of a circus-man 's proud affection for his son and his fear that circusing will spoil the boy 's chance of amounting to something . Highly admired as a stageplay two seasons ago , the story by Kenyon Nicholson is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is convincing even when he chokes his girl friend ( Betty Compson ) for contriving the seduction of his son by one of the carnival ladies ( Dorothy Mackaill ) . Out of the sound device comes barker-lingo ; Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ( the barker 's son ) smiles just like his father ; and the hitherto silent voice of Milton Sills has been surpassed , in its recording quality , only by that of Lionel Barrymore . Best shot : bed-time in the circus sleeping-car.
