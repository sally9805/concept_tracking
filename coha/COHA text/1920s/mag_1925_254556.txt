Maneuvering around two grand pianos which took up most of the available floor space of a small Manhattan apartment , a young Jew last week went about the business of packing a suitcase . Old newspapers-the inseparable , useless adjuncts of this operation-lay here and there in crumpled disorder , but two , each containing an item which had been circled with a pencil mark , reposed on a table . The first item related how Composer George Gershwin , famed jazzbo , had recently returned from Europe ; the second stated that this Gershwin , when he had finished the piano concerto which Dr. Walter Damrosch has commissioned him to write for the New York Symphony Orchestra ( TIME , May 4 ) , will compose the score of a new musical comedy for the producers of Lady , Be Good . Soprano excitement abruptly galvanized the telephone at the young man 's elbow : he began to address its black aperture . " Yes , " he said , " this is Gershwin . . . . No , no , it 's too hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I ca n't see anyone " Smiling , he hung up the receiver , tossed a last striped shirt into his bag . It was sometimes a nuisance , but he could not honestly pretend that it bored him , this growing public interest in his movements , his past , his plans . <P> George Gershwin , 27 , was born in Brooklyn . At an early age , he contributed to the music of a rickety , rollicking , tenement street , at first with infantile muling , later with a stout , pubescent chirrup . He skinned his knees in the gutters of this street ; he nourished himself smearily with its bananas ; he broke its dirty windows and eluded its brass-and-blue clothed curator . When he was 13 , his mother purchased a piano . <P> It was not that Mrs. Gershwin detected any seeds of musical talent in her grubby young son .

For some time the neighbors suffered ; then they advised him to study in Europe . His first teacher died when he was still torturing Chopin 's preludes . Max Rosen , famed violinist , told him he would never be a musician . When he was 15 , he tried to write a song . It began decently in F , but ran off into G , where it hid behind the black keys , twiddling its fingers at Gershwin . Discouraged , he went to work as a song-plugger for a music publisher . <P> He plugged songs on tin-pan pianos- those renegade instruments that stay up late , every night , in the back rooms of cafes , in the smoky corners of third-string night clubs , till their keys are yellow , and their tone is as hard as peroxided hair . Gershwin 's fingers found a curious music in them . He made it hump along with a twang and a shuffle , hunch its . shoulders and lick its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that tune , honey ?
