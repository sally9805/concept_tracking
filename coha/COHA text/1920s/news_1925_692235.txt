txt Important developments in respect to proposals for legislative relief for the American farmer succeeded a White House conference today , in which President Coolidge discussed the agricultural situation with Secretary Jardine at great length . 1 As a result , it was made known that the Administration is willing to give its approval to a bill creating a commission to dispose of farm surpluses , provided it is understood at the outset that such measure shall not provide for price fixing and shall not require the Government to be responsible for the marketing of crops . Despite the fact that this was a legal holiday , President Coolidge spent a large part of the morning in a discussion with Secretary Jardine relative to conditions in the agricultural West , where the de1 mend for farm relief is more persistent than'in any other section of the country . Asks That Farm Elements Agree . This afternoon Representative L. J. 1 Dickinson of Iowa , head of the farm bloc in the House , called on Secretary Jardine at the Department of Agriculture , where the subject was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4pa , t1t1 ktriown that the Administration would endorse another farm bill in addition to the cooperative marketing measure now pending it Congress , provided the various farm elements concerned could agree upon the terms of a plan that did not wander into a field that the Administration regarded as unsound . Early in January President Coolidge and his advisers will take up for earnest study the economic problem presented by recurring farm surpluses . In a series of conferences that have been arranged for the month of January an endeavor will be made to reconcile the conflicting views advanced by those who are seeking relief for the farmer through 1 the medium of legislation by Congress . Secretary Jardine hopes to complete these conferences within the month , and 1 get a program dealing with farm surpluses before Congress in time for action at this session . While these conferences are in progress the agricultural committees of the two Houses will begin hearings for the benefit of various farm groups . Representative Dickinson 's conference with Secretary Jardine was for the purpose of ascertaining definitely the attitude of the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting to ' be held in Des Moines , Iowa , Tuesday . The entire Iowa delegation was called home to attend this meeting and nearly all the members left this afternoon for Des Moines . Aroused over the Coolidge speech in Chicago , which Middle West farm leaders asserted did not go far enough in meeting the situation confronting the corn belt , a definite movement was 1 launched last week to make a , drive for a farm export corporation backed by the Government . Eleven States participated in this meeting . It was severely critical of Coolidge and the Administration 's program . As a follow of this general meeting , the Iowa delegation was asked to attend a. subsequent meeting to get the views of the farm leaders of that State with the purpose of backing definite legislation this Winter . After his conference with Secretary Jardine today Representative Dickinson appeared satisfied with the attitude of the farm Secretary and said he would convey to the Iowa meeting the word that the Administration was ready to cooperate with the Westerners in work- ing out some program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no specific plan of its own , but it believes that out of the many plans now being urged something can be devised that will be practical and meet the situation . Mr. Dickinson , went away satisfied that the Administration " meant business . " Proposals for meeting the farm surplus situation range from the Haugen-qzmcq#Nary ' bill , which would create a . Government corporation to sell farm surpluses abroad and - definitely maintain a fixed scale of prices in this country on certain commodities by Government purchases , to the suggestion that if Cooperative marketing organizations are stimulated and developed , eventually they will be strong enough to deal with the situation and the Government need take no further step at this time . The Administration has definitely rejected the Haugen-qzmcq#Nary plan as impractical because it involves both pricefixing and putting the Government in the marketing business . On the other hand , the Iowa group , the American Farm Bureau and farm groups from the Northwest have apparently been successful in convincing the Administration that simply to build up cooperatives would not render any effective assistance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , if an agreement can be reached among the farm . organizations , is something in between the two extremes . Commission May Be Set Vp . What apparently is meeting the most favorable consideration here at the moment is a plan to set up a governmental " surplus " commission . It is not proposed that this body should deal directly in exports of grain or meat . products abroad , but that it should be given sufficient governmental financial backing to be in position to step into an emergency situation and help the farmers set up a marketing body of their own to handle surpluses that are depressing the domestic markets . The line tee Administration draws is that the Government Itself must not be drawn into the business of marketing and that its efforts shall be directed at helping the ' farmer to handle his own problem . The Administration denies that it has changed front on the farm situation or that its hand has been forced by the apparent uprising in Iowa and certain Northwestern States , following the Coolidge speech at Chicago before the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jardine dealt at length in his annual report on the surplus problem and declared that the Administration would be ready to deal with it as soon as the legislation affecting choperatives was out of the way . However , there is not the slightest question but that the farm leaders got the impression from the Coolidge farm speech that he was closing the door to legislation at this time along the very lines the Administration now is taking up . They thought that was the case , anyhow , and since then the Middle West has been rumbling . The American Farm Bureau convention went on record for additional legislation dealing with the export or surplus question . Tho corn belt held eleven State meetings , at which the Administration attitude was denounced . Former Governor Frank 0 . Lowden and Samuel Thompson , President of the American . Farm Bureau , have been invited to come to Washington ante explain just what the plan they propose is : the agricultural editors of the country have been invited for the middle of the month , Will Seek Advice on Plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here the middle of January , and it will be asked to deal with the problem . Following this . the Iowa group will be asked to submit its plan ; the St. Paul group their panacea . Some of the biggest farm economists of the country will be called in . The Ad , ministration is asking each sponsor of a program to get down to business with a specific detailed . plan . Then it will take the various proposals and calling in spokesmen for each group attempt to work out some plan to which all can agree . The big fight , as pointed out , will be on whether the Government shall set up machinery to deal with the surplus problem direct or simply set up a body to assist the farmers themselves in dealing with the problem . Senator Capper of Kansas , who ha , s been taking the lead in the demand for some " surplus " legislation , said tonight that he would introduce a bill next week which he hoped might contribute toward meeting the problem . It is being drafted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not yet ready to announce . TO DEDICATE CHURCH SITE . City Officials and Policemen to Join In Catholic Ceremonies Today .
