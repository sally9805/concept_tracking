" Though the Edge has been taken off the Senate , we can look forward with joy to the Morrow . " <P> So punned Business Manager Louis Wiley of the New York Times , toastmaster at a send-off luncheon last week in Manhattan to Walter Evans Edge , embarking as Ambassador to France . But in New Jersey many a Republican looked with anything but joy upon Dwight Whitney Morrow 's decision to leave his embassy in Mexico City and-after the London naval conference-succeed Mr. Edge in the Senate ( TIME , Dec. 9 ) . Joseph Sherman Frelinghuysen of Raritan , N. J. , and his friends had long been planning to boost Mr. Frelinghuysen back into the Senate seat he lost in 1922 . He had already entered the Jersey Republican primary when Governor Larson announced the Morrow appointment . With a contest inevitable , Frelinghuysen friends charged that Mr. Morrow had been tricked into accepting the nomination with false assurances that he would be unopposed in the primary . <P> But in Washington there was joy aplenty at the prospect of Mr. Morrow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm had really brought the Morrow appointment to pass . If a President ever needed in the Senate a friend of the personality and capabilities credited to Mr. Morrow , that President is Herbert Hoover . <P> Leaders . While Mr. Morrow will have no official standing as a Senate leader because of his lack of seniority , he will nevertheless be able to exert a strong Hoover influence on the Senate 's nominal leadership . Senator James Eli Watson has made such a poor fist of leading the Senate since last April that his Republican followers have been casting about for a means of displacing him . <P> Most logical successor would be Senator Charles Linza McNary of Oregon , young ( 55 ) , in popularity the best middleman between Regulars and Insurgents . Last week Senator McNary moved up to Assistant Republican Leader when Senator Wesley Livsey Jones of Washington resigned to succeed Wyoming 's late great Warren as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee . Shrewd . Senator McNary will not openly contest the leadership with Senator Watson . <P> New Face . Except for Mr. Morrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership tangle . The newest Senate face-long , pointed , with fun-filled eyes-is that of Patrick Sullivan , born on St. Patrick 's Day 64 years ago in County Cork , Ireland . Governor Emerson of Wyoming appointed him to the Warren vacancy . Since 1917 he has been Wyoming 's Republican National Committeeman . Like his predecessor a wealthy sheep rancher , Senator Sullivan grew up with the West , prospered with its oil . He lives at Casper in the State 's finest mansion . Plain , bighearted , full of fight or banter , Irishman Sullivan was undisturbed by reports that the Senate might question his right to membership because of a quirk juggled into the Wyoming law by a Republican legislature to prevent one-time ( 1925-27 ) Governor Nellie Tayloe Ross from appointing a Democrat in case Senator Warren died .
