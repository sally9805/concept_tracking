Hotelkeepers do not admire mice . <P> They give their chambermaids severe instructions . Nevertheless , other Manhattan hotels were envious when , last week , mice were reported in the Waldorf-Astoria . For one thing , these mice were dead . For another , they were , as mice go , famed . They had arrived in the luggage of Explorer-Engineer Grant Carveth Wells of England , who was going to take them to the American Museum of Natural History , where they would be mounted against a background of bleak tundra and labeled Lemmus norvegicus , the lemming . Stubby of tail , tawny of fur , blunt of snout , five inches long , lemmings are probably the only mice that ever excited awe in both sexes of human kind . Not Aesop 's mouse who gnawed a lion free ; not the three blind mice whom the farmer 's spouse decaudated ; not the clock-scaling mouse of Mother Goose nor Alice 's dormouse nor the mouse that did not stir the night before Christmas nor even Ignatz Mouse* himself , have histories to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythology and further ; back to Miocene days when lemmings periodically migrated from the Scandinavian peninsula to another continent , perhaps lost Atlantis , by land routes which no longer exist . The lemmings have not yet learned that their oldtime highways are gone . At uncertain intervals ( sometimes after five years , sometimes after 20 ) they mass on an edge of the Scandinavian plateau+ and start a beeline migration . They move by the million , having families more plentifully than ever on the march ; destroying crops and herbage ; preyed on by throngs of bigger beasts . They never hesitate , moving on ( like Theodore Roosevelt and his children** ) over every obstacle , lake , river , mountain , until they reach the sea . Here their blind instinct persists and out they swim , still in the line of the migration , until the last one is drowned . Only a few will have stayed behind , hibernating or lacking true lemming instinct , or perhaps so hardy that they have not felt the need for a more congenial home . These will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.

Author Earl Rossman of Black Sunlight ( 1926 ) mentions that the last migration of the Alaskan lemmings ( Lemmus migripen ) occurred in 1888 . <P> **A Sunday pastime of Roosevelt 's was to set out for a tramp with the children following one line as far as possible , to some unscalable wall or impassable river . The design : to have an exciting time , to teach tenacity of purpose .
