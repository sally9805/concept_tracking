txt The publication of the Treasury 's accounts for the financial year just closed illustrates the extent to which public finance dominates private finance . During the year the Treasury sold $8,486,964,950 certificates of indebtedness and retired $9,144,566,469 . Almost eighteen billions was put into the money market and taken out of it by a privileged borrower , selling taxexempt securities , and paying interest at a rate above what business men can earn in quiet times . The first sign of ease and quiet in the money I market for those competing with the Treasury for funds will be the funding of the floating debt , for its payment is a matter of a still more distant future . For the year the excess of the Treasury 's income over its expenses was $192,176,424 . At that rate it will take a long time to make an impression upon a gross debt of $23,977,450,552 , or even upon the Victory loans of $3,913,933,350 , or the Treasury notes and certificates of $2,699,572,950 , Increase of taxes is not to be thought of . Economy and funding are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which needs rest more than it needs resources . There is plenty of potential credit , but the Government snaps it up , showing now a decrease of the public debt as the taxes come in , and an increase as the Treasury borrows again . Thus de6pite the year 's decrease of debt there was an increase of $24,708,960 for June . The Treasury 's excess of assets over liabilities in the general fund at the year end was $549,673,105 ; or several times the normal amount . As the abnormal conditions are left behind it may be assumed that the Treasury will find means of reducing its till money , and stopping interest proportionately that the idle half billion is put at the command of private users by payment of public debts . Prominent among the funded debt items are the several issues of Panama bonds to a total of $124,901,530 , the latest maturity being 1961 . The canal tolls for the year were $12,280,741 , against $5,664,741 last year . The year 's cost of the canal is not given in the preliminary statement , but experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tolls , to say nothing of interest or amortization . The doubling of the toll receipts , therefore , is welcome , and the military uses of the canal prevent grudging its insolvency on a commercial basis . During the war the canal had no fair opportunity to show its utility to trade , and it remains to he seen how it will fare in competition with the railways . There is at the present moment a rate-cutting competition between them , at a time inconvenient for the railways in a financial sense , but convenient in an operating sense . The railways have to earn their living in competition with a rival which has no anxiety about its fixed charges . If the Treasury would set up a ledger account for the Panama Canal , the public would get an idea of what It costs to compel the railways to cut rates and improve service to such an extent that business goes by land instead of by sea .
