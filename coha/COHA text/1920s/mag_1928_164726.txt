Item : since Aesculapius , physicians have seduced , been seduced by nurses . Item : wine stirs passion . In the office of Dr. John Weston was an attendant-nurse . Mrs. Weston spent a rainy night under another roof , the nurse a " beautiful , marvelous " one under the Westons ' with the doctor . Six years later Nurse Katy returned to make her child an honest son . Kind words , a tear , a plea softened her wrath , ended the play , dismissed a summer audience .
