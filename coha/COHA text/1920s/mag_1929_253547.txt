Controversy over the management of Childs ' restaurants ( TIME , Feb. 11 ) last week closely approached the " You 're another " stage . Into the newspaper advertising columns went Mr. Childs , announcing that " We Reacted in 1928 , But Now , Business Is Fine ! " Mr. Childs vigorously flayed William A. Barber , his deposed counsel , and Harry S. Black , Board Chairman of U. S. Realty and Improvement Co. , whereupon Mr. Black bought advertising space for an open letter in which he termed Mrs. Childs ' elevation to a position as Mr. Childs ' secretary " most unusual and open to criticism " and sneered at the alleged Childs ' policy of " meatless days and boneless nights . " <P> Meanwhile Childs ' patrons were given leaflets which exhorted stockholders to " Please Support the Founder of Our Company " and announced that " We Childs ' employes Want William Childs . " <P> Childs ' Statement . Mr. Childs ' opponents have long argued that Mr. Childs ' vegetarian policies ( now abandoned ) have injured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some malign influence has been affecting Childs ' receipts . A 1927 operating income of $2,451,186 shrank to a 1928 operating income of $1,365,167 , a net decrease of some $1,086,000 . True the company reported a 1928 net profit of $1,002,425 , but this figure was arrived at by including on the balance sheet a profit of approximately $1,060,000 in the sale of Childs ' holdings in the Savoy-Plaza hotel . Minus this transaction , the balance sheet would have shown a loss of about $58,000 , compared to a million-and-a-half profit in 1927 . This poor showing was vaguely attributed by Mr. Childs to " general causes which no management could overcome . " <P> Savoy-Plaza . Though it was the Savoy-Plaza transaction which enabled Childs to show any 1928 profit , yet it was over this sale that Mr. Childs drew Mr. Black into the squabble . The purchase of Childs ' holdings in the Savoy-Plaza by the U. S. Realty and Improvement Co. was arranged between Mr. Barber and Mr. Black , and for his services Mr. Barber charged the Childs ' interests $210,000 . Pointing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts for the year , Mr. Childs added : " And it is interesting to note that Harry S. Black is a member of the Barber committee that is now trying to put the Barber faction back into control of our company . " <P> To this statement Mr. Black tartly replied that " if such a transaction as the Savoy-Plaza could be repeated occasionally it would be greatly to the advantage of your stockholders . " Mr. Black also suggested that Mr. Childs resign , since it was " a foregone conclusion " that he would be ousted when the stockholders meet in March , and since his resignation would " put the Company in the hands of men who can certainly administer its affairs much more efficiently than you and your family seem able to do .
