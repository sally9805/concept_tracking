" The papers did not report one-tenth the shop windows I actually smashed . " <P> Thus , at London last week , famed " militant suffragette " Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst , now a venerable steady-going matron , reminisced to newsgatherers . Recalling the heyday of her truculence , just before British women won suffrage ( 1917 ) , Mrs. Pankhrust said : <P> " One day I smashed a jeweler 's plate glass window with a heavy hammer . Instantly a crowd of hundreds assembled , with a great uproar of shouting , thinking it was the deed of an anarchist . I ran away , to avoid violence . But the jeweler , a fleet-footed young man , ran after me and overtook me . I assumed that he meant to arrest me . But instead , he pressed into my hand a list of his other shops , saying , ' Go and do the same to all of them ! It will be a splendid free advertisement for me ! ' "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
