txt W.T. LOPP 'S WORK IN ALASKA Tribute Is Paid to His Efforts to Aid the Indians and Eskimos . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with keen interest your editoHal in today 's issue relating to W. T. Lopp , superintendent of the education of natives in Alaska . You can not speak too strongly of the service which Mr. Lopp has rendered to the Alaskan natives and , through them , to the Territory of Alaska . during ' the past thirty-five years . Mr. Lopp , with all of the wilderness-reticence of those whose work is in the great spaces of the North , is a man of exceptional character , devoted to the interests of a backward people , rich in experience of their ways , with a lively insight into the workings of their minds and a sense of both the humor and the tragedy of their lot . The play of quiet fun that runs through his talk is assurance of the wholesomeness of his outlook upon man , whether aboriginal or sophisticated . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the whole of Alaska . Including the Indian and Aleut population as well as the Eskimo . He has adapted and supplemented the work of public school teachers to fit the needs of this people in a great variety of ways , sending among them teaching I nurses , securing provision of physicians and hospitals , improving their standards and practices as regards housing andl Industrial habits and methods , furthering ! the cultivation of little farms and gar- , dens where such things are practicable , and taking important steps In the de- I velopment of cooperative buying and selling . But his most picturesque work , and that through which he Is most widely known , is the development of the rein- , deer industry . The earlier methods and j results of this undertaking were under sharp criticism from Secretary Hitchcock and his advisers under the Roosevelt Administration . Mr. Lopp was called to reorganize the industry . This he did in such a manner as to conserve with the utmost care the interests of the natives . The encroachments of those who would exploit the reindeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes have given the Bureau of Education much anxiety all through these years . Mr. Lopp shaped up a system of training of native boys to be herders , which is the most interesting application of educational processes to the fundamental needs of a people which I have ever known . Under this system the native boy is put through a systematic apprenticeship , four years in length ; receives the gift of reindeer from the herd as he proves his capacity to care for them and at the end of his course is not only a competent herder but has a herd of his own and is able to marry and support a family in native dighity and comfort . I most earnestly hope that the report of Mr. Loop 's retirement from the Alaskan service will be found to be incorrect , and that he will long continue to lead this people , whom he has made his own , as a fostering father , both educationally and industrially .
