When George Gershwin 's " Rhapsody in Blue " was played by Paul Whiteman 's orchestra last year , critics knew that they were listening for the first time to the voice of Broadway talking in its sleep ; they were listening to the hot-lipped , two-timing , razz-m'tazzle moan of the saxophones that chuckle and the whistles that whine in the cabarets of Charleston , Memphis , Chicago , in San Francisco roof-gardens and the honkey-tonk joints of Tia Juana ; they were listening to tones as strident as peroxided hair , to rhythms that strutted like Negro girls in diamond tiaras . " The most authentic piece of music , " said Carl Van Vechten , " that ever came out of America . " Critics hurried to crown with bayleaf the youthful brow of George Gershwin . Walter Damrosch besought him to write a jazz concerto for the New York Symphony Society ; Composer Gershwin said he would . <P> Last week the long-heralded composition , " Concerto in F " was played in Carnegie Hall ; with Mr. Damrosch conducting , Mr. Gershwin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hide-thumpers of the Symphony Orchestra in attendance . <P> Conductor Damrosch beamed . At last the throaty and macabre yowl of modern America was about to be lifted into a new melodic line ; patrons were about to learn that there is no modern music worth mentioning except the flawed melodies that a very old barroom piano , operated by a coin , can send tilting , spilling , staggering , into the languor of a summer twilight . <P> Mr. Damrosch raised his arm and thereafter the assembled audience listened intently for a considerable time . They heard pinguid plati- tudes of the symphonic concert hall resuscitated ; they heard discreet echoes of Tschaikowsky , of Stravinsky , of Rachmaninov ; they heard sentimental melodies in pseudo-jazz they heard the anxiously im- mature opus of a youth who-no longer child of the Cyclades and of Broadway-has become an earnest aspirant for musical respectability . There was nothing daring , nothing racy , nothing even individual Law- rence Gilman said : <P> " We need not discuss the question whether his ' Concerto in F ' is good jazz or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question whether it is good music or not ; and we think it is only fairish music-conventional , trite , at its worst a little dull . " <P> Notes <P> Tenor Beniamino Gigli , who has refused all offers to sing over the radio , saying that it would take $50,000 to induce him to broadcast a concert , last week signed a contract to give the Christmas week concert of the Atwater Kent Co. , Philadelphia , on Dec. 27 . A curtain was held and the audience waited uneasily between the first and second acts of Herodiade at the Chicago Auditorium while call boys went to tell William Beck , baritone , that it was time to go on as Vitellius . Baritone Beck was not to be found in his dressing room . A messenger hurried to his hotel , found the baritone lying in bed . He was dead . <P> Carmela Ponselle ( of Meriden , Conn. ) made her dbut in Aida , while her sister Rosa sat applauding in a box .
