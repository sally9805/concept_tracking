Wolf Song ( Paramount ) . Hill scenery is the background of this intelligent attempt to fit music into a romantic story . The foreground is Lupe Velez , who sings attractively and shrilly through her teeth . Gary Cooper is a gangling Kentucky boy who loves and kidnaps a Mexican girl and is harassed at last by the conflict between his memory of the girl 's sweet singing and the fleering chantey of the mountaineers . <P> Vivacious and increasingly competent as an actress , Lupe Velez was born in San Luis Potosi , seven days by donkey from Mexico City . When she was twelve she danced at a church festival . A booking agent , impressed , hired her as ballerina for a theatrical troupe . Her family thought a convent would be better for her . After two years in Our Lady of the Lake , at San Antonio , Tex. , she went back to Mexico to dance . She was in Monterey with a musical comedy called Rataplan when someone from Hollywood saw her and took her north . She worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair-banks 's leading lady in The Gaucho . Brunette , she is five feet high , weighs 105 pounds , can play the ukelele , likes dancing best . <P> Her press agentry recently included a story of Lupe 's gifts from her leading-man ( " sweetie " ) , Gary Cooper . These were two live , well-mated , very hungry eagles , and one stuffed eagle . Lupe was quoted : " Thees heegles-they eat and eat , now that damn mamma heegle , I hate her , for I theenk she get more and more fat and pretty soon poor Lupe she have little heegles all over the place , all eating rabbits and more round steak . " <P> Hearts in Dixie . First of several Negro cinemas scheduled for imminent release , this picture has only one white actor in its cast-Richard Carlyle , who plays a doctor . Spirituals , nicely sung , occur , as advertised , 30 times in the hour and ten minutes Hearts in Dixie takes to run . The voodoo doings , the cotton pickings and Bible-shoutings are just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life " colorful " and " primitive " expect of the race , just as people of another class expect vaudeville patter and tap-dancing . The pathos , based upon the low temperature of the ground enclosing somebody named Massa , is repetitious . All is redeemed , however , by the humor of a gaunt , pop-eyed blackamoor named Stepin Fetchit , cast as " Gummy , " laziest of blackamoor husbands . The unpretentious story , genuinely moving at its best , at its worst a kind of Bostonian black-bottom , deals with an old Negro 's denial and final acceptance of modern medical methods . Best shots-Gummy , whose feet hurt . <P> The Spieler ( Pathe ) is a tense picture of carnival life faithful to its background . From the time a crooked spieler goes to work for a girl-proprietor who is trying to run an honest show , the action moves ahead faster and faster through beautifully dovetailed sequences to a climax in which the spieler , armed with a tent stake , fights his way out of a battle with a mob of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renee Adoree and a competent minor cast replace with simple , effective acting the sentimentality common to this type of picture . Best shot : the quiet , sinister mob jostling in the midway .
