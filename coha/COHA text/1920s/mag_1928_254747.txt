Friends of the Signora Rachele Mussolini were glad to believe , last week , a pleasant story illustrative of her undoubted goodness of heart . It is told that , prior to the birth of the bambino Romano Mussolini ( TIME , Oct. 10 ) , she learned how intolerable was the lot of some 600 antiFascists then exiled upon blistering , volcanic islands off the coast of Sicily . Acutely sensible of the sufferings of others , she was moved to intercede with the Signor Benito Mussolini . Soon it became known that some at least of the 600 exiles would be released . Last week a round , generous 300 were allowed to return to their homes . Among them were seven onetime deputies , two priests , numerous journalists . . . . <P> Not the least curious fact concerning the Signora Rachele Mussolini is that her very name is unmentioned in the sole authorized biography of Il Duce , a volume of 352 pages in which space is found to depict several mistresses . Thus this great lady is the ideal Italian type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the matronly virtues and proclaims that , as befits Caesar 's wife , she is transcendently above suspicion . <P> Born in a poor stone hut , there is now no palace that the native peasant girl of the Romagna might not enter . She has been a toiler in the fields , a gatherer of grapes , a shepherdess , a household servant , even a tavern tap-wench . Today , by a pretty pirouette of Fate , she is the consort of a man on whom Italy has bestowed the Collar of the Annunziata . He who wears that supreme badge and his wedded wife are both legally " cousins of the king . " <P> Picturesque is the story of how the tavern keeper Allessandro Mussolini-father of Benito-warned his tap-wench Rachele Agostini against his son . " Do not let yourself think of that young man , " he is said to have said . " It would be better to throw yourself under a train . Married to him you will have neither happiness nor peace .
