Fischer 's Brother-in-Law Declares lie Got Explosion Messages . On his return yesterday from Hamilton . Ontario . - where he had been looking after the interests of his brother-in-law , Edwin P. Fischer , the sender of the Wall Street explosion warnings , detained in Canada as insane , Robert A. Pope reiterated his belief that Fischer 's written and verbal warnings to friends here to stay away from Wall Street on Sept. 15 and 16 had been inspired by telepathic messages from those concerned In the bomb plot . Mr. Pope went to the offices of the Lams . Detective Agency , where he was questioned by Raymond F. Burns . He told Mr. Burns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and added that other members of the family were similarly endowed . Statement by Brother-in-Low . Later in the evening Mr. Pope gave out this statement : " Some four weeks ago my brotherin-law , Mr. E. P. Fischer , began to show signs of mental disturbance such us he had shown on two previous occasions . One of the Bellevue authorities cal psychopathic problems was consulted with . He advised that if Mr. Fischer went to some quiet place that it might all pass off , and consequently it would be better not to be too precipitious about having him sent to a sanitarium , which might have the effect of intensifying his difficulty . " About a week or ten days later it was evident that my brother-in-law was lot going to be content to remain in the camp that he had gone to . and that he was not getting better , hence the family endeavored to have him examined as a preliminary to having him sent to a proper sanitarium . Every effort was made to accomplish this , but the apprehension of the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be brought before a justice prior to commitment , resulted in every effort that the family made was frustrated . Mr. Fischer , who had been in correspondence with the management of the Toronto tennis tournament regarding securing the entry of some of the best players , left New York in this connection on Friday . the 10th , arriving as planned at Toronto for the opening of the tournament . During the tournament and following days he spent his time in Toronto or Niagara-on-the-Lake , at the Queens and the Queens Royal Hotels . respectively , where he was a guest of his very old and dear friend , the owner-manager , Mr. Winnett , who subacquently told me that ' Eddie could not pay for anything in his hotel , ' and that he had given him a card which entitled him to guest privileges . Family Receives Telegram . " ' the family received a telegram stating Where he was on the morning of Wednesray , the 15th. asking for a check to he sent to him at Niagara-on-theLake. a check previously having failed to reach-him which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Toronto . Knownig that he would wait for the check , it was decided that I would he able to locate him , and that I should leave at once for Canada for the purpose of getting him into a sanitarium , as it was evident that this would be the best thing for him and hasten his recovery . I arrived in Toronto ? on the Morning of Sept. 16. and went straight to Mr. Winnett , the manager of the Queens Hotel , and with his very helpful co-operation located my brother and arranged by telephone to meet him at Niagara-on-the-Lake. where he was . " I met Mr. Fischer as planned at the dock at Niagara-on-the-Lake. he coming aboard the boat . and we proereded to Canadian Niagara . Falls , where we spent the night at the Niagara Hotel , While there in the early morning I arranged by telephone to have him received by the Guelph Sanitarium of Guelph , Ontario , and received instructions on how to accomplish this . During my contact with my brother at this time I endeavored to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to predict the bomb outrage . I telling him that it had actually happened . He said that ' Whenever any of my friends are in danger I know it  --  it comes to me . ' Dismissed Matter of Prophecy . " A similar reply was gotten from him by me on every occasion that I endeavored to get information from him on this point . My interest being primarily psychological , believing as I did then , and do now , that he has the power of receiving telepathetic communication , it never even remotely occurring to me that he could have had any knowledge of such a plot , except through somethine in the nature of telepathy . It might be noted here parenthetically that . he prophesied that New York would be blown up some three weeks previously , and at that time I also endeavored to see if he had any basis in fact for such a statement , but he replied vaguely about it . coming ' to him out of the air . ' 1 dismissed the matter from my mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not at all of a secretive nature . " We arrived at Hamilton as planned at 8:30 on the morning of Friday , the 17th , and I immediately arranged . with the captain of the police for an escort to the sanitarium at Guelph . The arrangement made by the deputy was vetoed by the Magistrate and resulted in my seeking the co-operation of my lawyer , Mr. Thoma.s Hobson of Hamilton , who agreed to detain him while 1 made arrangement to have him taken to the police station for examination and hold on my warrant that he was not mentally responsible . This was accomplished as planned and immediately a commission of alienists were called in and adjudged him as not competent . This proceeding took place without any objection on the part of Mr. Fischer , partly because he did not know lie was being examined by doctors . He told stories and joked and entertained the authorities . Sought to Commit Fischer . " I then endeavored to have him committed to a very fine asylum in Hamilton , Ontario , but unsuccessfully , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Canadian citizen . I then instructed the authorities , my lawyer , the doctor in the case and the immigration authorities to facilitate his return to New York at the earliest possible moment , for the sake of getting him where he could be properly taken care of with the least delay , also thinking that this would be the best thing to facilitate his examination by the authorities here In New York . " Having done everything that I could to make my tesether-in-law comfortable . I left him in care of his old friend , Dr. Roseburgh , and returned to New York to see the authorities to aid them in the elimination of Mr. Fischer from any suspicion of connection with this disaster . " The following statements are in answer to the specific questions by the re-porters : " There has never been any effort to keep Mr. Fischer in Canada . He happened to be there and my sole purpose was to get him into the nearest good sanitarium at the earliest possible moment . As stated above , it was my Instructions rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to facilitate his immediate return to New York . " Mr. Takamina was one of his innumerable friends , a wealthy Japanese gentleman of the highest standing . The statement attributed to 11r . Fischer that he . was a manufacturer of high ex- , plosives , as far as 1 knew , has no foundation in fact . It is correct that I attributed thiaprediction of the disaster and warning no his friends to psychic receptivity . No cne who has really known my brother-in-law has been willing to believe for one moment that he could by the remotest possihnity have been a party to this plot . He is one of the gentlest of men and greatly loved by a host of innumerable friends . " Definite information that Fischer had previously been considered mentally unsound was obtained from Dr. William L. Russell , medical superintendent of Bloomingdale Hospital at White Plains . Dr. Russell said that Fischer was confined for eighteen months , beginning in 1095 , and for about the same length of time , beginning in 1910 , and that he had been committed on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man very well , " maid Dr. Russell . " He had periodic attacks of great excitement during which he used strong language and had many curious ideas . His sister often came to see him . " Dr. Russell said that the records showed that Fischer was suffering from " mania depressive psychosis . " J. R. Delatour Buena a college classmate of Fischer , said he met the latter two weeks ago on a subway train . Fischer told him that he was employed by the French High Commission and predicted that there would soon be uprisings in New York and elsewhere . 0 . Weinstein of the Russian Soviet Bureau explained yesterday that Fischer 's possession of a copy of the " Soviet Republic , " a paper published at 110 West Fortieth Street , as reported in dispatches from Hamilton , did not indicate that he had any connection with the representatives of the Russian Soviet Government in this country or was necessarily a sympathizer with the Soviet cause .                 @ @ @ @
