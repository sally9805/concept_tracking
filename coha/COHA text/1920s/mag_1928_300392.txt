Life at this level now costs about $15,000 or $16,000 a year . " <P> So wrote , last week , Professor Yandell Henderson ( physiologist ) and Assistant Professor Maurice Rea Davie ( sociologist ) from Yale , again expressing the trite thought that college professors earn too little . <P> At Yale , full professors receive from $6,000 to $8,000 ; the Medical School salaries are somewhat higher . At the Law School certain professors make $10,000 . <P> Full professors at Yale therefore saw slim chance of $15,000 salaries even if they , like Professor Henderson , taught at Yale more than 25 years . If professional salaries were to be raised , as seemed likely , it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something like $10,000 ; more than $6,000 or $8,000 but still far less than $15,000.
