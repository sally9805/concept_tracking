In Paris the announcement that M. Caillaux was bringing home for ratification merely a stop-gap debt settlement ( see Page 5 , THE CABINET ) wrought one effect expressible in figures . On the Paris Bourse itself , in spite of the French Government 's placing buying orders for 40,000,000 francs , the exchange value of the franc fell from 4.75c per franc to 4.62c . <P> Developments in the Press were naturally lass capable of being accurately evaluated , but reflected a general tone of condemnation for Mr. Mellon and sympathy for M. Caillaux . The French temperament exploded into many lurid headlines and wild words , such as : " France , with a knife at her throat is being offered up to a God more detestable than the God of War ! " But two questions were asked everywhere that summed up the tenor of thinking Frenchmen 's worries : 1 ) How can France keep up her prestige in Europe for another five years , without knowing what her total obligations will eventually be ? 2 ) Can M. Caillaux actually secure ratification by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over 800,000,000 francs ( $40,000,000 ) a year for five years , and at the end of that time leave the principal of her debt exactly as large as before ? <P> The answers seemed to be : 1 ) France 's prestige will certainly suffer . 2 ) If a vote of the French people were taken , they would unhesitatingly repudiate the Caillaux agreement ; but M. Caillaux has a 50-50 chance of securing its ratification in the Chamber . <P> That some stormy scenes are to be expected , may be judged from a statement by Deputy Louis Marin : " M. Caillaux 's failure is the best thing that could have happened to us . I think he must have sought it himself when he saw he was rushing into an inextricable situation . The Government undoubtedly and the Parliament certainly will reject the proposals he is bringing . " <P> In London it was generally felt that the French-British as well as the French-U . S. debt settlement is now considerably muddled . <P> The present status of the French-British agreement ( TIME , Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not less " than what she pays the U. S. And now that an agreement of a purely temporary nature is all that is contemplated between France and the U. S. , Britannia will have a hard time trying to figure out what is due her in the long run .
