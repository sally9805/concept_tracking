txt In a letter to the Board of Estimate . signed by Henry H. Curran , its counsel . and headed " Subways or Children J.-Which or Both ? " the City Club of New York appealed yesterday to the board " in the name of New York 's two million children , big , little and babies , " not to build the proposed Fifty-third Street subway as part of a new independent system inherited from the Hylan Administration , but to join the Washington Heights-Eighth Avenue subway , now under construction , to the existing lines of the B. M. T. Mr. Curran , who gained an expert knowledge of transit when he was Borough President of Manhattan . urged that all the city subways , existing and prospective , be made self-sustaining out of their own revenues and expressed the hope that this might be done with a six-cent fare or perhaps even a fare of five cents . For the Board of Estimate to go ahead with its plan for the construction of an independent subway system , he asserted , would deprive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other improvements so much needed by them by requiring the city to use every available dollar of its borrowing capacity for subway construction . Mr. Curran opposed the proposed *300,000,008a ** constitutional amendment to permit the city to borrow money for subway Construction outside the to per cent . constitutional limitation . Offers Transit Program . On behalf of the City Club . he presented the following concrete transit program : First  --  Reject the Fifty-third Street branch of the new subway , and abandon the balance of the enterprise , except for connecting links to the B. M. T. ; Second  --  Tie the Eighth Avenue line to the B. M. T. system at Fiftyninth and Fourteenth Streets , and tie it in also at a point to the south ? in this case perhaps by tunnel ; Third  --  Take your part in bringing about an early rearrangement of the dual subway contracts to the end that all our subways may be made self-sustaining on their own rev-enues ; Fourth  --  Build ( a ) the unbuilt balance of the dual system as planned in 1913 , ( b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transit Commission , ( 2 ) crosstown lines , exterior and interior , connecting Bronx . Queens and Brooklyn , and ( d ) all the other connections and extensive additions that are so much needed  --  all as part of the present dual system , and all as soon as borrowing power therefor is released from constitutional debt limitations ; Fifth  --  Rezone the city so as to de'centralize industry ; Sixth  --  Withdraw your support of the proposal in the Legislature at Albany to exempt $300,000,000 more from the city 's borrowing limitation ; Seventh  --  Urge the passage by the Legislature at Albany of a revised pay-as-you-go section in the city 's charter ; Eighth  --  Adopt and go ahead , vigorously , with a program of permanent improvements , in addition to subways , beginning with parks , playgn.urck and schools , and going straight down the list , arranged in order of urgency  --  and carried out to a proper point of reasonable accommodation . Board Gets Question Monday . The City Club 's letter was made public because the question of constructing the Fifty-third Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the Committee of the Whole on Monday , Mr. Curran as-1 Dented that the Fifty-third Street subway was not needed , unless it was to be used a. , ui an independent system , and that its construction would cause a neecaess expenditure of millions if the new subways were to be connected with existing lines . Mr. Curran amplified his argument in a speech before the Municipal Affairs Committee of the Women 's National Republican Club . " The dance as the sidewalks of New York is a dance of death today , " he said . " At present we kill about a child a day . Th. , children have inadequate or no playgroundr in most sections . If we giv ? them no more , we are certainly not being fair to them . " If all the money which the city will be at liberty to borrow after March 1 to spend on the unnecessary Fifty-third Street subway and tunnel could be spent for the children we would leave Something for posterity . Under present plans , playgrounds , libraries and museums  --  frills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone a enny . " ' These children have no voice and they have no votes : but they are citizens of our city , and the time is very near at hand when they , rather than you or I , will have the voice and the vote that will decide how New York shall be governed and who shall do the governing . " Mr. Curran said that on March 1 , according to Controller Berry , the city Would have a borrowing capacity of about $200,000,000 . This entire amount , he said , could easily be taken up without using any money for subway construction . as the city needs to spend thirty-five million dollars for schools , ten for hospitals , forty for parks and beaches , forty for playgrounds , seven for docks , seventy for sewage disposal and fifty millions for a triborough bridge . Calls Self-Support the Solution . Mr. Curran declared that the problems of new subways and of caring adequately for the children of the city would both be solved by making the city 's investment in all subways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will do just one thing  --  make all our subways self-supporting on their own revenues  --  you will uncover all the subway money you may need or want , without invading or even threatening any other kind of city Money , " he continued . " To make our subways self-supporting  --  that is the point of the whole affair  --  the key that will open the lock to orderly and sensible financing of the city 's needs of every kind . We are coming back to this point later on in this letter . But , before emphasizing again this constructive principle , we desire to call your attention to the destructive nature of your efforts if you build the Fifty-third Street extension as planned . " To ' begin with , let us see , in round figures , how far in the hole we have already descended , on the subway side of the proposed stone wall . In addition to the 300 millions of dollars . of capital alone , which is the city 's funded investment in the dual subway system , we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the new subway  --  on the one branch of the new subway that runs from Inwood down through Washington Heights and Harlem , thence along the west side of Central Park , and so on down through Eighth and Sixth Avenues and Church Street to Park Place . That makes 420 millions . " And , out of the 420 millions , 360 millions are financially in a hole . For only 60 millions out of the whole 420 are self-supporting . Those 60 millions represent the first subway , authorized in 1900 , and later made a part of the dual system , which soon became more than self-sustaining , on the basis of the self-suffocation of the crowds it carried . It still retains both qualities , and the Appellate Division has so certified It , as to the first , so that the first subway 's 60 millions are not charged against the city 's borrowing capacity . But the other 360 millions are not self-sustaining , and thus become a charge against the city 's borrowing capacity . Sees Greater Extension . " Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastward branch . But if we build the Fifty-third Street branch , we have got to keep on going ahead with the new system . We must build other branches , so that it may become a tree by itself . We must connect the Eighth Avenue trunk with branches eastward to Long Island , so that there will be a double swing for the trains . We must go still further and establish other branches and twigs as planned . " And ? by , . the time we are through we shall have built and also equipped , ourselves , a new subway system , competing directly with the great dual subway system we already own  --  which the lessee companies built in part and equipped in full  --  at the highest rate of cost of construction that the city has ever known  --  over double the rate before the war  --  and at a total cost , for this new system alone , of over $600 , - 000,000 , at the very least . It will , more likely , be $800.000,000 . It may be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , let us still call it $600,000.000 . " In effect , we may now divide our subway expenditures , funded and proposed , chronologically into three enterprises , as follows : 1900 subway $60,000,000 1913 subway 240,000,000 1925 600,000,000 Total $900,000,000 " But only the first small item of $60,000,000 is self-sustaining . The other two items , totaling $840,000,000 , are not self-sustaining , as now maintained or planned . Consequently , the last two items require a crutch from some other quarter . We refer , of course , solely to the city 's funded subway investment , present and future , as distinguished from that already made by the two lessee companies , the Interborough and the B. M. T. " The crutch is derived primarily from the annual budgetary appropriation of over $10,000,000 a year to carry the interest and amortization burden of the city 's investment of $240,000,000 in the second subway system , which is not self-sustaining from the revenues . This carrying expense must be paid . If revenues do not pay it , the money must come from somewhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city  --  whether they use the subway much , little or not at all  --  through the agency of this tenmillion-dollar item in the annual budget . The crutch must shortly be enlarged to provide for the interest and amortization charges on the third item of $600,000,000 , $120,000,000 of which has already been spent , or authorized . and that means $30,000,000 more a year , to be paid by the taxpayers and the rentpayers , as long as the fare on this third subway is 5 cents . And then , for a time at least , there may also be an operating deficit on the new subway , if it be operated on a 5-cent fare . Even if we disregard this possible operating deficit , we find the crutch growing from $10,000,000 a year to $40,000,000 every year , and perhaps more  --  if you stick to a 5-cent fare on the third subway . Calls Sum Dead Weight . " But this forty-million-dollar crutch is to bear the burden of current carrying deficits only . And it is to be paid by budget ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every year , for as long as you keep the third subway on a five-cent fare , to be paid out for subway deficits , instead of for children 's schools , parks and all their other usual advantages of American civilization . " And , worse than all , when this new subway system is filushed , we shall have to run it for three years at a 5-cent fare , if it be municipally operated , with the deficits referred to . Then , when that period is over , we shall have to raise the fare to 8 or 10 cents , if we try to make this new subway fully self-sustaining , and thus threaten it with a deeper financial hole than ever , because of its inability to compete on a higher fare with the present city-owned system , if the latter still be operated on a 5-cent fare . " And , remember well , that always overhanging the enterprise is this threat of municipal operation of it . " If the new subway be operated , not by the city , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal for private operation based on the obviously fatal foundation , financially speaking , of a five-cent fare , unless the city is to pay the inevitable deficits . In the event then of a farce of eight or ten cents for the new subway , under private operation , we are confronted three years sooner with the difficulty of successfully operating a subway on an eight or ten-cent fare in competition with two other subways that operate on a five-cent fare . Would Stop 53d Street Branch . " The thing to do now is to stop short and reject this Fifty-third Street scheme , and to tie up the Eighth Avenue line , now under construction , with the E. M. T. system at Fifty-ninth Street ; and again to the south , by eastward extension from Eighth Avenue , at Fourteenth Street and Sixth Avenue ; and , again , elsewhere to the south and east , by a new tunnel or otherwise . " If we tie this line tothe B. M. T. part of our city-owned dual system at Fifty-ninth and Fourteenth Streets and elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and from Queens through the B. M. T. Sixtieth Street tunnel , and to and from Queens and Brooklyn through the B. M. T. Fourteenth Street tunnel  --  in each case without having to build a new tunnel ? and , again , to Brooklyn further south . These facilities will add to the advantage of those who live or work near the B. M. T. lines and consequently will use such extensions of the B. M. T. part of the dual subway system . This will be a boon to hundreds of thousands of our citizens traveling one way or another through the maze of rapid transit routes in the City of New York . Anybody who rides in the present subways can quickly figure it out . " And it is to be remembered always that , under the present contract , the B. M. T. may be compelled by the city to equip and operate this new Eighth Avenue line . The B. M. T. has no choice in the matter , if the city so desires . We are no longer subject to doubtful negotiation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New subways are needed . We all know that . But they should be built as additions to and as parts of our present city-owned subway system . We should scrap at once all consideration of a new and independent system . To continue this misguided fantasy of an era of rapid transit demagogy is to swallow  --  hook , line and sinker  --  the mistake of a previous and different City Administration , and to make the mistake your own . Now is the time to stop . " Self-sustaining subways would make the proposed $300,000,000 constitutional amendment unnecessary , said Mr. Curran . " The City Club , " he said , " is vigorously opposed to any such wildcat finance as borrowing this extra three hundred million dollars and then shoveling it into tubes and tunnels that do n't pay . " If it were necessary to increase the fare to six or seven cents to make the subways self-sustaining , he added , it should be made clear that the extra money would go for the benefit of the children . Repeats " Cobweb " Suggestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway system , made originally in his campaign for the Mayoralty as the fusion candidate in 11:21 . He declared that the city had built its rapid transit facilities in the form of a wheel without a rim , but with the hub in lower Manhattan and %. ith spokes radiating to the Bronx , Brooklyn and Queens with no belt line connecting the three last named boroughs . " Our system should better approximate the plan of the cobweb , " he continued . " The spider is a successful business animal who builds his cobweb with numerous cross strands as well as spokes , and the spider is thereby enabled to use his own rapid transit layout with definite and prosperous effect . He gets there , cross-lots , and he seldom misses .. We human beings miss , every day or our lives . "
