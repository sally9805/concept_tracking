The Shipping Board last week sold the four ships of the Pan-America Line . The Pan-America , Southern Cross , Western World and American Legion , combination cargo and passenger ships of the " President " type , have plied between the Atlantic Coast and South America . They were operated for the Government under contract by the Munson Line and constituted one of the major services still operated for the Government . The last big sale of a going line was that of the California-Orient Line to the Dollars ( TIME , Apr. 13 ) . <P> The Munson Line had offered $3,200,000 for the four ships . Moore &; McCormack , another shipping firm , offered $4,101,100 , whereupon the Munson Line bettered its bid to $4,104,000 . Last week the Shipping Board called before it both bidders , directing them to make their best bids . Moore &; McCormack objected to several features of the offering , and when the Board refused to make concessions , withdrew their offer . So the Board closed with the Munson Line . Terms : $4,104,000 , one quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4% interest ; a bond of $1,000,000 to be put up to insure operation of the service for five years . <P> So was disposed of another important section of the Government-owned merchant marine .
