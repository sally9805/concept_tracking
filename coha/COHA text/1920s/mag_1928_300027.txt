Royalists and Imperialists rejoiced , last week , as progress was made away from Democracy : <P> Poland 's eccentric dictator , Marshal Josef Pilsudski , was besought by 1,500 delegates of the Monarchist Party to proclaim himself " Emperor of Poland " last week . <P> Marshal Pilsudski who is now gulping mineral water at a Rumanian spa , " The Baths of Hercules , " did not repudiate the suggestion of a Crown . Poland was of truly Imperial dimensions circa 1650 in the great days of Ladislas IV and John Casimir II . <P> Since practically every Hungarian is a royalist , the perennial squabble between Budapest politicians is over whether to elect a king or to recognize the legitimate claim of Prince Otto of Habsburg . Last week legitimist Hungarians were wroth to the point of oaths and tears because Prime Minister Count Stephen Bethlen has just appointed the leader of the electionists , Herr Julius Gombos , to be Under Secretary for War . <P> At present Hungary is ruled by His Serene Highness Nicholas Horthy de Nagybanya , Governor of the Kingdom-which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually a dictator , leans covertly toward the electionists . The legitimists suspect him of wanting to snatch for himself 15-year old Prince Otto 's Crown . <P> The actual and holy Crown of St. Stephen without which no monarch has been King of Hungary for 900 years , now lies in a great vault atop the citadel of Buda . <P> One of the few direct and absolute commands issued recently by British Emperor George V was cabled to Santa Barbara , Calif. , into the harbor of which steamed , last week , H. M. S. Durban , carrying Prince George , youngest son of Their Majesties , in his technical capacity of a mere Naval Lieutenant . <P> The command , really a prohibition , forbade Prince George to fly from Santa Barbara to Hollywood . So Prince George motored to Hollywood and famed Douglas and Mary fed him there . <P> H. R. H. said : " Your California climate is certainly all that you advertise it to be . " <P> " Oh yes , I like the Navy very much . <P> They treat me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better cabin . " <P> Hearst Feature Writer " Annie Laurie " tittered at fatuous length : <P> " Prince George-dear me . . . young and good looking , and heart whole and fancy free . Do you suppose there is a girl in California who will have a moment 's peace while the prince is here . . . deep eyes and such a voice of mellow sweetness . . . . <P> " Dear , dear-here he is right in our midst-a real , live prince . . . . Whisper-I 'd really rather be a traffic cop myself , would n't you ? <P> " I wonder if the blue jellyfish . . . out at Point Lobes . . . have kings of their own , big jellyfish , bluer and more transparent than all the rest-and do they have royal weddings , do you suppose ? Maybe . . , " * <P> After leaving Santa Barbara , Captain Coleridge of H. M. S. Durban radioed to the Associated Press as he steamed toward the Panama Canal and Bermuda : " I should be obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Highness Prince George during the visit are without foundation and are unauthorized . " Seemingly this blanket statement was intended to smother an A. P. story that H. R. H. had split his trousers in Santa Barbara , while performing the " varsity drag . "
