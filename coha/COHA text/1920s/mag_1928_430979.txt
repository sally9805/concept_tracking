T HE departure of what is possibly the most distinguished company of American specialists that has yet visited Soviet Russia ? educators , presidents of educational institutions , psychologists , and philosophers , with John Dewey as chief representative ? draws our attention again to Moscow and the new regime which in the name of the world 's proletariat now rules a tenth of the world 's population . Upon arriving in the Red capital , the delegates were officially received by Anatol Lunacharsky , Soviet Commissar of Popular Enlightenment as his title reads . They are now devoting their time to a study of Soviet schools and educational methods in both city and country . They are visiting evening classes for adults and the special " workers ' faculties " ? in Communist nomenclature , " Rabfaks " ? which have been established in connexion with many high schools and technical institutes , and some of the ten thousand or more " cultural outposts " and cottage reading-rooms from which Soviet literature and propaganda are distributed , in which , more or less regularly , classes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant men and women are taught to read and write , to spell , to figure , and to believe in the unsleeping beneficence of the Party and its energetic Directorate . Education in Soviet Russia seeks not so much to provide free development for the individual ? to " release the imprisoned splendour from within , " of which Browning speaks ? as to convert him emotionally and intellectually to the Marxian gospel of salvation , to permeate the child from infancy with " the consciousness of the Revolution " and of the working-class , with a feeling for Proletarianism and a conviction of the authoritarian economic , social , and political idea . This idea is sovereign in Bolshevist Russia ? more important than the idea of self-fulfilment , of race , of patriotism , of prosperity , or of God . Not long ago the present writer chanced to meet and interview The Idea in Moscow , in the persons of several eminent Bolshevists , among them , Comrade Lunacharsky . I was standing in a large hall where a special collection of paintings and sculpture had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wall hung a number of clear ,  | cold water-colours , the work of a hunter living on the coast of Novaya Zemblya within the Arctic Circle ; they were landscaper , and sea-scapes fringed with ice-bergs . Considering that the painter was a trapper , not an art student , they were very well done . There were portraits in oil of Circassian women and warriors , or mountaineers , in dagger-decorated burkas ; they looked like Italian primitives ? more primitive even ? and were the work of a Transcaucasian . Several charming woodcuts of peasant faces and scenes by an unknown Ukrainian artist aroused my admiration . But on the whole the statuary exhibited more striking talent and skill than the paintings . In the lobby , carved in wood , towered the figure of a peasant-woman , arms akimbo , kerchief over her head , straddling the furrows , vivid as life . The centre of the main hall was occupied by an heroic group of male figures in white plaster , nude , and bowed , bearing on their shoulders a pallet or bier on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleep of death . Of classic conception and noble solemnity the group was entitled simply , Burial of Lenin ; it was the work of Merkurof , a sculptor who had achieved fame before the Revolution . The Government Art Commission , which is virtually the sole patron of all the fine arts in Russia , had ordered it especially for this decennial jubilee exposition . As I lingered , admiring it , I realized that a guard was clearing the hall of its few visitors and on enquiring the reason was told that the Government Art Commission had arrived in official automobiles for the purpose of censoring the exhibition before its opening . ( I had been admitted by special dispensation it appeared ? prior to the public opening , already two and a half months late . ) As I moved slowly toward the door , the seven members of the Commission , led by Lunacharsky , entered the hall and standing in front of the sculpture , began to discuss it . I watched them with interest , inwardly abusing myself for my paralysing ignorance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which I lingered , I nerved myself and advancing toward Lunacharsky , presented my card to him with a word or two in English , at the same time observing him closely . He is a thickset man of great nervous energy , about sixty years of age , of dark aristocratic Russian type , with a slightly greying goatee and moustache , and piercing black eyes behind narrow nose-glasses . He wore a black coat and peaked black hat of astrakhan ; like the others , he had not removed it in the hall . He replied to me at once in French , cour- teously assuming that I spoke it ; and in response to my request for an opportunity to talk with him about Russian schools and educational policies , named a time when I might come to his office , and consented to answer certain questions which I would put to him in writing . Two or three days later , I learned that the opening of the artexhibit had again been postponed because the Art Commission had been displeased with several pieces , among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the opening . Why ? . . . There was nothing irreverent about it ; it was the most nobly impressive group in the collection . The concept was self-evident . Was it not beautiful ? It seemed so to me . . . . It had been disapproved because it betrayed no proletarian feeling . It was too chaste , too classic , and therefore too bourgeois ? too dead . There was nothing about the limbs of the youthful pall-bearers to suggest that they were proletarian limbs . There were no overalls , no pick , shovel , sledge , or sickle ; no miner 's lamp , or carpenter 's square ; no boots ; the faces even were not clearly those of toilers . In fine , it was too ideal in conception and , in the absence of anything to indicate that the working-class was bearing Lenin on its shoulders to the tomb , the piece was officially rejected and the gallery closed until it could be removed . What a world of significance , I thought , lay in that deed ! Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conditioning , " and so controlling the human mind , the sense of beauty necessarily is included . Indeed , any effective re-orientation must begin with a re-coloration of the aesthetic sense . Save in war-time censorship and propaganda , nobody in the modern world , since Loyola 's Society of Jesus , has ever believed that it could be done or has seriously tried to do it . But in Soviet Russia for the fine arts as for the author and editor , one law , or fiat , holds : Thou shalt contribute by thy creative expression to the desired revolutionary state of mind in the observer , or thou shalt not breathe in marble , in drama , or on canvas . Is any other inference possible ? Had I known about the rejection of the sculpture before meeting Comrade Lunacharsky I should not have been able to refrain from asking him about it ; and doubtless he would have replied as frankly as he did to the questions which I submitted to him in writing . My first question was : What do you consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Commissar Lunacharsky replied : " They may be seen in : 1 . A.  | great rise of the cultural level and in activities of the workmen and of peasant youth , of women , and of even the most backward national minorities which during the Czar 's regime were completer neglected . 2 . The number of children attending school , which has increased from forty-eight per cent to seventy per cent of the population . ( The middle and higher schools are now open to the children of workmen and peasants ; they now constitute from sixty to seventy per cent of all students , and in 1933 we shall introduce a compulsory school law. ) 3 . The press , which is now two and a half times as large as the pre-revolutionary press . It is disseminated chiefly among the masses of workers and peasants . The number of our books , notably scientific works , exceeds the number of those published in 1913 . They are designed for the most part for the common man whose interest in reading is incomparably greater than before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publication of books in Russia , I obtained from the Government Printing Office the following figures : " In 1913 ? 3,500,000 newspapers were printed in Russia ; by 1924 the figure was five and a half million ; in 1925 , seven million ; in 1927 , eight million . These newspapers do not circulate as did the pre-war press , in Poland , Finland , and the Baltic provinces lost to Russia by the World War . Especially noteworthy is the growth of certain types of newspapers : in the last two years the leading central and provincial papers have increased their circulation by forty-one and four-tenths per cent ; professional papers by twelve and two-tenths per cent ; papers designed for the labouring masses by thirty-two and two-tenths per cent ; military magazines and newspapers by ninety-five and three-tenths per cent , and minority-nationality papers by thirtynine and four-tenths per cent . The growth of farm papers is of especial interest ; their issue amounted in 1923 to 150,000 copies ; in 1924 , to 530,000 ; in 1926 , to 1,200,000 ; and in 1927 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of journals as compared with that before the war has decreased thirty per cent ; but their circulation has increased , as above ; the chief point being that they circulate among classes of the population which never read before . We have at least a hundred thousand bulletin-board newspapers ; not a village and not a factory is without one . " As further evidence of cultural activity , I saw the first three volumes of a new fifteenvolume encyclopaedia issued by the Soviet Government Press and compiled by a staff of Russian scholars and scientists .  | My second question was : Which Russian authors are most widely read ? Of to-day ? Of the past ? Gogol , Dostoevsky , Tolstoy , Chekhov , Gorki ? To this he replied : " Our workmen read the classics in large numbers . The cheap editions which we issue are so quickly bought that we find difficulty in issuing them fast enough the most popular is the American , Upton Sinclair . " Concerning what Russia reads , a report of The Cultural-work Cabinet of the Moscow Central Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow ? says that the workers read ' Russian writers , mostly ? ( 65% ) ; and lesserly , foreign authors ? ! 3j% ) . Contrarily , clerks and others read foreign authors more ? ( 56% ) , and the works of Russian writers less ? ( 44% ) . Of the workers ' reading , the classics constitute 21.8% ; pre-revolutionary non-classical literature , 12.2% ; and new literature ' ? post-revolutionary ? 66% . On the demand stand , first at the present time , the following books : Gladkof 's novel of the civil war in Russia entitled Cement ' ; Leonof , ' Barsuki ' ( Hedgehogs ) ; Neverof , City of Bread ' ? ' Tashkent ' ; Serafimovitch , The Iron Torrent ' ; Seifoulina , Virineya ' ; Romanof , Tales ' . Of the classics , Gorki leads all the others with his Mother ' , The Artamanof Affair ' , Among Strangers ' , Childhood ' , and his shorter tales . Next come Turgenef 's Virgin Soil ' , Fathers and Sons ' , The Squire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tolstoy , War and Peace ' , Anna Karenina ' , and Resurrection ' ; Dostoiefsky , Crime and Punishment ' ; Chekhov , Goucharof ' ; and Gogol , Taras Bulba ' . " Of foreign books read in Moscow public libraries Jack London is first , with Martin Eden ' , The Iron Heel ' , and The Little Woman of the Large House ' ; Upton Sinclair is second with King Coal ' , The Jungle ' , Jimmie Higgins ' ; then Curwood , with Kazan ' , followed by Kellermann ? ' The Tunnel ' ; Victor Hugo ? ' Les Miserables ' and L'Homme Qui Rit ' . Among clerks and employees O. Henry is more popular than Kellermann ; then come Claude Farrere , Victor Hugo , and Anatole France . " " All of which , " concludes the report in the Isvestia , " demonstrates the wholesome taste of our readers . We have no bad literature in our sixty-three libraries . " The foregoing investigation was made in December , 1927 , among three thousand readers in the trade-union reading-rooms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vol- umes all of Upton Sinclair save only his Book of Health ; also Sinclair Lewis , and Theodore Dreiser 's Color of a Great City and Twelve Men ; Albert Edwards ' Comrade Yetta , Edna Ferber 's Show Boat and So Big , Fanny Hurst 's Song of Life , Ben Hecht 's Humpty Dumpty and Count Bruga , Lawrence Conrad 's Temper . and four volumes of O. Henry , within the last year or two . Incidentally , no royalties have been paid the authors , although last November Sinclair Lewis was offered when he was in Moscow . back payment of royalties , but he declined until a similar offer should be made to other American authors . This present season likewise , several American publishers are pirating in English translation , half a dozen Soviet publications . While on the subject of books I asked Lunacharsky about his own book on religion , published several years ago , which , according to a rumour current in Europe has been suppressed in Russia . " As concerns that book , which I wrote twenty-five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my opinions and have re-published only those parts which coincide with my present views . This clearly is every author 's right . All my books are issued without difficulty by our publishing companies and in most instances enjoy a large circulation , particularly my books on educational subjects . " I then asked him about religion , especially about moral instruction in the Soviet schools . Upon this subject Comrade Lunacharsky was most emphatic . " In the secondary schools ? for children above twelve ? " he said , " a purely scientific view is taught , of the origin and development of religion in society , with emphasis upon the injurious role played by religions that have outlived their time , in the conflicts between labour and capital , between oppressed and oppressors . Concerning morality , we practise and inculcate the highest morality created by Humanity ? the world conceived as a brotherhood of peoples , to a realization of which the worldwide triumph of the self-conscious proletariat is absolutely necessary . For this great end everyone must live and , if need be , die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of profound Collectivism . It is to be regretted that not all has been done as yet to aid this morality to exterminate the retarding power of organized religion and all manner of petit-bourgeois notions . " All manner of petit-bourgeois notions ! What a way of dismissing theology and a hundred sectarian aberrations !  | Communism and Collectivism , Leninism and Proletarianism , as ideals and ideas , tasks and attitudes and slogans , demanding from their adherents an absolute loyalty , have not yet become platitudes in Russia , and will not , I think , while Soviet Russia feels herself in process of regeneration as the embattled and unique embodiment of them . And is not a certain gorgeousness created in the atmosphere beyond our Valley of Disillusion by the spectacle of vigorous , apparently intelligent , desperately sincere men devoting their utmost energy to the attainment and establishment of any ideal , old or new ' ? . . . The notion occurred to me many times in my journey that perhaps for Russia a mission has been ordained : that to atone for Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of European civilization into the gulf of war in 1914 , Russia will become the chief force making for its integration . If nothing more ? yet I suspect that it is destined to be more ? to be a tonic-purgative for an over-sophisticated , cynical , senescent , cunningly complicated world of individualistic enterprise , a world which has long since solved the problem of adequately producing wealth , but falters at the task of finding satisfactory methods for controlling and justly equalizing its distribution .  |
