The 1924 cotton crop is now ceasing to be entirely conjecture and beginning to become history . The crop is being picked and soon the ginnery figures will begin definitely to indicate its real amount . However , the period of conjecturing and estimating is not yet over . The Department of Agriculture has announced , as its estimate for the current crop on Oct. 1 , 12,499,000 bales of 500 lb. each . This is a reduction of only 97,000 from the estimate by the same source for Sept. 16 . The Department was almost equally reassuring as to the condition of the crop , which as of Oct. 1 it placed at 53.5% of normal , compared with a rating of 55.4% a fortnight earlier . Very evidently , at any rate , this year 's crop will considerably exceed that of 1923 , which was only 10,139,671 bales . <P> Texas is easily the premier cotton state , with an estimated crop this year of 4,255,000 bales ; next comes Oklahoma , with 1,272,000 bales ; and then Georgia , with 1,118,000 ; Mississippi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other state promises to have a million bale crop this year , although the next state in order , Alabama , is set down for 959,000.
