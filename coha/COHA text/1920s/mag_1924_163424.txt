Sunday , Mar. 16 , John F. Kelman , Scot divine , will preach his farewell sermon to the congregation of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church , Manhattan . No evangelical church in the U. S. has a wider reputation . The question of a successor to Dr. Kelman assumes international interest . Three of the last five pastors have been British. * George B. Agnew , committeeman , stated that an American was now desired . Two were mentioned : Charles F. Wishart , of Wooster , O. , present moderator of the Presbyterian Church , theologically moderate ; Maitland Alexander , of Pittsburgh , dominant fundamentalist . The tradition of the church is said to be fundamentalist . Dr. Kelman , now retiring , is liberally inclined . <P> *The two other Britishers were John Hall , who served 31 years ( 1867-1898 ) , and John Henry Jowett ( TIME , Dec. 31 ) , who served 1911 to 1918.
