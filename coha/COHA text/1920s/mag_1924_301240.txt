M. Lunacharsky , who as Commissar of Education is also Supreme Lord of Theatreland in All the Russias , is a playwright . Last week his Hertzog ( Duke ) was produced at the People 's Theatre in Moscow . That was not all . At the Little Theatre in Moscow Julius Caesar , a play by a lesser author named William Shakespeare , was also produced . <P> The Bolshevik critics attacked both authors from a purely Marxian viewpoint , but were harsher to Lunacharsky than to Shakespeare . They thought Shakespeare 's play was capable of " ' proletarian " interpretation , though as produced in Moscow , gave a " disgusting , vulgar , ignorant , bloodthirsty " effect . <P> Referring to the great Bolshevik playwright , a critic contended that the author explains in the preface the intended inner revolutionary meanings of the play . But how wide is the gulf between Lunacharsky , as a prefacial explainer , and Lunacharsky as a dramatist . The play is based on sex and mysticism-religious mysticism at that . <P> " It is a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask whether there is not yet a third Lunacharsky addition to the prefacial exponent and the dramatist- Lunacharsky the Bolshevik Commissioner of Education and head of the censorship-and whether the latter does n't think this production of our national proletarian theatre needs a heavy dose of blue pencil .
