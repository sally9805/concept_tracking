The Six family is famed in Holland . In the 16th and 17th centuries Sixes were shrewd magistrates of Amsterdam , portly , solid men with provincial sagacity . Burgomaster Jan Six ( 1618-1700 ) was something of a visionary . As he walked by the placid River Amstel he heard the clopping of wooden shoes , saw the bright pageantry of Dutch costume , buxom , healthy girls in voluminous skirts , aprons , peaked caps . He loved little , angular Dutch gables , the wide Dutch sky over the flatlands . He knew an advanced , much-mooted artist named Rembrandt and often bought his etchings which caught the homely beauties of life in Holland in deep chiaroscuro . Jan Six also collected many contemporary paintings . Holland from his doorstep and on canvas was shining , sunny , softly reflected in the canals . <P> Sir Henri Wilhelm August Deterding is famed in Holland . The son of a Dutch sea captain , he left Holland in 1884 , went to the Dutch East Indies to sell kerosene lamps and allied merchandise . In 1892 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . He is now Director-General of that gigantic enterprise . Robust , brown-eyed , white-haired , he spends most of his time in St. Helen 's Court , London , centre of the financial district . The English have made him a baronet . His millions rank him with Rockefeller , Ford , the world 's Croesi . He is superficially a brisk cosmopolite . But if his career has taken him further than the Amsterdam Sixes , he , too , has seen the windmills , the dikes , the sunny peace of Holland . He has not forgotten . <P> Recently the Six heirs found their inheritance taxes a burden . There were too many paintings . Works of art are heavily assessed in an age where everything is interpreted financially . An auction in Amsterdam was announced . To the auction rooms of Frederk Muller , on the banks of the Amstel , came a host of connoisseurs from all over the world . They came to take away from Holland the treasures that the loving Jan Six had collected .

He sped over from London . When the bidding began the potency of Dutch oil , of Dutch nurture , became plain . The Letter by Gerard Terboch stood on the easel , a slight canvas in which a pretty maiden is seen writing a billet-doux . There was a fusillade of bidding . Sir Henri pounced on the foreigners , kept raising the bid " dix mille guilders " at a leap . He triumphed at $127,600 . It all happened again with Jacob Ochtervelt 's The Oyster Eaters . For this gastronomic scene Sir Henry offered $83,600 . Several Americans slumped in their chairs . The limitless resources of Sir Henry 's preposterous wallet were exasperating . Over and over he took what he wanted . Two of the paintings he gave immediately to Dutch museums . Dutchmen were convinced that at his death he would give them the rest . He safeguarded the civic , esthetic affection of the old Burgomaster . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
