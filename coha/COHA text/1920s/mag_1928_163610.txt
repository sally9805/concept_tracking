What must have been the feelings of George Arliss , famed actor in The Green Goddess , Old English , The Merchant of Venice , frequent benefactor of needy actors , and councilor of the Actors ' Equity Association when he read last week two communications addressed to the last named organization and signed by 60 actors and actresses . The purport of these epistles was rudely apparent ; the 60 actors and actresses wished Mr. Arliss , long one of the major ornaments of the U. S. stage , to be excluded from holding office in Equity because he is a citizen of Great Britain . <P> True , foreign actors are almost always forbidden to act in England . True also that the 60 signers did not have enough influence to cause Mr. Arliss to resign from Equity . Yet it must have been painful for Mr. Arliss to realize that some at least of his ungrateful confreres would go far into the past and repay kindness with spite in the foolish effort to requite their grudge against his country .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
