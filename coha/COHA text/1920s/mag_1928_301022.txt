With eyes bandaged a Jew and a Nordic lay with ocular fraternity in Manhattan 's Eye &; Ear Hospital last week . The Nordic , one Bert Ferguson , had one glass eye . The Jew , one Charles E. Greenblatt , had a gauze-packed socket , into which a glass eye soon would be set . His extracted eye had had a tumor . His other eye was good . But Nordic Ferguson 's other eye was bad . It bore a cataract , an opaque thickening of the cornea that prevented light images going through his pupil and striking upon his retina . So hopeless was his case that he had become an inmate of Manhattan 's Home for the Blind . And he is only 32 . <P> Thirty-two also is Jewish Greenblatt . Equal also are the color , size and shape of their eyes . Coincidal too were the accidents of Dr. Ben Witt Key , ophthalmologist , knowing both their cases . A sure eye surgeon , and a daring , Dr. Key thought of lifting the thickened cornea from Nordic Ferguson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good cornea of Jewish Greenblatt 's bad eye . The Jew amiably agreed to the graft , the Nordic hopefully received it . And hopefully , with eyes bandaged , they waited for results .
