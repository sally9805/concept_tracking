S HALL THE UNITED STATES enter the World Court ? As our readers are aware we have leaned in that direction , perhaps because we did not feel that it made much difference one way or another . But we are clear that we should not enter the court without at least the four reservations proposed two years ago by Mr. Hughes  --  to prevent amendment of the World Court charter without our consent , to give us a voice in the selection of judges , to provide for the payment by the United States of a fair share of the court 's expenses , and , most important , to give assurance that accepting the court would not be entrance into the League of Nations . These are admirable reservations , but they do not go far enough . Entering the World Court is amomentous step . The history of our country shows- that authority was not given the United States Supreme Court to exert force in executing its decrees against our States nor has it ever tried to do so ; that the intangible yet potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court . If we enter the World Court we should see to it that the conditions of entry are such that the court shall be backed by no power except that of world opinion . More than that , the United States should condition its entry on effective agreements that neither the court nor the League , nor any of its members , shall have power to enforce the decrees of the tribunal by war or by economic pressure of any kind . Only under such circumstances will the World Court truly be a court of justice and not a court of arms . ECRETARY MELLON is a fortunate man in more ways than one . There can be no question that if our Republican rulers and the press and the , public had the sensitiveness in regard to the business relations of officials which prevailed in this country during the Roosevelt campaigns for the divorce of politics from business Secretary Mellon would have to get out of the Cabinet . The two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission last week published their dissent from the majority rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information pertaining to Mr. Mellon 's Aluminum Company of America that the commission obtained from that company . Messrs . Nugent and Thompson deliberately accuse their fellow-commissioners of making the commission " an accessory after the fact in aiding a possible criminal to evade trial and escape punishment . " It is impossible to brush aside this statement on the ground of partisan bias , for the reason that former Attorney General Stone wrote to the commission that the aluminum trust had deliberately violated the decree of the federal court and added : " The fair inference is the company either was indifferent to the provisions of the decree or knowingly intended that its provisions should be disregarded with a view to suppressing competition in the aluminum industry . " Finally , the two protestants point out that the evidence in the case of a rival of Mr. Mellon 's company , the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company , was turned over to the Department of Justice , while Mr. Mellon 's company was protected . This would be a first-class political scandal if Washington and the public were not surfeited with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hide of a rhinoceros he would resign promptly , and Mr. Coolidge would ask him to were he sensitive of the honor of his Cabinet . cc OOLIDGE AROUSED by Lewis Letter ; Plans Firm Reply " ? thus a newspaper headline . Stuff ! Can a mouse bite or a rabbit turn carnivorous ? Yet the newspapers which have created the fictitious Coolidge continue to " play him up " as a man of force and resolution capable of facing an issue , grappling largely and boldly with it , and then dominating it . When and where ? For this is the same President and the same Coolidge who , on July 19 , last , assured the newspaper correspondents at Swampscott  --  of course through that alter ego " the spokesman for the President " ? that he was " determined to prevent a coal strike , " and a few days later let it be known that he had a plan of a " revolutionary nature " to propose if , after all , a strike came to pass . Well , the strike ' came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest ; no plan of any kind , revolutionary or otherwise , was forthcoming . So now we have more thundering because John L. Lewis , head of the United Mine Workers , has sent a letter which the President , or whoever told him to , " interprets as a threat and an unfair statement in the case  --  a veiled attempt to place responsibility upon the Government for labor conditions . " Well , all we can say is we do n't propose to enter our private cyclone cellar just yet , nor would we advise Mr. Lewis , the impudent , to take to his  --  not even if the President has included in his message a proposal to forbid strikes in essential industries . For just when Mr. Coolidge 's sense of outrage begins to master him he will , we are sure , recall the constitutional inhibitions upon his office , and recongeal . W ALL STREET OWNS BELGIUM and now super- sedes the Belgian Parliament . This is the statement of Mr. Jaspar , a former Minister , who publicly asked Vandervelde , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American and British bankers in cutting its budget by 150,000,000 francs , and whether " the Belgian Parliament is no longer in control of the situation . " Vandervelde replied : " The statements in the press to that effect are exactly true . The government had its choice between two alternatives , either to obtain a loan or give up stabilization of the Belgian franc . The ministers were unanimous in the opinion that . . . the best thing to do was to submit to the requirements of the foreign capitalists and obtain stabilization of the Belgian currency . " The leading Belgian papers , such as the Nation , Beige , hulependance Beige , and Etoile Beige , three conservative organs , confess to the state of " vassalage and servitude " in which the country has been placed , while the more liberal and radical newspapers denounce the government for its surrender . So Belgium has found out the truth , but Belgium is not the only slave and vassal to the American money power . Germany is another , and if French finances continue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to predict a Dawes Plan for France and Wall Street vassalage for her . - Perhaps there is no other way out , as Vandervelde has said , but the fact that the whole world is coming to be the financial vassal of America does not mitigate the gravity of the situation or prevent it from working infinite harm to the vassals and , what is more important for us , to their masters . C ABINETS COME AND GO in France with whirligig speed , and meanwhile the country 's financial troubles remain without even an approach toward a settlement . Our daily press hails the advent of Aristide Briand  --  with Louis Loucheur as Minister of Finance  --  with optimism , and the announcement of the new cabinet caused a slight advance in the exchange value of the franc . We can not see any reason for rejoicing . Both Briand and Loucheur , it is argued , are strong for a debt settlement with the United States and have the ability to obtain one . What of it ? How will an undertaking on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however small , make it easier for her to settle her internal obligations ? Because , we hear somebody say , when France has signed a debt compact she will get a loan in the United States just as Italy did . Again what of it ? This will be pulling herself up by the boot-straps . It will be one more pile on the already mountainous debt . There are only two ways of meeting that debt  --  taxation or repudiation . The internal debt has already been practically repudiated to the tune of 80 per cent by the inflation of the currency and the consequent depreciation in the value of the franc . If any of the franc 's value is to be saved , it can be done only through drastic taxation of wealth and privilege . Louis Loucheur , with his close identification with French big business , is exceedingly unlikely to propose any such course . T HAT THE GERMAN REICHSTAG has approved the Locarno treaties and that they have been signed by the Government ought to surprise nobody . We were unable from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Luther Government might be overthrown and the treaties fail because of the opposition of the nationalistic and imperialistic elements . As long as President Hindenburg stood fast there could be no question as to the outcome , but even had he not , the opposition would not have triumphed . There is too much at stake ; Locarno meant too great a step forward for the treaties to be rejected while sanity ruled in Germany . We do not deny that there are uncomfortable things in those pacts and that it is more the spirit behind them than the text which will count in helping to keep the peace in Europe . We particularly regret that it was not possible for the Germans to obtain a reconsideration of the war-guilt issue and that much in the treaties strengthens the Treaty of Versailles while other portions override it . But as we have said , the overwhelming balance is on one side . While so much credit is being given to Briand and Austen Chamberlain let it not be forgotten that the Germans originated this whole proposal of a security pact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mutiny and to seduce soldiers and sailors from their duty is the grave-sounding charge for which the twelve Communists on trial in London have been sentenced , some to six months and others to a year in prison . The first offenders , who were given six months , had even an opportunity to go free if they would pledge themselves to renounce the Communist Party and all its works . There is certainly an inconsistency here . If the charge is as bad as it sounds , if the safety of the empire is seriously threatened by these persons , then the punishment should evidently have been more severe . Deprivation of liberty for half a year indicates that the Crown does not really think the empire in danger ; in that case , why say that it is ? Why not merely charge the Communists with being a nuisance , with interruption of the sleep of worthy Tories , with Ioud talking on street corners , with any of a dozen minor offenses ? For these a light sentence would be suitable and the triviality of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things more expertly ; a man is sentenced to from five to fifteen years in the penitentiary . And while these sentences  --  and the British ones  --  are being served the republic and the empire go on about as usual , and in each case the Communist Party flourishes because of the persecution of its members . T N RUSSIA , which some think a benighted and barbarous 1 country , two gipsies caught at horse-stealing were burned alive by an infuriated mob . Walter Duranty , correspondent of the New York Times , grows eloquent on the subject : " From the background of medieval cruelty and superstition that still hangs , darkling , over the Russian people , there sometimes blazes forth a survival so monstrous as to be hardly credible . " Is it not impolite of Mr. Duranty to be able barely to credit in Russia what is common news in the United States ? Here , when men are burned to death , as they are every year in our glorious republic , when they are mutilated , hung to convenient trees , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets with ropes around their necks and then shot , the news item is small and rarely makes the front page . Nor is this all . Mr. Duranty ends his account thus : " . . . only by degrees the facts became known to the authorities . Now , after five months and twenty-six days , the ringleaders have been arrested , including members of the village soviet .. . who will be tried immediately by the Moscow tribunal . " But at the most recent burning in the State of Mississippi the crowd was not so diffident ; some of them were not afraid to be photographed standing near the victim ; one of them was not afraid to say in the Jackson Daily News : " Investigation ? Shucks , there wo n't be any . . . . No officer down there is going to dare try to identify anyone because nobody 's mad about it " Alas , for barbarous , medieval Russia . We are in America ; we burn men alive every year and they do n't have to be caught doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims are Negroes ; and that , of course , is different . W HITE SPACES both in the news and editorial col- umns of the Campus , the student publication of the College of the City of New York , effectively advertise the ban President Mezes has placed on further discussion of compulsory military training in that institution . The students voted 6 to 1 for the abolition of compulsion ; they were duly denounced by certain self-constituted guardians of patriotism as traitors , from which charge Mr. Mezes defended them by a " they 're all right but , boylike , they want to dodge some irksome drill " statement which , it has been pointed out , is neither complimentary nor true . Then the president clapped on the muzzle hard , adding denial of free speech and discussion to compulsory drill in an American college . For all this it would be easy to denounce Mr. Mezes and point again the finger of scorn at his brand of weak-kneed ineffectual liberalism . But to do this and merely this is to miss the true problem . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly suspect that he fears that any other would imperil the city appropriations which he feels the growth of the college demands . His fear may be a bit cowardly but it is not groundless . In other words , not one man but a false sense of patriotism in our governing bodies , and in the more articulate public opinion , is to blame . This ignorant , unreflective patriotism of preparedness is the enemy . Against it the City College boys are planning to keep up the fight . They deserve the active support of all citizens who love peace , liberty , and the best American traditions of education . P RESIDENT COOLIDGE 'S FIGURES in his recent speech before the Chamber of Commerce in New York City are as dubious as the economic principles he laid down . However much we may differ on economic principles , we are always ready to pay respectful attention to figures . But as the New York World has pointed out , these particular figures are questionable in the extreme . The President says that wages are 20 per cent above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while prices have fallen 30 per cent since 1920 and are only 57 per cent above prewar averages . The result , obviously , is a paradise for the wage-earner of today . Paradise indeed , if only it were true ! With 120 per cent more cash and only a 57 per cent increase in the goods that cash will buy , the improvement in the standard of living of the wayfaring man would be profound . The first trouble is that the President bases his statement on wholesale prices . The worker does not buy wholesale . The cost of living measured in prices the worker has to pay declined only 20 per cent from June , 1920 , to June , 1925 , according to the federal government 's own Bureau of Labor Statistics . Secondly , the assumed 20 per cent increase in wages since 1920 is not borne out by statistical evidence . Average per capita wages for factory workers in New York State are now below the 1920 average and so are pay-roll figures as reported by the United States Department of Labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 cents , compared with 49 cents in 1920 . Farm labor is receiving $49 a month , against $65 in 1920 . So Mr. Coolidge 's statistical utopia turns out to be , as Broadway would put it , a " flop . " A NEW OCEAN QUEEN has arrived in New York and her crossing may prove as epoch-making as that of the first transatlantic steamship . The new queen bears the historic name of Gripsholm and she belongs to the Swedish-American Line . She is the first Diesel-engine liner to enter the New York passenger service . No soot , no smoke  --  engines that work , similarly to those of automobiles , by direct explosive power  --  this is what the new boat has to offer besides a sea speed of 173/4 knots , something , it was stoutly averred , the Diesel-engine could never achieve because of the size and weight such a speed would call for and the cost . There is a greater original cost in the new as opposed to older types of engines , no less than $125,000 in an 8,000-ton steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the economy of operation is so great that European owners are not hesitating , and it is probably only a question of a short time before a majority ' of the cargo fleets of the world will be Diesel-engined . Lord Inverforth , president of the British Institute of Marine Engineers and himself the owner of Diesel-engine cargo vessels , is enthusiastically in favor of them . Comparing a steamship and a motor vessel of about the same size which recently voyaged in ballast from Japan to Australia and thence to Europe with a cargo of wheat , he finds that the Diesel ship earned $7,500 more profit than the steamship . Of special interest to intending voyagers On the Gripsholm is Lord Inverforth 's assertion that in all weathers the new type is steadier , propeller revolutions being maintained regularly with an almost complete absence of the racing of the screws which , in rough weather , is so trying to passengers in vessels equipped with older types of engines . The internal-combustion engine is thus winning on sea as on land .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
