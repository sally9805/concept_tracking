Albert E. Sartain , onetime warden of the Federal Penitentiary at Atlanta , was registered at the institution last week for a sojourn of 18 months as a guest of the Government . He had been found guilty of violating a house rule when he had been there as manager in 1924 , accepting tips from the guests-$10,500 worth-in exchange for soft berths . His present manager-host , Warden John W. Snook , saw to it that he was outfitted with a costume which will be inconspicuous so long as he remains within , and despatched him to the entresol where he was given a pick and shovel and told to pursue the tasks which he had so often assigned to others . Warden Snook , however , does not believe in asking unusual tasks of his guests , for , as he says himself in the official prison magazine , Good Words : " This is an ideal place for men to refit morally and physically for the battle of life , " and " no man is asked or expected to work beyond his capacity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hot supper is served to every newcomer , and then a shower bath and bed for a good night 's rest in warmth and comfort . . . . With the morning comes a revelation in breakfasts and everyone goes to work with pick and shovel making roads " ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) . Guest Albert E. Sartain discovers himself paradoxically thankful that it is Mr. Snook , not he , who is manager-warden , even though the tipping rule is now stringently enforced .
