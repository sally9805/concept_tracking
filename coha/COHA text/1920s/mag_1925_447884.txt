IN my mail I found a circular marked Important , ' which seemed to indicate that it was n't . I was about to consign it to the wastebasket when I saw that it was from an old and valued friend whom I had not met for several years . It was written in that lucidly dictatorial style affected by modem advertisers . deleted material When you invest in stocks and bonds , you choose your banker carefully . What about your thoughts ?

' Not at all , ' said Bagster . ' Same old job ministering to the unfelt wants of people who know that there 's something the matter with their minds and want someone to tell them what it is .

The people I am interested in are intelligent persons who have come to the " years that bring the philosophic mind . " That is about twenty years after the date set in our educational system for the study of philosophy . Touchstone asked Corin , " Hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ? " By that he meant to inquire whether Corin was interested merely in some particular sheep , or whether he liked to talk about the shepherd 's life in general . We curiously enough set apart for the study of philosophy the period in life when the mind has the fewest facilities for profitable philosophizing . We say to the husky youth , " Go to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lifetime . Meditate fruitfully on the One and the Many . See things steadily and see them whole . In the sessions of sweet silent thought ' get acquainted with the Cosmos . Having absorbed large ideas and learned to see things in their true relation , then you may take a few years in the professional school to fit you for your specific job . Just now you must finish up with the fundamentals . " But the youthful Gallio cares for none of these things . He is not interested in the Cosmos . He is interested in himself . He does not care to sit on the banks of the River of Time contemplating its mighty current . He wants to go in swimming . But the chances are that if all goes well with him , and he succeeds in his own business , he will in about fifteen or twenty years awake some fine morning and ask what it is all about . He will be in a mood for philosophizing . John Stuart Mill , speaking of his own education , says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never told until I had exhausted every effort to find it out myself . My father always gave his explanations not before but after I had felt the full force of the difficulties . " After about ten or fifteen years of independent struggle with circumstances , enough difficulties are encountered to make the explanations interesting . If even in a small way one has overcome a real difficulty , he is anxious to give others the benefit of his experience . He thinks that it forms the basis of profitable generalization . The people I have in mind have accumulated a certain amount of experience . They have learned to do what they set out to do , but they have a surplus of unexpended curiosity and energy . Having tended to their own business , they are ready for larger operations . They have come , taler considerable effort , upon some thoughts that seem to have a wide application . They are sure these thoughts have intrinsic value , but they do not know what their exchangeable value may be . They are in the same state intellectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exchanges by which the individual 's savings could be combined with others and put to work profitably in large undertakings . They are even worse off , for they do not know of any circulating medium and carry on their intellectual trade by primitive barter ? a mere swapping of ideas . Owing to the lack of coordination , there is a great deal of waste . Many mental factories are running full time , but at a loss . Their facilities for production are greater than their facilities for distribution . That being the case , it seemed to me that there was room for the despised middleman . These people need professional assistance . I am not a thinker . I am a thought investment banker and broker . I execute orders and give advice when it is asked for . In my advisory capacity I encourage intellectual thrift . I advise my clients that if their savings are wisely invested , and the accruing interest promptly reinvested , they can be assured of an intellectual competence .

" He that is first in his own cause seemeth just ; but his neighbor cometh and searcheth him . " Here , for example , is a man who has made his fortune in boots and shoes . He knows that business from A to Z. But one day he comes upon an idea that applies first of all to boots and shoes , and then to everything else . He feels like Jack when he began to climb his beanstalk . There seems to be no end to it . It 's a principle , and he wants to apply it in a large way . He applies it to Church and State , the public schools and the board of aldermen . The thought expands and almost explodes . He wonders why the preachers and teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would revolutionize their methods . In fact , it would revolutionize society . Now , if in the first flush of his enthusiasm he were to present his ideas to his business associates , they would think he was a Bolshevik . But if he is fortunate to see my advertisement he will come to me and make a few inquiries . What is the present state of the thought market ? Is it able without disturbance to absorb so large an offering ? I suggest to him that he might be in a better technical position if part of his intellectual capital were in a more liquid form . In a revaluation of his holdings he must be prepared for some paper losses . There is likely to be a difference between the book value of his stock and the market value . In the case of unlisted securities there is often a considerable margin between the bidding and the asking price . All this seems reasonable to him and we sit down and do a little figuring . In estimating the exchangeable value of an idea , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of a thought depends a good deal on who thinks it . An idea is like a check ? its value is greatly enhanced by the name of its endorser . Here on the front page of the daily newspaper is an idea endorsed by Mr. J. P. Morgan . Large headlines proclaim its value . " Never do anything which you do not approve of in order to accomplish something you do approve of . " That is a perfectly sound proposition . But if the minister of the Methodist Church in Sauk Centre , Minnesota , had said that , as he probably has many times , it would not have been telegraphed over the country . When Mr. Morgan says it , it is news . There are useful persons who are not original thinkers but who are indispensable in the commerce of ideas . They take thoughts from one province where they are cheap and transport them to another where they are rare . I think that these common carriers should receive some profit over and above the bare transportation charges . A part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in analyzing the cost involved in transportation . Yesterday a prosperous merchant came to me and , taking a newspaper clipping from his vest pocket , read excitedly : " The Manchester Guardian , commenting on the shipment of cotton goods to Central America , expresses the opinion that the larger purchases of coffee in Germany in recent months contributed to increase the sales of Lancashire products to Central America and Brazil . " " ' Here , " he said , " is a commonplace in the business world . I wish you 'd tell me how to get it over into the minds of the clergymen . It has great spiritual value and it would revolutionize their preaching if they could only be made to see it . My minister has been running a course of sermons on Religion and Modern Civilization . He treats them as if they were trade rivals and the only way were cutthroat competition . Now we business men have got away beyond that . He thinks if he can run down Modern Civilization he can get its custom into the church . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he has gone on enumerating one thing after another that has failed ? Greek Philosophy , Ethics , and all the rest . When he 's got all the competitors out of the way , he 's going to wind up with a sermon on Religion , the only hope of a ruined world . I 'm afraid that he will get us so in the habit of looking for failures that we shall be discouraged about religion , when we come to it . " ' Now I should like to spring that item from the Manchester Guardian on him , and see how he takes it . When we let up a little on the Germans , they buy more coffee , which allows the people of Brazil to buy more cotton goods from the Lancashire mills , and so it goes . Now does n't spiritual prosperity follow the same laws ? If I had a chance to preach , I would n't run down Modem Civilization . I 'd boost it . I 'd show that Science and Art and Morality and Economics are departments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow healthfully . I 'd make a chart and make everyone in the congregation see the point . It does n't matter where the wave of prosperity starts . It spreads . " " Why do n't you do it ? " I said . " You have Laymen 's Sunday in your church . Just the chance for you to preach . I can tell you of some mighty good texts . " ' I am continually warning people against reckless speculation . I tell them not to believe everything they see in a prospectus . Go slow on any proposition that promises abnormal returns for a small investment . Do n't let anyone sell you the blue sky . Here is a letter from a man who says he is one of Abraham Lincoln 's plain people : " I 'm a native American and do n't care who knows it .

Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't running for office ? Or should I be content with a more moderate return ? What about investing a portion of my patriotic enthusiasms in K. K. K. , Inc. ? I enclose a circular which I have just received . It looks good to me . I do n't see where I could get a hundred per cent so easily . I notice that in order to get in on the ground floor I have to be a Nordic . Could you tell me how I can qualify ? All I know about them is that the Nordics were Protestants from away back before the Christian era . But were they any particular denomination of Protestants ? Or does every stockholder get a certificate of Nordicity when he pays his ten dollars ? " I answered in a conservative way : " The securities you mention are highly speculative . You should look into the history of these offerings and avoid irresponsible dealers . The market for racial and religious antipathies is very fluctuating . At one moment it rises to enormous proportions , and then it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . One is enough . This is a big country , and you ca n't corner the hate market . If you must invest , choose your antipathy cautiously , then put it away in a safe place and think no more about it . Do not expect a ready market for it . Most persons have antipathies of their own and do n't care to have others dumped upon them . " Here is a letter from an excellent and 446 AUGUSTUS BAGSTER , THOUGHT BROKER public-spirited citizen which shows the kind of questions that come to me . While they require only a moderate amount of business sagacity , yet they are not without their difficulties . One correspondent writes : " My chief interest has been in enterprises dealing with the peace of the world . Complications in world politics have made it necessary to scrutinize my investments . I ask suggestions from your office . Almost any plan for keeping the peace looked good to me , and in the course of the last twenty years I have invested in pretty nearly everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribunal , Benevolent Neutrality , Pan-American-ism , League of Nations ( with or without reservations ) , Outlawry of War , Washington Conference , World Court , Youth Movement , Limitation of Armament , Society of Friends , Universal Religion ( when , as , and if issued ) . I invested in the first issue of War to End War . These were short-time bonds to mature in 1919 . When the date of maturity arrived , it was found that no provision was made for meeting these obligations , and an extension of time was asked . " As I am loaded up with these securities , which I took in good faith , I am looking for relief . Might not a committee be formed to protect the interest of the investors ? I think we ought to consolidate our holdings . Perhaps some of the older pacifist issues might be retired and new issues be presented that would reach a wider investing public . Competitive peace-planning seems as wasteful as competitive armament . ' " Here is an editorial in a paper devoted to the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not interfering in the recent crisis in Egypt , though it declares that if it had done so that would have been the end of the League . ' In our judg ment it would have been better for the League to have smashed itself up in a vain attempt to settle the Egyptian question than to continue to exist amid wars and rumors of wars . ' ' " What do you think of this as a business proposition ? Should the League smash itself up trying to do something that it knows it ca n't do now , or should it try to keep on as a going concern even though it ca n't pay dividends for several years ? What would you advise me to do with my various holdings ? " ' I wrote my client in regard to the advantage of diversified investment . " I would suggest that this is not a time for panic . Do not dump any large block of peace securities on the market so as to depress it . The fact that a man like yourself can sympathize with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . It is well to have even the weaker securities in strong hands . If the whole list can be kept active , it ensures a continuous market . You know Sir Philip Sidney used to advise his friends , When you hear of a good war , go to it . ' That was a great encouragement to the sixteenth-century militarists . Why should n't you say , When you hear of a good peace , go to it . ' " I agree that cutthroat competition between peace plans is uneconomic . We should remember that the best plan is not that which looks best on paper . It is the plan that can be put through . When at last it is put through it may turn out to be a combination of various plans , or it may be an old discarded plan with something added to make it work . Or perhaps what is needed is somebody who has force enough to work it . " I suggested also that arrangements might be made for bringing Peace issues within the reach of the ordinary man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person of moderate means . He does n't know how to swing anything so big . Now , if peace principles in smaller denomination were offered him , he might feel like investing his little all . A peace plan covering his own ward might seem attractive . If he found that he could carry on a neighborhood church or a town meeting peaceably , he might be induced to take stock in more ambitious enterprises . More attention should be given to the small investors . Perhaps there are no subjects in regard to which I have had more inquiries from well-meaning people whose minds are in a tangle than in regard to the various Temperance issues . They have so overlapped that it is hard for the ordinary person to find his way about . There was a time when Temperance was a comparatively simple proposition . Most people would agree in regard to Ten Nights in a Barroom . The first night was really enough to convince anyone that a barroom was a good place to keep away from . But as the Temperance movement has gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people differ among themselves , and are not always able to discuss their differences temperately . There is often occasion for Father Taylor 's ejaculatory prayer , " Lord , save us from bigotry and bad rum ? Thou knowest which is worse . " Here is a letter from an earnest Temperance advocate who feels the need of expert advice . She writes as follows : " About 1867 my mother invested in Victory Bonds of Ohio Crusaders . These bonds were to mature in 1880 . Before the date of maturity mother was induced to exchange them for W. C. T. U. preferred . I inheritedthese securities , together with a block of Moral Suasions from my grandmother 's estate . They were , I was informed , no longer active on the exchange , but might have some value in the future . From time to time I have taken up the new issues of W. C. T. U. as they came out , particularly the Educationals . I invested in Coffee House , Local Option , Scientific Investigation , Three Square Meals a Day , Better Housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I added to my holdings Y. M. C. A. , Y. W. C. A. , and Social Settlement . I looked upon this as a reasonably diversified investment . The bull movement in National Prohibition took me by surprise , but I promptly invested all my spare funds in Eighteenth Amendment and Volstead Act . I do not regret this , but I confess that I have been a little bewildered by later developments . I do n't know just where I stand , for I am also a D. A. R. and have inherited , from my revolutionary sires , a large interest in Personal Liberties . Must any of these valued securities be sacrificed ? I have been advised to sell my old securities for what they will fetch in the open market and invest everything in Law Enforcement . What do you think about it ? " I wrote to her strongly advising her not to sacrifice anything . " Law Enforcement is all right , but it is what we call a business man 's investment . It has to be watched carefully all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are lots of laws on the statute books , and the law enforcer must n't play favorites . I do n't think you can afford to throw away that old-fashioned Moral Suasion your grandmother believed in . A little more of it would come in handy just now . After you have persuaded people to pass a law you have to keep on persuading them to obey it . That 's the hardest part of 448 AUGUSTUS BAGSTER , THOUGHT BROKER the job in this country . Do you remember the text , ' What the law could not do . . . ' ? There are some things the law can do , but there are a good many more things that the law can not do . They have to he done in a different way . Do n't get in wrong on that Personal Liberty issue . But insist that Personal Liberty has as its only security Personal Responsibility . " Speaking of the various temperance reforms reminds me of the reformers of all kinds who come to my office , and with whom I have established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seasonal trade . In his busy season the reformer has no time to consider the relation of his cause to society as a whole . He is not a general practitioner like Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , who could boast that the world was out of joint and he was born to set it right . He is a specialist and confines himself to a particular joint . He holds on to that with grim tenacity , till it is set . But when his particular reform has been accomplished the reformer is likely to have a gone feeling . The cause for which he labored has triumphed , but it is not his triumph . Its opponents have forgotten that they ever opposed it . It is no longer a great moral issue ; it has become an accomplished fact , and all the people who stand for accomplished facts accept it ? and then go on as if nothing had happened . ' If the reformer is a sensitive and self-centred person , this is gall and wormwood to him . He is like the workmen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , and begrudged the eleventh-hour man his penny . But if the reformer is a sensible person he comes to my office to talk over the matter just as any successful business man might talk with his banker about changing his investments . He has had a quick turnover . He has cleared a quite tidy sum in his last venture . He has an unexpended balance of pugnacity , and is in a rather speculative frame of mind . He would like to take a flyer in some new cause that conservative people are afraid of . What is there that 's most unpopular just now ? After talking with me he does n't lose much time in making the change . One can always find wrongs to be righted if he knows where to look for them . I keep a list in my office of reforms that are overdue . There are some choice bargains yet to be picked up . IV A good many clergymen drop in from time to time seeking advice . They know that they are spiritually solvent , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained that he had some seasoned doctrinal bonds for which he had received no return in interest for a number of years . I looked up the securities and explained to him that these bonds had been called some time ago . The capital was safe , but the interest had stopped . The best thing for him to do would be to invest his spiritual capital in some securities that were not callable . A zealous minister came with his troubles . He had become , he said , socially minded , but he found it difficult to get his congregation to keep up with him . He had added one social activity after another in his church till the people complained that the addition of another good cause would be more than they could stand . What could he do about it ? How could he keep his church up to the mark in social activities , without having it die on his hands ? ' I took out a little pamphlet which I had received with the compliments of the U. S. Steel Corporation . It contained remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let ' s get at the principle . You see , when the steel industry in this country was in its infancy , the cradle was in Pittsburgh . That 's where the steel was actually produced . It was natural that the price in other parts of the country should be that established at Pittsburgh , plus the cost of transportation from that point . By and by steel began to be produced in Alabama and on the Great Lakes in large quantities . Why should transportation from Pittsburgh be included in the price of steel that had never come from Pittsburgh ? Judge Gary explains how at last the U. S. Steel Corporation hurl to yield to the demand for a new standard for price-making . The price of steel is no longer determined by its distance from Pittsburgh , but there is a recognition of the point where it is actually produced . " ' Now you are dealing with the same kind of question . The time was when all social-welfare activities were centred in the church . It was the Pittsburgh for altruism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special needs . These nonecclesiastical agencies have proved very effective . You are going on the principle of the church ? your church ? plus . If a person wishes to engage in work for the community , you expect him to join your church and then go to work . But what if he takes a short cut and goes to work without joining your church ? When the individuals of your congregation join with their neighbors in good works , you want them to do all these things over again so as to make a good showing in your denominational yearbook . You miss the point of the parable of the Good Samaritan . He was n't a good Jew or a good Christian ? he was only a good Samaritan . " Why do n't you cutout church plus ?

A well-known philanthropist came to me for help . He said he had for some time been converted to the modern view of social responsibility . He did not consider himself as a benefactor when he contributed to various organizations for social welfare . It was a voluntary form of taxation . ' What he objects to is that , now that his principles are known , his assessment has been raised and he is the victim of triple and even quadruple taxation . He asked , " Does the fact that I have given as much as I can afford to one good cause carry with it the obligation to contribute as much to every other good cause ? Would there not be a more general participation in altruistic enterprises if the principle of limited liability were recognized ?

" On my last drive , " he said , " I carefully chose names of friends with whose generosity and affability I was familiar . When I called at their houses they were out . On my return to my home I found their cards , each friend stating that he would 450 AUGUSTUS BA GSTER , THOUGHT BROKER call again to interest me in a philanthropic object to which he knew I would gladly contribute .

What is lost in one way is made up in another . The lowest depression in the worst financial year did not fall fifteen per cent below normal , and in the years of greatest prosperity the rise was not more than that above it . I promised to send her a similar chart showing the fluctuation in the manners of the young during a similar period . Our chart has not been completed , but our statistician thinks it probable that the difference between high and low will not amount to more than ten points .
