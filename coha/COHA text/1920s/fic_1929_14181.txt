SCENE : The scene is the living-room in an old-fashioned house in a small University town in Massachusetts . It is the habitation of a scholar . The high old bookcases are filled with portentous-looking volumes , the desk and tables are covered with piles of scientific magazines . The order-liness of the room is a momentary banking of disorder by disciplinary hands . There are two doors L.1 and L.2 on the Left . The downstage one , L.1 , leads to DR . AVERY 'S study , the upstage one , L.2 , to ANN 'S room . On the Right is a large double door leading to other rooms in the house . Through the large bay-windows in the rear , L.C. , may be seen the denuded tops of trees  --  maples and elms . It is late fall . The time is evening . Chair below R. door ; stand above it ; large chair upper R. corner ; seat before fireplace up R.C. ; lamp and chair L. of fireplace ; cabinet in upper L. corner ; desk L.C. , with chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Curtain goes up it reveals PHYLLIS PENNELL back of desk , L. , tying up DOUGLAS ' birthday present to ANN . She is twenty , pretty , wears a simple evening frock . DOUGLAS CARR enters from R. He is a sensitive boy of twenty-two . DOUGLAS CARR Oh , hello , Phyl. p. 3 PHYLLIS PENNEL Hello , darling . I 'm just doing up your present for Ann . ( She is tying a big-bow ribbon ) Help me with this , will you ? Put your finger there . ( He does so . ) There ! Is n't it pretty ? DOUGLAS CARR A little too much ribbon , I think . PHYLLIS PENNEL I hope Ann likes what I got her . Do you think she will ? DOUGLAS CARR Of course she will . Ann is n't hard to please . PHYLLIS PENNEL Well , that sounds doubtful . DOUGLAS CARR I did n't mean that . PHYLLIS PENNEL I 'm awfully excited . I always get excited over parties . How do you like my dress ? DOUGLAS CARR You look slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? PHYLLIS PENNEL Why , Doug , it 's brand new . DOUGLAS CARR Sorry ! PHYLLIS PENNEL What 's the use of dressing up for you ? DOUGLAS CARR Lots of use . Look at me . Abject ! PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Taking his hand ) Love me ? DOUGLAS CARR ( Putting his arms around her ) Of course . p. 4 PHYLLIS PENNEL More conviction , please . DOUGLAS CARR ( Kissing her ) Darling . PHYLLIS PENNEL Oh , Raphael Lord called up a few minutes ago . DOUGLAS CARR Thought he might have . He left a message for me at the library . What did he want ? PHYLLIS PENNEL I would n't speak to him . You know the way I feel about him . I do wish , Doug , you 'd forget this idea of going to New York with him . With Raphael Lord of all people ! DOUGLAS CARR Well , you ca n't deny he 's brilliant . PHYLLIS PENNEL You 've heard him admit it so often now you believe it . DOUGLAS CARR Uncle Avery says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years . PHYLLIS PENNEL Well , he ought to be ! He 's got a head start . He must be at least five years older than any of the other boys . DOUGLAS CARR Well , you need n't worry . I probably wo n't go to New York with him . PHYLLIS PENNEL Probably ! DOUGLAS CARR Havent't the guts . PHYLLIS PENNEL Why , Douglas ! p. 5 DOUGLAS CARR Let 's drop it . We ought to begin helping Mrs. Goodhue with the sandwiches . Come on along . PHYLLIS PENNEL No , Doug . Wait a minute . I want to know what 's the matter . DOUGLAS CARR What do you mean ? PHYLLIS PENNEL I want to know what 's the matter . DOUGLAS CARR Nothing . Why ? PHYLLIS PENNEL You ca n't fool me . You have n't been yourself lately , and I 've noticed it . You have n't been working . Something has been bothering you and you ca n't tell me there has n't  --  DOUGLAS CARR Nothing special . PHYLLIS PENNEL Yes  --  it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . I 'll get over it . PHYLLIS PENNEL Why do n't you come to me about it instead of spending all your spare time with that Lord person ? Hearing him talk about himself all the time would get anybody depressed . DOUGLAS CARR Lord 's all right . I wish I were like him . PHYLLIS PENNEL Why , Douglas . You 're sweet and lovable and he 's  --  DOUGLAS CARR ( Passionately ) I 'm ineffectual . I 'm no good at all . p. 6 PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Amazed at this outburst ) Why , Doug ! DOUGLAS CARR Well , it 's true . Look at Raphael  --  No advantages  --  God knows where he came from  --  Uncle Avery says that he does n't even believe that Raphael Lord is his real name . And yet he 's sure of himself , certain of his future  --  everything I 'm not . PHYLLIS PENNEL Well , think of your being so impressed by that conceited , objectionable  --  Why , he 's no more than a sort of tramp . DOUGLAS CARR You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARR Nonsense . Do n't be silly . PHYLLIS PENNEL You are , Douglas . DOUGLAS CARR It 's just that being with Lord has made me conscious of my own limitations  --  that 's all . I 'm terribly discouraged . PHYLLIS PENNEL But Doug , darling , why ? DOUGLAS CARR Well , I ca n't kid myself . I 'm not doing especially well in my work . PHYLLIS PENNEL Has Uncle Avery said anything ? DOUGLAS CARR Oh , I 'm plodding along doing the routine job of a Ph.D . grind  --  but I 'm not my father 's son . p. 7 PHYLLIS PENNEL You talk as if you were an old man  --  with your work behind you . DOUGLAS CARR When Father was my age he had written several important papers . He was James ' star pupil at Harvard . Oh , well , just another dull son of a brilliant father . ( He kisses her ) Come on , Phyl . ( He rises and crosses toward door R. ) Let 's go downstairs and help Mrs. Goodhue with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is just a mood . I know it will pass . DOUGLAS CARR For two pins I 'd chuck the whole thing and go to New York with him  --  take my chances  --  PHYLLIS PENNEL What does he want you for ? To pay his expense , I suppose , while his great schemes get under way . DOUGLAS CARR Well , as I probably wo n't go , there 's no use getting agitated about it . I 've been sitting over there working  --  forcing myself to write . My notes piled up before me  --  then suddenly I stopped and looked at what I was doing . I looked at the page . Just a page of stuff  --  dull , routine , commonplace . I saw myself writing hundreds of such pages all my life , and what for ? Files . It all seemed so useless . We 'll marry and I 'll get a job teaching in some fresh-water college out West and you 'll be the young instructor 's wife , pinching to make both ends meet . In the meantime let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  guests will be here soon . p. 8 PHYLLIS PENNEL This is all Raphael Lord 's doing . He 's filled your head  --  ( RAPHAEL LORD comes in R. His age is indeterminate . He might be twenty-four or twenty-six or even older . Febrile , restless , the brain which animates him is an incessant gyroscope . A terrific nervous vitality . Pale , underfed , weak , except nervously and mentally . Shabbily dressed . His movements are abrupt , panther-like . He gives an effect of darting about a room , and in his speech , too , of sloughing through irrelevancies like an arrow . ) RAPHAEL LORD Where 's Ann ? DOUGLAS CARR I do n't know . RAPHAEL LORD ( To DOUGLAS ) Got to talk to you alone . ( To PHYLLIS ) Mrs. Goodhue wants you . Better go help her . PHYLLIS PENNEL Well , of all the nerve ! RAPHAEL LORD I 'm in a hurry ! DOUGLAS CARR ( Afraid of what he 'll say to PHYLLIS ) Perhaps you 'd better  --  PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Disgusted ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. end of bench before fire ) I 've got some important things to say to Doug and I have n't much time . Do I have to go through a ritual to get you out of here ? p. 9 PHYLLIS PENNEL Well , of all the nerve ! DOUGLAS CARR I 'll tell her afterwards anyway  --  Why ca n't you talk before both of us ? RAPHAEL LORD She 'll interrupt with foolish remarks . I ca n't be bothered . PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Rises , picking up ANN 's present ) Oh , you ca n't ! Well , I 'm not in the least bit interested in your get-rich-quick schemes . If he wants to borrow the fare to go to New York  --  give it to him , Doug . It will be worth it to get rid of him . ( She goes out R. ) DOUGLAS CARR ( Distressed ) Why ca n't you be nice to people ? RAPHAEL LORD I 've got no inclination for it . DOUGLAS CARR Pose ! RAPHAEL LORD I do n't have to be polite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . DOUGLAS CARR I 'm not sure what 's the matter with you , Rafe  --  genius or swelled head . RAPHAEL LORD You 'll find out . What I came to tell you is this . I 'm leaving Calvert tonight . DOUGLAS CARR ( Sitting L. of LORD ) But I thought you said  --  p. 10 RAPHAEL LORD I 've changed my mind . I 've gotten all I can out of this place . My God , I thought I came here to learn something ! I thought this was a University  --  It 's a sadium ! Lot of football fans and flag wavers . And that moron Sherman Maxwell the presiding genius ! DOUGLAS CARR Oh , Sherman 's just a fad . He 's a great player and  --   --  RAPHAEL LORD So I read in the papers . Well , are you going to stick around Calvert rooting in the grand-stand while Sherman Maxwell runs around with a football against his chest , or are you coming to New York with me ? DOUGLAS CARR Well , it 's quite a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just about halfway through my post-graduate work  --  RAPHAEL LORD It 's a great time to quit . If you ever get your Ph.D . you 'll be sunk ! DOUGLAS CARR If there was something definite I 'd quit in a minute . But this way  --  RAPHAEL LORD Let me do the worrying for both of us . DOUGLAS CARR How can you be so confident about your future ? When you have n't even a definite idea  --  RAPHAEL LORD This is your great chance , Doug . You 've no special talent for scholarship . You know that . p. 11 DOUGLAS CARR I guess that 's true  --  I wonder what I have got a special talent for ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Rises ; crosses to desk ) You 'll be all right with me . Stay here and you 'll become a college professor . DOUGLAS CARR Well , that was good enough for my father . RAPHAEL LORD Your father was a great man . DOUGLAS CARR My father  --  RAPHAEL LORD Do n't talk to me about your father . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course  --  you know everything . RAPHAEL LORD It was on account of your father that I came here . I was in jail in Denver for bumming . In the prison library there was a copy of your father 's autobiography . I read it  --  one sitting . The book got me . I said to myself : " The guy that wrote that book was the real thing and if he thinks so much of Calvert it must be some place . " The minute I got out I hopped a freight and came here . What do I find ? A lot of babies yelling themselves blue in the face over a football prodigy . DOUGLAS CARR You seem to have Sherman Maxwell on the brain . RAPHAEL LORD It amazes me Ann sees so much of him . p. 12 DOUGLAS CARR Oh , so that 's it . ( He laughs ) Rafe  --  RAPHAEL LORD You do n't think I 'm jealous of him , do you ? DOUGLAS CARR Well , it occurred to me  --  RAPHAEL LORD Let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him seriously I 'd have nothing more to do with her . DOUGLAS CARR You 're priceless , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD Ann 's sorry for him , that 's all . One thing Ann 's got to learn is to be ruthless with bores . DOUGLAS CARR But look here , Rafe ! You 've never given me the slightest idea what it 's all about . You talk of taking me in with you . In  --  what ? RAPHAEL LORD I have n't settled that yet . DOUGLAS CARR You must have some idea . You would n't want me to give up my work here and come to New York  --  RAPHAEL LORD You 've got to trust me absolutely . You 've got to believe in me entirely . DOUGLAS CARR If there 's something concrete , I 'm willing to listen . But just this way  --  RAPHAEL LORD My God ! Is n't that concrete enough for you ? p. 13 DOUGLAS CARR I do n't know . RAPHAEL LORD Whatever I go into , I 'll go to the top . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RAPHAEL LORD Do you think I can fail ? DOUGLAS CARR But you have n't got anything to start with  --  no capital  --  no friends . RAPHAEL LORD I 've got more than that . I 've got myself . I 've got my brain . I 've got my vision . DOUGLAS CARR Gee , I wish I could be as sure of myself as you are . RAPHAEL LORD If you were sure of yourself your confidence would be misplaced . DOUGLAS CARR Rafe  --  RAPHAEL LORD Too late . DOUGLAS CARR But Rafe , you 'll have to have some money . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm not asking you to come to New York because I need you . DOUGLAS CARR I have my inheritance  --  RAPHAEL LORD I do n't need anyone . I 'm only asking you because you 're Ann 's brother . I 'm crazy about her . That 's why I 'm asking you . DOUGLAS CARR You 're in love with Ann  --  and yet you 're leaving her here . p. 14 RAPHAEL LORD No , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're joking . ( DR . AVERY enters R. He is sixty ; gray hair and wrinkled eyes . He carries a brief-case . ) RAPHAEL LORD Where 's Ann ? DR . AVERY I thought she 'd be here . She left the library before I did . Wo n't you wait ? RAPHAEL LORD I was going to . DOUGLAS CARR Hello , Uncle Avery . DR . AVERY ( TO DOUGLAS ) Phyllis wants you to help her . From the preparations I gather you are expecting the entire college for Ann 's birthday . DOUGLAS CARR It wo n't be as bad as it looks . About a dozen people . See you later , Rafe . ( Crosses to door R. ) RAPHAEL LORD ( Sitting at desk , looking over a book ) You probably wo n't . DOUGLAS CARR You 're not really leaving tonight ! RAPHAEL LORD You 'll find I do n't say things just for the sake of talking . DOUGLAS CARR I 'll go to the station with you . p. 15 RAPHAEL LORD You need n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He starts to speak ; ca n't evolve anything ; goes out . LORD gives the effect of having already put DOUGLAS out of consciousness . He turns on AVERY ) Where 's Ann ? DR . AVERY Probably dressing for the party .  --  Look here , son . I want to talk to you . What 's this about your leaving tonight ? ( Sits R. end of bench in front of fire . ) RAPHAEL LORD It 's true , that 's all . DR . AVERY Phyllis tells me you want to take Douglas with you ? RAPHAEL LORD I gave him a chance . DR . AVERY He refused the opportunity ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . He prefers to stick around here and become a college professor . DR . AVERY A lowly destiny , I admit . But what do you offer ? RAPHAEL LORD The truth is , Doctor , there 's something I 've been wanting to tell you for a long time . DR . AVERY Yes . RAPHAEL LORD ( Sitting L. end of bench before fire ) I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . AVERY Only one ? RAPHAEL LORD ( A little hurt ) You think I 'm conceited , do n't you ? DR . AVERY Well  --  you 're not exactly tortured by doubt . RAPHAEL LORD Doctor  --  I 'm going to tell you something that I 've never told to a living soul  --  DR . AVERY Well ? RAPHAEL LORD I know things before they happen . DR . AVERY You what ? RAPHAEL LORD I 've proved it to myself . I know things-before they happen . DR . AVERY A prophet ! Well ! Well ! Very interesting . ( LORD is a little let down . AVERY is n't sufficiently startled . ) It 's an Old Testament faculty . You 're a curious person to revive it , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD You do n't believe me now , but in two years you will  --  in less . DR . AVERY You know this does n't surprise me , my boy .  --  Does n't surprise me at all . RAPHAEL LORD It does n't surprise you because you do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 've been expecting something of the sort . p. 17 RAPHAEL LORD How do you mean ? DR . AVERY You know I 've been very interested in you ever since you came here . I do n't mind admitting that I 've rather studied you . I felt pretty certain that you 'd produce some little gadget out of your mind to demonstrate your superiority to yourself and to the rest of the world . So it 's prophecy ! Well ! Well ! I have in mind a book : " Varieties of Egomania . " You shall have a footnote in it . RAPHAEL LORD Only a footnote ? DR . AVERY Maybe a chapter ! RAPHAEL LORD You think I 'm a case , do n't you ? DR . AVERY In a sense everyone 's a case . RAPHAEL LORD In a short time , in two years  --  maybe in less , I 'll be one of the most talked-of men in America . Will you believe me then ? DR . AVERY No , I wo n't But I do believe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down I may be able to make a first-rate scholar out of you . RAPHAEL LORD ( Rises and crosses to C. ) I 'm going to New York . I 'm going tonight . DR . AVERY What will you do there ? RAPHAEL LORD Never mind . p. 18 DR . AVERY Another vision ? ( LORD does not answer . ) You know , Raphael , if you lived sensibly and ate more regularly , you would n't have any visions . Visions invariably proceed from malnutrition . The old saints knew that . When they wanted to see interesting things they went into long fasts . RAPHAEL LORD Some day I 'm coming back  --  DR . AVERY I 'm rather disappointed . I used to believe I could make a fine scholar out of you  --  but I 'm afraid you have n't the temperament . RAPHAEL LORD I could become a fine scholar without the temperament . DR . AVERY It 's a pity you wo n't take the time for it . RAPHAEL LORD It is in a way . God ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trouble with most of these machine-made scholars is that they 're dull  --  dull ! The fellows around here despise me . They ca n't make me out . They think because I 'm brilliant I ca n't be profound . ( Sits R. of desk . ) DR . AVERY ( Laughing and crossing to him ) Raphael , I adore you . RAPHAEL LORD Do you want me to tell you what 's the matter with scholarship in America ? p. 19 DR . AVERY I 'd love to know . RAPHAEL LORD It 's that none of the scholars are men of the world . DR . AVERY Why do n't you remedy that defect ? You 're a man of the world , are n't you ? RAPHAEL LORD It depends on what you mean by a man of the world . If you mean one of those stuffed shirts that go out to dinner every night in a crush hat ,  --  well , I 'm not . But in a deeper sense I am . Did you know that I was with Sandino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lenin in Russia . DR . AVERY How do you get on with Mussolini ? RAPHAEL LORD You do n't believe me ? DR . AVERY I do n't have to believe you to like you . RAPHAEL LORD ( Suddenly suspicious , passionate ) You distrust me too . In some obscure way , you are jealous of me . DR . AVERY My dear boy ! RAPHAEL LORD Yes , you are ! You envy my sure grip on life , my certainty . I 'm sure , and you are floundering . You envy me my genius . DR . AVERY Envy you your genius ! My dear boy ! I 've been doing all I can to foster it . If you knew how bored I am with the ordinary run of my students . No , my dear Raphael , I 'm not jealous of you . I 'm fond of you . But I do wish you 'd eat a bit more regularly and take better care of your health . p. 20 RAPHAEL LORD ( Suddenly ) Doctor Avery ,  --  I respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do something marvelous for you . Endow a university for you  --  anything you like . DR . AVERY Well , that 's very generous of you . ANN CARR ( Comes in from L.2 . She crosses to LORD and takes his hand ) Oh , hello , Raphael . Is n't this nice ? ( Crossing to between LORD and DR . AVERY ) He 's the first to greet me on my birthday . RAPHAEL LORD I did n't know it was your birthday . ANN CARR Ca n't you be pleasant ? What shall we do with him , Uncle Avery ? DR . AVERY He was very pleasant to me just before you came in . He presented me with a magnificent gift . ANN CARR Really ? What ? DR . AVERY Oh , a little thing . A university endowed especially for me . ANN CARR Oh , dear ! When is this going to happen ? DR . AVERY As soon as he is a multi-millionaire . How long , Raphael ? A few months ? RAPHAEL LORD I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't he direct ? ANN CARR Since he has been giving you a university , do n't you think we had better tell him what we have for him ? DR . AVERY I 'm afraid it 's too late . Raphael 's going to New York tonight . ANN CARR ( She looks from one to the other ) No . No . Oh , Raphael .  --  He ca n't be serious . RAPHAEL LORD I know what I have to do and I 'm going to do it . ANN CARR Let 's tell him . Let 's tell him now . DR . AVERY In our blundering way , Ann and I have contrived to get you the Wendell Phillips Scholarship for next year . RAPHAEL LORD What 's that ? ANN CARR Three years at any university in Europe . DR . AVERY Oxford , Berlin , the Sorbonne  --  wherever you want to go . ANN CARR Three thousand dollars a year .  --  You wo n't have to worry about anything  --  just study . History , economics . You will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD I 'll do that without a scholarship . ( ANN is silent . She stares at him. ) p. 22 DR . AVERY The truth is , Ann , Raphael is bored with us . ANN CARR What 's he going to New York for ? RAPHAEL LORD Money ! DR . AVERY Can it be that we 've been harboring a materialist in our bosom , Ann ? RAPHAEL LORD Do you despise money ? Why , this is the most commercial time in the history of the world . Money technique is the essence of the age and I shall be a master of it ! Despise money ! Why , that 's intellectual snobbery . ANN CARR Whatever is he talking about , Uncle Avery ? DR . AVERY I leave it to you to find out . ( AVERY goes to door L.1 . ) Mind  --  you do n't go to New York with him , Ann . ANN CARR ( Laughing ) Do n't worry . DR . AVERY Well , he 's a very compelling young man ! Keep him here . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk ) I 'll do my best . Well  --  RAPHAEL LORD I love you . ANN CARR ( Slowly ) You 're very difficult , Raphael . p. 23 RAPHAEL LORD You must come with me tonight . ANN CARR You 're not serious . You ca n't be serious . RAPHAEL LORD ( Draws Chair below desk to her Left and sits ) Listen , Ann , my darling . Can I tell you what I feel inside my head , inside my will ? Something  --  irresistible . Something that nothing can stop . I 'll do anything for you . Is n't there something in you  --  some instinct  --  that tells you that I can do it ? That nothing will stop me doing it ? My love  --  I love you . ANN CARR My mind tells me this is romantic nonsense  --  but something else , something deeper , makes me believe in you . It 's curious . RAPHAEL LORD Why is it curious ? ANN CARR Why do I believe so much in you ? Why am I so much taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARR I hardly know you  --  anything about you . RAPHAEL LORD You 've known me six months . ANN CARR No , really ? RAPHAEL LORD I 've been here six months . ANN CARR But I do n't know you any better than I did when you first came . p. 24 RAPHAEL LORD I 've told you everything about myself . ANN CARR It 's all so unreal . It 's like  --  Jack London . RAPHAEL LORD I knew London . I once took a trip with him on his boat . ( ANN laughs . ) What are you laughing at ? ANN CARR Nothing ! RAPHAEL LORD Yes , you are . You 're laughing . ANN CARR Well , it 's only that whenever anyone mentions anyone , provided they are famous enough , you seem to have known them . RAPHAEL LORD I hate mediocrities . ANN CARR You keep insisting on your superiority , as if it were necessary to convince yourself . RAPHAEL LORD It is n't Why should I pretend that I 'm not extraordinary ? Why should n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk like this , I think you 're being funny , but when I look at you , I see that you are perfectly serious . RAPHAEL LORD I ca n't be flippant about myself . ANN CARR My father was a great man and yet he was very simple and unassuming and humorous . RAPHAEL LORD Why should I be simple because he was ? Why should I be unassuming because he was ? No . You 've got to take me as I am. p. 25 ANN CARR You 're not serious about going to New York tonight ? RAPHAEL LORD Absolutely . ANN CARR You have n't any money , have you ? RAPHAEL LORD We 'll manage . ANN CARR You 're quite mad , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD I love you . ANN CARR Do you ? Do you really love me ? I mean ,  --  really ? RAPHAEL LORD Not exactly with the emotion of Sherman Maxwell . ANN CARR What is this obsession with Sherman ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Under his breath ) Ineffectual ! ANN CARR I 'm fond of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RAPHAEL LORD Is he ? Well , I hate him ! I hate him . But I love you . ANN CARR I 'm a little afraid of you . RAPHAEL LORD ( Laughs ) That 's as it should be . ANN CARR You funny boy . You 'd have great charm if you took the time  --  p. 26 RAPHAEL LORD Ca n't stop for that . ( Rises and crosses down R. ) ANN CARR You do attract me . RAPHAEL LORD I know . ( Crosses and kisses her . Then crosses to chair below desk and sits down . ) ANN CARR We must be sensible . What have we in common ? RAPHAEL LORD Our love . ANN CARR No . You 're too restless . You 're too ambitious . You 're not the sort of person I care for . RAPHAEL LORD Well , you 're in for it ! ANN CARR You do n't really imagine I 'm going to New York with you tonight ? RAPHAEL LORD Of course you 're going with me . ANN CARR Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're remote . I have an idea you 're lovely . ANN CARR Is it only a suspicion ? RAPHAEL LORD I like to talk to you . ANN CARR That 's it ! I 'm an audience . RAPHAEL LORD You 're intelligent . You understand the implication of what I say . p. 27 ANN CARR I 'm very clever , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD Also you 've got a feeling for poetry but you 're not wistful . ANN CARR ( Laughs and quotes ) " And the best and the worst of this is , Neither is most to blame . If you have forgotten my kisses And I have forgotten your name . " ( LORD speaks the third line with her but stops . ) RAPHAEL LORD You 'll never forget my name . ANN CARR You say you love me . Do something for your love . RAPHAEL LORD What ? ANN CARR Stay here . Take this scholarship . It 's a splendid chance . Find out what there is in you . RAPHAEL LORD I know . ANN CARR No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD I could n't stay even if I wanted to . ANN CARR Why not ? RAPHAEL LORD I have a command to go . ANN CARR Command ! From whom ? RAPHAEL LORD My star ! ANN CARR Your star ? What are you talking about ? p. 28 RAPHAEL LORD I 've gotten all I can out of this place . ANN CARR Do n't talk like that , Raphael . I love this place . I love Calvert . RAPHAEL LORD What more can we accomplish here ? You come with me . ANN CARR But Raphael , I ca n't leave Calvert like this . RAPHAEL LORD Why not ? ANN CARR You must give me time . RAPHAEL LORD I ca n't do that . You must decide now . ANN CARR You 're ruthless , are n't you ? RAPHAEL LORD What 's wrong with that ? Do you think it possible to achieve anything without ruthlessness ? ANN CARR I imagine there are people who would n't be ruthless no matter what material success it brought them . RAPHAEL LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think people are content with mediocrity and poverty ? Why do n't they rise out of it ? Do you think people stop in taking what they want out of a moral scruple ? That 's simply  --  naive . To be ruthless requires strength  --  it requires courage and concentration . You remind me of the people who say they have marvelous ideas if they could only express them , which is exactly like saying they 'd be rich if only they had money . p. 29 ANN CARR ( After a moment ) There 's a flaw in that somewhere . I 'll probably discover just where it is after I 've thought about it a little while . ( With a sigh ) Oh , dear , my best answers come to me too late . RAPHAEL LORD There 's no flaw in it . Besides , you 'll profit by my ruthlessness . ANN CARR Will I ? How ? RAPHAEL LORD Do n't you want to keep some element of surprise ? ANN CARR You mean money , I suppose . RAPHAEL LORD Power . ANN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? RAPHAEL LORD What you want  --  I 'll give you . ANN CARR I 'm not sure you can . RAPHAEL LORD In any case you have no choice . You love me , Ann  --  ANN CARR Do you know what first endeared you to me ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . ( Corrects himself ) No . ANN CARR Because I heard that you had crossed the continent because you 'd read father 's book . RAPHAEL LORD His personality comes through every word he 's written . If he were alive I know I'd-worship him . p. 30 ANN CARR No , I do n't think so . You have some dream of success in your head he would n't have liked . RAPHAEL LORD How do you know what I 've got in my head ? What 's your father got to do with me ? ANN CARR I adored my father . I still do . This old house  --  his spirit pervades it .

He was the first man in his field in this country  --  a pioneer . Of course psychology was n't as popular then as it is now . RAPHAEL LORD It 's too popular now . What a lot of voluble stuffed shirts these psychology courses turn out ! ANN CARR Try to listen  --  just once . RAPHAEL LORD I will . I 'll try . But you must n't expect too much . ANN CARR Raphael , you 're hopeless . RAPHAEL LORD ( Taking her hand ) Go on . I 'll listen . I 'll listen if it kills me  --  sweet  --  ANN CARR Money does n't interest me very much . As for power  --  well , if I had it  --  on whom would I use it ? p. 31 RAPHAEL LORD I do n't want money for its own sake . I do n't want power for its own sake . I want to use them .

We 'll give the Soviets the once-over in Russia  --  ANN CARR That 's very exciting , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD You 'll have an exciting life with me . ANN CARR You know I believe in your book , but must we start it tonight ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . Yes . ANN CARR Why ca n't we do the preliminary work here ? RAPHAEL LORD No . No . ANN CARR What can be waiting for you in New York that is more important to you than I am ? RAPHAEL LORD Many things . My destiny . p. 32 ANN CARR But if you love me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAPHAEL LORD It 's true . ANN CARR So does Sherman . He offers me some sort of fabulous fortune too  --  professional football . I must say his sounds more real than yours . RAPHAEL LORD So that 's it ! ANN CARR What do you mean ? RAPHAEL LORD You want him . ANN CARR I just wanted to show you  --  RAPHAEL LORD I offer you  --  He has n't got a brain in his head . A year after he 's left college they 'll be using his name to sell fake stocks . I offer you and you prefer  --  You 're not taking any chances , are you ? ( He rises ) Well , I know my future and I know his too . ( Crosses and sits on chair , front of desk ) Will you come with me tonight ? ANN CARR No . RAPHAEL LORD Can I have your word that you 'll join me in a week ? ANN CARR No . RAPHAEL LORD In a month ? ANN CARR No. p. 33 RAPHAEL LORD You do n't love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I do . RAPHAEL LORD ( Rising and taking his hat ) All right , then you 'll never see me again . ( He starts to go . She stops him . ) ANN CARR ( Rising ) Raphael , do n't go . Do n't go like this . RAPHAEL LORD Why did n't you tell me you loved Maxwell ? ANN CARR You misunderstood me . RAPHAEL LORD You 've kept me here all these precious months . ANN CARR I wanted you to stay because it was good for your future  --  RAPHAEL LORD You wanted to reduce me to you and the dullness around you . ( Crosses front of her to C. ) God , how I despise you ! God , let her know how I despise all of you ! I hate you . Do you hear ? Do you hear ? ANN CARR Yes . I hear . RAPHAEL LORD I 'll always hate you . ( He rushes out R. ANN , dizzied by the blow , starts to exit L.2 when DOUGLAS enters R. ) p. 34 DOUGLAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . ) What 's the matter with Raphael ? ANN CARR Why ? DOUGLAS CARR He rushed by as pale as a ghost . Would n't speak to me . What 's happened ? ANN CARR I do n't know  --  ( She starts to exit L.2 . ) DOUGLAS CARR Oh , Ann  --  ( She stops . ) Sherman phoned . His brother is in town for the day . He asked if he could bring him over for the party . I told him yes . ANN CARR Of course . ( DOUGLAS starts to go . ) Douglas  --   --  ( She crosses to him . ) DOUGLAS CARR Yes . ANN CARR Go after Raphael . ( AVERY enters L.1 . ) DOUGLAS CARR I do n't know if I could get him now . ANN CARR Yes , you can . In his room . Or at the station surely . DOUGLAS CARR What 'll I tell him ? ANN CARR Tell him he misunderstood me . Make him come back . DOUGLAS CARR I 'll do what I can . p. 35 ANN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Ann . ( DOUGLAS exits R. ) DR . AVERY ( Crossing to chair below desk  --  ANN is at C. ) I hope you get him back . He 's a tremendous relief from the average undergraduate . ANN CARR Frightful temper . ( There is a pause . ) What will become of him ? DR . AVERY He 'll manage . As to what will become of him  --  well , that 's problematical . Pity he was n't born a century ago . He might have become a military adventurer on the Napoleonic scale . ( ANN impulsively goes to him . ) Yes , my dear ? ANN CARR I feel that there is something in him magnificently worth saving . DR . AVERY So do I ! But as the boys say , try and do it . ANN CARR I intend to make a fight for him . ( SHERMAN 'S and CURTIS 'S voices are heard off R. ) Oh , they 're beginning to come . ( Starts for L.2 and then hesitates for a moment ) Uncle Avery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him tonight , I suppose you 'd think I 'm quite crazy  --  ( There is a slight pause . ) Well , perhaps I am . ( She exits L.2 . DR . AVERY , left alone , looks after her , an indulgent smile playing about his lips . He saunters to the desk for a magazine , when SHERMAN MAXWELL and his brother , CURTIS , come in . SHERMAN MAXWELL is six feet tall , blond , with no suggestion of heaviness , an all-American end of great renown . His brother is much smaller and does not resemble SHERMAN in the least . SHERMAN is a " hick " country boy raised suddenly to fame . CURTIS is sleek , saturnine , with a city-edge . SHERMAN wears a dinner suit . CURTIS , a dark business suit SHERMAN is not altogether comfortable in his stiff collar. ) p. 36 SHERMAN MAXWELL Oh , hello , Doctor Avery . This is my brother , Curtis . DR . AVERY ( Shaking hands with him ) Hello . How are you ? Another football player ? CURTIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAXWELL Curtis does n't want to stay for the whole party . DR . AVERY Well , to tell you the truth , I do n't think I 'm going to stay very long myself . ( Exits L.1 . ) CURTIS MAXWELL ( Crosses to C. He 's sizing up the place . ) Is that the Uncle Avery I keep hearing about ? SHERMAN MAXWELL He 's not really their uncle . Kind of looks after ' em . He was a great pal of their father . The old man Carr must of been an awful educated man . Wrote a bunch o ' books . Wish to hell I could get this tie straight . I ca n't get the ends to match . CURTIS MAXWELL ( As he fixes SHERMAN 'S tie ) These Carrs got any money of their own ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Not much to speak of . The old boy left ' em a little , I guess . Insurance and this house . But Ann works . ( As tie is fixed ) Thanks . p. 37 CURTIS MAXWELL What at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they make ' em . Is n't a book in the place she do n't know  --  ( Is nervous . He is a little afraid of his brother . ) CURTIS MAXWELL ( Crossing down L. ) Propose to her yet ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Not yet . I kinda guess she 's expectin ' me to pop any minute . Pretends not to be interested much . Ann 's funny that way . ( Sits in front of fireplace . ) CURTIS MAXWELL ( After a moment  --  quietly ) You 're making a mistake , Sherman . SHERMAN MAXWELL Aw , now , Curt , wait till you see the girl , ca n't you ? That 's all I 'm askin ' . Wait till you meet the girl . You 'll change your mind . See if you do n't . Ai n't fair to condemn a person before you meet ' em . CURTIS MAXWELL You 're a fool , Sherman . SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Sulky ) Oh , the trouble with you , Curt , you got no romance in you . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . CURTIS MAXWELL I come down , here to put a fortune in your hands and you wo n't listen . p. 38 SHERMAN MAXWELL Who said I wo n't listen ? CURTIS MAXWELL Got this " hick " girl on your mind . SHERMAN MAXWELL All I say is , if I 'm gon na give up my amateur standin ' , I 've got to have a little talk with Ann about it , that 's all . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Crossing up C. Darkly ) Suppose she does n't approve . SHERMAN MAXWELL Aw , sure she will . I 've already mentioned it to her . CURTIS MAXWELL What did she say ? SHERMAN MAXWELL She did n't seem to care . CURTIS MAXWELL Suppose she does ? SHERMAN MAXWELL I 'll let you talk to her . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Sits R. of desk ) I 'll have to beg her permission , I suppose , to let you earn a half a million dollars . SHERMAN MAXWELL Well , say , now listen . For all I know she 'll think it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance , will you ? ( Rises and crosses down R. ) CURTIS MAXWELL I 'm not going to let this thing get away from us . I 'm telling you now . Do you know what we can take in at the gate ? One match at the Polo Grounds alone , one match . p. 39 SHERMAN MAXWELL I 'll bite . How much ? CURTIS MAXWELL Forty percent of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . Sixty thousand dollars . SHERMAN MAXWELL That 's if you get that big a gate . CURTIS MAXWELL Bound to . You 're the biggest man in American football right now . All you need to play  --  well , let 's say ten matches . I 've got them all lined up  --  New York , Chicago , Boston , Philadelphia , Detroit , Cleveland , Pittsburgh ,  --  maybe a couple in the West . A cold half million I figure it 's good for , and that 's conservative . SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Almost shyly ) There 's just one thing you 're overlooking , Curt . CURTIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chair L. of fireplace ) How many matches do you figure ? CURTIS MAXWELL I told you . Six or eight , maybe ten . I 've had bunches of offers from small towns , but we 'll just hit the big ones . SHERMAN MAXWELL Tell you the truth , Curt , I do n't know if I could play ' em . CURTIS MAXWELL What ? ( Pause . ) What do you mean ? p. 40 SHERMAN MAXWELL The old pump . CURTIS MAXWELL ( After a moment ) Been bothering you lately ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Some . CURTIS MAXWELL Been to a doctor ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Yeah . I went to see a specialist in Boston . CURTIS MAXWELL What did he say ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Football heart . Advises me to lay off . Geez , lucky my season is over . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Rises and crosses to SHERMAN . Cajoling ) Well , now you know , Sherman , these matches . You can fake through ' em , ca n't you ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Trouble is , once I get started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't forget yourself . Ten matches and you 're through . SHERMAN MAXWELL Yeah . I might be . CURTIS MAXWELL Do n't let that doctor scare you . If you ask me , it 's nothing but nerves . I 've never noticed anything wrong with you . I 'm sure you 're going to be all right . Anyway , in these games most of the time you 'll be playing against professionals . SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Crossing in front of fireplace ) Do n't you kid yourself . These professional teams are mean babies . I 'd rather be up against these college boys any day . p. 41 CURTIS MAXWELL ( Follows him ) Now Sherman , will you stop worrying about yourself ? You 'll really make yourself sick . If you do n't feel up to it , we 'll wait till next season . You can have six months ' rest . You have n't mentioned this to anyone , have you ? SHERMAN MAXWELL No , who would I tell ? CURTIS MAXWELL Sure ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Sure I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I have n't told anybody . CURTIS MAXWELL Nobody knows you 've even been to see a doctor ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Not a soul . Well , except  --  CURTIS MAXWELL Who ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Oh , well , he does n't matter a damn . CURTIS MAXWELL Who ? SHERMAN MAXWELL A phoney college student I happened to meet on a train to Boston . CURTIS MAXWELL Who is he ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Oh , he 's just a big heel of a Bolshevick that hangs around here . No one knows where he came from . Do n't even know his right name . No one has any use for him . p. 42 CURTIS MAXWELL Is he a football player ? SHERMAN MAXWELL A football player ! Of course not . Did n't I tell you no one has any use for him ? CURTIS MAXWELL What did you have to tell him you were going to see a doctor for ? SHERMAN MAXWELL I did n't know I was telling him . CURTIS MAXWELL What ? SHERMAN MAXWELL He just kept looking at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it make ? No one around here even talks to him . CURTIS MAXWELL God , what a dumb-bell you are , Sherman ! Always were ! SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Crosses back of desk ) Oh , do n't be always crabbin ' , for God 's sake . CURTIS MAXWELL Ca n't you see what we 'd be up against if any dope on this got out ? Might queer all these matches . I 've been months arranging them . Do n't forget I worked like hell on you all my life . SHERMAN MAXWELL I know all about it . CURTIS MAXWELL I worked to keep you in college before you  --  My God , Sherman ! SHERMAN MAXWELL What 's all this about ? For all he knows , it might have been to cure a belly-ache  --  This guy do n't know what I went to see a doctor about . p. 43 CURTIS MAXWELL Shut up ! SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Crosses to L. ) I never said a damn thing  --  ( ANN enters L.2 . ) Oh , hello , Ann ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CURTIS ) How do you do ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Curt 's just in town for the day . ANN CARR Sherman 's told me a lot about his older brother . You do n't resemble each other at all . I 'd never have suspected you were brothers . CURTIS MAXWELL Sherman has all the looks  --  SHERMAN MAXWELL Well , Curt 's got all the brains . He 's awful smart , Ann . ANN CARR Is he ? Sit down . SHERMAN MAXWELL Curt , do n't you think you 'd better  --  CURTIS MAXWELL Oh , I saw a punch-bowl downstairs . Do you mind if I  --  ? ( Crossing toward door R. ) ANN CARR Certainly . Let 's all go . ( She follows him . ) SHERMAN MAXWELL Aw , now , Ann . You do n't want to go . CURTIS MAXWELL Is there anything in it ? p. 44 ANN CARR Yes , there 's something in it  --  fruit juice ! CURTIS MAXWELL I guess I 'll have to use my imagination . SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Crossing to them ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with a come-back . Say , Ann , I want to talk to you about something personal . I 'll see you in a second , Curt . CURTIS MAXWELL Can it be that he wants to get rid of me ? See you later . ( Exits R. ) SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Taking ANN 'S hand and drawing her to C. ) Say , Ann , you look simply marvelous in that dress . ANN CARR Sherman , you act just like a little boy  --  you are a little boy . What shall I do with you ? SHERMAN MAXWELL That 's easy . Marry me ! ANN CARR ( Sitting R. of desk ) Oh , my dear ! SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Sitting L. of desk ) Oh , now , Ann , do n't ask me to propose to you . What 's the use ? I 'm crazy about you . I guess you know that other girls kinda make a fuss about me  --  but you  --  you 're different . Probably that 's why I want you . p. 45 ANN CARR Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what I mean . ANN CARR It 's not very difficult to know what you mean , Sherman . SHERMAN MAXWELL But honestly , Ann , if you marry me I 'll do anything in the world you want me to do . ANN CARR But , Sherman , I do n't want you to do anything . SHERMAN MAXWELL Now listen . Curt 's got a big proposition for me . Remember what I told you ?  --  Those professional matches . I stand to make about half a million dollars . Of course , you understand , it means giving up my amateur standing . ANN CARR I do n't see anything sacred about your amateur standing . SHERMAN MAXWELL Gee ! You 're some sport . I told Curt  --  ANN CARR You told him  --  what ? SHERMAN MAXWELL I told him I 'd have to ask you . ANN CARR But why me ? SHERMAN MAXWELL Now wait a minute . Let me talk .  --  I 'm looking ahead for the both of us , see . After I play these dates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie engagement or so and then we 'll travel . Go around the world . There 's as much education in that as there is in books . How 's that look to you ? We 'll just be sitting pretty  --  both of us . What do you say , Ann ? p. 46 RAPHAEL LORD ( Enters R. ) Maxwell  --  ANN CARR ( Overjoyed he is back ) Raphael ! RAPHAEL LORD Maxwell , I want to talk to you . SHERMAN MAXWELL What about ? ANN CARR Did Douglas tell you ? I sent him after you . RAPHAEL LORD I have n't seen Douglas . I came back to see Maxwell . SHERMAN MAXWELL I 'm Mr. Maxwell to you , Lord . RAPHAEL LORD Do n't be funny . ANN CARR I 'm so glad you 're back , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD I have n't time to talk to you . I 'm leaving in a few minutes . SHERMAN MAXWELL That 's tough . We 'll miss you . ANN CARR I suppose it would never occur to you to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast first . That would be too prosaic , I suppose . ( Exits L.2 . ) SHERMAN MAXWELL Say , what 's eating you anyway ? RAPHAEL LORD You better listen to me . SHERMAN MAXWELL It 's a lucky thing for you I do n't smack you on the nose . p. 47 RAPHAEL LORD What good will that do you ? SHERMAN MAXWELL It might teach you to behave like a gentleman . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm not a gentleman . SHERMAN MAXWELL I 'll tell the world . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Enters R. ) I 'm Sherman 's brother , Curtis Maxwell . RAPHAEL LORD ( TO SHERMAN ) Want your brother to hear what I 've got to say to you ? SHERMAN MAXWELL What you 've got to say to me ? You 've got as much to say to me as I 've got to say to you . CURTIS MAXWELL What 's all this about ? Sherman 's got no secrets from me . RAPHAEL LORD Do you mean to marry Ann Carr ? SHERMAN MAXWELL What 's it to you , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think you 're going to marry her after you play those matches . My God ! SHERMAN MAXWELL Say , you  --  ! Who do you think  --  CURTIS MAXWELL ( To LORD ) What 's on your mind ? RAPHAEL LORD ( TO SHERMAN ) If you 're going to marry Ann Carr , you 've got to tell her the truth about yourself first . p. 48 SHERMAN MAXWELL ( TO CURTIS ) He 's coocoo . CURTIS MAXWELL The truth about what ? RAPHAEL LORD He 's got to tell Ann what 's the matter with him . SHERMAN MAXWELL What 's the matter with me ? Say , you yellow  --  CURTIS MAXWELL ( TO LORD ) Wait a minute . Just what do you mean ? SHERMAN MAXWELL It takes a yellow low-down swine like you  --  RAPHAEL LORD I like the way these big strong men call everybody yellow . I know your sort of courage , Maxwell . SHERMAN MAXWELL You dirty sneak !  --  ( He starts threateningly toward LORD ) I 'll kill you . RAPHAEL LORD What good will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds his ground ; does not move . CURTIS has hard work to keep SHERMAN off him ) SHERMAN MAXWELL How long do you think I 'm going to stand here listening to you ? Will that save you ! What do you mean  --  will that save you  --  ? CURTIS MAXWELL ( Crosses to between them ) Wait a minute , Sherman . You let me handle this . There 's a party downstairs . p. 49 SHERMAN MAXWELL I can see through the whole thing . He 's crazy about Ann himself and he 's sore because she 's keen about me . Why , the dirty son-of-a  --  CURTIS MAXWELL ( Who is restraining SHERMAN from attacking LORD ) Shut up . You want everybody in here ? SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Who is attempting to free himself from CURTIS ) He 's just a low-down bum that 's drifted in here . He 's living a on charity right now . No more belongs in a college than  --  RAPHAEL LORD No . I 'm leaving that to you intellectuals . SHERMAN MAXWELL Shut up ! God-damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head , will you ? RAPHAEL LORD He 's got to tell Ann what 's the matter with him . SHERMAN MAXWELL ( To CURTIS ) Are you going to let him get away with this ? RAPHAEL LORD It 's no use , Maxwell . I know . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Taking command ) Sherman , go in the other room . SHERMAN MAXWELL Are you going to let him lie about me to Ann ? p. 50 CURTIS MAXWELL I 'll take care of that . You go in the other room . SHERMAN MAXWELL ( Used to obedience ) All right . I do n't want to make any trouble here . Ann 's birthday and all . ( He starts to exit R. and turns ) If you know what 's good for you 'll keep out of my way after this . That 's all I 've got to say . ( Exits R. CURTIS follows him and closes the door . He then crosses to LORD , who has seated himself R. of desk . ) CURTIS MAXWELL ( Very suavely ) You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get this idea about Sherman ? RAPHAEL LORD What 's the difference ? CURTIS MAXWELL ( Ingratiating ) Well , if I knew where you got your information , I might be able to show you . RAPHAEL LORD If I did tell you you would n't believe it . CURTIS MAXWELL I might . Take a chance . Tell me . RAPHAEL LORD ( Rising ) It 's not important how I know  --  the point is I know ! CURTIS MAXWELL Oh ! It was you Sherman met on the train going to Boston ? Was n't it ? p. 51 RAPHAEL LORD No . He did n't tell me what was the matter with him and yet I know . CURTIS MAXWELL What ? ( LORD , by way of answering , indicates his heart . ) I 'll be perfectly frank with you . There 's no reason why I should n't be . I wo n't deny that Sherman has a slight heart condition . RAPHAEL LORD Slight ! CURTIS MAXWELL Sure . Slight . Does n't amount to anything at all . Strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to give him six months to rest . No reason in the world Sherman should n't live as long as the next person . Nothing to worry about at all . I 'm positive . RAPHAEL LORD Are you ? CURTIS MAXWELL Yes . I am . Do you think you know more about him than I do ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . I do . I know more about him than anybody else in the world . CURTIS MAXWELL Say , are you crazy or what ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Nervously avoiding the subject ) Say , have you got a cigrette ? CURTIS MAXWELL ( Giving him one . Coming closer to him and after a moment ) Just between ourselves . You see I 'm taking you into my confidence . I agree with you about this marriage . I think it would be a mistake for my brother and for Miss Carr too . But there 's another reason , a special reason why I should n't like this about my brother 's condition to be noised about . p. 52 RAPHAEL LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Is there ? CURTIS MAXWELL You see I 'm being absolutely frank with you . You see Sherman is booked to play some professional matches all over the country . Now , it would be pretty bad publicity if  --  any of this got out . RAPHAEL LORD You 're going to let him play football knowing  --  ! CURTIS MAXWELL No reason in the world Sherman should n't play all the football he wants to ! I tell you you 've been misinformed . RAPHAEL LORD How many times do I have to tell you ? I have n't been informed . I tell you I know  --   --  ( He points in the direction of room R. ) Your brother is  --  CURTIS MAXWELL Say , do you take dope or something ? ( There is a sudden uprush of VOICES from off R. , among which can be heard : ) A GIRL 'S VOICE Open the window , somebody ! A MAN 'S VOICE I 've never seen him like this before . A VOICE Do n't get excited , I tell you . ANOTHER VOICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 53 ANOTHER VOICE Undo his collar  --  ( Etc . These VOICES continue until the end of the Act . ) RAPHAEL LORD Sherman ! ( WARN Curtain . ) CURTIS MAXWELL What 's the matter ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Frightened himself at the instant revelation he gets ) Better go down  --  PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Appears at R. ) Mr. Maxwell ! CURTIS MAXWELL What is it ? PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Very scared ) Your brother 's fainted . ( She goes out . ) CURTIS MAXWELL God-damn you , you 're responsible for this ! ( He goes out . ) RAPHAEL LORD ( To himself ) No  --  ! No  --  no . I do n't want it  --  I do n't want it  --  no  --  no  --  no  --  ( He grips a chair-back as if to hold himself upright . ) DR . AVERY ( Enters L.1 . Crossing to him ) What 's the matter , son ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Touched by hysteria ) Doctor Avery , I want you to know  --  I did n't ask for this  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know  --  p. 54 DR . AVERY What are you talking about ? ( PHYLLIS , offstage , calls , " Dr , Avery ! " DOUGLAS enters R. ) DOUGLAS CARR Uncle Avery , Sherman 's terribly ill  --  ( DR . AVERY and DOUGLAS go out R. ANN enters L.2 . DOUGLAS calls to her as he goes out . ANN crosses room and is about to go out door R. when LORD stops her. ) @x SCENE : Five years have elapsed since the end of Act One . The scene is the living room in a house off Fifth Avenue in New York , a beautiful , nobly proportioned room with great , dull-yellow curtained windows in the rear . A chastely square marble fireplace R. , old Florentine pieces  --  a richly mellow , rather somber room which could have been achieved only by a person of opulence and exquisite taste . The millionaire from whom RAPHAEL LORD bought the house is a gentleman of culture who has decided to abandon New York for Florence . A Sunday afternoon in January . Chair below fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. and L.C. ; large sofa R.C. ; chair L. of it ; small table at upper L. end of it ; table L.C. with chairs R. and L. of it ; entrances on platform upper R and L.2 ; door L.1 . AT RISE : CURTIS is pacing up and down the room . He is obviously bored with waiting . He is soberly , faultlessly dressed . He is older , harder , more impenetrable than in Act I  --  then he had a certain sardonic geniality which is now gone . EDGAR MULLIN is seated on chair down L. , complacently smoking a cigar . By his side is a briefcase . He is about forty . MULLIN ( After a considerable pause ) When do you think he 'll be here ? p. 56 CURTIS MAXWELL It 's a major principle with him never to be on time . MULLIN It 's comfortable enough here . I do n't mind waiting . CURTIS MAXWELL You would n't . Seems to me I spend half my life waiting for Lord ! MULLIN Where do you suppose they keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a drink . We 've been here nearly an hour . ( There is no reply . CURTIS continues to pace back and forth . As he approaches , MULLIN takes some sheets from his brief-case ) Look here , Curtis . Look at these figures on Ariandos . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Taking the sheets ) In  --  let 's see  --  fourteen months  --  ! MULLIN Lord 's certainly got them hypnotized ! CURTIS MAXWELL ( Casually after a pause ) I 'm going down there Friday . MULLIN I would n't mind going to South America myself . CURTIS MAXWELL I 'll be rather glad to get away . ( Pause . He goes to table L.C. and sits R. of it when MULLIN speaks . ) MULLIN It 's remarkable when you come to think of it . p. 57 CURTIS MAXWELL What is ? MULLIN Much as the public 's been nicked on oil lately you 'd think God Almighty himself could n't float an issue , Loard comes along and they fall all over themselves to buy the stock . You ca n't print the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's oil down there . It looks like a big find . Maybe as big as Texas or Mexico  --  MULLIN Well , no matter what you say he 's a remarkable young man . CURTIS MAXWELL There 's some luck in it , you know , Mullin . MULLIN Well , you ca n't say it 's just luck . Somehow  --  CURTIS MAXWELL ( Looking over a copy of the " American Magazine " on the table ) You 're like everybody else . Minute a man gets to the top the herd discovers he 's a genius . ( Still looking over the magazine ) Certainly likes to read about himself . " Meteoric Rise of Raphael Lord . " MULLIN What does it say ? CURTIS MAXWELL ( Reading from the magazine ) " Career characterized by audacity and vision  --  Brilliant execution of a merger in the automobile field established him as a financial genius  --  In the past eighteen months has emerged as the pioneer of a new oil region in the Republic of Ariandos  --  " Pictures of his various homes  --  Westlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's certainly riding high . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Throwing the magazine aside ) I ca n't read the guff  --  ( He picks up a newspaper from the table and looks it over ) Another editorial ! MULLIN Do you suppose there 's going to be any trouble down there ? Those papers of Vining 's are printing a lot about Ariandos . CURTIS MAXWELL Well , what of it ? MULLIN What 's behind this crusade of Vining 's , anyway ? CURTIS MAXWELL ( Seeing ANN come in R. ) Drop it . ANN CARR Please do n't let me disturb you . CURTIS MAXWELL How do you do , Mrs. Lord ? We were n't doing a thing . You know my cousin , Edgar Mullin ? ANN CARR Of course . MULLIN ( Crossing and shaking her hand ) I 've had the pleasure . ANN CARR I 'm expecting Doctor Avery . I thought perhaps he 'd come in . CURTIS MAXWELL We were just marking time until Mr. Lord arrives . ANN CARR Do n't tell me he 's late . p. 59 CURTIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some tea  --  or a highball ? MULLIN Yes , ma'am . A BUTLER ( Enters L.I . ) Doctor Avery , Madam . ( DR . Avery comes in . ) ANN CARR Oh , Uncle Avery , I 've been waiting for you . ( They ALL nod to each other . ) CURTIS MAXWELL If you do n't mind we 'll go upstairs . I 'd like to go over these statements before he arrives . ANN CARR Certainly . ( TO BUTLER ) Oh , Henry . Serve the gentlemen some whiskey in Mr. Lord 's study . CURTIS MAXWELL Thank you , Mrs. Lord . ( CURTIS and MULLIN exit R. , followed by BUTLER . ) DR . AVERY ( BOTH cross to sofa ) Who was he ? ANN CARR Do n't you remember ? Sherman 's brother . DR . AVERY Oh ! That 's the man Douglas was talking about . ANN CARR ( Sits R. end of sofa ) Yes . I do n't think he likes any of us. p. 60 DR . AVERY ( Sits L. end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of the idea that he blames us for Sherman 's death . DR . AVERY Well , that seems slightly unreasonable . ( A pause . ) Where 's your fire-eater ? ANN CARR I do n't know . Mr. Maxwell had an appointment with him . He 's never on time , you know . Raphael likes to keep people waiting for him . DR . AVERY He never keeps me waiting . ANN CARR He 's fond of you , Uncle Avery . I really believe he is . DR . AVERY Well , he 's given me a marvelous time . But he 's a bit too strenuous for me . ANN CARR When are you going back ? DR . AVERY Tomorrow noon . I just got my reservation . You know , my dear , Raphael has whirled us about so since I 've been here that you and I have hardly had a chance to talk . ANN CARR I know . DR . AVERY Your life now is so different from what it was  --   --  ANN CARR Yes . It is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years since you left home . Sleepy old Calvert must seem very remote and uninteresting to you now . p. 61 ANN CARR No . I miss Calvert . I miss the life there . DR . AVERY Do you ? I should n't think you 'd have the time . ANN CARR I have more time than you think . DR . AVERY Have you ? ANN CARR Yes . You see , Uncle Avery , my life here is curiously disorganized . I do n't do anything and yet I seem to have no leisure . DR . AVERY Do you see many people ? ANN CARR Very few . Raphael 's business friends he occasionally brings home . ( DR . AVERY looks questioningly . ) No , they do n't amuse me very much . Then I ca n't have any social life . I never can count on Raphael . He always calls up at the last minute to say he 'll be an hour late . Then he 's three hours late . DR . AVERY That must be trying . ANN CARR At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to any work of my own . DR . AVERY Why not ? ANN CARR He needs me . Always telephoning . Mustsee-you-right-away sort of thing . DR . AVERY Well , why do n't you take it up with him ? ANN CARR Oh , I have . He says it 'll all be different tomorrow . Of course it never is . It 's worse . All that , though , is secondary . p. 62 DR . AVERY To what ? ANN CARR I 'm so glad you 're here . I could n't possibly talk this to anyone else . RAPHAEL LORD ( Enters L.1 . He is febrile , swift , conscious of omnipotence , coordinated on a high plane . Carelessly dressed , though expensively , with a gardenia in his buttonhole ) Hello  --  sorry ! DR . AVERY You 're late , young man . Five years ago I could have had you up before the Dean for this but now I 'm helpless . ( LORD shakes AVERY 'S hand and kisses ANN . ) RAPHAEL LORD ( At back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her buy that dress . I wanted to get back earlier , but I was held up for speeding  --  till I told the cop who I was . ANN CARR Did the cop apologize ? RAPHAEL LORD No . I showed him some of the trimmings on my new car . He was fascinated . Wait till you see her . Does ninety without the slightest  --  just hums . Wait till I take you out in her . DR . AVERY Ninety ! You wo n't take me out in her . RAPHAEL LORD You know , there are only two others like her in the world . One belongs to the president of the Continental National and the other to the King of Spain . p. 63 ANN CARR Two others like her ! We would n't ride in such a common car , would we , Uncle Avery ? RAPHAEL LORD Well , I would . I 'm no snob . By the way , Ann , I wo n't be able to make the concert tonight . ANN CARR Oh , Raphael , I did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming for dinner  --  very interesting men  --  ANN CARR But this is the third you 've missed and it 's Toscanini 's last . RAPHAEL LORD As a matter of fact I get pretty restless listening to these programs . The conductor looks so grotesque . I wonder what he 'd look like making those absurd gestures if the music stopped . ANN CARR There 's such a magnificent program tonight  --  Beethoven a new Ravel . RAPHAEL LORD Doctor Avery can take you . Where are Doug and Phyl ? I 've been out buying a wedding present for them . Where are they ? I want to tell them about it . ANN CARR They 'll be here . Phyl 's just telephoned . RAPHAEL LORD Has Maxwell come ? ANN CARR He 's upstairs . He 's been waiting an hour . RAPHAEL LORD Curious man . One of the few people in the world who is impervious to my charm . He dislikes me ! ( This is simply a phenomenon to LORD. ) p. 64 DR . AVERY Does he ? I ca n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Strange fellow . DR . AVERY Why does he hate you ? RAPHAEL LORD Well , for one thing he has an enormous capacity for hate . I can understand that . So have I. ANN CARR You say that with such pride . RAPHAEL LORD Well , I also have an enormous capacity for love . You know that , Ann . ( PHYLLIS and DOUGLAS enter L.I . PHYLLIS crosses to sofa , kisses DR . AVERY and sits at ANN 's Right . DOUGLAS shakes LORD 'S hand as he crosses to chair below fire . ) DOUGLAS CARR Hello , everybody . RAPHAEL LORD You 're very dressy , are n't you ? DOUGLAS CARR It 's Sunday . RAPHAEL LORD Well , how 's the married man ? DOUGLAS CARR So far , so good . DR . AVERY That sounds ominous . DOUGLAS CARR As a matter of fact , Phyl and I have just been having our first quarrel . ANN CARR Do n't let him misunderstand you , Phyl. p. 65 DOUGLAS CARR I want to go to Ariandos with Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . RAPHAEL LORD It 's no place for a woman . PHYLLIS PENNEL Then it 's no place for a man either . ANN CARR Does he have to go ? RAPHAEL LORD Of course he does n't . DOUGLAS CARR I do n't feel comfortable about this fellow Maxwell . RAPHAEL LORD No ? DOUGLAS CARR You leave so much to Maxwell . RAPHAEL LORD Less than you think , Douglas . DOUGLAS CARR You 're in so deep in this Ariandos business . RAPHAEL LORD Maxwell ca n't affect it . Nothing can affect it . PHYLLIS PENNEL Is n't he wonderful ? The way he just knows everything  --  RAPHAEL LORD Quite right , Phyllis . I 'm one of the few people in the world who 's practically omniscient . PHYLLIS PENNEL What does that mean ? RAPHAEL LORD And since you adore me so sincerely I 've got a little surprise for you  --  your wedding present at last . p. 66 PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Excited ) Oh . What is it ? RAPHAEL LORD Are you interested , Douglas ? DOUGLAS CARR In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for plans which he left there when he entered ) Three guesses . Ann , what do you think ? ANN CARR Old silver . RAPHAEL LORD No . Douglas ? DOUGLAS CARR Bath mats . RAPHAEL LORD What do you see in him , Phyllis ? PHYLLIS PENNEL Oh , do n't mind him . Linens . RAPHAEL LORD No . DR . AVERY Do I get a guess ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Crossing to back of sofa with plans ) No . You 're not even warm  --  any of you . It 's a house . PHYLLIS PENNEL A house  --  ! RAPHAEL LORD Well , maybe it 's a cottage . Anyway , it 's got a roof on it . It caught my eye one day last week when I was driving to Connecticut  --  so I bought it this morning .  --  It 's a tricky little place . p. 67 PHYLLIS PENNEL Is he joking ? I could n't bear it . RAPHAEL LORD No , I 'm not joking . It 's in Rye  --  just off the Boston Post Road . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . It 's waiting for you . ( He stands back of the sofa " demonstrating " the plans which he has given to ANN . PHYLLIS is at ANN 'S Right on sofa . DR . AVERY is on her Left and DOUGLAS now crosses up to PHYLLIS 'S Right . PHYLLIS , enraptured , keeps making inarticulate cries of delight . DOUGLAS wavers between gratitude and embarrassment . ) PHYLLIS PENNEL Doug  --  is n't it too  --  ! DOUGLAS CARR Gee , R.L. ANN CARR Oh , it is charming . RAPHAEL LORD This really gives you no idea of it . PHYLLIS PENNEL What color is it ? RAPHAEL LORD It 's white .  --  No  --  sort of cream color . What 's your idea of bringing that up ? ANN CARR It 's probably pink . PHYLLIS PENNEL Green blinds ? RAPHAEL LORD Do n't ask me about colors , Phyllis . In this wing is the kitchen . No , wait  --  maybe it 's this wing .  --  Anyway the hall runs straight through . The living room is on this side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHYLLIS PENNEL It 's furnished ! RAPHAEL LORD Completely . DR . AVERY In prince . DOUGLAS CARR Gee , R.L. RAPHAEL LORD In back of the living room is the library . Biggish fireplace in that too . Brass andirons . PHYLLIS PENNEL Brass and  --  RAPHAEL LORD Well , maybe they 're gold . I du n no . They look like brass . This is the dining room . These windows overlook the water . The Sound 's out there . There 's a nice garden in the back . Does n't look like much now but they say in the summer  --  PHYLLIS PENNEL Doug  --  a garden . DOUGLAS CARR Well  --  why not ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Taking plans abruptly from ANN and , turning the page , gives them back to her ) Let 's go upstairs . Four bedrooms  --  beds in ' em . Two bathrooms  --  baths in ' em  --  water all drawn and everything . DR . AVERY Can you get along with two bathrooms , Phyllis ? DOUGLAS CARR ( Coming back to chair down R. ) Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a house party ? p. 69 RAPHAEL LORD With two baths ? I guess you 'll have to take turns . DOUGLAS CARR Honest , R.L. , I do n't see how we deserve all this . RAPHAEL LORD ( In great spirits ) Neither do I. Just gives me a chance to feel like God . ( LORD feels the truth of what he has just said in the moment of utterance . Then with an air of discovery ) You know that 's perfectly true what I just said ! Marvelous sensation . PHYLLIS PENNEL Did you ever see such a darling front door ? RAPHAEL LORD It 's Gothic  --  no , maybe it 's Colonial . I du n no . Back here there 's a little gravel walk . There 's a flower garden with a sun dial in the center and benches all around it . PHYLLIS PENNEL Stone benches ? RAPHAEL LORD No , concrete . Anyway , you ca n't sit on'em . DR . AVERY Does it say Tempus Fugit on the sun dial ? RAPHAEL LORD It does ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to bore me . Here , take your God-damn cottage . PHYLLIS PENNEL You 're just the kindest  --  sweetest  --  RAPHAEL LORD ( Crosses around sofa to chair L. of sofa ) Shut up , Phyllis . It just meant signing a check . Doctor , do you remember that university I promised to endow for you at Calvert ? Perhaps it is n't so nebulous now . p. 70 DOUGLAS CARR ( Who has crossed around R. of sofa to above LORD ) Raphael , I 've got to talk to you seriously about Ariandos . RAPHAEL LORD You know , Doctor , he has nothing on his mind but Ariandos . DOUGLAS CARR But listen , Rafe  --  RAPHAEL LORD Well , what is it ? DOUGLAS CARR I do n't like the look of things down there . They 're doing their best to stir up feeling among the natives . RAPHAEL LORD Let ' em stir ! DOUGLAS CARR Vining 's papers  --  RAPHAEL LORD I 'll stop Vinning . DOUGLAS CARR How ? RAPHAEL LORD Never mind . I 'll do it . DOUGLAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vining thinks he has an emissary in my camp . I have one in his . DOUGLAS CARR Who ? RAPHAEL LORD Maxwell . DOUGLAS CARR Maxwell ! Then I was right . Maxwell is  --  RAPHAEL LORD Yes . Maxwell is ! p. 71 DOUGLAS CARR And you 're letting him go to Ariandos alone . RAPHAEL LORD Douglas , will you go back to your cottage ? DOUGLAS CARR But do n't you see the damage he might do ?  --  Sabotage to our properties . RAPHAEL LORD I tell you , Douglas , it will not happen . DR . AVERY Do you realize , Douglas , you are keeping him from giving me a university ? RAPHAEL LORD Uncle Avery , how would you like to start one in Ariandos ? The Raphael Lord University . You shall be its first president . DR . AVERY To warm . I could n't stand the climate . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm serious . I am . You see , Ariandos means more to me than just an oil field  --  more than profits . For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to see , Doctor , what I 'm really after ? DR . AVERY Reveal ! RAPHAEL LORD Would it interest you to see a practical idealist at work ? DR . AVERY It would fascinate me . RAPHAEL LORD Right . You shall . Let 's have in Maxwell . DR . AVERY Mullin too ? p. 72 RAPHAEL LORD Mullin ? Did I ask Mullin to come here ? Sure , have him in . I 'll get rid of him . ( DOUGLAS exits R. ) I 'm crazy about Douglas . When I first met him at Calvert he was fumbling and ineffectual . DR . AVERY Do n't tell me you 're going to make a go-getter out of Douglas . RAPHAEL LORD Why not ? Better than an introspective  --  PHYLLIS PENNEL When can I see it ? I ca n't wait to see it . RAPHAEL LORD Any time . Drive out today . PHYLLIS PENNEL Will you come , Ann ? ANN CARR I 'd love to but it 's Uncle Avery 's last day . PHYLLIS PENNEL He can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me today . DR . AVERY That settles that . RAPHAEL LORD Got to talk to you . DR . AVERY I love to be ordered about . ( DOUGLAS returns R. with MULLIN and CURTIS . ) RAPHAEL LORD Well , gentlemen  --  Do you know Doctor Avery ? Mrs. Carr ? ( They all nod . ) Phyllis , you go into the library and call up your country house . p. 73 PHYLLIS PENNEL Call up  --  ! RAPHAEL LORD You have a telephone  --  Rye Forty-Seven . And the housekeeper is Mrs. Davis . Call up and introduce yourself . ( PHYLLIS goes off L.2 , repeating , " Rye Forty-Seven " and " Mrs. Davis . " ) ANN CARR I 'll go with you , Phyl . RAPHAEL LORD No , you stay here . Well , gentlemen ? MULLIN You asked me to bring in a statement . RAPHAEL LORD Yes . MULLIN I hope you 'll be satisfied , Mr. Lord . ( Hands him statement . ) RAPHAEL LORD Amazing credulity of people . On my bare word , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand people turn over their savings to me simply because I suggest that it might be profitable . Credulity and greed ! MULLIN But there is oil down there , is n't there , Mr. Lord ? RAPHAEL LORD Do you own some , Mullin ? MULLIN Every penny I 've got . RAPHAEL LORD Well , I hope there 's oil down there . Every cent I own is in Ariandos. p. 74 MULLIN ( Sits L. of table ) Well , what 's good enough for you ought to be good enough for the public , Mr. Lord . RAPHAEL LORD ( Handing back the statement ) Thanks . I 'll be in the office in the morning . MULLIN ( Rising ) Shall I wait for you , Curtis ? RAPHAEL LORD No , Maxwell is staying . MULLIN Good afternoon . ( He goes out L.1 . ) RAPHAEL LORD Not crazy about your cousin , Maxwell . Typical yes-man . CURTIS MAXWELL Your method does n't exactly encourage initiative , Mr. Lord . RAPHAEL LORD Am I domineering ? Douglas , defend me . DOUGLAS CARR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't mind my being perfectly frank  --  RAPHAEL LORD No . Go right ahead . I 've asked these people to stay . Say what 's on your mind . CURTIS MAXWELL Very well , then . I CURTIS MAXWELL You 're floating an issue down there on the basis of maximum production . Before the geologists and I come back , perhaps even before we get there , the issue will probably be entirely bought up . RAPHAEL LORD ( His tone is slightly indulgent , and expert talking to a novice ) It 's certain to be . CURTIS MAXWELL What 's the use of my going , then ? RAPHAEL LORD I 'm not sending you to look for oil , Maxwell . CURTIS MAXWELL Well , if you 're not sending me to look for oil  --  RAPHAEL LORD No . CURTIS MAXWELL Oh ! You want me to see Ramenez ? RAPHAEL LORD No . CURTIS MAXWELL No ? RAPHAEL LORD By the time you arrive there 'll probably be another president . No , I 've got a different mission for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD Sit down . I want you to find sites for cities . Places where people can live . CURTIS MAXWELL I 'm not a city-planner . RAPHAEL LORD I do n't want specialists just yet . p. 76 CURTIS MAXWELL I think what they need down there is not a landscape gardener . They want more machine-guns . ANN CARR Machine-guns ! RAPHAEL LORD Well , just in case  --  ANN CARR Mr. Maxwell , what is the situation down there ? CURTIS MAXWELL Hard to say exactly . The natives are being armed against us , Mrs. Lord . Of course , our marines are down there . But as I say , they need more machine-guns . RAPHAEL LORD All this is just a phase  --  I see far beyond these minor troubles  --  DR . AVERY Trade follows the flag . Bigger and better navies . RAPHAEL LORD Well ? Why not ? DR . AVERY I do n't believe in this sort of thing . I believe in letting those little fellows alone . RAPHAEL LORD Of course you do . Because it 's easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doze  --  DR . AVERY But do n't overlook the fact that occasionally we sleepy fellows have to wake up long enough to repair the damage done by you ruthless ones . RAPHAEL LORD I 'll accomplish more with my ruthlessness than a thousand of you sentimental radicals with your amiability . Wait till you see what I make out of that place . A paradise ! I 'll provide all the things I missed when I was a boy . Do you know what hunger is ? What poverty is ? What tenement-crowding is ? What frustration is ? No , of course you do n't . I have my own ideas about education  --  about labor problems . You wait until you see what I make of Ariandos ! I 'll build model villages  --  houses with patios  --  open-air schools and vital teachers for the children  --  a happy cultural community founded on a sound industrialism . A place for the slums of the world to disgorge. p. 77 DR . AVERY It 's been tried . You know it 's never worked . RAPHAEL LORD Tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . AVERY It 's a glittering idea except that the slumdwellers notoriously love their slums . RAPHAEL LORD Do n't be so damn silly , Avery . ANN CARR ( Rises and crosses to fireplace ) Raphael ! DR . AVERY You think you 're going to lure them out of the slums with a prospectus  --  derricks among the palm trees  --  You ca n't do it . No . Not even you . RAPHAEL LORD Oh , ca n't I ? You think I 'll be held up by a stale clich like that ? While you 're handing out these sterile platitudes to your students I 'll go ahead . I 'll show you how it 's done . ( ANN starts off R. LORD , without seeing her , feels she is going . ) Do n't go , Ann . DR . AVERY It 's visionary . RAPHAEL LORD Visionary ! Of course I am . If you do n't see things ahead you ca n't do ' em . Visionary  --  plus will . Will ! That is the raft on which I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that none of them can add or subtract . I 'll make a Utopia out of Ariandos , run by expert accountants . p. 78 DR . AVERY A Utopia run for profit . Eh ? RAPHAEL LORD Why not ? Do you know why most Utopias fail ? Because no one makes any money out of ' em . CURTIS MAXWELL In any case I 'm hardly the man . RAPHAEL LORD You 're precisely the man . Do you know why I send you ? Because you 've lived in the streets of cities as I have  --  ( TELEPHONE rings . ) DOUGLAS CARR Do you want me to take it ? RAPHAEL LORD No . I 'll take it . ( He takes up phone ) Hello . Yes . Do n't mumble . Speak up .  --  Yes .  --  Yes .  --  Yes . Where was Warren ?  --  Why was n't he on the job ?  --  How many ? Why did n't they mow down a couple hundred ? Then perhaps they 'd learn to leave our stuff alone Who ? Vining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to him . ( He hangs up , white with anger . ) DOUGLAS CARR ( Crosses to LORD ) What is it , R. L. ? RAPHAEL LORD The office . Mr. Vining . DOUGLAS CARR What 's happened ? RAPHAEL LORD Some humanitarian down there  --  probably a professor  --  got the bright idea of translating a few of Vining 's editorials and distributing them among the natives . They burned some of our derricks and a couple of dozen or so were shot . p. 79 DOUGLAS CARR More copy for Vining . DR . AVERY There you are ! RAPHAEL LORD Yes . You ought to be writing for Vining , Avery . Your sit-back-and-do-nothing ideas would suit him admirably . ANN CARR Raphael ! RAPHAEL LORD I 'm always being stopped by some sentimental noodle  --  I 'm sorry . However , that 's not important . Vining is . I 'll let him deal with my lawyer . Douglas , get Hollister up here right away . DOUGLAS CARR I believe he 's arguing a case out of town . RAPHAEL LORD Get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't fool with me . Do you know what he 's trying to do ? Steal my property in Ariandos by stirring up trouble among the natives . Well , he ca n't do it . He 's got a well-known name behind him . They 're both in on another little deal together which is n't exactly immaculate and I can pin it on both of them . I 'll give them publicity they wo n't welcome right now . Douglas  --  no , Maxwell , go upstairs and get me Hollister . I do n't care where he is , get him . Tell him I 'll give Vining twenty-four hours to get his people out of Ariandos or I 'll take it to court . God , if I ever got on the stand in a case like this , the picturesque things I could say about those two babies . I 'll be right up , Maxwell . ( CURTIS exits R. ) ( To DOUGLAS , very pleased with himself ) Did n't I tell you I had an emissary in Vining 's camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you love him upstairs about to telephone Vining ? A neat little way to get a message to him  --  no service charge . p. 80 DOUGLAS CARR But are n't you going to start a lawsuit ? RAPHAEL LORD It wo n't be necessary . As soon as my threat of publicity reaches Vining 's silent partner he 'll call a halt to the whole business . ( He crosses R.C. for a cigarette . ) Doctor , does n't this amuse you ? DOUGLAS CARR But you ca n't hush up those shootings down there . When that gets out what 's going to happen to our stock ? It 'll go way down . RAPHAEL LORD Of course it will . DOUGLAS CARR Thirty or forty points , perhaps . RAPHAEL LORD The lower the better . DOUGLAS CARR What ! RAPHAEL LORD I knew there 'd be some trouble down there . I have orders in half a dozen brokers ' offices to pick up every share that 's offered . DOUGLAS CARR I do n't  --  RAPHAEL LORD Of course you do n't . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pocket ) Here . Listen to this . It 's from Warren . ( He reads ) " Brought in gusher today on Diamond section  --  estimate yield fifteen thousand barrels a day . " p. 81 DOUGLAS CARR ( Taking cable ) Fifteen thousand barrels a day . My God , Raphael , that 's wonderful . RAPHAEL LORD Not bad . Notice the date , Douglas . DOUGLAS CARR The sixteenth . Ten days ago . You 've known this for ten days . Why have you kept quiet ? RAPHAEL LORD I 've been holding this in reserve . On Tuesday morning I 'll announce it . It 'll send our stock sky-high . This is what is known as an inside tip , Professor . Better give Douglas your savings tomorrow morning . DR . AVERY I have n't any savings . RAPHAEL LORD I 'll lend you some .  --  I see all around them . I 've got the whole thing right in the palm of my hand . ( He rises ) Look at that hand ! Visionary ! Is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the width ! You know , Rodin would have liked to have done that hand . DOUGLAS CARR My God ! You 've known this for ten days ! RAPHAEL LORD ( Crossing to back of sofa ) Big business ! You know , Doctor , it 's child 's play . People think this is so mysterious , so extraordinary . It is n't really . It just requires one thing  --  ( He starts to go off through R. ) p. 82 DOUGLAS CARR Genius , Rafe ! RAPHAEL LORD ( Turning ) Well , I would n't exactly call it that , Douglas . ( Exits R. ) DOUGLAS CARR He is a genius . DR . AVERY Whenever he does a thing he 's sure it 's the right thing to do just because he 's done it . DOUGLAS CARR ( Aware of the impression LORD has made on them ) You must n't take everything Raphael says too literally . He 's up against a tremendous job , and he 's really much more tired inside than you have any idea of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . He 's an absolute racketeer . DR . AVERY ( Who has crossed up C. ) Last night at dinner I sat next to Philo Estabrook . He 's a man of different stripe than Vining , is n't he ? DOUGLAS CARR Pink liberal . ANN CARR ( Rises and crosses to front of sofa ) What did Mr. Estabrook say ? DR . AVERY He 's writing an editorial : " What are our marines doing in Ariandos ? " DOUGLAS CARR ( With heat ) They 're protecting American property and American lives , that 's what they 're doing . p. 83 ANN CARR Doug  --  Doug . DOUGLAS CARR It 's a damn shame you ca n't realize what he 's up against . ( Exits L.2 . ) DR . AVERY Can that be the shy , rather discouraged boy I knew at Calvert ? ANN CARR He 's changed . ( She crosses to L. end of sofa ) Well , what do you make of us ? What do you make of our Utopias founded on machine-guns ? DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're likely to know more about it than I do . ANN CARR ( Sits on L. arm of sofa ) What did Estabrook say to you last night ? This article he is going to write on Ariandos ? DR . AVERY Oh , well  --  ANN CARR What did he say ? DR . AVERY Briefly it was to the effect that no small country which finds itself rich in oil can feel confident of its political security . The more you stir things up , the greater the chance of bloodshed . First thing you know they 're identifying dividends with national honor , and there you are . ANN CARR Why does n't Raphael come out and say so ? Why does he suddenly pretend to be an altruist ? Utopia ! p. 84 DR . AVERY The strange thing to me is that I really think he believes it when he says it . ANN CARR It 's impossible to know what he believes . DR . AVERY Amazing fellow ! Talent  --  great talent  --  possessed by a fanatical self-belief . That combination is unbeatable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANN CARR That sort of victory no longer interests Raphael . DR . AVERY Used to  --  great intellectual curiosity . ANN CARR He 's changed . As far as I can make out now all he cares for is possession  --  obsessed by a sort of gluttony for power . DR . AVERY Great charm  --  ANN CARR Yes . Yes . Yes . He turns it on . DR . AVERY And off ! ANN CARR I felt so ashamed just now when he flared up at you  --  DR . AVERY ( Deprecating ) Oh  --  ANN CARR I do n't think he meant anything by it  --  personal . It 's just that  --  I 've noticed it especially in the last year or so  --  He ca n't stand contradiction , any obstacle of any sort  --  even in little things  --  p. 85 DR . AVERY Well , he does n't exactly hide his light under a bushel  --  ANN CARR I feel as if something is going to happen to him  --  in his mind , I mean . He 's like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clairvoyant , unconquerable  --  it is a mania , is n't it ? DR . AVERY Well , it 's an illusion that in his case seems to have great pragmatic value . And see how life confirms his fixed idea . It all works as a charmed circle  --  his complete belief in his powers gives him the audacity to act . It enables him to cut through hordes of timid , uncertain men . Magnificent ! I love it . ANN CARR Sometimes I think  --  well , here 's this great current of energy  --  a terrific urge toward power . Have I the right to get in the way of it ? And even at his worst , I feel  --  that he 's rather whistling in the dark . I understand him better than I used to . His childhood must have been dreadful . He grew up in wretched surroundings . He was starved . He loved beauty  --  longed for some sort of expression , for power . He felt in himself immense abilities , immense strength  --  DR . AVERY And nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some manifestation  --  to distinguish him  --  to make him unique . ANN CARR Yes . This belief in his gift .  --  But is n't it amazing that he 's so overwhelmingly right ? His career  --  how do you account for it , Uncle Avery ? p. 86 DR . AVERY Intuition plus coincidence , and at the bottom , a sound unconscious reasoning , combined with a marvelous memory for the times he 's been right and not so good for the times he 's been wrong . Oh , I 'm not denying he has great ability which almost amounts to genius . After all , what is genius but a sort of sixth sense , an uncanny instinct for utilizing the accidental , so highly developed that it may at times approach clairvoyance ? ANN CARR I want to help him . But all this makes it so impossible ! I ca n't quite get near him . DR . AVERY He seems to adore you  --  ANN CARR He reduces me to nothing . DR . AVERY He could n't do that . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does that sound vain ? DR . AVERY Well , when he 's in the room I feel like a white corpuscle . ANN CARR At one time we had a beautiful companionship . At Calvert we used to read poetry together , make plans for the future . Oh , he 's gay and humorous with me but it 's all a kind of  --  condescension . He puts me off with charm , with a kind of adoration that is  --  an ecstasy of self-discovery . I want simplicity . Where is it going ? What will it do to those who get in the way of it ? What will it do to me ? What will it do to Raphael himself ? I get intimations that trouble me  --  p. 87 DR . AVERY ( Rises and puts his arm around her shoulder ) Life will offer some corrective . ANN CARR Or is it that I 'm jealous because other things mean more to him than I do ? Am I as commonplace as that ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Enters R. ) Doctor Avery , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing me , have n't you ? DR . AVERY We have ! RAPHAEL LORD What 's the matter with me , Ann ? ANN CARR You 're perfect . RAPHAEL LORD I know it . God , she 's a lucky woman . ANN CARR Why are you in such high spirits ? RAPHAEL LORD I 've been upstairs juggling figures with Maxwell . ANN CARR I thought you were laying out the City-Beautiful . RAPHAEL LORD We are . We 're just in the suburbs . You know , Doctor , one of these days you and I will retire to the Academe and write a history of Utopias . ANN CARR Just a little thing he 'll turn out over night . RAPHAEL LORD Not at all . We 'll take a week-end . p. 88 DR . AVERY Not less . ANN CARR I wish I had a list of his literary projects , Uncle Avery . They are encyclopedic . I imagine if Raphael ever did get down to writing  --  with a mind like his  --  he ought to write like  --  H. G. Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Wells ! I would be at once encyclopedic and profound  --  cameo and panorama . H. G. Wells ! Look at her , Uncle Avery , is n't she lovely ! I 'm crazy about that dress . You know Ann does n't know how lovely she is . ( He sits at her R. and takes her face in his hand ) Look at that face . It 's classic . ( He turns her head to get a side view ) No , it 's modern . No . It 's timeless . ANN CARR ( To AVERY ) He 's turning it on . RAPHAEL LORD What 's that ? DR . AVERY Never mind . That 's a little secret between Ann and me . RAPHAEL LORD What 's she been saying about me ? ( He rises . ) DR . AVERY Well , she says that you 're a sinister , mysterious figure . ANN CARR Do n't tell him that . You 'll delight him . p. 89 RAPHAEL LORD Mysterious ? I ? Why , I 'm engaged constantly in an orgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are amused . ) You do n't believe me . Well , ask me something . What do you want to know ? Anything at all . DR . AVERY All right . I 'll ask you something . Dare I , Ann ? ( He rises . ) ANN CARR Risk anything . DR . AVERY Well , I 'd like to know your right name . Would n't you , Ann ? ANN CARR That 's a delicate subject . I never approach it . RAPHAEL LORD Really do you want to know my right name ? DR . AVERY Consumed . RAPHAEL LORD ( Crossing to back of sofa ) All right . I 'll tell you . But absolutely  --  DR . AVERY ( Sitting at ANN 'S L. on sofa ) I 'm a tomb . RAPHAEL LORD Are you prepared for the worst ? ANN CARR Oh , Raphael . DR . AVERY The suspense is killing . RAPHAEL LORD No matter what it is  --  you promise not to leave me ? p. 90 ANN CARR I promise . RAPHAEL LORD All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts into the room , followed by DOUGLAS , L.2 . ) PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Dancing with excitement ) I spoke to Mrs. Davis  --  ANN CARR Sshh ! ( Both ANN and AVERY look up to RAPHAEL for the answer . ) RAPHAEL LORD Too late ! The spell is broken . ( He crosses to DOUGLAS ) I 'm not sending you with Maxwell after all , Douglas . He 's going alone . I 've just told him . DOUGLAS CARR It 's a mistake , R. L. RAPHAEL LORD Do n't you worry . DOUGLAS CARR I do n't like it . RAPHAEL LORD Maxwell ca n't hurt me . ( To PHYLLIS ) Did you speak to Mrs. Davis ? What did she say ? PHYLLIS PENNEL She wants us to come out . She says she 'll have supper for us . RAPHAEL LORD You and Douglas take the Packard . ANN CARR I 'd rather like to see the cottage . p. 91 RAPHAEL LORD No . We 'll follow . Right , Douglas . DOUGLAS CARR Come on , Phyl . PHYLLIS PENNEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't come . ANN CARR Why ca n't we all go together ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Thinking for reasons ) Maxwell 's still upstairs . PHYLLIS PENNEL We 'll wait . RAPHAEL LORD No , you run along . ( Beneath his facetiousness there is an unalterable determination  --  the possibility of disagreement is ruled out . DOUGLAS is impatient to carry out LORD 'S slightest wish . ) DOUGLAS CARR Lady , do n't argue . ( LORD leads PHYLLIS and DOUGLAS toward door L.I. ) DR . AVERY What are you going to do with me ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Turning to him ) I 've got that all worked out . ( To DOUGLAS and PHYLLIS as they go out ) Hurry up ! DOUGLAS CARR ( At door ) Goodbye , R. L. You probably wo n't show up . p. 92 RAPHAEL LORD I 'll do my darndest . DOUGLAS CARR ( As he goes off ) Anyway , see you in the morning . PHYLLIS PENNEL ( Has gone off ahead of DOUGLAS , adlibing ) We 'll wait out there for you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAPHAEL LORD ( Closing the door and crossing back C. ) Now I 'll tell you what I want you to do , Doctor . ANN CARR You 've no idea of going to the country , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD That 's perfectly true . This is a contrivance to see you alone . DR . AVERY So that 's it . ANN CARR Yes . I 've been at Westlands . RAPHAEL LORD As a matter of fact I have n't seen her alone in weeks . DR . AVERY You know the thing about him is that he always has a program  --  and he always wants things more intensely than anyone else in the neighborhood . That 's the secret of his success . RAPHAEL LORD ( Practically lifting DR . AVERY from the sofa ) That 's perfectly true . Most people have n't any idea what they want , and what they do want they want only mildly . Is that a good sentence ?  --  I do n't think so . p. 93 DR . AVERY Incorrigible ! RAPHAEL LORD ( Walking him toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Doctor . DR . AVERY Going-away ? RAPHAEL LORD You 'll find it in the library , wrapped in manila paper . DR . AVERY Is this a bribe ? RAPHAEL LORD Well , it 's a surprise . Guess what it is ? DR . AVERY I have n't got your intuition . ( They are now at the top of the steps of alcove in the c. arch . ) RAPHAEL LORD Well , it 's a firs-edition of Thomas Browne 's " Religio Medici . " DR . AVERY ( Overcome ) Oh , Ann . This makes up for everything . Thomas Browne ! My favorite author . And a first edition ! RAPHAEL LORD ( Leading him toward L.2 ) Well , maybe it 's a second ! DR . AVERY Ann , how do you resist him ? RAPHAEL LORD ( As he urges AVERY off L.2 ) She does n't . ( Calling to AVERY off ) There  --  on the top of the table . p. 94 DR . AVERY ( From off stage ) All right  --  I 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted in him by the irradiation of his own charm simmers down . He crosses down to ANN . ) ANN CARR Well ? Why all this maneuvering ? You have a way of almost pushing people out of a room . RAPHAEL LORD I had to see you alone a minute . ANN CARR Why ? All of a sudden ? RAPHAEL LORD I felt you were hating me . ANN CARR You 're so violent in your expressions , Raphael . RAPHAEL LORD I call things by their names . It was something I said to Doctor Avery . You wanted to get out of the room because I was in it . ( She turns away from him . ) You 're always like that , always straining to get away from me . Why ? ANN CARR Shall I tell you ? RAPHAEL LORD Do you think I 'm afraid of what you can tell me ? ANN CARR A pebble against a Colossus  --  of course ! RAPHAEL LORD ( Crossing to table above sofa for cigarette , which he lights ) you resent me. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 've always resented me . Tell me . ANN CARR I will . I want to . I 've been wanting to . RAPHAEL LORD Tell me , then . ANN CARR Your way of sweeping aside other people 's opinions and other people 's desires , as if they were so much  --  spindrift ,  --  irritates me beyond words . Just now your insolence to Uncle Avery  --  RAPHAEL LORD ( Sitting at L. end of sofa ) Why did n't you wear those jewels ? ANN CARR What jewels ? RAPHAEL LORD The new ones  --  the ones  --  ANN CARR They do n't go with this dress . RAPHAEL LORD Why did n't you wear another dress ? ANN CARR You never listen to me , do you ? You never have . RAPHAEL LORD All right . Go ahead . I 'll listen . ANN CARR It 's just  --  part of everything else  --  RAPHAEL LORD I 'll listen . Go ahead . ANN CARR Your insolence to Uncle Avery  --  p. 96 RAPHAEL LORD I do wish you 'd worn those jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARR Your contemptuous manner toward him made me furious  --  RAPHAEL LORD I love Uncle Avery . ANN CARR Why do you insult him ? RAPHAEL LORD Do I ? ANN CARR Uncle Avery is a distinguished scholar . Intellectually you are a parvenu  --  and Uncle Avery is an aristocrat . RAPHAEL LORD He did n't seem to mind . ANN CARR I minded . RAPHAEL LORD Well , what if I do send those people down there ? ANN CARR I should still say that you 're insufferably arrogant , insufferably  --  RAPHAEL LORD What if I do do it  --  and I will do it  --  it will only prove that Uncle Avery had no right to tell me what I can do . ANN CARR ( Logically she finds herself , for the moment , in an impasse . She turns to other scores . Sitting at R. end of sofa ) Raphael , there 's a touch of charlatanism in everything you do . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm perfectly sincere . I may send a half a million people to Ariandos , and if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loveing half a million morons one does n't know is just funny to me . Hard enough to love the people one does know . The other is cant . Cant , like the politicians ' speeches  --  I love the French people  --  I love the common American man . I adore the poor .  --  What do speeches like that mean , if any ? p. 97 ANN CARR You 're certainly clever in justifying yourself  --  ! RAPHAEL LORD I expect to make a decent place of Ariandos  --  bathtubs and gardens , but I do it as an economic measure . I do it because it will save me trouble and insurrection in the future . I do it because it 'll be pleasanter for me to observe when I go down there . Most of all I do it because it 's a terrific job and I 'm probably the only man alive who could pull it off . But I do n't do it out of affection for an anonymous horde in the slums of fifty cities . They 're raw material , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANN CARR Blood and iron . RAPHAEL LORD There 's a lot to be said for blood and iron . If Russian Communism is a success , it 'll be because the leaders are first rate executioners ,  --  the first Utopians who knew how to handle machine-guns . ANN CARR And this is the boy who used to read Shelley aloud to me at Calvert  --  RAPHAEL LORD Why should n't I read Shelley ? Napoleon read Goethe . ANN CARR This is the boy who was ambitious to become a great scholar ! RAPHAEL LORD What makes you think I wo n't ? I 'm young yet . Silly divorce nowadays between scholarship and business . I shall be both . Francis Bacon . p. 98 ANN CARR ( Wryly ) I seem to have heard that before . RAPHAEL LORD You wait . Give me time . ANN CARR For years you 've been saying the same thing . But something always interferes . One scheme after another . Now it 's Ariandos  --  RAPHAEL LORD Ariandos is my last . Ariandos is my swansong . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concentration that I give to business , when I surround it with the same amazing  --  God ! Ann , it 's such a relief to talk to you . Why are you always at Westlands ? You know I 'm not a money-grubber , Ann . ANN CARR I have n't the faintest idea what you are  --  RAPHAEL LORD Ann , would you like the Nobel Prize ? I 'll get it for your birthday . I mean it . I 'll do it . Do n't you think I could make my mark in scholarship ? ANN CARR Of course you could if you wanted to , but do you want to ? It seems to me you 're more serious when you 're talking about business than when you 're talking about scholarship . RAPHAEL LORD That shows how superficial you are . ANN CARR Perhaps I am  --  Tell me , Raphael  --  RAPHAEL LORD What ? I 'll tell you anything . I 'm in a mood to tell you anything . p. 99 ANN CARR Why is Douglas so worried about Curtis Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's instinct is perfectly sound . ANN CARR Really ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . Maxwell hates me . ANN CARR I 've felt it . RAPHAEL LORD He 's just lying around the corner  --  waiting to knife me . ANN CARR Why do you employ him , then ? RAPHAEL LORD It amuses me . He 's safer where I can keep an eye on him . ANN CARR Then you 're not sending him down there to find sites for cities . RAPHAEL LORD No , merely to confirm him in the impression that I 'm an eccentric . ANN CARR And to confirm the rest of us in the impression that you are a philanthropist . RAPHAEL LORD You do n't expect me to be consistent , do you , Ann ? ANN CARR Why does Maxwell hate you ? RAPHAEL LORD What ? ANN CARR Why does he hate you ? Tell me that . RAPHAEL LORD It goes back to that night at Calvert . I foresaw that Sherman was going to die  --  heart , you know  --  I told him he must n't marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 ANN CARR You told him  --  you upset him , knowing his condition ? RAPHAEL LORD Well , Curtis was going to let him play some professional matches . He would never have survived them . ANN CARR He might never have played them . RAPHAEL LORD Well , he was going to just the same . ANN CARR Does that console you ? RAPHAEL LORD You remember that night  --  I had asked you to go away with me . You refused . I left you , never intending to see you again . I walked the streets . I had n't eaten all day , then I saw what was going to happen . I came back to the house . All the time I was in a sort of trance . ANN CARR Poor Sherman . RAPHAEL LORD Nothing could have saved him . It was inevitable . ANN CARR ( Rises and crosses to fireplace ) How can you ? How can you ? RAPHAEL LORD You forget this infallible gift of mine . ANN CARR ( Crossing to R. end of sofa ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It enables you to share a secret with God . I 'm a little surprised you permit even that partnership . p. 101 RAPHAEL LORD Might as well let God in on it ! ANN CARR ( A bit put out in her argument by his humor ) It 's incredible to me that you continue to believe this  --  literally  --  RAPHAEL LORD I 've proved it to myself . I 've tested it almost every day of my life . Take Ariandos , for instance . Every nation in the world is tapping the earth for oil . It 's the most intensely waged competition there is . And yet , I find this field . It 's been the same with everything I 've tried from that day five yearse ago when I borrowed Douglas ' inheritance to follow a hunch on the stock market . I knew when to buy . I knew the exact moment when to sell . Why was this given to me ? Where does it come from ? Why was I chosen ? I feel as apart from the common herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior . Well , there 's a price on superiority . I 'll pay it . ANN CARR Well , will you tell me what is my place in all this ? RAPHAEL LORD Inside spectator . I should think you 'd find it amusing . ANN CARR I do n't . The spectacle does n't amuse me . I see you all the time drawn in deeper into your Business schemes , getting more greedy , more selfish , more vindictive . You egotists never consider the other person 's ego . p. 102 RAPHAEL LORD We do when we have to . ANN CARR What about all your promises to me ? We were going to achieve things together , remake life together . RAPHAEL LORD Well , why should we bother to write books ? Let other people write them about us . ANN CARR Your life does n't touch mine at any point . Do you think I married you to be stuck away in a formal garden  --  to spend my life sitting on a rustic bench , making designs in the nice gravel with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my work . Now what am I ? An appendage to you . And what are you ? You do n't know yourself any more where the truth in you begins or ends . This place for the slums of the world to disgorge . Why are you slaughtering natives in Ariandos ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Deeply angry ) What 's that ? What did you say ? ANN CARR Yes . Yes . Do n't you think we know ? Do you think we 're blind ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Deadly calm ) You 've been reading Vining 's papers . ANN CARR It 'll be in Estabrook 's papers too . RAPHAEL LORD What do you know about it ? ANN CARR He spoke to Doctor Avery last night . p. 103 RAPHAEL LORD Oh ! He did ! Well , it 's thoroughly unimportant what that anemic high-brow , Estabrook , says about me . ANN CARR Is it ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . Only I forbid you to discuss my affairs in public . ANN CARR Do you ? Because your affairs wo n't bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't consider you competent to discuss my career . I do n't accept your standards . ANN CARR I do n't accept yours . I never have . I never will . Utopian machine-gunner ! Why do n't you come out with the truth ? ( WARN Curtain . ) RAPHAEL LORD If you want the truth I 'll tell you the truth . It 's that you do n't possess me entirely . That 's what 's eating you up , not the poor down-trodden natives in Ariandos . You want to fill my life  --  every cranny  --  every instant . Well , you wo n't . You ca n't . I have energies and imaginations outside and beyond you . Outside and beyond myself . You grudge me my greatness . You grudge me my vision because they do n't need you . ANN CARR Well , now I know where I am  --  RAPHAEL LORD I 'm not interested in your sentimental theories . I have to read this sort of puling stuff in the press and I wo n't have it in my own home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . ( There is a pause . He feels that he has gone too far . Shifts to charm ) You 're serious , are n't you ? ANN CARR Yes . So are you . RAPHAEL LORD What are we quarreling about ? ( He starts to kiss her . She turns away . In his anger he almost strikes her . AVERY enters L.2 . ) DR . AVERY It 's really a first ! RAPHAEL LORD Well , Doctor , how do you like your book ? DR . AVERY This will make me the envy of Calvert . RAPHAEL LORD ( As he goes up R. ) You see , I 'm not one of those rich men without culture . ( He exits R. ) DR . AVERY ( Crossing to ANN ) Look , Ann  --  Sixteen Forty-Two . ( He sees for the first time that something is wrong ) @x SCENE : The same . One year later . AT RISE : AVERY and LORD are talking . LORD is seated at L. of table L.C. and AVERY at R. There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with White Rock , etc . There is a drink poured for each of them . RAPHAEL LORD Finish your drink , Doctor . DR . AVERY Do you want me to make an exhibition of myself before the assembled scientists ? RAPHAEL LORD What are you going to talk to them about ? DR . AVERY I have n't the faintest idea . RAPHAEL LORD I 'll tell you why I telegraphed you to come , although it lets me down a bit to know that you had to come anyway to make a speech at a banquet . DR . AVERY I 'm glad to let you down . That 's what you need . RAPHAEL LORD It 's about Ann . DR . AVERY She 's well , is n't she ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . DR . AVERY It 's a great grief to me that she 's at Westlands . I assumed naturally that you would tell her that I was coming . p. 106 RAPHAEL LORD You can telephone her and drive out in the morining . Another drink ? Do . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to me as it is . If I drank a quarter of what you 've absorbed since we 've been sitting here , I should be what my students call pie-eyed . RAPHAEL LORD Oh , drink does n't affect me . I 'm immune to it . One of my little peculiarities . DR . AVERY You transcend time . Are you above physiology ? RAPHAEL LORD I never condescend to physiology . ( AVERY laughs . ) Why do n't you make me the subject of your paper , Doctor ? DR . AVERY Perhaps I have . RAPHAEL LORD It 's the only thing that would bring me to your damn lecture . DR . AVERY What a passion for hearing yourself discussed . Well , come along if you like  --  I promise you you 'll understand very little of it . I 'm being very abstruse tonight . RAPHAEL LORD I bet I could . I 've been reading like hell lately . DR . AVERY Have you ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . Science . Philosophy . Things I have n't seen  --  names I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while I get a gleam that illuminates me . Me , myself , I mean . p. 107 DR . AVERY The hypochondriac searching for symptoms  --  Well ? Have you found it ? RAPHAEL LORD Precious little . One fellow  --  a Frenchman  --  juggles with time . He imagines a world in which the entire past is spread out simultaneous with the present  --  " Like a fan , " he says . That made me think . Suppose the entire future is spread out like that too  --  and I am the one human being  --  the one unlucky human being in the world  --  DR . AVERY Unlucky ? A year ago you were revelling in this distinction . RAPHAEL LORD Yes , that was a year ago . There 's not much thrill in it any more . DR . AVERY Really ! RAPHAEL LORD No . There 's no contest . Everything 's so clearly laid out  --  so simple  --  so easy . Up to a few months ago I went through the motions of routine . At my desk every morning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my subordinates , I asked their opinions . But lately I 've lost patience . I hardly go down town any more . I 've simply relegated duties to the heads of departments . If they do their jobs at all business will go on through sheer inertia . DR . AVERY The executive 's paradise  --  RAPHAEL LORD No . It 's not the same thing  --  You 'll find Douglas for instance very much upset over a man called Maxwell . Oh , you remember him , do n't you ? p. 108 DR . AVERY Of course . RAPHAEL LORD Maxwell 's been laying an elaborate scheme to sell me out to some business rivals headed by Larrabee Fremont . If I thought there were any little chance of Maxwell 's succeeding I might get some kick out of it . DR . AVERY Supposing Maxwell did succeed . Would n't that disturb your illusion of infallibility ? RAPHAEL LORD Illusion ! It has never failed me . DR . AVERY Magnificent ? ! RAPHAEL LORD I 've known all about Maxwell from the very beginning . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? RAPHAEL LORD At the last moment things will fail him  --  He will be helpless . DR . AVERY If there were some way I could help Maxwell I 'd do it . Just to see what you 'd say after your debacle . RAPHAEL LORD ( With a large gesture ) Go as far as you like , Doctor . DR . AVERY You 'd probably wiggle out of it . I knew a charming lady once who got it into her head that the world was going to end on a certain Wednesday . She went around saying goodbye to her friends and providing them with candles against the preliminary darkness . On Thursday I called her up to felicitate with her on our mutual survival . She was perfectly undisturbed . She explained to me that her Wednesday was not my Wednesday  --  she went by a calendar entirely personal to herself . p. 109 RAPHAEL LORD You class me among the neurotic females ? DR . AVERY I class you among the neurotic males  --  a company not without its immortals . RAPHAEL LORD That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly to a close and changes the subject ) This is why I 've sent for you . I have to leave Ann . I Ca n't go on . DR . AVERY What 's happened ? RAPHAEL LORD I 'm afraid for Ann . DR . AVERY Afraid ! What of ? RAPHAEL LORD There 's something hanging over me and I do n't want to involve Ann . DR . AVERY This is the merest bogey-chasing . What 's hanging over you ? What are you afraid of ? RAPHAEL LORD The future . DR . AVERY Why should you fear it more than I ? More than anyone ? RAPHAEL LORD Because  --  I shall know it and you wo n't . I 'll see it  --  and you wo n't . Whatever life holds for me  --  I 'll see the first long shadow . I 'll have to wait  --  till I catch up to it . Can you imagine  --  that waiting ? DR . AVERY My dear boy  --  ! p. 110 RAPHAEL LORD No , listen . How can I make you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness in which you live which makes life possible for you . You 're like motorists driving in a thick fog at night  --  your lights show you only a few inches at a time  --  but you are confident that the way is clear . In that confidence you live . But for me there is no fog . If you knew how I envy you  --  your unconsciousness of the future . To me  --  it 's a charged present , ambush ! What will it be ? Whom will it touch ? That 's it , Doctor , whom will it touch ? DR . AVERY I 've always thought that people who believe in this sort of possibility belong to an outside fringe of the mind  --  not to be counted among adults . People who consult astrologers and read horoscopes  --  that absurd crew with their silly little charts  --  who think they can outmaneuver Destiny , steal the Creator 's plans  --  like spies in a sort of cosmic melodrama . RAPHAEL LORD You take Ann away from me . It 's better if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? RAPHAEL LORD I sense this shadow hanging over her .  --  Something  --  and that I shall be the cause of it . DR . AVERY You do n't understand yourself . She frustrates you and so you think-you see something threatening her . p. 111 RAPHAEL LORD No . No . Will you take her back to Calvert ? Will you do this for me ? DR . AVERY Yes , I will . RAPHAEL LORD She 'll be all right with you . DR . AVERY But what will you do ? RAPHAEL LORD I do n't know . I 'll go away to Ariandos . Oh , I 'm so immensely relieved I ca n't tell you . DR . AVERY I 'm greatly disappointed , Raphael . I should have foreseen something like this would happen  --  DOUGLAS CARR ( Enters L.1 . He is greatly troubled  --  very keyed up ) Oh , Raphael  --  Doctor Avery  --  I did n't know you were in town  --  DR . AVERY How are you , Douglas ? DOUGLAS CARR Well , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but AVERY is an outsider to him at this moment . ) Where in hell have you been , Raphael ? I 've telephoned here and to Westlands . For two blessed days I 've been trying to get hold of you . RAPHAEL LORD What 's the matter ? DOUGLAS CARR God , Rafe , it 's awful . Maxwell resigned today . p. 112 RAPHAEL LORD That 's too bad . DOUGLAS CARR He 's gone over openly to the Fremont people . RAPHAEL LORD What of it ? DOUGLAS CARR Imagine how sure he must have been to have done that . RAPHAEL LORD What of it ? DOUGLAS CARR But look what 's happened ! I tell you we 're up against it . I do n't know what you really could do now  --  and you do n't do anything . You 're never in your office . You sit there drinking as if you did n't know what 's happened . DR . AVERY What has happened ? DOUGLAS CARR ( Almost screaming ) He 's facing ruin ! The Fremont people have bribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug up fake leases supposed to belong to some old families down there . Well , they antedate our leases . What can we do ? Ramenez  --  and Ramenez is the government  --  says our leases are n't legal . With him against us we 'll never get anywhere . We 'll never so much as get one more well started . RAPHAEL LORD Ramenez is a figure-head . How long do you think he 'll last ? DOUGLAS CARR Have you got anyone down there  --  anyone you can trust , looking after Ramenez ' successor ? Maxwell had Fremont 's money when he went down there  --  and he used it  --  You have n't anbody  --  they 're all Fremont 's people . The trouble is , you do n't seem to care what 's happening . Something 's stopping you . God knows what it is ! p. 113 DR . AVERY Is it so bad ? DOUGLAS CARR Half his holdings have been leased by Ramenez to the Fremonts . I had a cable today from Warren . RAPHAEL LORD What did he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . RAPHAEL LORD ( Glancing at it ) It 's too long  --  what 's the gist of it ? DOUGLAS CARR The gist of it is that the big deposits are on the properties that Fremont now holds . Oh , we can fight this out legally but by the time we ever got a court decision where would we be ? Besides the news will break at any moment . What do you think will happen then  --  when it 's out that you sold stock on properties to which you had no clear title ? The bottom 'll drop out of everything , that 's all  --  the stockholders 'll have a panic  --  it 'll be like a run on a bank . There 'll be no stopping it  --  God Knows what . DR . AVERY What about this ? RAPHAEL LORD It will never happen . DOUGLAS CARR How are you going to stop it ? RAPHAEL LORD It will never happen . DOUGLAS CARR I tell you it 's happening . That 's what you said the last time I saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He turns to AVERY in despair ) This is what I 've been up against all the time  --  for months . I do n't know what to do any more . It 's this terrible apathy . I simply ca n't move him . I tell you it 's awful . " It 'll be all right "  --  that 's all I ever get out of him . You can imagine how set it all is when Maxwell gives up a fifty-thousand-dollar job to  --  p. 114 A BUTLER ( Enters L.1 . ) Mr. Maxwell to see Mr. Lord . DOUGLAS CARR Maxwell ! RAPHAEL LORD Tell him to come in . ( BUTLER exits L.1 . ) DOUGLAS CARR You 're going to see him ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . I sent for him . ( To AVERY , who rises ) Do n't go , Doctor . DR . AVERY I 've got to go to that awful dinner . Douglas , if there 's anything I can do , let me know . RAPHAEL LORD You might try to get Westlands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . AVERY All right . I 'll try and get her from the hotel . ( Exits L.1 . ) DOUGLAS CARR I 'll be back later . RAPHAEL LORD All right . ( DOUGLAS exits L.1 . LORD , left alone , prepares a glass , etc. , for CURTIS . ) CURTIS MAXWELL ( Enters L.1 . ) You sent for me . RAPHAEL LORD Yes . ( He closes the doors and crosses back to table R. ) Have a drink ? p. 115 CURTIS MAXWELL No , thanks . RAPHAEL LORD Oh , do . CURTIS MAXWELL All right . RAPHAEL LORD ( Hands him a drink ) Sit down . Happy days ! ( They both sit , LORD at R. and CURTIS at L. of table . ) I hear you 've resigned . CURTIS MAXWELL Yes . RAPHAEL LORD I sent for you before I knew that you had resigned . I sent for you to make you an offer . I still make it  --  sincerely . CURTIS MAXWELL What 's your proposition ? RAPHAEL LORD I sent for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to make you a partner . CURTIS MAXWELL That 's very generous . RAPHAEL LORD It is , indeed ! Well ? CURTIS MAXWELL No . RAPHAEL LORD It may be a bigger offer than you at the moment think ! CURTIS MAXWELL I still decline with thanks . ( His courtesy , over-elaborate , has an undertone of insolence . ) RAPHAEL LORD Well , that 's that . Another drink ? p. 116 CURTIS MAXWELL No , thank you . ( There is a pause . ) Have you anything else to say to me ? RAPHAEL LORD No , that 's all . ( He rises and crosses down R. ) I 'm sorry you wo n't accept my offer . ( He takes a cigarette from table and lights it as he crosses ) Good afternoon . ( There is a pause . CURTIS rises and follows him down R. ) Good afternoon . CURTIS MAXWELL ( Can scarceley believe that he is being let go like this . He has come there intending to be canny , to evade , to parry . LORD 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) Your offer ! Your bribe , you mean . RAPHAEL LORD I beg your pardon . CURTIS MAXWELL You gave me this job in the first place to keep me quiet . Now you offer me a partnership to save your skin ! RAPHAEL LORD ( Casually ) Oh , no , Maxwell . CURTIS MAXWELL Your thought a lousy job would make me forget what you did to my brother . RAPHAEL LORD A lousy job ! You know fifty thousand dollars a year was n't bad , Maxwell . And now I offer you more . This posthumous devotion to your brother does n't impress me . You seem to have forgotten that you were willing to let him play a dozen matches for money . p. 117 CURTIS MAXWELL ( Simmering down  --  wily again ) You offer me half of Ariandos , do you ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes . CURTIS MAXWELL You know the way I feel about you . And yet you offer me half of what you think you 've got . Why ? RAPHAEL LORD I regret what happened to your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside my intention  --  CURTIS MAXWELL You planned it  --  just the way it happened . God , how it worked out for you . Your luck ! RAPHAEL LORD LUCK ! There 's nothing to be gained by this . I 'm sorry you wo n't accept my offer . Good afternoon . ( He is not ironic  --  very tired . ) CURTIS MAXWELL Your offer ! RAPHAEL LORD Yes , my offer . CURTIS MAXWELL Your offer ! I love that ! Tomorrow this time you wo n't be worth the powder to blow you to hell . RAPHAEL LORD Are you sure of that ? CURTIS MAXWELL Yes . And so are you . It 's too late for bluffing now . You know it damn well or you would n't have sent for me after I 'd kicked you over . RAPHAEL LORD Well , what are you waiting for ? p. 118 CURTIS MAXWELL Tomorrow this time you 'll be a national scandal . The newspapers 'll be full of how you robbed twenty thousand stockholders . The biggest bubble the Street 's ever known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a great time with you  --  photographs of this house  --  Photographs of Westlands , bought with the widows ' and orphans ' money . It 'll be a riot . Raphael Lord , the mushroom-financier . A riot  --  You offer me half your business ! Well , that 's very generous ! Half your jail sentence , maybe ! RAPHAEL LORD I really thought you were cleverer than this . CURTIS MAXWELL This bluff wo n't get you anything . It 's too late for that . RAPHAEL LORD Not so quick , Maxwell . Discipline ! CURTIS MAXWELL For four years I 've taken your orders  --  waited hours for you while you got good and ready to see me . I 've gone to Westlands and waited a whole day for a five-minute conference while you showed your guests your rose gardens . Discipline ! RAPHAEL LORD Did you actually think I did n't know what you 've been up to all this time ? I 've known almost from the very beginning . CURTIS MAXWELL That 's likely . RAPHAEL LORD It must be obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this time ? You must be wondering why I have n't done anything . Well , I 'll tell you . I wanted to see how long I could wait and still beat you . How close I could shave the risk ! It 's rather pretty . It 's even beautiful . Have you any sense for spectacle , Maxwell ? p. 119 CURTIS MAXWELL Look here . There is nothing you could say that will help you . You 're hemmed in . You do n't know how close yet , but you 'll find out  --  and sooner than you 've any idea of  --  RAPHAEL LORD Do you think I do n't know that the reports you sent up from Ariandos were faked ? That you and Fremont were bribing Ramenez ? CURTIS MAXWELL Prove it ! RAPHAEL LORD I wo n't have to prove it  --  luckily for Fremont . CURTIS MAXWELL In twenty-four hours your name will be mud , Lord . RAPHAEL LORD In twenty-four hours Fremont will have transferred his interests in Ariandos back to me from whom he stole them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me ? Does n't he regard my silence as ominous ? Tell me , Maxwell , does n't he keep asking , " What about this man Lord ? What about this man Lord ? " CURTIS MAXWELL He 's not in the least concerned about you , Lord . Fremont 's a big man with enormous interests . RAPHAEL LORD He 's a small man with interests that are too big for him . No , Fremont is n't calm . Although you told him not to worry , he 's left a houseful of guests on Long Island and come to town . He 'll let you down , Maxwell . Decision is difficult for Fremont . But in his heart he distrusts you . He 'll let you down . p. 120 CURTIS MAXWELL All this wo n't help you a damn . The whole things 's set . Even if every word you said were true , things have gone so far that you could n't possibly get out  --  RAPHAEL LORD Fremont 's in his office . And your worthy cousin , Mullin , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fremont wo n't see him  --  so Cousin Mullin is sitting there chewing a cigar . He 's getting pretty nervous  --  Mullin . CURTIS MAXWELL Do n't worry about Fremont . You 'd better think about saving your own neck . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm inside Fremont 's mind . I 'm inside it and I tell you it 's alive with indecision , with fear  --  with distrust of you . CURTIS MAXWELL You 've had some information . RAPHAEL LORD I 've had no information . Suppose I telephone Fremont ? CURTIS MAXWELL I doubt if he 'd even answer you . RAPHAEL LORD Suppose I threaten him with a law-suit  --  publicity ? Suppose I tie him up with Vining and his yellow press . Vining with you  --  you with Mullin  --  Fremont with Mullin  --  Fremont smuggling guns to a bandit South American president ! Fremont who contributes to the building of cathedrals . Fremont , the connoisseur , the art patron , the aristocrat . How do you think he 'll feel when he hears his name being yelled through the streets ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 121 CURTIS MAXWELL Would n't make a bit of difference . We 've got Fremont hooked . He could n't back out if he wanted to . You 're done , Lord . You 'll see it damn soon . RAPHAEL LORD All these possibilities are crowding in on him . Supposing there 's a revolution in Ariandos and he has to deal with another Ramenez ? Supposing Ramenez holds him up for more money ? Then there 's me . There 's always me . Fremont 's never met me but he 's heard things about me and in all this time I 've been so silent . Why do n't I do something ? Why do n't I say something ? My silence has been right  --  magnificently right . Fremont 's scared . You and Vining have done some pretty raw things in this deal and you 've had to convey this to Fremont to keep him in when he wanted to back out . Have n't you ? CURTIS MAXWELL It 's a lie ! RAPHAEL LORD It 's the truth ! Why should I get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . ( The PHONE rings . ) That 's Fremont now . CURTIS MAXWELL Fremont ? RAPHAEL LORD Yes , Fremont . CURTIS MAXWELL The hell it 's Fremont . What are you talking about ? ( The PHONE continues to ring . ) RAPHAEL LORD Answer it ! p. 122 CURTIS MAXWELL ( Crossing to phone ) Hello  --  I 'm speaking for Mr. Lord  --  What 's that ? RAPHAEL LORD Tell Mr. Fremont he 'll hear from me when I get ready . ( To himself ) I suppose Doctor Avery would call this a coincidence . CURTIS MAXWELL ( At telephone ) Mr. Lord ca n't see Mr. Fremont today . He will communicate with him . ( Hanging up and turning to LORD as to an oracle ) What 's going to happen ? RAPHAEL LORD ( Mechanically ) I 'll tell you  --  CURTIS MAXWELL You 'll buy Fremont out ? RAPHAEL LORD I 'll pay him a fancy price for his buccaneering  --  CURTIS MAXWELL Pay him  --  RAPHAEL LORD A royalty on every barrel of oil that comes out of Ariandos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself dealing with me instead of with Fremont . I do n't think he 'll mind , do you ? CURTIS MAXWELL How did you know that was Fremont ? p. 123 RAPHAEL LORD How did I know about Vining ? How did I know about you ? ( He says this not arrogantly but with a sort of despairing recklessness . He feels himself caught in a tight hand and that what he says now ca n't matter . ) CURTIS MAXWELL Sherman  --  how did you know about Sherman ? RAPHAEL LORD How did I know about Sherman ? CURTIS MAXWELL Tell me that . RAPHAEL LORD I knew . ( ANN enters L.1 . Crosses back of table to up C. and stops when she hears CURTIS . ) CURTIS MAXWELL You killed my brother  --  You killed my brother  --  ( Rushes out L.1 . ) RAPHAEL LORD I thought you were at Westlands . ( ANN does not reply but starts off R. LORD crosses to chair R. of table L.C. ) I did my best for Maxwell . Well , what if he is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Who has come back into room from alcove , having taken off her hat and coat ) Oh , Raphael ! RAPHAEL LORD Am I never to be forgiven that night ? ( He sits R. of table L.C. ) p. 124 ANN CARR ( Having put her hat and coat on table R. , crosses to above him at his L. ) Let me talk to you . RAPHAEL LORD If only something would happen  --  Just now with Maxwell I told him things  --  things he knew no one could have told me . I heard myself saying things I did n't know myself . When I began talking the words came to me  --  it was as if someone else was speaking . There was a momont when I prayed I might be wrong , but I knew I could n't be . I felt such an awareness that I could have crushed him with the sheer force of my mind . The same dreadful clarity surrounds everything I do . I can no longer endure this light . I am blinded by it . Ann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARR I knew this was going to happen . I 've been watching this happen . ( She takes his head in her arms  --  strokes his hair . He is lulled by a momentary comfort . ) Listen , Raphael dearest . RAPHAEL LORD There 's no way out . ANN CARR What 's the matter ? Here you are harassed and tortured . By what ? Over what ? You 've given yourself up to some power that 's consuming you . You 've denied me . Raphael , turn to me . Trust me . RAPHAEL LORD It 's no use , Ann . p. 125 ANN CARR Raphael ! Trust me . Listen to me . RAPHAEL LORD ( Thrusting her away ) It 's no use . If once  --  if only once I had been wrong . But no  --  never . I 'm haunted . Nothing can save me  --  not you  --  not anybody . ANN CARR So this is where your brilliant career has brought you ! Into a grim , farcical impasse where you can neither live nor die . RAPHAEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cruellylighted world  --  with no merciful shadow  --  no darkness . ANN CARR ( Crossing to his R. and on her knees ) My love  --  is it nothing to you ? RAPHAEL LORD No . ANN CARR No peace , no rest , no hope ? RAPHAEL LORD No No . Why does n't it touch me ? Why does n't it reach me ? Why do n't I feel it ? Why do n't I hear it ? ANN CARR Because you do n't listen . You wo n't . You do n't look at me . You do n't see me . Even now , in this moment when you need me . It 's yourself  --  that 's all you ever see  --  Your own voice is all you ever hear  --  RAPHAEL LORD I am alone . p. 126 ANN CARR Is it my fault ? I 've tried . I 've begged . I 've prostrated myself . What can I do against your egotism ? What can anyone do against it ? All the words I know  --  simplicity , strength , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to you  --  nothing . Less than nothing . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm caught in a blind alley and you fling symbols at me  --  ANN CARR How can I speak to you ? What are your symbols ? Death and destruction  --  RAPHAEL LORD Do n't say that  --  ANN CARR Yes . Yes . Yes . Death and destruction . ( BOTH rise . ) You destroy whoever comes in your way . Have n't I heard you say you hate me ? Have n't I seen it in your eyes ? Those you ca n't conquer , you annihilate . You like to talk about remote Utopias , but those near you  --  you kill  --  ! RAPHAEL LORD ( Crossing to fireplace ) Do n't say that ! ( ANN 'S words have put nakedly his subconscious fears . ) ANN CARR ( Crossing to him to front of sofa ) I want to bring you back . RAPHAEL LORD ( Recoiling from her ) I want you to go away from me  --  go away from me . I never want to see you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ANN CARR Why ? RAPHAEL LORD I 'm afraid . ANN CARR Of what ? RAPHAEL LORD Just now I felt myself on the verge of something dreadful . ANN CARR What ? RAPHAEL LORD Just now when you said those words  --  those near you , you kill  --  I felt somehow I 'd heard those words before . ANN CARR My love  --  my love . RAPHAEL LORD Ann , I want you to go away from me . ( She comes toward him . ) Yet what good will that do you ? Nothing can save you . That 's the hell I 've found . If I must destroy you  --  I must . Ann , pity me ! ANN CARR I 'm not afraid . I love you . ( He stops suddenly , staring straight ahead of him . ANN is in terror ) What are you staring at ? RAPHAEL LORD ( After a pause ) The end . I 've seen the end . Why was this sent to me ? Of course I see it now . I 'll kill myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEWSBOYS have started shouting : " Extra  --  The Ariandos Bubble  --  The Downfall of Raphael Lord . " ) I see what I have to do . Break this chain of circumstance that 's forcing me to kill you . ( ANN goes nearer to him . ) Do n't come near me . I must do it to save you . Do n't be afraid . Ann , I want you to leave me now . p. 128 ANN CARR No . RAPHAEL LORD I beg you . ANN CARR No . RAPHAEL LORD This is the only way to save you . I 've got to . ( He rushes past her toward library L.2 . When he reaches up C. , DOUGLAS enters from L.1. with newspaper . The SHOUTS in the streets are now loud and very distinct . ) DOUGLAS CARR ( Stopping LORD ) Vining 's published . RAPHAEL LORD What ? DOUGLAS CARR Vining 's published . RAPHAEL LORD ( In his frenzy taking DOUGLAS by the throat and shaking him ) What ? DOUGLAS CARR Vining 's published . What did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD Shut up ! I do n't believe it . DOUGLAS CARR It 's in the evening papers . The Ariandos Bubble . My God , Raphael , why did n't you do something ? RAPHAEL LORD But I saw that tomorrow  --  DOUGLAS CARR Tomorrow ? Why did n't you do something today ? ( TELEPHONE begins ringing. ) p. 129 RAPHAEL LORD Tomorrow I saw myself and Fremont  --  ( Outside the CALLS are still clear and loud . The TELEPHONE continues to ring . ) DOUGLAS CARR ( Indicating the phone ) It must be the reporters . ANN CARR Answer the phone downstairs , Douglas . Say there 's no one here . ( DOUGLAS exits L.1 . ) RAPHAEL LORD ( Oblivious to all this turmoil and as one noting a curious phenomenon ) Tomorrow I saw myself and Fremont  --  I heard Fremont saying : " Very well , Mr. Lord "  --  I mentioned the sum , the exact sum  --  I heard Fremont say : " I consider that quite satisfactory , Mr. Lord "  --  I heard the words  --  the intonation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Fremont but I know he has a lisp  --  " the thum quite thatithfactory  --  " I heard him so distinctly  --  I heard him say it . Did I ? Did I ? ANN CARR Raphael , darling . I 'm so glad . I 'm so glad . RAPHAEL LORD ( Not seeing nor hearing ) I saw Fremont so distinctly . ANN CARR But you were n't to see Fremont until tomorrow . RAPHAEL LORD I know . I know . And it will never take place ! p. 130 ANN CARR But do n't you see , Raphael ? This sets you free . RAPHAEL LORD Maxwell and Vining . I was sure  --  ANN CARR A moment ago you were praying for this to happen . Well , it has happened . Your gift has failed you . RAPHAEL LORD Tomorrow half a continent  --  ANN CARR Thank God it 's happened . RAPHAEL LORD The Ariandos Bubble  --  ( The CALLS are now becoming more distant  --  but at this moment there is a definite call : " Extra  --  extra  --  The Ariandos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns in the direction from which this is coming and listens . He crosses and sits L. end of sofa . The actuality has at last reached him . ) ANN CARR ( Following him to sofa and sitting on his R. ) Let me draw you close . Let me hold you . Let me shield you . RAPHAEL LORD Vining published . I was so sure he would n't . This is the first time , Ann . The first time . ANN CARR You thought you were infallible . Well , that is n't human , Raphael . You should never have assumed it . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm like everybody else , then ! p. 131 ANN CARR Oh , my dear . RAPHAEL LORD I 'm nothing . ANN CARR You prayed for this release . RAPHAEL LORD I 'll have to get used to this . What am I now ? What have I now ? ANN CARR You have me  --  You have yourself  --  Your real self . RAPHAEL LORD But what am I in my own eyes ? One of the herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . It is n't possible . I do n't believe it ! ANN CARR Do n't you see , Raphael , now you have a chance to be something for the first time ? You were willing to die for me . What about living for me ? Is that so much harder you ca n't face it ? Have you no pride , no anger , no belief in your own character or in my love ? ( She is holding him in her arms . ) RAPHAEL LORD But you do n't understand . A liar , a charlatan , a failure . That 's what I 'll be before everybody  --  before the world . I could stand that  --  I could endure that if I myself  --  It 's the first time in my life that in my own mind  --  Even when I begged meals on country roads , when I slept on park benches , I felt proud and contemptuous of those around me . But now  --  What am I ? What am I ? p. 132 ANN CARR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to you , so near to you , so hopeful of you . Now I can break through the fallacy , the lie in your career . You thought your little calculations included life and death . Thank God this lie is exploded . Now we can get away from all this lying and trickery and bloodshed . Now you can face yourself , your own possibilities , your own strength . This , oh , Raphael darling , do n't you see ? This sets you free . RAPHAEL LORD Sets me free  --  ANN CARR Why pursue your meanest talent and let your finest wither ? RAPHAEL LORD Sets me free . My own possibilities . My own strength . You 're right , Ann . You 're right . Ann . You 're right . You 're right . ANN CARR Thank God you see it ! I bless those men who 've beaten you . I bless those newsboys crying your defeat . ( The CALLS , which have been getting lower and lower , now stop . ) RAPHAEL LORD Defeat ? What defeat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to you . Thank God for your defeat . RAPHAEL LORD Defeat ? You mean they 've beaten me ? They have n't beaten me . Because of my gift , I waited , I temporized . I let this happen . I relied on my gift instead of on myself . You 're right , Ann . This sets me free . ( He rises and crosses down L. ) Of all the things that have ever happened to me , this is the luckiest . Now , for the first time , I 'm ready for my destiny . How could I have been so foolish as to rely on something outside myself when all the time I had my own talent , my own brain , my own unconquerable will ! p. 133 ANN CARR Raphael ! RAPHAEL LORD Now my untrammeled genius will live . ( Crosses to C. ) Because of my gift I showed them mercy . Now I 'll show no mercy . I 'll fight them with my own unaided strength .

ANN CARR Yes , that is what I want . RAPHAEL LORD Do n't you think I can rise up out of all this ? ANN CARR I 'm sure you can . RAPHAEL LORD These men are trying to rob me . ANN CARR Between you and them there is very little to choose that I can see . A half-dozen greedy men squabbling over a possession that does n't belong by right to any one of you . Revolution ! Bloodshed ! What have I to do with all this ? RAPHAEL LORD If I accept defeat at the hands of these men what will become of me ? p. 134 ANN CARR ( Crossing to table back of sofa ) Fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her hat and coat . ) RAPHAEL LORD ( Coming into the room again ) What do you mean ? ANN CARR I 'm leaving you . RAPHAEL LORD You ca n't . ANN CARR I know now that I can . RAPHAEL LORD I wo n't let you go . Let me fight this out this once . ANN CARR No . RAPHAEL LORD ( Having gone to above table L. and picked up phone ) Whitehall-nine thousand . I 'll make a scandal out of this that will shake the whole country . I 'll drive that effeminate weakling Fremont to his grave . ANN CARR Raphael , if you go on with this it 's the end for us . RAPHAEL LORD Is this Whitehall-nine thousand ? ANN CARR Do you realize what you 're doing ? ( WARN Curtain . ) RAPHAEL LORD Yes . I realize what I 'm doing . ( Speaking in the phone again ) This is Raphael Lord speaking . I want to speak to Mr. Fremont . You know damn well he 's in and if he knows what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANN CARR Raphael , I mean what I say . RAPHAEL LORD I am what I am . I ca n't change .

ANN CARR Well , I do n't know . ( She exits L. I , closing the door behind her . ) RAPHAEL LORD ( Shouting ofter her ) Ann ! Ann ! ( He is aware of an irreplaceable loss  --  he takes refuge in anger ) All right ! Go on ! I do n't need you . I do n't need anyone . ( Speaking into phone again ) Hello . Mr. Fremont .
