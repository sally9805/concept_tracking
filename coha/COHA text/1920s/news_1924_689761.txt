txt The Repub . Iicans of the House , in caucus tonight , decided to give the Administration tax reduction program the right of way over the Soldiers ' Bonus bill in their legislative program . The caucus refused to advance the bonus measure ahead of the tax program , insisted that the Mellon bill receive priority and urged the Ways and Means Committee to report tax redu , - tion to the House not later than Feb . I I , after which that committee may proee ? d with the consideration of the bonus bill . After a long and vigorous debat , during which every ' aspect of the situs , ton : fro* , toe .. yleatpoints of nation : , ' needs and party . advantage . was , 01 , - sidered. the caucus shortly before 1 ' - o'clock adopted a resolution tee-that ef feet , offered by Representative Long worth of Ohio , the floor leader of tL ?

When the Longworth motion was adopted without a roll call , only tyro or three " nays " were heard . Representative Fish of New York offered an amendment that the committee should be directed to report a bonus bill by Feb. 25 . A roll call was taken and the proposal was defeated by 109 to ST .

The heaviest vote , which was on Ben ; ? resentative Fish 's proposal that a bonus bill be reported by Feb. 25 , was0196 . There are 225 Republican members of the House . Mr. Longworth said that he was willing to accept the Fairchild proposal to bring the bonus measure forward at as early a date as possible , but - this was opposed by the bonus bloc , which wanted a specific date set for reporting the bill . Mr. Longworth appealed for the solidarity of the Republican Party and said that tax reduction legislation would benefit every class , while bonus payments would aid only a small seQ . tion of the nation .

Representative Longworth , the majority leader , offered his resolution in favor of priority for the tax reduction program . He asked that the Ways and Means Committee be instructed to devote all of its time tothe consideration of the tax bill am &; complete that measure before taking up the bonus . There was a general debate in which Mr. Longworth insisted strongly that it was the duty of the Republicans to support the program of the President in favor of the early enactment of tax reduction . Those figuring prominently in the debate , besides Messrs . Longworth and Fish , were Messrs . Fairchild of New . York , . of Illinois , a member of the Military Affairs Committee ; who introduced the bonus bill at , the request of the soldier bloc ; Mills of New York , who is a member of the Ways , and Means Committee ; Madden of Illinois , Chairman of the Appropriations ' Committee ' Murphy of Illinois , and , Schafer , a Wisconsin Radical , who tried to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed first so as to enable the House to ascertain what room there would be for tax reduction .

Copies of the Fish resolution were made public in advance , but for some reason , not explained , Mr. Fish is understood to have withheld his resolution , pending a Vote nn his proposal to amend the Longworth resolution in favor of having the Ways and Means Committee report a bonus measure by Feb. 25 . The resolution as drafted by Mr. Fish for presentation to the caucus , but . Which , he said before the caucus , was Subject to revision . read : " Resolved that the Republican conference of the House of Representatives is In favor of a reduction in taxes substantially equal to the total amount recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury , and is also in favor of adjusted compensation for the veterans of the World War ; that the passage of this legislation is consistent with such reduction in taxes in view of the announced surplus of 929,000,000 In the Treasury and the proposed red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated in the President 's budget message , including a proposed saving of 518,000,000 in the Veterans Bureau , and further on account of the payment oft the interest and amortization on the British debt amounting to $161,000,000 annually for the first ten years and approximately $115.000.000 annually for the next fifty-two years . " New Fight on Soldier Bloc . Bonus legislation is dead in this Congress , in the opinion of Administration leaders as the result of the caucus action . The decision is held to show conclusively how the public demand for relief from war-time tax burdens is affecting Congress . Leaders said tonight that they had promises from men , members who were pledged to the bonus last year , to Vote against it in sufficient numbers to uphold the expected veto in the Senate and within twenty-five votes to sustain the veto in the House . What the politicians in the Republican Party are now trying to do is to shelve the bonus plan in the Ways and Means Committee so as to prevent the members going on record in this Presidential year . Public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucus action so strongly as to strengthen their hands for several other moves that will be taken soon to smother the bonus completely . If the country shows Its approval in letters and telegrams to the plan reporting a tax bill which will reduce taxes to preclude a bonus , this will be regarded as notice to the Administration leaders to make other contemplated moves . That the tax bill will follow substantially the Mellon lines , except perhaps that the surtaxes will not be reduced - as low as ' 25 per cent , is the conclusion of the Administration leaders who have been working on the taxbonus situation . " The bonus can not be passed unless the Democrats unite with the Radical Republicans , " said an Administration Flouse l " ader tonight . " We do not believ ? that the Democrats will be able to play polities so far as to formulate a tal bill which reduces taxes just far enough to take care of a bonus . " State Sharing Move Planned . Some of the Republican leaders are convinced that the Democrats have no well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to show their stand for a bonus without assuming the responsibility to pass it . In order to test the Democrats and in the hope of Milting the Bonus bill a compromise bonus plan will be thrown into the struggle when the Tax bill appears . This plan will provide for a Federal aid bonus , following the lines of Federal aid to States for building roads . The plan of States receiving 50 per cent . of the cost of building roads from the Federal Government was devised when the Democrats were in control ' of all branches of the Government Since it is called a Democratic policy , the Republicans say that Democrats can not consistently reject it as a. means of paying a bonus . Under this plan all States which elect to pay bonuses in conjunction with the Federal Government will be required to pay 50 per cent of the cost of the bonuses to their citizens , the Federal Government supplying the remainder when the State Legislatures appropriate . States which have already paid bonuses are behind the movement States which pay more than 1F5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonuses . If the present bonus bill went through , these States would have to pay a much greater sum in taxation , while Southern States and some of the smaller States would escape in part .
