 | AFRICA , once known as the Dark Continent , still has a few ( lark corners , but most of them are relatively small and , with one notable exception , no large area remains which is not under European influence . This is the ancient independent Empire of Ethiopia , which sits aloof on its elevated plateau , unconquered , little known , and almost unsung . Its autonomous position , however , is not for lack of interest , since it is larger than the Republic of France , it has a delightful and healthful climate , and its economic resources have large possibilities . It ' is rather because it has natural strategic advantages of location and because it is inhabited by a wonderfully patriotic and warlike people , who have defended it against all comers . If we are not too particular in our analogies , Ethiopia might be called the Tibet of Africa . It has no Dalai Lama and no forbidden city of Lhasa , with its monasteries , but it does have a numerous religious people , ancient and isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continent . It is not now exactly a closed territory in the way that Tibet is , but it has been practically closed for long periods in the past and foreign travel within its borders has always been very limited . ' In order to enter it , one must ask permission of the Ethiopians ( Abyssinians ) themselves , rather than of some European power . With Afghanistan and Siam , it is one of the three absolute monarchies left in the world . PEOPLED AT THE DAWN OP HISTORY The beginnings of Ethiopia go back to times of myth and legend . Unlike Egypt , with which some of its early history was doubtless connected , it has left only scanty and very imperfect records . That it was peopled from the north , perhaps from ancient Judea , with additions from Egypt and Arabia , is evident . The people , therefore , are Hamitic and Semitic in origin . As to when and how they arrived , there is much uncertainty . Apparently we may go back to moo B. C. with some degree of safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact and , since it is a matter of speculation and inference anyway , there are those who are willing to believe in origins as remote as 5000 B. C. Among these are the Ethiopians themselves , whose pride of ancestry may perhaps be excused for being allowed to outweigh the accuracy of their historical chronicles . One of their most cherished traditions  | is that of the descent of their line of rulers from the offspring of Solomon and the mysterious queen Makeda , or , as now designated , the Queen of Sheba , who is supposed to have visited King Solomon at Jerusalem about I00o B. C. From this time on for some three thousand years their dynasty is believed to have continued , and it is certain that , in spite of many civil , religious , tribal , and foreign conflicts , they have maintained themselves as a free and independent people . Their territory has expanded or contracted from time to time , but its essential integrity has persisted . Their civil and social customs , language , and their outlook upon the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stand as anachronisms in a world which is moving at bewildering speed . Although surrounded by Negro tribes and having some admixture of Negro blood brought in through centuries of slave-holding , the Ethiopian is by no means a Negro . He is dark-skinned , with hair usually kinky and lips frequently thick , but he has a good high-bridged nose , well-set eyes , and a firm chin ( see illustrations , pages 130 and 131 ) . To this he adds a proud and dignified bearing and a warlike. patriotic spirit , which mark him in an outstanding manner . His principal language is Amharic , an  | ancient Semitic tongue , but many languages and dialects are spoken . There is no literature in Amharic and only priests can read and write in Geez , also of Semitic origin , but a dead language no longer spoken . There are various tribes , but the dominant one , representing the original stock , mainly occupies the central and northern part of the country . FEUDALISM , SLAVERY , AND CHRISTIANITY The modern history of Ethiopia may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Menelik II , who ruled from 1889 to 1913 . He unified various warring groups , subdued outlying savage tribes , added much territory , and encouraged the inception of a railway from the coast . In all this he laid the foundation for the introduction of foreign ideas , most of which were ineffective during his lifetime , but which are now beginning to have important results . The government is an old-fashioned feudalism , such as flourished in Europe in the Middle Ages . Theoretically , the hereditary ruler is all-powerful , with the life or death of every man in his hands . All are subject to his call to arms and , through a system of provincial governors , overlords , and petty chiefs , to taxation and other forms of service . Practically , the system is subject to some variation ; for , in a country with poor communication and many physical barriers , might can make right here as elsewhere , and it is sometimes possible for a man to rise to comparative power through his own effort . Under the feudal  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the people are vassals in one degree or another . Every little village has its chief , or shum , and around him are his retainers . When he travels or appears in public they tag at his heels , and when he is at home they lie about his courtyard like so many hunting dogs , waiting to be called . If he is a big chief , they may number hundreds or , on special occasions , thousands ; if he is of minor importance , they may be only two or three ; but everyone who can muster as much as one small boy to act as his attendant will take great pains to do so . In addition to serfdom , slavery has ex- isted for hundreds of years , and , although the present government is making a sincere effort to mitigate and diminish it , there is little hope that it can be entirely abolished at once . Long before our European ancestors had heard of Jesus of Nazareth , Ethiopians were devout Christians , and Christians they have remained to this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , branch , which originated in Egypt and is supposed to have reached Ethiopia early in the fourth century . The priesthood is very numerous and very powerful and numbers nearly one-fourth of the male population .  | Until recently Ethiopia has been difficult of access , both physically and politically . Foreigners have not always been welcome , and even some of those who were officially well received have been killed while traveling in outlying parts . During the World War , however , a railroad was completed from Jibuti , in French Somaliland , to Addis Ababa , which is in the heart of the country ( see map , page 123 ) . GOOD FIELD rOR ZOOLOGICAL EXPLORATION Ethiopia is a rich field for zoological research . The Field Museum 's recent expedition to that country was carried out with the substantial aid and cooperation of the Chicago Daily News . The hospitable reception accorded by the Ethi- opians enabled the expedition to cover a large part of the country . Our party included Suydam Cutting , sportsman and amateur motion-picture photographer ; James E. Baum , Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer ; and Louis Agassiz Fuertes , ornithologist and painter , well known to readers of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE through many beautiful paintings of birds and mammals which he has contributed to its pages . The accidental death of Mr. Fuertes , since our return , has been widely noted . He was a very talented and delightful man , and he is greatly mourned as artist , naturalist , teacher , and friend .  | After much preparation and many diplomatic arrangements , we arrived in the centrally located capital , Addis Ababa , two words meaning " new flower . " This is the nearest approach to a real city in the country and the only place much affected by modern influences . It was in the first days of October , just after the close of the rainy season , that we arrived at Addis Ababa , when the smiling plant world was most attractive , the weather perfect , and promising to continue so for full seven months , during the long dry season . Snuggled against the hills at an altitude of 8 , Ioo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine climate , with cool , clear nights and glorious days of brilliant but not oppressive sunshine . The main streets of the capital literally swarm with natives in their picturesque costume of white cotton cloth . They are all barefooted or , at most , wear very simple sandals , and the majority are bareheaded , although the red fez , and especially the turban of the Moslem , appear with considerable frequency . There are so many people abroad that one feels it must be a gala season of some sort , but the visitor learns that much of the coming and going may be accounted for by the fact that in a feudal country the job of being a vassal consists largely in running errands or wandering and sitting about doing nothing . The streets in Addis Ababa are fairly wide , but very winding , and the city is spread over a large area . In the business section there are a few buildings of substantial character , and western civilization has made its usual contribution of corrugated iron , but the dwelling places are mainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUTOMOBILES ENLIVEN TRAFFIC OE THE CAPITAL 'S STREETS The automobile has arrived and proved its usefulness to such an extent that some 300 are now in use , and the work of grading and improving streets is actively under way . Outside the city , however , the automobile , as yet , can not go . Small trade is carried on by Turks ,  | and lodging ; the f orArmenians , and Hindus , who have been suffered to come in , and altogether the place presents a curious mixture of the ancient and the modern , together with certain pioneer features due to the fact that the city was founded scarcely more than 30 years ago . Hyenas howl at night and Ford cars honk and rattle by day . Camels in long lines sway along under heavy loads ; mules and donkeys , horses that range from native scrubs to the finest Arabians , cattle . sheep , goats , dogs ? all kinds of domestic animals except pigs ? help to fill the streets . A motor ride through this teeming life is more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest by the noise of the horn , which the driver is , perforce , obliged to keel ) honking practically all the time . While the people flock through the streets all day , they are forbidden to be out at night , as there is no lighting system , and after dark the highways are left to the prowling dogs and hyenas . Even leopards have been known to enter the city at night . The curfew does not apply strictly to foreigners , but they are enjoined to carry lights at night , and if they are wise they provide themselves with stout clubs to ward off the dogs . All this sounds somewhat forbidding , but in reality a sojourn in Addis Ababa is both interesting and enjoyable . There are several small hotels offering satisfactory food and lodging ; the f oreign colony is cordial , and Ethiopians of rank also extend hospitality . One may indulge in horseback riding , tennis , teas , and dinners , and although motoring is expensive and not yet a diversion , it contributes to freedom and rapidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are made to feel at home by their own countrymen connected with the American Mission and Hospital , and with  | the newly established legation and consulate . The work of the mission is mainly medical and educational and it has done much to create and maintain good feeling toward America . WELCOMED BY RAS TAFFARI , PRINCE REGENT The titular head of the State is the Empress Zauditu , daughter of Menelik II ; but practical affairs are largely in the hands of the young and progressive Ras Taffari , whose official title is " Regent of the Empire and Heir to the Throne . " It was practically at his invitation that we entered his domain , and he received us with the utmo s t courtesy and consideration . We found the regent a man of quiet dignity and much charm of manner , educated far beyond most of his subjects , and deeply interested in and devoted to the welfare of his country . Immediately after our arrival he granted us an interview , and a few days later invited us to a state dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner we met his wife , Waizeru Menen , quiet and unobtrusive , but a gracious hostess ( see illustration , page 122 ) . The dinner was in French style , of well-chosen modern food , prepared by an accomplished chef , and served faultlessly by white-garbed native waiters . No detail was missing , and if there was anything about it that might be called barbaric it was only the display of a golden table service which was dazzling . Plates , serving dishes , spoons , forks , knife handles , large vases , and high , double-decked fruit dishes , all were of solid gold , the metal , perhaps , of Ethiopian origin , but the design and workmanship beautifully wrought in Europe . Among- the decorations of the table was a small howl of live goldfish , which elicited the remark that perhaps they also were solid gold . Ras Taffari and his court in Addis Ababa are a mixture of the old and the new . Outside the capital city there is nothing modern and the customs of the  | people have not changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We spent several weeks in the capital organizing our caravans ; then plunged into the unknown in the large southern province of Arussi . The organization of the caravan was itself something of an adventure . In the big game fields of Central Africa and in the Congo , caravans move " on safari " by man power , with porters or bearers carrying loads on their heads or their backs ; in the hot lowlands surrounding the Ethiopian plateau camels are the usual means of transport , but in the highlands , which constitute the main part of the country , with the fertile grass-grown meadows , the abundance of water , the fine climate , and , above all , with the lack of such murderous insects as the tsetse fly , it is possible to use mules and horses . Therefore we traveled by mule train , and our own mounts were especially selected riding mules . When fully outfitted we had 6o mules and 40 men ? interpreters , headmen , personal servants , cooks , mule-skinners , and armed guards , or zabanias . These last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police duty while on the march , but their main use was to conform to the custom of the country , which decrees that no man of importance travels without an armed following to tag behind him , ready to fight off brigands if necessary . Although loyal to us and more than willing to fight for us at all times , these men were mostly very poor shots ; so it was principally as a show of force that they were of value . CHARACTER OP CARAVAN MEN Three days ' march southward from Addis Ababa we came to the Hawash River and were relieved to find it at a stage offering no especial difficulties for fording . Camp was made near its southern bank , in a parklike spot , where lush long grass grew under large trees scattered like the live oaks of California . The rains were over , but Nature still sparkled ; the Hawash was behind us , all the multifarious preliminaries were finished , and after the last few trying days  | of wrangling with the men of the caravan to get them away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with profound satisfaction that we settled into the free , open life of camp and trail . This we found delightful beyond expectations . PHYSICAL , COWARDICE UNKNOWN Our men were proud , suspicious , and very jealous of personal rights , but after we had eliminated a few bad characters , after we had come to know the others individually , and after we had learned to speak a few words of their language , we had no serious difficulty in managing them . Their own petty affairs and complaints against each other never ceased to need adjudication , but in the main they proved loyal and willing to do our bidding . In the city they were unmanageable , but once on the trail a marked change was evident . They have little initiative and are burdened with custom and superstition , but under direction they work willingly and efficiently . Among the best of them were outstanding individuals , whose tireless energy , industry , and faithfulness could scarcely be excelled ? men one would choose for caravan service among any race of people in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proved on many occasions in encounters with dangerous animals , in hazardous undertakings against natural obstacles of mountain or river , and in meeting real or fancied hostilities from natives along the way . Whatever else he is , the Ethiopian is not a physical coward . A THREAT PROM BANDITS In Addis Ababa we had received many warnings about robbers and bandits , shiftas , as they are called , and , although they did not molest us seriously , we saw plenty of evidence of their existence . In fact , it was not long before we met a band of them at close quarters . We were camped in an isolated place on the banks of a small river , at the bottom of a canyon ,  | when thirty or forty horsemen suddenly appeared on the rim of the cliffs above us , and then rode down to the opposite bank of the river and looked us over . They were obviously ruffians . All carried long , wicked-looking spears and were unaccompanied by women or baggage . They dismounted and remained for an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other , as if undecided what to do . Toward nightfall they left , and our men were much disturbed with the idea that they planned to return and attack us in the dark . Special guards were placed about the camp , and we ourselves slept with loaded rifles within easy reach . Nothing happened , however , and subsequent experience led us to conclude that we were never in any real danger from bandits . These marauders prey mostly upon small , unprotected caravans , and their forays are likely to be directed against lifelong enemies of adjoining tribes rather than against foreigners , whose ability to shoot straight has their respect . It is only a relatively short time since all Ethiopia was a mere collection of warring tribes without loyalty to any except local chiefs , and many of the old hatreds still exist . For this reason the native seldom travels alone except in his own territory . Our local guides on coming to the boundary of another tribe would stop and announce that they could go no farther . If urged to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asking nothing less than suicide from them , since they would be obliged to return alone . " BEAUTIFULLEST " COUNTRY IN THE WORLD The country through which we traveled is beautiful beyond description . Mountains and valleys , forests and meadows , lakes and rivers , deep-cut gorges and sheer-walled canyons , all combine to fur-  | nish such a variety of natural conditions as is rarely to be found . Before leaving America and just after our plans had been announced , we had received a letter from an American prospector who offered us his services . Evidently he was a rough diamond , a Trader Horn of a sort , and his letter concluded by saying , " It is the beautifullest country in the world . " We soon came to agree with him . Although much of the country is thickly inhabited , the people live in small , round , grass-thatched h u t s , known as tukuls , which are built in small clusters on the tops of knolls or so nestled into the sides of the hills that they seem always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or roads , no telegraph lines , and no wheeled vehicles of any kind , the appearance of smiling virgin Nature is everywhere maintained . During seven months ' travel we covered nearly two thousand miles of territory and made nearly two hundred camps . There was scarcely one of these that did not provide an attractive setting and all practical requirements ? level ground for the tents , water and forage for the mules , shade , firewood , and opportunity to collect specimens of mammals and birds . FROCKS OF ' PINK BIRDS SUGGEST SUNSET GROW Ethiopia offers as delightful conditions for outdoor life as can be found anywhere in the world . In the dry season , there is practically no danger of fever , and insect pests , with the exception of fleas in the settlements , offer little or no annoyance . In the Hawash Valley we had our first real introduction to the African fauna . Bird life was abundant ; there were crocodiles in the river , and troops of small gray guenon monkeys scampered through the trees . On both sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose flocks of ducks and geese ; stately white storks stood scattered about , contrasting with their more graceful cousins the demoiselle cranes , which were in small parties ; flocks of great white pelicans heavily  | took wing and strung themselves out against the sky ; and along a muddy slough were a few of the grotesque African marabou storks , or adjutants . Smaller birds were scarcely less conspicuous , especially the large jaylike and turquoise - blue rollers , small slenderbodied hornbills , and gorgeous pink beeeaters . These last occurred in close flocks , and when a hundred or more swept down to alight in an open and practically leafless tree , it was like the sudden turning on of a brilliant sunset glow . As we neared the hills a flock of guinea fowl scuttled across the trail , and as a slight eminence gave view over the meadow a pair of gazelles raised their heads above the grass in the distance . That night the hyenas made music and the sepulchral cough of a leopard came through the darkness . The next morning a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baboons of graduated sizes , grimacing and stalking swiftly from one vantage point to another . There was no doubt we were in Africa . HUNTING THE MOUNTAIN NYALA Our first objective in southern Ethiopia was the group of peaks known as the Chilalo Mountains , which we approached from the eastern side , over the wide , high grassland which lies between them and the Gugu Mountains ( see map , page 123 ) . Disregarding guides and beaten trails , we looked across the plain , selected  | a promising section of the mountains , and headed for it . There was little or no forest at this point , and by following ridges and making slight detours we were able to avoid the thickest of the bushy growth and ascend rapidly . Camp was made in a beautiful spot at 10,700 feet , a sunny glade partly surrounded by low trees and commanding a magnificent view both up and down the mountains . It was near the lower edge of the zone of bush heather , or giant heather , which is the principal growth at the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few patches of small trees and great banks of grayish green , thistlelike shrubs ( Echinops ) . In effect they were thistles , but thistles fifteen to twenty feet high , surmounted by great globular florescent balls bright pink in color ( see illustration , page 139 ) . Open ridges were studded with hoary cushions of straw flowers , or " everlastings , " and moist spots were matted with mosses , sedges , and bog plants of alpine associations . We called this place " Nyala Camp " because here we had our greatest success in hunting the mountain nyala , one of the largest and handsomest of African antelopes and one of the rarest . It is also  | called giant bushbuck , and on account of its strictly Ethiopian distribution and its great beauty the suggestion has been made that it be rechristened " Queen of Sheba 's antelope . " It lives at high altitudes in the heather zone and in the forest just below it . Like its relative , the ordinary bushbuck , it skulks and is given to lying in close concealment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively open country is remarkable . Once , as I passed a thick bush , it fairly exploded as a great buck crashed out on the other side scarcely ten feet from me . He must have seen me coming and lay low , expecting me to go by within a few rods , but when I actually brushed against his brier patch the strain was too great for him . Fortunately for the hunter , the nyala does at times appear in the open on high ridges or at the edges of mountain glades . In such places he presents a magnificent sight . One handsome buck , which momentarily stood at attention for me , was enlarged by the magnifying effect of a  | foggy atmosphere to such an extent that I could scarcely believe my eyes . It seemed impossible that the animal I had been seeking with such minute care could be so large . THE GALLA TRIBE IS ETHIOPIA 'S CHIEF SUBJECT RACE The natives we met in southern Ethiopia were mainly Gallas , belonging to the most important of the socalled subject tribes . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have extended into the central and even t h e northern part of the country , and have become so powerful and so numerous they may almost be regarded as assimilated . They are probably of Hamitic origin and are lighter in color than the old Ethiopians . Although mostly pagan , some have embraced Christianity , while others , especially in the southeast , are Mohammedans . The Arussi Gallas , with whom our contacts were most frequent , were conquered by Menelik and are now subject to the rule of local chiefs placed over them by the central authority . These chiefs receive no pay beyond what they can exact from their subjects , and this system is the cause of considerable difficulty . The southern Gallas speak a language of their own . The men are herdsmen and warriors , good horsemen , good hunters , good fighters , and notorious marauders . They ride bareback on tough little ponies , and a party of them sweeping over the plain , with their long spears flashing and their lithe brown bodies nearly naked , makes a picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them who visited our camp brought his two little daughters . He seemed fond of them , but when we attempted to compliment them he shrugged his shoulders and said : " I 'm very unfortunate , since I have only daughters . I wish I had a son . Women are only good to feed and care for men . I , myself , have killed men and lions , and I wanted a boy who could do the same . " Galla women do much menial work and lead rather a hard life , but Ethiopians in general , being Christians and monoga-  | mists , treat women well and , especially in well-to-do circles , where there are slaves , the position of woman is far from lowly . MANHUNTING IS A FAVORITE SPORT AMONG THE ARUSSI GALLAS The Arussi Gallas cling to various old practices of barbarism . Among them is one decreeing that a young man before taking a wife must prove his manhood by killing a lion , an elephant , or a man . Since lions and elephants are now practically extinct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Arussi Galla seeks it among his ancient enemies of the neighboring province of Gurage . Mutilation of a disgusting sort is a part of the procedure . The central government naturally frowns upon such practices , and they are now carried out only occasionally , in secret or in temporary outbreaks , when control is lost . In passing through Gurage we noticed slender streamers of white cloth , in groups of three or four to eight or ten , fluttering from the peaks of the huts or from poles set in front of them ,  | and upon inquiry we were informed that these were to indicate the number of men killed by the occupant notches on his spear , as it were . Killing and fighting , therefore , are looked upon as man 's highest attainments , not only in semisavage districts , but rather generally throughout the country . MOUNTAIN FORESTS From our first camp in the Chilalo Mountains we passed southward into a magnificent forest on the southeast slope of the range . The trees in this forest were mainly of unfamiliar kinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stately ; dark-foliaged yews having pendent fruit about the size and shape of an olive . These trees have straight trunks two or three feet in thickness and rise to a height of 75 to 100 feet . Another beautiful and interesting tree is the kosso ( Hagenia ) , which grows to great size , with irregular spreading branches and a short , thick trunk with a light , scaly bark ( see page 136 ) . Its pinnate leaves and pink fruit suggest the American sumachs done on a grand scale . The fruit , which is very abundant , hangs in great clusters , like enormous bunches of pink Catawba grapes . This fruit is gathered by the natives and crushed to make a rather heroic remedy for tapeworm , with which , on account of the habit of eating raw meat , every Ethiopian at one time or another seems to be afflicted .  | Farther south , in the Ghedeb Mountains of the province of Bale , we found similar luxuriant forests , rich with undergrowth and apparently in virgin condition , although in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is untrodden by man . BIRDS FAMOUS TOR THE COLOR STRUCTURE UF THEIR FEATHERS Bird life in the heavy forest was limited but interesting . Flashes of bright red here and there revealed the flight of small flocks of touracos , curious birds found only in Africa and famous for the unique character of their pigmentation , which is partly soluble in water and contains a small but definite percentage of metallic copper . They are long-tailed , crested , and slender-bodied birds , mainly greenish in color except for great red patches on their wings , and they have the lizardlike habit or running up and down branches and twisting themselves into ludicrous positions , where they stop motionless and quizzically eye the intruder . A few small parrots shrieked about the tree tops , and in dark solitudes richly colored trogons sat silently . Flowering trees were frequented by one or two species of the beautiful little African sunbirds , which , although not related to them , have considerable superficial re  | semblance to American humming birds . Always there were the clumsy , croaking , thick-billed ravens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . A feature of the forest life was the guereza monkey ( Colobus ) , a handsome species with long , flowing black and white pelage . It is a large monkey and very active , tearing through the tops of the trees and making long downward leaps , sometimes for 5o or 75 feet , and seeming to trust to luck for a landing place . At such times it is very conspicuous , but when it chooses to hide it can do so most successfully in a very small bunch of foliage . My constant companion , Fuertes , the ornithologist , spent most of his time with the birds , but the guereza monkeys caught his artist 's fancy and he never tired of watching them . The first time he saw one crashing through the branches , with its long white-tufted tail waving aloft like a pompon and its black and white body flashing through the green , he promptly characterized it " a hearse on a spree " ( see page 143 ) . FEW LIONS LEFT IN ETHIOPIA Near the southern end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Cutting turned eastward to pass through the old Mohammedan settlement of Sheikh Hussein , and then northward through a little-known and relatively dry region which led them back to  | Addis Ababa via Hawash Station . Meanwhile I'uertes and I continued southward into the province of Sidamo , and thence northward along the chain of lakes in the Great Rift Valley . The eastern party found considerable game ? oryx , waterbuck , greater and lesser koodoos , gerenuk , gazelles , and Grevy 's zebras . No lions were encountered , however , and we came to the conclusion that they are nearly extinct in most of Ethiopia , being found only near its borders adjoining Somaliland , Kenya , and Sudan . Mr. Baum relates one amusing experience with a hyena which suddenly con- fronted him in the twilight and which he bravely shot at a few paces , while quivering with excitement because he thought it was his first lion . Several small antelopes are common in the highland , and rare animals like the nyala and the ibex are of great interest to the naturalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sportsman . INTO THE CANYON Or THE WEBI SHEBELI RIVER Progress southward was hindered by the Webi Shebeli , largest river of south-  | ern Ethiopia , flowing through a deep-cut canyon , basalt-walled for many miles . The grandeur of the views from our camps overlooking this canyon was most impressive , and , although it is on a smaller scale , comparisons with the Grand Canyon of the Colorado came to mind ( see page 156 ) . The eastern section of our party experienced considerable difficulty in making the crossing , and only succeeded by swimming the mules and sending the baggage over on the shoulders of the men , who went in parties of four in water up to their armpits . They were able to keep footing only by bracing against each other and the heavy common load which weighted them down . We emerged from the canyon of the Webi on a dry open plain in the province of Bale , which was one for which we had no special credentials and in which whites have seldom traveled . The place seemed uninhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking for the usual fuss with real or pretended customs officers and , after going a mile or two , we saw some huts from which a dozen or more natives rushed , shouting and waving their spears . With the interpreter and two or three of our principal men , we drew off to meet them , but signaled the caravan of pack mules and the main body of our men to proceed . The natives were an unusually dirty , rough-looking lot and almost immediately became surly . They demanded that our caravan stop , unload , and let them search our baggage . Our official passes and letters they could n't read , and the imposing seal of Ras Taffari apparently made no impression . Arguments became heated and threatening looks passed about until it was evident quick and decisive action was necessary . Therefore we told them flat-footedly that our authority to proceed was clear , that we intended to do so with or without their permission , and that if they attempted to stop us our men would be given orders to shoot . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing among themselves , but making no move to follow us . This was in the nature of a bluff on our part , since of course shooting was the last thing we wanted to start , but it had the desired effect . As we look back upon this , we do not consider that it was a very dangerous situation , but at the time it was exciting . It is true that our opponents had only spears , while a half dozen of our men had rifles ; but we were greatly outnumbered and the surrounding hills were full of hostile natives . A MOMENT OF ' REAL DANGER As to the loyalty of our own men , there was no question . Here , and at other times , they proved conclusively that they would gladly fight with us and for us . The Ethiopian loves a fight , and , once started , he is likely to be reckless of consequences . Some time later we had a really dangerous moment with a more remote tribe . Fortunately , it was only a moment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign travelers in Ethiopia have to contend . This is the possibility that the men of one 's own caravan may quarrel with local natives , starting with some trivial matter , but rapidly leading to high words , passion , and finally bloodshed , in which case the whole countryside is aroused and the party 's chance of escape is small . In the case mentioned one of our guards , with orders to keep loafers and small boys out of the camp , had extended his authority to a visiting young man , who was the son of a chief and who considered himself too important to take peremptory orders . He therefore demurred , and the guard beat him with a stick and tore his clothes . The young man was enraged and rushed home for his gun , loaded it , and returned a few hours later with manslaughter in his heart . Stealth was no part of his method , although we afterward learned that he had friends , also with loaded guns , posted in the bushes . He appeared suddenly , livid with passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . The guard was my own syce and gunbearer , carrying my rifle , and although he had never been allowed to fire it , he had  | cartridges for it and at once began shoving some into the magazine . Meanwhile our other armed men pulled cartridges from their belts and at once assumed defensive attitudes . It was all a matter of seconds , and Fuertes and I , luckily present , but at the time entirely ignorant of the circumstances leading up to the outbreak , rushed in , shouting at our men to stand back and calling for the interpreter to bring the matter to a parley . We placed the blame on our own man and pronounced a fine upon him , to be paid to the incensed stranger . At the same time I drew a few small coins from my own pocket and offered them ostensibly as recompense for the torn clothing . The young man was mollified at once , with the result that a situation which might have resulted in the loss of several lives , perhaps including our own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUIDES IMPRESSED INTO SERVICE Our relations with the Gallas , and in general with other tribes , were for the most part pleasant and friendly , and we often employed them as hunters and guides . The trails are little more than cowpaths , constantly forking and running in all directions . In order not to lose time between main points , therefore , it was necessary for us to have local guides from day to day . These guides were furnished by the local chiefs , were paid for their services , and usually were very glad to go with us . In one place in the far south , however , we had considerable difficulty with guides . This was near the province of Walamo , where a French traveler had been killed two years previously . It was the consensus of opinion that his death had been due to his own excitable and ill-advised actions , but his government protested and Ras Taffari was induced to make an example of the natives supposed to be implicated , and after some sort of trial eleven of them were hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natives not hostile , but decidedly inclined to keep out of our way . The chiefs were very solicitous for our safety , but the rank and file simply did n't want to be found within gunshot of us . The result was that we would go to a chief and ask for a guide , and after he had assigned one to us we would start out , but at the first opportunity the guide would dodge into the bush and disappear , forfeiting our promised reward and leaving us adrift . We finally placed the guide under guard and marched him along at the head of the caravan between two armed men . In one case , through the leniency of the guards , or perhaps through collusion , the guide was permitted to visit alleged friends in a hut along the way . When he failed to reappear the owner of the hut was seized and told he must take his place . He protested loudly and his women and neighbors gathered around , wailing and making dire predictions . When they realized we meant business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts were heard from a thick patch of bananas near by , and soon a crowd came out , dragging the original guide , who ultimately remained with us voluntarily for two extra days , after contact with our men had convinced him he was in no real danger . At one time , while traveling without a guide , we came to a small village , and as we approached we could see the inhabitants scurrying into their huts . By the time we arrived the place seemed deserted . One or two women remained in their doorways , but no men were in sight . Many trails led out and the locality was very boggy ; so for a few miles at least a guide was essential . Selecting the most important-looking habitation , our interpreter started to enter and search for a man ; but his progress was immediately barred by a young woman , who appeared at the entrance and had to be forced aside . No man was found inside , although we felt sure we had seen one go in . Meanwhile we sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling old man . Women began to gather about him ; then two scared young men joined the group , declaring that they were the captive 's sons , and that they would take his place rather than have him impressed into service as a guide . This was quite satisfactory , and a few hours later , when they were dismissed and rewarded , their man-  | ner had changed and they left us smiling and happy . HOSPITALITY ALONG THE WAY Wherever we went the hospitality of the various chiefs was a never-failing source of interest . From Ras Taffari , in the capital , down to the shum , or little headman , of the smallest village on our route , practically all officials received us graciously and courteously . They insisted on doing it formally , however , and much time was consumed in visiting and being visited when we wanted to get on our way and carry on our work . Often no sooner would camp be pitched than a shum , all dressed up and followed by his vassals , would appear to pay his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual procedure was to take him to our tent , where a table would be set , and our boys would bring him food and drink . He would then ask us all sorts of questions about ourselves and the great world , of which he knew nothing except from hearsay . Frequently the conversation would be largely geographical and an ever-recurring subject was the shape of the earth . Most Ethiopians believe it is flat , but it was in  | teresting to find them beginning to h a v e doubts and recognizing that at least some other people think it is round . Local chiefs among the Gallas and other tribes in much of southern Ethiopia have been sent there by the central government and frequently are men of character and intelligence superior to their subjects . One who came to visit us in Arussi was of a very sweet and gentle disposition , with a benevolent face and none of the hard warrior characteristics . In the course of entertaining him we displayed some of our specimens , opening a chest with trays filled with skins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment and then said thoughtfully : " I can understand killing l i o n s , hyenas , and animals of that sort , - but it seems a pity to kill these beautiful , harmless birds . Do you think God will like that ? " This was rather a poser ; but , since he seemed very appreciative of the beauty of the birds , I explained that these particular specimens could be spared from Ethiopia , where only a few people noticed them , whereas we were taking them where they might be enjoyed by thousands who had never seen them before . He saw the point at once . MENELIK NOT YET FORGOTTEN The loyalty of many of the minor chiefs to Ras Taffari was apparent . When shown our letters from him , they would take occasion to extol him with much feeling , and when we inquired if they could fulfill our requests for guides or assistants , it was common for them to smile and reply in effect : " It is n't a question of whether I can or will . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , depended somewhat upon the individual . In one rather remote place , as our papers were being examined , a bystander interjected : " Ras Taffari ! Who is he ? Hurrah for Menelik ! " At another time a rather important chief said , with a quizzical look : " Ras Taffari is all very well , but I am proposing to entertain and assist you on my own account . "  | After a shum had visited our camp it was usual for him to send us a gift of food , the amount depending upon his wealth and importance . Sometimes it was only a chicken or a few pancakes of native bread , a jug of milk , or half a dozen eggs . It was not until we reached the province of Sidamo and camped in the precincts of its eccentric and powerful ruler , Dejazmatch Balcha , * that we received really * Since our return , it is reported that Balcha , with an exaggerated idea of his power , gathered his cohorts and marched on Addis Ababa . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no loss of life and he himself was captured and imprisoned . lavish attention . Here , immediately after our tents were set , a long line of slaves marched gravely up , bearing baskets of bread , jars of hot pepper sauce , gallons of tej , or honey beer , chickens and eggs by the dozen , hay and barley for our mules , bundles of firewood for our camp , and live stock on the hoof ? a couple of sheep and , finally , a big fat ox . Such large gifts were embarrassing , for we could not offer money in return and our stock of gifts was not large . Balcha at least pretended that he wished no return , and , as circumstances fell , he got none ; for , although we had set aside a small rifle  | for presentation to him , a change in our route made its delivery impracticable . The practice of supplying food to armies on the march or to important travelers , either native or foreign , is called demo and is of long standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round robin , it is in reality a tax upon the people . BAMBOOS , BANANAS , AND COF'F'EE Balcha ruled his province with a firm hand . We found many evidences of his efficiency . Over much of the province there is a heavy growth of bamboo , which not only affects the natural appearance of the region , but marks the works of man . It serves for the construction of larger and better huts than were seen elsewhere , and the practice of building stockades and inclosures is widely followed . Easily constructed but very practical bridges ? soft , yielding affairs , entirely of bamboo , often precarious looking , but in reality very tough and strong -- were found over all the small streams . The general cultivation of a banana plant , the starchy root of which is used as food , also serves to give Sidamo an outward aspect very different from the other provinces we visited . It was here , also , that we entered the coffee region and began to meet trains of mules and donkeys loaded with bags of the beans hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coffee is native to this part of Ethiopia , which includes the province of Kafa , somewhat to the westward ( see map , page  | 123 ) , and from which even the word coffee may have been derived . Early in the fifteenth century coffee passed from this region to Arabia , and thence to its present world-wide use . MANY CHANGES AT ADDIS ABABA IN THREE MONTHS Sidamo was our southernmost point . Here we turned northward and made our way back to Addis Ababa , threading among the beautiful lakes which occupy the northern extension of the Great Rift Valley . Ras Taffari again received us courteously and provided credentials for travel in the northern provinces . The caravan was reorganized , specimens were shipped , and miscellaneous business transacted . Although only three months had elapsed since our first visit , we observed many changes in the capital . New streets had been opened , grading of others had progressed , several important new buildings had been finished , and a general air of activity was evident . Some additions and changes had been made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American diplomatic representative was expected. * Automobiles had increased in * Addison E. Southard , U. S.

CANYON Or THE BLUE NILE Late in February our entire party started northward with a replenished and improved outfit , an enlarged and selected native personnel , and a feeling of confidence born of the experiences behind us . We passed rapidly through central Shoa over grasslands which were hard and dry , although a few months previously they had been largely covered with standing water a n d frequented by thousands of water birds . The trail led across the canyon of the Muger River , a scenic gorge of no mean dimensions , and thence onward to the famous Abbai , or Blue Nile . This extends for many miles and effectually cuts off the northern provinces of Ethiopia from the central and southern part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite impassable , and this condition gives to the chiefs of the northern provinces a large measure of independence . The rim of the canyon is formed by perpendicular walls of reddish basalt which are so nearly continuous that ingress and egress are possible only at long intervals , well known points which have been used for centuries . The canyon drops abruptly from the grass-grown level of the plateau , and we scarcely had a preliminary view of it before we stood on its very edge . Then it was magnificent , and as we laboriously descended , new vistas unfolded , at every turn . The trail is rough , rocky , and in places very steep ? a hard trail for tired mules , but not a dangerous one . Fortunately , there is one small spring of water about halfway down the south wall , and another near the foot of the upper escarpment on the north . This makes it possible to arrange the crossing in three days , which is about all that mules and men can endure . The first day took us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the river , forded it , and climbed part way out ; and the third we finished the grueling climb to the north rim . Here the aneroid again read 8,100 feet , practically the same as on the south side . At the river the  | reading was 3,100 feet , so the depth of the canyon at this point is almost exactly 5,000 feet . The region inside the canyon is practically uninhabited and largely unexplored . The crossing place is reputed to be favorite ground for bandits , but we saw none . HEADWATERS Or THE BLUE NILE The Blue Nile in this section makes a big bend and , although the point where we crossed is many miles from its source by the windings of the river , we were able to cut across this bend and in a relatively short time reach its ultimate headwaters at Gish Abbai , near Sakalla , in the mountains of central Gojjam . Here a small spring rises in a mountain meadow at an elevation of about 9,000 feet . A trickling rivulet runs thence through open dales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Little Abbai , which British engineers have authoritatively determined as the true source of the Blue Nile ( see page 166 ) . This stream runs into and through the lower end of Lake Tsana , emerging with other waters of the lake to form the main Abbai , or Blue Nile proper . The spring at the source is regarded by the natives as a holy place and its water is a sort of Jordan to them . They have erected a light stockade around it and make pilgrimages to it from distant points . A number of natives were here when we arrived , and for several days they were coming and going or sitting about with their water jars conducting simple devotions . Mr. F'uertes and I began to get some of the romance of the situation , and at meal time would amuse ourselves by lifting our glasses and apostrophizing the great river , or , as we passed the stream , would drop chips into it with foolish remarks about meeting them again in Khartum or Cairo . However , for domestic purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as elsewhere . MAGNIFICENT RECEPTION BY RAS HAILU On the north bank of the Blue Nile we entered the important province of Goj jam , rich realm of the famous chieftain Ras Hailu , second in wealth and power to Ras Taffari , but occupying an isolated terri-  | tory as yet little affected by modern influences . We had sent word of our approach , and when we reached his borders an emissary was there to welcome and guide us . The messenger presented us with a quaint little note written by Ras Hailu himself and stamped with his ornate seal . In effect , this gave thanks to God for his state of good health , hoped we were the same , and bade us come at once to see him . We had expected to find him at his long-established capital at Debra Markos , but he was temporarily quartered at the village of Bichana , birthplace of his father , Tecla Haimanot , which , largely for sentimental reasons , he was rebuilding and enlarging , perhaps with the idea of making a new capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without warning , as we topped a rise in the trail , we confronted a company of 50o men drawn up in orderly array to meet us ? a sort of guard of honor led by a handsome chamberlain ( see page 169 ) . After we had dismounted and exchanged greetings , we were invited to proceed toward the village . The spot was very picturesque , situated on a high ridge looking clown over sweeping slopes to the broken side canyons of the Blue Nile on one side and up to the cloud-capped peaks of central Goj jam on  | the other . A band of 20 slaves playing weird music started the march , and our enormous escort fell in on either side . Our own boys proudly formed in a square behind us , the caravan of mules and attendants trailed in the rear , and we rode on like heroes returning from battle . The march ended at the outskirts of the village , where a campsite had been set aside and a large ornamental Arab tent , its floor laid with rich oriental rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAS HAILU The next day , when we met the chief , he amply justified his royal welcome and all that we had heard about him . Thereafter , for ten days , his strong , vivid personality monopolized our attention . Our work of collecting specimens was halted and all ideas of proceeding on our way had to be abandoned until he saw fit to release us . Each day he came to visit our camp and each day he provided entertainment and hospitality for us in the village . The first invitation was to luncheon , and we rode tip to our host 's compound accompanied by a goodly escort of our own boys , who were much spruced up for the occasion . At the gate was a small guard of men in and stood at attention in long lines through which we passed to the inner gate . Here we dismounted and were met by Ras Hailu , who came forward smiling and surrounded by special attendants and dignitaries . At the luncheon these notables and several of our more important " boys " stood within call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were fifteen courses , mainly meat in various forms , the most acceptable being good fried chicken . Native beer and tej were served lavishly and continuously and there was also champagne , and finally cognac and native coffee . The next day a return engagement was arranged , and the Ras readily accepted an invitation to dine at our camp . Our cooks and attendants outdid themselves , and the entertainment was carried off with great success . This sort of thing was kept up and we sat for hours at table , conversation never  | lagging and subjects ranging from international relations to cures for sore - backed mules . Although the chief is a large , ponderous man with rather heavy features , he has an engaging smile and a certain indefinable charm that we could not fail to recognize . He has a decided sense of humor , is fond of a good story , and his comments on human nature were usually pithy and sometimes quite epigrammatic . We were the first Americans to pass his way , and it was evident he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were important mainly as representatives of a great nation , but he was shrewd enough not to refer to this and made his compliments delicately and personally to us as individuals . He did not neglect the men of our caravan , men from Addis Ababa , where he has many admirers . A RAW MEAT FEAST One of the most interesting incidents of our stay with Ras Hailu was a great guebeur , the preLenten raw-meat feast of Kurbella . Owing to the chief 's temporary quarters , this was held in a large tent , in campmeeting style ( see illustration , page 172 ) . It lasted for some hours and required various sittings to accommodate the different classes of people . Practically the entire male population was served , even including prisoners under sentence for minor offenses.  | The feast was far from being an orgy . It was conducted in a very orderly manner . Long tables and benches supported by wicker cylinders were closely arranged , and the groups of men filed in and took their places with great solemnity . Steers had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large wooden platters and passed about to the feasters , who cut it in small pieces with slender steel knives and ate it deliberately with bread and drink . The flesh was in red , quivering chunks of about a half pound each and was consumed without any wolfing or tearing . We , ourselves , sat on a dais at a special table with the Ras , where we were served with special food and drink . Raw meat was offered us , but not urged upon us , as was the case with other native food . As the feasters filed out , some of the older men stopped in front of our table and made short , impassioned speeches addressed to their chief , extolling him and expressing good wishes to us , his guests . Finally , there was music and dancing and some rather rough pantomime by a band of slaves , and the affair broke up with laughter and good feeling . The eating of raw meat seems to have no particular significance and is said to have had its origin ( luring intertribal wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THE SIMYGN MOUNTAINS Around the famous Lake Tsana our party was divided , one going to the south and west and the other to the north and east via the old settlement of Gondar , where there are interesting ruins of stone buildings erected by Portuguese adventurers ( see pages 159 and 160 ) . The Gondar party , composed of Baum , Bailey , and Cutting , went northeast to the Simyen Mountains , the highest group in Ethiopia , reaching an extreme elevation of more than 15,000 feet . Its main object was to hunt the Abyssinian ibex , a rare animal , found only in these mountains . The chief of Simyen , Dejazmatch Ayalu , received the party cordially , and , although be is not reputed to be so rich or powerful as Ras Hailu , he almost outdid him in his demonstrations . Without his friendly cooperation nothing would have been possible , since the ibexes and the cliffs they inhabit are his personal preserve . Ibex hunting in any part of the world is back-breaking work , usually exciting , and often dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reputed to be and even more . The mountains were exceedingly precipitous , and if it had not been for willing native guides who went up and down the dizzy pinnacles , clinging with bare feet like flies to a wall , the results might have been disappointing . As it was , a fine series of specimens was obtained , the first ever to fall to American rifles and the first ever to be brought to an American museum . Mr. Bailey had one experience which he will not soon forget . In brief , he shot and instantly killed an ibex as it ran directly above him . Its dead body , accompanied by loose debris , fell toward him , passing within a few feet as he crouched on his narrow ledge , and then crashed on down for 2,000 feet more . It was only a matter of inches as to whether or not the quarry would carry the hunter with it . THE END OE THE TRAIT , Early in April the two sections of the party , following converging trails , suddenly and somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ' march from Gallabat , on the Sudan border . It was a joyous meeting , with much good fellowship and rapid interchange of experiences ; but almost immediately a spell of some sort seemed to prevail , as each man realized that a wonderfully interesting trip was virtually over . At Gallabat two English officers welcomed us cordially , and their efficient establishments proclaimed that we were at the great world 's door ; yet we could scarcely believe it . Wires were sent to wives in Paris , and answers came back the next day . It did n't seem possible . All that remained of Ethiopia was represented by our simple-hearted and mostly faithful men . A few days later automobiles , ordered by telephone , came from Gedaref and bore us and our baggage , for two blistering hot days , to Wad Medani , only a few hours by rail from Khartum and a well-appointed tourist hotel .
