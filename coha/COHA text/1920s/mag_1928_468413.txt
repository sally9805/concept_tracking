A RINDLY , velvet-fingered physician removed the other day from the writer 's eye a fragment of mineral substance which had entered it during a taxicab ride on Sixth Avenue . In the course of the conversation it appeared that the kindly physician had come from dining with the richest old man in the world to remove that splinter . It further appeared that the richest octogenarian in the world , having till a very advanced age subsisted on a daily diet of two crackers and a half pint of sour milk , had latterly blossomed out into a normal lunch and a seven-course dinner , and felt none the worse for it . And there ? exaggerations and all ? you have health-talk ! Now , quite good-humoredly and altogether without cynicism , because I think it is time that the ordinary citizen took his own destinies more in hand , I am going to set down a number of medical instances , rather haphazardly , and then to make , not any dogmatizations , but some suggestions about them . My father was murdered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ; my mother died of the pain of an operation because the operators said that an anaesthetic would kill her . Another member of my family after thirteen specialists had declared that she was not tuberculous -- and after the usual analyses ? was operated on by a fourteenth , an organ being removed and found to be tuberculous . Another , having had an organ removed by the knife of an eminent surgeon in an adventurous , after-dinner frame of mind , the organ was declared to be perfectlyfree of any malignant traces which the surgeon had alleged to exist . Similar histories distinguish almost every family in our Western World . So in all that there is nothing to write home about . Let us get to another class of medical belief . My maternal grandfather was a remarkably abstemious man . He hardly ever ate red meat or drank alcoholic liquor . He died of apoplexy at the age of seventy-two . On my father 's side one of my direct ancestors used to boast that he had never gone to bed sober after attaining the age of eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow . Happening to be on the bench in an English northern county 's petty sessions , I heard two octogenarian witnesses , both remarkably well preserved and intelligent , testify in a right-of-way case . One of them was eighty-two , the other , older . Complimented by the chairman of the bench on his lucidity and asked to account for his age and condition , the junior replied that he had never had a pipe of ' bacca in his mouth and never swalowed a drop of liquor . Asked the same question , the elder replied : " I was never without a pipe of ' bacca in my mouth for sixty years and I have n't passed a completely sober week since . . " Similar histories exhilarate every court house in Christendom . Now here is a story of yesterday ? literally of yesterday . I was lunching with a young man with whom I lunch frequently and who is usually in blooming health . Yesterday he appeared to be under a cloud . He 0 HYGEIA ! ' 769 said that his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a date for him with her physician . He objected that there was nothing the matter with him , but she replied that since she had made the date that young man might as well keep it , for he would have to pay in any case . The physician overhauled that young man thoroughly . He said ( Mark this ! ) : " There is nothing the matter with your throat , so I can not order you to stop smoking . I wish I could but I ca n't . " He then said that that young man had been suffering from bronchitis for three weeks , that he was on the edge of a nervous breakdown , must do no work and take an extended holiday in the south . That young man is now in a nervous breakdown and left this morning for the south ! I will not for the moment comment on this case , but as a corollary will state that my own life was completely ruined and myself for six years reduced to a condition of hypochondriacal lunacy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a doctor who had been called in to see a member of my family . Except for influenza and the haps of the late War , I have not passed a day in bed for thirty-three years ; but that gentleman ? an old-fashioned country doctor of a cheerful and irresponsible type : I can still see him tap the top of his high hat as he put it on ! ? that gentleman so efficiently auto-suggested me with the idea that I suffered from a chronic disease one of whose sequel.he is epilepsy ? so efficiently that for six years I expected at every minute ? at every minute of the day ? to drop under the dread malady which is alleged to have afflicted Napoleon . and most other great men . I have not yet done so . It would seem that destiny has decreed that mankind shall live in a dark forest of fears ? of Nightmares ! I look abroad on this fair world into which pour the rays of the sun ? for truly today the sun shines over Greenwich Village as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village too ? full of gay and gallant men and of women utterly charming . The children laugh over their games ; artists paint in the garrets ; in the basements poets are hard at their verses ; on the intervening floors are musicians . The radio sounds unceasingly . Who could not be happy in Greenwich Village ? But who is ? Behind each member of the apparently gay throng rides black care . Do you remember how Doctor Johnson used to sigh at Ranelagh or Vauxhall , which forerunners of night-clubs he used to describe as the most miserable spectacles that human misery could afford ? . . . He sighed , not as Moralist but as Hypochondriac . He was of opinion that every participant in the lively and agreeable scene faced black misery when he retired to his closet and the dark night . That was true of himself , but his companions always protested that it was not the ease with the rest of humanity , and I daresay they were right . The eighteenth century pretty well chanced its luck so long as it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely true of today , for there is no adult without a skeleton in his or her cupboard , and for the little children at their games they are preparing . Oh , yes , they are preparing ! Even for me before I frequented this country they were preparing ! I can not remember to have owned a bottle of medicine for my personal use in twenty-one years except quinine for influenza . Of course , in Red Cross Hospitals I was made to take things which I would not have taken had the disobeying of the doctor 's orders not been a courtmartial offense . And then the V. A. D. 's were so charming it was a pleasure to take things from their hands ! But the only specific I ever carried was a very old-fashioned toothache tincture which dentists always declared to be a quack medicine . But it used to burn all the skin off the inside of my mouth , and the toothache would go ? so why it should be called a quack medicine I do not sec . It did what you paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last six years I have had no toothache and even at that , when it was at its worst could cure myself by assuring myself that there was no such thing as pain . Apart from that , I used to like to have handy some boric ointment made with yellow , not white , vaseline for cuticular abrasions , an old-fashioned horse-liniment for sprains , and extract of witchhazel for sunburn and the like . Alas ? I have just been to my toilet closet to see what skeletons now are there ? now , after protracted frequentations of these shores . And what do I find ? I. A bottle of Eau de Cologne , recommended for use with witch-hazel after shaving. 2 . Witch-hazel. 3 . A jar of something that describes itself as an Effervescent Saline Combination . Laxative and Cathartic ! For me ! 4 . A jar of Bicarbonate of Soda . I used to use this for tooth-brushing , but I am told that American public opinion demands its internal consumption whenever you have a hang-over . And when do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what I am supposed to do with this . 6 . An eye-cup. 7 . A lotion for use with above . Only moral pressure of the direst , amounting to physical coercion made me use this . 8 . A bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide . I was told , I think , to use this as a mouth wash . I found , however , that its use was turning my mustache prematurely white . This bottle is , therefore , empty . 9 . A jar of ointment for keeping chaps from the hands . I never wear gloves even in the coldest weather , and my hands arc never chapped. 10 , Another jar of something dark brown . For colds . Now I am led to believe that the above is the minimum equipment for the American gentleman . I mean that if you travel with less than this you will be regarded with suspicion in hotels orcountry houses . . as if you should lack a toothbrush . That is all very well in its way , and for myself I try here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not politically of course , but in the way of doing at Rome what the Romans do . But there is the reverse of the medal . I mean that I find myself beginning to have " symptoms " ? symptoms of what I do n't know , nor can I in any way precise them . It is a sort of all-overish feeling . In Paris where I Live and work , since I take no bit nor sup when I am writing and eat only one meal a day , I should put it down to an empty stomach . Here . . . well , it feels slightly different . A more sinking feeling ! I am : old it is due to blood pressure ? by half L dozen solicitous persons . They say I must wear a blood-gauge on my wrist and watch it . 1 shall then see the blood spouting terribly , as coffee bubbles up in a certain type of coffee-maker that has a glass bowl . They say it is glorious . It must be . It is also painful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , it is obvious that if you have something definite the matter with you , or have been in a street accident or fallen out of a window , you must go to a doctor who may or may not cure you . For myself , I like doctors ? I mean their society . I even like to have little things get into my eye so that a velvet-fingered gentleman may coax them out . And doctors are usually contemplative and well-mannered ? and they never write novels ! That is curiously significant . But it is to be remembered that if the doctor has taken in modern society the place of the priest he has taken that place , and that the priesthoods of Anglo Saxondom arc largely Puritan in coloration . Anglo Saxondam , in short , believes that salvation lies only in negation of joy and , since nations have the doctors that they want , the first thought of the doctor in seeing a new patient is : " Lct me see . What can I forbid him to do ? " I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the case of the poor young man whose doctor said he wished he could forbid him to smoke , but could discover no reason for doing so . Here , in truth , you perceive how very much more than the player of the game is the game ; and how very much more a doctor 's thoughts are set on morals than on medicine . It is not a question of whether smoking is harmful or no ; it is a question of whether it is enjoyable . And the doctor in Anglo-Saxon countries assumes the same attitude towards wine , meat , sweet stuffs for children , and any other human practice from which enjoyment can be obtained . For a century or so it was held that smoking was had for the eyesight . There was absolutely no demonstrable ground for the belief any more than for the old women 's and fishermen 's belief that piercing the ears for ear-rings was good for the eyesight . Nowadays it is held by the most advanced oculists that smoking as such does nothing whatever to the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will smart just as if you let smoke from a , wood fire get into them . And the thing to do if , as I do , you wish to smoke all day and all night , is to use a long cigarette holder or a pipe with a long stem . This , upon the recommendation of my own oculist ? a Frenchman ? I have found to be perfectly efficacious . I can not say how far it would work in the case of everybody , since it takes all sorts to make a world . It is precisely the same with wine . Noticing the other day that a lady in whose company I was dining drank no wine but did drink cocktails , 1 was bold enough to ask the reason . She told me that , although formerly on the Continent she was accustomed to drink a reasonable amount of wine without noticing any ill results , her doctor had lately told her that wine was bad for persons of rheumatic tendencies and that , if she must drink anything at all , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootleg gin instead of a perfectly natural , if not very good , wine , which was then on the table . She must have consumed at least twice as much alcohol as was contained in my pint of ordinaire . In addition she is in no way of a rheumatic disposition . Now a French doctor will give you the same advice as St. Paul , not because he is of any specially religious leanings , but because living in a country whose most important industry is the production of wine , he has under his eyes continuously specimens of wine drinkers in every stage of bibulousness . Moreover , wine is not to him a Frenchified and foreign beverage , and he lives in a country whose inhabitants implicitly believe that anything which " changes your ideas " ? ga change les ides is the phrase perhaps the most often heard in the broad lands of France ? anything , then , which changes the ideas is salutary , and , indeed , necessary for the salvation of body and soul . I remember years ago being told in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely necessary fur the brain worker before going to bed . He said that alcohol changes the specific gravity of thought , and without some such change the man who has spent his day in thinking will go on thinking thoughts of the same caliber and complexion , this keeping him awake and being bad not only for the body but also for the quality of that man 's thought itself . daresay he was right . I know I sleep very badly myself if I do not take a little something ? preferably light wine ? before going to bed . I hold again no special brief for the consumption of alcohol . I merely point out that here in the matter of the consumption of one article one body of men who know something of its nature and action on the human frame recommend its moderate use while another body of men who , by the nature of the case , can know nothing about the normal consumption of alcohol say that it is bad for you . Most French doctors do indeed hold that white wines taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This I should say is true in my own case and in those of several of my friends , for I have found that I can personally consume a quite large quantity of light red wines ? a couple of bottles or so at a sitting ? without feeling next morning any ill-effects at all whereas a relatively small quantity of quite good Chablis or Sauterne will give me more than a little hang-over . I should say that I am talking only of French wines in France . In England all wines have varying degrees of alcohol added to them by the wine merchant in order to conform to the public taste and to make them keep longer ? and the best French light wines practically never leave that country , either because they will not carry or because they will not keep for more than a year or so . And the same is true of the lightest , most delightful and most healthful of all wines , those from the Moselle and Sarre valleys . But see how difficult it is to write judicially ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , though all I mean is that they have been most healthful to me . And even at that I am quite aware that they may have proved most healthful simply because I have usually drunk them in situ , on the banks of the Moselle or the Sarre , in summer conditions of a great deal of air and exercise . And this brings me to my theme ? to my suggestion , for I am offering the public no more than suggestions . This is a good-humored , slightly cynical monologue , no preaching of a crusade , my suggestion being that the public ? the good , normal public ? should take its own rules of health much more in hand . If you think of it , what would you do if the souls to whom your priest had ministered were posthumously visible and you saw a large proportion of them writhing in flame from Tophet ? You would change your priest , possibly your parish , possibly even your denomination . Thereis , indeed , a Chinese legend to that effect . A stranger arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night when the souls of all their dead patients throng round the physicians ' doors . Round most of these doors there are great crowds . The stranger chooses one with only two dead attendants and puts himself under that doctor 's charge . Next morning he discovers that that doctor has been in practice for only two days . The stranger left that city precipitately . You see ! The Chinese are of an older civilization than our joint one which spans the Atlantic . Every Chinese child has that legend told to it by its careful mother : I have never heard the like of it in the Western World . The Germans have a practice of some value as a precautionary measure : They pay a doctor not by the visit but an annual lump sum to keep the family well . That is sensible , but even that will not protect you completely , for every practicer of medicine , being human and having been professionally disciplined , is filled with esprit de corps and inhibitions . One will insist on prescribing buttermilk and salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; another will operate on you for appendicitis if your head but aches . Others delight in finding that you have maladies ? like the doctor of my young friend ? for the sheer love of the thing . So that it would be a good thing if before employing him you could be engaged to your doctor as you are to your wife before marriage . That , I suppose , is impracticable ; one usually employs a doctor on someone 's recommendation , which appears to be the only way ; but it is a good thing to make careful inquiries as to a medical practitioner 's fads before accepting the recommendations of your friends . In my pre-converted days I knew a doctor who insisted on giving everyone belladonna , which is quite a good thing in its way but which acts very differently upon various individuals . One artist I knew went temporarily blind merely because she spent some time in arranging deadlynightshade plants in order to make a botanical drawing , and I myself am so susceptible to its action that if I put a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyesight . Before I knew this my friend the doctor ? he was such a nice fellow ! ? prescribed belladonna for me for the sequelx of influenza . My eyesight became so blurred that I went to an oculist who accused me of having used belladonna to enlarge my pupils . At that I told my friend the doctor that he must give me no more belladonna , and he substituted strychnine . But the next time he prescribed for me he gave me belladonna . Another good method when engaging a new doctor is to let him prescribe a complete regimen for you . You will , of course , pay no attention to his regimen and , as far as possible , you will deafen your ears to his remarks about your health , otherwise by auto-suggestion you will acquire the diseases to which he declares you to be liable . I may cite in parentheses the case of an American friend I had long , long ago . He used to invite me to his house to eat Welshrarebit ? at the confection of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to consume salads , at the making of which I considered myself an adept . One day I said to him that I wondered at his eating Welsh-rarebit late at night because it was terribly indigestible . He wondered , in reply , that I could eat anything so indigestible as salad . ( You see how long ago it was ! ) Ever after that he suffered tortures after eating his dish , and I could not eat lettuce without gastric pains . I will now interpolate a great truth and then return to the consideration of how to deal with doctors ? two great truths : one is that what is one man 's meat is another man 's poison . This is ! mown to everyone but doctors and the kindly persons who are interested in your health . The other is that nothing will do you any harm that you like . Nothing will do you any harm if you like it . To return to the choice of a physician . After you have got your regimen you will send to him for regimens for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each unlike the other and yourself in temperament , bodily habit , and complexion . You will then compare his recommendations , If they prove to be the same in each case ? for a tall , lean , dark man , as for a bullet-shaped man with red hair and a tendency to gout , you will go to another doctor and begin again , and so again until you find one who varies his recommendations to suit his patients , and does not , regarding his art as a sacred mystery , insist that the physical necessities of every man should bow to the dictates of his theory . This would be a practical and fairly sensible way of dealing with the matter , but there is this warning to be uttered : this is merely a method of selecting a doctor to whom to go in ease of actual illness , not for selecting a permanent medical adviser . This functionary no man should ever install , for , in what I would call living through the green , by the use of only a small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best guide for himself in matters of health . And this should begin with your children , particularly in the matter of diet . A child should be allowed to eat what it likes and as much or as little as it likes of what it likes . If a child likes potatoes it should he given as many potatoes as it wants ; if it likes meat as much meat as it wants ? or as much sugar , or as much pie , or as much or as little fruit . Medieval doctrines of abstention as a road to godliness and seventeenth-century superstition as to the avoidance of damnation by denial remain so ingrained in us that even parents who allow their children to be the most infernal nuisances so as to avoid inhibitions in the child in after life ? even those parents will flinch at the idea of letting a child follow its natural inclination in the matter of diet . Yet it is the merest common sense to recognize that if you force a child 's inclination in regard to food you are inculcating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will cause it in after life to indulge in every kind of dietetic excess . If we Anglo Saxons are to-day two nations of dyspeptics and hypochondriacs ( for there is nothing to choose between the English and the American , and if I write more about American instances it is because of late years I have seen ten times as many Americans as English people . The English consume fewer packet goods and fewer horrors in the way of cereals with delusive names , but their approaches to their health , their dietetic superstitious , proportions and doctorings are almost identical ) , if , then , we Anglo Saxons are two nations of dyspeptics and hypochondriacs , it is largely because of the ignorance and the dietetic devil-worshipping of our parents . We have all been forced to clean up our plates when we had no appetite , to eat , say , cabbage when our systems revolted against it ; we have all been refused food when Nature told us that we needed it , and the consequence is that when in after life we are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with ourselves and are at the mercy of every crazemonger and of every advertiser with sufficient capital to force himself upon our attention . As the power of the priest has waned and our thoughts are less and less fixed on the affairs of the next world , so the power of physical superstition has gained and gained . It has , indeed , gained all the more with the disappearance of the religious-ethical factor . In the Middle Ages the Church would enforce days or periods of abstention , and probably health was the better for it . But this was done in the name of morality , not of health , so that hypochondria was not encouraged and hardly existed . We are accustomed to dwell on the superstitious dreads of the Middle Ages , but I question whether it is not better to go in dread of a personal devil or of hobgoblins in churchyards than to live in a perpetual state of concern for one 's health . But the unfortunate child of to-day who is whined at by parents and nurses to take something or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , " or who is refused something that it likes and , therefore , needs because it will cause him to have some disease or other , is at once auto-suggested into a tendency towards those very complaints . No child should ever be induced to think about its health , and it is far better , if you can not bring yourself not to meddle with your unfortunate youngster , to say to him , " You sha n't have it , you little devil , because I say you sha n't ! " than with every term of endearment to reason against the unfortunate 's desire for another spoonful of jam on the plea that jam causes acidity of the stomach . Of course a child that is left to itself will occasionally over-eat certain substances , but it will not do that twice with the same food , the automatic memory of the stomach causing nausea at the idea , and thus gradually it will evolve a system of diet which will leave it free from all cause ever to think of digestive troubles its life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small price to pay for lifelong immunity ; and it is astonishing to observe in children who are allowed to choose their own foods how moderately they eat and how their chosen diet resembles that of a sensible and rather frugal adult . But that is , of course , not the case with a child that has been already badgered about its appetite , for it will have developed all sorts of abnormal tastes . I remember that , as a child , I was always forbidden to eat ham , cream , and cheese of any kind except Dutch cheese . The result has been that , whilst still steadily disliking Dutch cheese , in after life when left to myself I consumed such quantities of ham , cream , and every kind of cheese that now I hate the sight of them ? which is a pity because they are handy comestibles in days when domestic help is scarce- This , of course , is the merest adumbration of what is the vastest subject in the world of to-day but , after I shall have related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave it at that , since it is a matter in which every man can think for himself once the originating suggestion has reached him . My conversion took place in this way : my mother was the most careful of parents , and her injunctions made me the most careful of sons . I was impressed with the fact that I had a weak heart , an enlarged liver , a tendency towards tuberculosis , hereditary gout , and throat troubles ? these last suggested by the eminent throat specialist who killed my father by telling him to get up and go about his business because there was nothing the matter with his throat . Actually he was suffering from a heart rendered temporarily weak by erysipelas and dropped dead at his bedside immediately after the specialist had left the room . That gentleman operated on my own throat six times ? for tonsils and adenoids ? that in itself being pretty bad for an already nervous child of eight . Thus , in short , from my tenderest infancy I was taught to watch my health at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and no human being can have had a much more miserable inner life than myself . Not much more ! Then , when I was twenty-three or so I had the epilepsy-dread which , after I was thirty or so induced a nervous breakdown that lasted a year and a half during which I was unable to walk , forbidden to work , and reduced in weight to one hundred and twenty-eight pounds . I was taken to visit at least seven of the most eminent nerve-specialists in Europe ? including Vienna ! ? and those gentlemen doing nothing to mend me , I came home to die . Then Conrad recommended my seeing his own general practitioner . This gentleman ? I owe him eternal gratitude ? was of the most mournful cast of countenance I have ever seen . He sat beside my bed for three hours and a half , sayingvery little and scrutinizing me all the time infinitely lugubriously through very large spectacles . Then he answered the first question I had put to him : might n't I do a little work because I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He answered : " Yes , you may as well do a little work . You will be dead in a month ! " and that was all he did say . I exclaimed on the instant , " By God ! I wo n't ! " And I sprang out of bed , dressed , took a hansom to Piccadilly Circus , and walked backwards and forwards across it innumerable times , through the traffic ? and from that day to this I have been able to walk pretty well ? as well , mean , as most people . . . . It was that doctor who first told me that nothing ? eating , drinking , or smoking , will do you any harm as long as you do not think it will . He cured all his patients at one sitting ? gazing at them as he had done for me , for hours , occasionally asking a question . Then he would write a prescription that cured them ? but he never suggested diets . Well , at the end of a month I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not dead . " He answered , " If I had n't said you would be dead you would have been ! " / had by that time finished my book ? it was about Holbein ? and had begun another , but , although my nervous breakdown was finished , I had not yet faith enough even in that doctor to be finally cured of my hypochondria . He told me to eat what I wanted and do what I liked , but I still lived on half a handful of rice a day , drank only warmish water , and followed the rice with half a handful of pepsin tablets . And I still weighed practically nothing , though I no longer lost flesh . Salvation came to me in New York . I was asked to lunch at the Players ' Club by a gentleman who , although a qualified physician , was , by the stern decree of his father , touring the United States as an actor . He is now professor of biology at the University of Cambridge . That sounds an eccentric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says he to me , " Have some beer ! " And I scream , " My God , it would kill me ! " He , " Have some lobster Mornay ! " I faintingly produce my little packet of flaked rice and my dozen pepsin tablets . Then he propounded his theory of life which saved me and would save any man . " Eat , " he said , " always what you like and nothing but what you like . If what you like disagrees with you , eat it all the more . I mean , if you like grilled lobster and it disagrees with you , eat it every night for a fortnight before retiring . At first you will feel baddish , but you will know what is the matter with you and will have no extraneous fears . And the unpleasant feelings will lessen as your stomach disciplines itself until at last you will feel no inconvenience at all . Do that with all the food you like , in turn , and you will arrive at the happy condition of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , you will be immensely improved physically and much brighter mentally . But never eat an ounce more or an ounce less than you are disposed to ! " By that counsel I have abided for twenty-one years and I have never looked back and never thought about my health . And do not believe that it is reckless counsel or leads to gluttony ! I am personally an extremely abstemious person and rarely eat more than one meal a day , and that quite a small one ? at any rate in periods when I work ; for naturally during sedentary periods one needs less nourishment than during periods when one can take a great deal of exercise . I find that my appetite for long periods leads me to eat almost nothing but meat , and at others very little but fruit and cooked vegetables , and I find that my tastes change curiously . At the end of the War ? probably because during that period we did not get enough fat ? I had a passion for sardines and olive oil and oranges , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do green peas , spinach , and lettuce , all of which I used to like very much . Thus Nature readjusts her balances . I do not mean to say that such a rule of life is very easy to carry out . You can not always get just what you like , and occasionally at the solicitation of someone else you must eat something that you do not much like , or for reasons of politeness at someone else 's too hospitable board you must cat more than you want . For myself I never do either of those things but that automatically and without escape I suffer from indigestion and dizziness . For instance , I was lately induced to try a morning course of some of that Effervescent Saline Combination that I have catalogued above . I was told that it would restore to me all the lightness and gaiety that I did not have in my youth , and I hoped that it might . But for three days it made me feel very ill , so I gave it up . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been conferred upon us by Nature , by the Deity , or by a process of the survival of the fittest , or by what you will . And , to speak anthropomorphically , for I am not concerned with the niceties of neo-scientific diction , they have been conferred upon us for a purpose . They are there , if we will let them be , to be our guides towards health . We never insist upon our horses , cats , pigs , dogs , or poultry consuming diets unnatural or distasteful to them ; we are ready to allow that all wild animals know what is good for them . Why , then , do we enforce these measures upon ourselves ? Is man with his lofty intelligence , with his achievements , his methods of government , of warfare , of justice , of communication ? is man who aspires to the heavens with his skyscrapers and scours them with his airplanes ? in this particular a little lower than the beasts that perish and the worm that never sees the light ?     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
