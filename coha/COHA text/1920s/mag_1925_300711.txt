The Last of Mrs. Cheyney . Before the dawn of realism , romanticism , expressionism and the other isms by which the modern theatre is cataloged , there was a type of drawing room comedy which served as staple entertainment . Wilde , Pinero and Henry Arthur Jones all worked industriously in this medium , thereby gaining fame and gold . Of late years the drawing room has been virtually unoccupied . Nice people saying casual , witty things have nearly vanished . Therefore it is a great novelty to see one of these comedies again , suavely , smartly written by Frederick Lonsdale ( Are n't We All ) and even more suavely and smartly played by Ina Claire , Roland Young and A. E. Matthews . <P> The framework for their pleasantries is inconsequential . Mrs. Cheyney is suddenly discovered in society after a somewhat mysterious widowhood in far Australia . Two eligible lords promptly propose marriage , and are somewhat nonplused to find that she is a pearl-thief masked by a shrewd overlay of charm and manner . She repents in time , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> If there is a surer and more irresistible comedienne on our stage than Ina Claire , theatre-goers have not seen her . Never did she play better . There are few leading actors so convincingly attractive as Mr. Young and Mr. Matthews . Of its type this entertainment has not been equaled this season , nor indeed since the same playwright 's Are n't We All so agreeably occupied the time of Cyril Maude . <P> The Last Night of Don Juan . Edmond Rostand is best known in the U. S. for Cyrano de Bergerac , which Walter Hampden has been performing with such marked success on and off for the past two seasons . This play of his has never before been done in the U. S. It is now given at the Greenwich Village Theatre in the translation of Sidney Howard , and provides a curiously contradictory evening . <P> Don Juan is discovered on the brink of Hell ; he obtains from the Devil ten years ' respite ; and is finally seen as the ten years end . The Devil brings back to damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> There is great beauty of line in the text ; greater beauty of line , mass and color in the settings of James Reynolds . Philosophical sagacity and finesse are provided in the argument , but the acting too often bleaches the brilliance of these formidably favorable factors . Stanley Logan and Augustin Duncan play Don Juan and the Devil ; Mr. Logan gives a rather inept performance ; Mr. Duncan only a fairly good one . <P> As a curtain-raiser the bill includes The Pilgrimage , a character study of small town life in France by Charles Vildrac . It was agreeable and excellently acted . <P> Hamlet , in modern clothes . The unusual but no less logical experiment of producing the greatest play of all time in the livery of the present has been made . It is declared almost unanimously one of the most successful theatrical experiments of recent years .
