txt // midway between front and back ; in fact , there may be a whole series of sounds between i and u , between the initial sounds of the diphthongs ay and ow , and between e ( " men " ) and o ( " obey " ) . Such vowels are German u , French u ( between i and u ) and Germano , French eu ( between o and e ) . They are called abnormal vowels . The vowel of English " club " and " summer " is an abnormal vowel not very different from the a of " father , " but closer . The familiar classification of vowels as long or short is quite distinct from the matters which we have been discussing . A long vowel is simply one which is held for a relatively long time . There may therefore be an indefinite number of degrees of length . The traditional division of vowels into two quantitative classes probably never fitted any language ; that it did not fit Latin and Greek is shown by the numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same line with iambs ( , , - ) or trochees (  --  ) . In English we may observe three degrees of quantity in " not , " " naught , " and " gnawed . " A difference in quantity appears , not only in vowels , but also in all consonants except the stops . Long consonants are not common in English , except in compounds such as " illegal , " " unknown , " " unnatural , " and in such phrases as " some more , " " our rights . " The common description of such sounds as double consonants has some justification in the fact that the syllable division falls within them and makes them appear to be divided into two parts . Some scholars speak also of long stops , but here the splitting of the sound into two parts is so striking that // the common name of double sounds is better . A stop is produced by two acts : the closing of the mouth passage and the sudden opening of it . Neither of these acts can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a slight pause between the closure and the opening during which no sound is produced . Double stops occur in English under the same circumstances as long consonants , for example , " rat-trap , " " a good deed . " The various speech-sounds differ from one another in sonorousness , that is , in the amount of sound . It is easier to hear the vowels than the consonants , and consequently children who are just learning to speak pronounce their vowels better than their consonants . For the same reason it is of the utmost importance for a public speaker to pronounce his vowels distinctly ; he can make his hearers understand them under circumstances which make the hearing of some consonants impossible , and the hearers will then be able to supply such of the consonants as they have not been able to hear . The voiced consonants are more easily heard than the unvoiced , the open vowels than the close . The least sonorous sound is h . These variations are to be observed in case the energy of pronunciation remains constant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given sound so that it will be heard more easily or less so , by simply increasing or diminishing the force of the breath , that is , the stress of pronunciation . The resultant of these two factors is the intensity of speech . During a sentence the intensity constantly varies in a series of waves of uneven height . These waves are the syllables . In // other words , the syllable divisions are points of less intensity than the neighboring sounds . If the syllable division falls within a long consonant ( " illegal , " " unnatural " ) , that is due solely to a lessening of stress . In most cases , however , there is a decrease of sonorousness at the syllable division . Note the difference between " un-til , " " ant-hill , " and " in-stil . " If a consonant of greater sonorousness stands between two consonants of less sonorousness , the group constitutes a syllable , as in " likened , " in which the second syllable contains no vowel . A consonant is the most sonorous sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " little , " " heaven , " and many other words . The last-mentioned word , however , may be pronounced as one syllable by reducing the stress of n until its intensity falls below that of v. It is more difficult to reduce " letter " to one syllable , because of the greater difference in sonorousness between t and r , and such a pronunciation is never heard in English . While each syllable wave involves an increase of intensity , the maximum of intensity , that is , the height of the wave , varies from syllable to syllable . Here , as elsewhere , intensity depends partly upon sonorousness and partly upon stress . A familiar term for stress as it applies to syllables is accent . The latter word was originally used of a very different modification of syllables ; for Latin accentus is derived from cano " sing , " and was used to translate Greek 7rpovc ) Sia " pitch . " The word is still used in this sense , especially in the phrase , pitch accent . An increase in stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some languages , as Latin , the two variations // are so nearly equal in importance that they may be treated together under the term accent . In other languages , as in English , the rise in pitch is slight , and the increase in stress is relatively strong . In still other languages the variation in pitch is great , and the variation in stress is so slight as to have no importance . This was the case with ancient Greek . The foregoing remarks , however , apply merely to syllabic accent . Even languages like English , which have scarcely any pitch accent , nevertheless make extensive use of variation in pitch for modifying the meaning of sentences and phrases , as in the " rising inflection " of certain kinds of questions . Relation between Form and Meaning One of the first linguistic problems to attract the attention of the thinkers of ancient Greece was this : Do the meanings of words belong to them inherently and naturally , or have men merely agreed to attach certain meanings to certain words ? The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his time . It is not strange that men should have seen something inevitable in the meanings of words ; for no man can change them . We may call a man a horse and a horse a man ; but both we and all who hear us will be quite conscious that we are speaking incorrectly . Even if a community should pass a law that the word " horse " should hereafter mean " man , " the law would be almost as absurd and quite as ineffectual as the bill once introduced in a certain legislature that the area of a circle should equal the square of one-fourth of its circumference . // Nevertheless it is perfectly certain that the meaning of words is not ordained by nature . To say nothing of homonyms , such as English " mine " and " sun " ( " son " ) , or of the difference in meaning between Latin to and English " two " and between Latin laus and English " louse , " it can not be true that a single object is naturally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin , Sonne in German , soleil in French , etc . Somehow or other the meaning of each word is a matter of convention . In some cases this is obvious enough . There is general agreement among scientists that the discoverer of a new species or a new element has the right to name it . In other matters different scholars are likely to invent rival terms for the same idea . In grammar there has graduallygrown up a perfect forest of technical terms , so that , in the hope of making it once more possible to see through the undergrowth , a committee of grammarians has recently devised a uniform system of terminology . In some of the South Sea Islands it is forbidden to speak the name of the reigning monarch or any word that resembles his name . If then a new king 's name resembles the word for " house " or " bread " or " father , " a new word has to be agreed upon . The reason why we do not more often witness these linguistic agreements is simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each generation adopts a few of its own , but in general it merely accepts the conventions of an earlier day . Imitation For the most part , then , each generation gets its language from the preceding generation by imitation , // just as it learns all the other activities of life . For speech is from the start quite on a par with the rest of our customs ; all are learned in the same way . At first a child 's movements have little resemblance to those of his elders , and the sounds of his first meaningless prattle are very much more numerous and diverse than the sounds of any language . Little by little he acquires the bodily motions which he sees in others , and his sounds come more and more to resemble the speechsounds which he hears . As he grows older , he imitates more closely the particular ways of eating , walking , and sitting that are employed by his elders ; for example , it is as easy for a child to sit on the floor as in a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too wants a chair . At the same time the child learns to speak more and more precisely in the manner of the community . Throughout life we are governed in all our actions by the customs of our associates . The influence of imitation in matters of dress has often been discussed , but few realize how far-reaching it is . Men sometimes blame women for following the rapidly shifting fashions of women 's dress , and women sometimes ridicule men for adhering to the stupidly rigid custom of wearing coats in summer . The women usually retort that they like a little change and that there is really something to be said for the latest type of skirt or hat . Men say that they really do not mind a coat , even in hot weather . Both imply that they could defy the fashions if they chose ; but , as a matter of fact , we can not without great discomfort dress in any but the usual way . I once found it convenient to wear an academic cap for a trip of two miles along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so uncomfortable that I borrowed a ht for my return trip . 4 Just as fashions in dress are binding upon all members of a given class and are imitated by all who look up to that class , so fashions in language are binding upon all people of culture and are followed by other members of the community to the best of their ability . This is irksome for those who rise from a lower to a higher class in the community , or who go from a provincial neighborhood to a college or university . It is not easy , and it often seems quite useless or even disloyal to one 's origin , to alter one 's speech at the behest of fashion ; but in many cases the thing must be done . Actors with an American accent can not easily secure an engagement in England . A strong western r is a distinct hindrance to a man who is trying to make his way in the East or the South of the United States , while a Bostonian pronunciation is not tolerated in some circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fashion is of recent growth , or at least that it is confined to civilized society . Many have sighed for the freedom in matters of dress that is supposed to belong to savage life . It is true that sudden and violent changes of fashion are of recent date , but the decrees of fashion were formerly even more peremptory than they are today . It would , in fact , be difficult to find a period when there has been greater variety of dress among people of a given class than there is now , or when departures from the mode have been more leniently treated . Among savages a variation from the usual form of loin cloth or nose ring is almost unthinkable ; for among them the individual is nothing , the tribe everything . // /Fashion in speech follows similar laws . In a group of savages there is scarcely any individual variation , although there may be differences between the speech of men and of women , between that of the old and of the young . With us individual variations are rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated people includes persons of different linguistic training and habits . Many a variation from the norm , however , is felt to be almost serious enough to exclude a man from polite society ; such , for example , are " ai n't , " " them people , " " me and him was there . " Many other variations are disapproved but tolerated , for example , the New Englander 's " lawr " and " idear , " the Westerner 's " carrt , " the Kentucky " kyaht , " the Alabama " cawt . " In many other cases we hear a pronunciation different from our own and can scarcely tell which of the two we prefer ; is " int'resting " preferable to " interesting ? " If the tyranny of fashion has relaxed its rigor , it has enormously extended the territory over which its decrees are binding . The modistes of Paris are supreme in Berlin , San Francisco , and Buenos Aires , and a linguistic fashion that is set in London is followed in New York and Cape Town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , some of which are larger than any that have previously existed . This development has been made possible by the increased intercourse between different parts of the world ; there has been an enormous growth of commerce and travel , which has brought into intimate personal relationship great numbers of men who dwell far apart . // Even those who live all their lives in one locality come to know many persons from a distance and are thus subjected to the influence of the fashions of places which they have never seen . Furthermore , those members of the community who travel most are in general the very ones who are most respected and imitated . Consequently it is the most influential part of society which exerts its influence for uniformity . Intercourse by the written word is also increasing with unexampled rapidity ; all educated persons come almost daily into contact with language from distant regions , either in letters , newspapers , and magazines , or in pamphlets and books . This sort of intercourse , however , does not affect all linguistic phenomena , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordmeaning , vocabulary , and syntax . Pronunciation remains unaffected because it is not indicated ; the native of New Orleans reads aloud a letter from Boston precisely as he would a letter from Baton Rouge . Correspondence and literature can not make for uniformity of pronunciation until our orthography is phonetic and each writer conscientiously indicates his own pronunciation . The influence of literature is re-enforced by the schools ; for in general the teachers inculcate the usage of the best writers . Effective pedagogy , however , calls for a certain amount of dogmatism , and so the teachers often erect a literary tendency into a rule that must have no exceptions ; hence such classroom bogeys as " it 's me " or the " split infinitive . " Imitation is in general a conservative factor . It does , to be sure , frequently spread an innovation ? a // bronze shoe polish , a mincing gait , a morsel of slang , or a habit of making statements with a rising inflection . But as long as all members of the community confine themselves to imitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore the conservative force of imitation varies in proportion to the size of the community ; for each innovation is opposed by the influence of that part of the community which is as yet unaffected by it , and the larger the community the larger the majority against each incipient change . Change in Language We might suppose , then , that language would remain forever stationary . But everyone knows that languages change ; the English of Shakespeare and of the King James version of the Bible is strikingly unlike the English of the present day , while Chaucer is scarcely intelligible without a glossary . It is our purpose to consider the causes and modes of linguistic change . Since language is a purely conventional affair , maintained and handed down by imitation , changes in language must come from one of two sources . There may be a change in the model , that is , in the speech of the person or persons who at the moment set the lin-guistic fashion . Such innovations are constantly arising in the speech of each one of us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intentional , we call forced uses of words or awkward sentences ; still others , which are fully intentional , we call figures of speech or coined words or new phrases . Most of such innovations are purely momentary and have no influence upon the language , but every now and then one of them finds // imitators . After a strenuous day of speechmaking in New Jersey , Mr. Roosevelt emphatically denied the suggestion that he was tired : " Why ! I feel like a bull moose , " he exclaimed . At the moment the phrase was effective , just because it was personal and original ; there was no reason to suppose that it would gain more currency than any of the other similes for a tireless man . But the reporters adopted the phrase and turned it into a metaphor ; they made Mr. Roosevelt himself a bull moose , and presently his followers were called by the same name . In all such cases there are two processes to be distinguished : the origin of the innovation in an individual speaker may be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other speakers may be called a secondary change . The other possible source of linguistic change is a change of models ; a new king may ascend the throne and his subjects begin to follow his speech rather than that of his predecessor ; or a neighboring community may make such advances in power or in culture that people imitate its speech . A few generations ago the common model for American English was the pulpit , although the really great writers had better models and thus escaped the pomposity of their contemporaries . Nowadays we scarcely have a common model in America : some of us try to follow the usage of the great writers , others the usage of the English aristocracy , still others take Broadway or the sporting page of the newspapers for their model ; but we are all agreed in avoiding the solemn style of our ancestors . Such a change as this has something foreign about it ; an uninterrupted development of : he pulpit style could scarcely have yielded present-day // American English in so short a time . Whether we be Anglo-maniacs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in large part foreign to the speech of our ancestors . A change of models , then , involves a mixture of dialects , even if the new model is only slightly different from the old . There is no question here of the origination of a change ; the new model is in existence before it is chosen . The choice of the model is an important phenomenon which will claim our attention later on ( pages 151 f. ) ; but , as far as specific linguistic changes are concerned , dialect mixture involves only the spread by imitation which we have called secondary change . Another division of the subject of linguistic change is based upon the speech-material affected . We have change in the form of words , change in the meaning of words , change in vocabulary , and change in syntax . Primary change and secondary change require separate treatment only as far as they apply to change in form . In all other cases secondary change is so simple that there is little to be said about it beyond what has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) . CHAPTER II PRIMARY CHANGE OF FORM Under this head we should treat only the momentary changes of form , most of which are unintentional and without permanent effect upon language . But we are confronted by a serious difficulty : there are no extensive collections of lapses available for any language except German . In 1895 Meringer and Mayer published under the title Versprechen and Verlesen lists of mistakes which they had observed , and in 1908 Meringer published supplementary lists under the title Aus dem Leben der Sprache . The data presented in these two books are of the utmost value , and those in the earlier one have been used by almost every writer on linguistic science in the last twenty years . No one , however , has hitherto published similar observations upon other languages , and Meringer himself notes that there is reason to believe that other languages follow different tendencies to some extent . Even for the German itself we may suspect that some curious gaps in Meringer 's material are due in part to the personal equation . Some English examples have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the Psychological Review , Supplement III , No. 4 ( 1900 ) , but the rather scanty material is not presented in enough detail , and the classification is not satisfactory for linguistic purposes . Fortunately the more permanent changes of linguistic form furnish an indirect record of many other mistakes in pronunciation ; for we have seen that all of the 32 // former which are not due to dialect mixture originated in a momentary variation in the speech of an individual . We may therefore use as illustrations mistakes inferred from secondary linguistic change . Mistakes during the Learning of a Language Human hearing is barely adequate to the demands which language makes upon it . Although our public halls are built according to certain acoustic principles , many speakers have difficulty in making themselves heard by a large audience . Even if a speaker is fuliy understood , it does not follow that the audience hears all his speech-sounds ; for we readily supply a great deal from our knowledge of the situation and of what the speaker is likely to say . It is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fragments of a sentence and at first make so little out of it that we ask to have it repeated , the meaning nevertheless flashes upon us before the repetition comes . When we try to understand a list of unconnected words or an unfamiliar name , the difficulty of understanding is much increased ; for in such cases we are dependent upon the sense of hearing alone : the mind can supply nothing . A child is able to supply far less than an adult ; at first he can add nothing at all to what his ears bring him , and it is only by degrees that he acquires familiarity with one sentence or phrase after another . In the meantime he is certain to misinterpret many of the sounds which come to his ears ? to " hear " incorrectly . A certain child habitually said " I'n " for " I 'm " until his seventh year . The pronunciation was not to be heard in his environment , and he showed no tendency to // substitute It for m in other words ; he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm . " Another child of seven or eight who said " perpelicular " for " perpendicular " apparently reproduced what she thought she heard . Until my thirtieth year I pro-nounced " trough " as " trouth . " I Until that time I had never realized that others said " trouf " ; and even then I became aware of my mistake only by seeing a printed list of words with gh for the sound f . Such cases are probably rare among literate persons ; I could not long have retained my illusion if it had not been for the curiously perverse spelling of the word " trough . " With young children , however , such mistakes as " brof " for " broth " are very common , and many of them must last throughout life in the speech of illiterate persons . When a child first undertakes to imitate speech-sounds , he does n't know what muscles to use to secure the desired effect . He sees some few motions of the lips and the lower jaw , and that fact undoubtedly helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in learning to talk . Still in the main a child can repro-duce the sound he hears only by a process of trial and test . Small wonder that his first attempts are far from successful . If the child hears correctly the sound to be imitated he will not be permanently satisfied until he has himself produced what he conceives to be the same sound ; but he may be content with an apparently or approximately identical sound produced by a faulty articulation . My daughter pronounced th with the // tip of the tongue thrust forward between the teeth , and neither she nor any of the household became aware of the peculiarity until her twelfth year . Meringer reports several cases of children who pronounced s with the lips closed except for an opening at the right corner of the mouth . This articulation seems in the cases reported to have been acquired by imitation ; but it probably started with some child 's experiments in reproducing the sound . The suffix seen in Latin vehiclum ( the early form of vehiculum ) was originally - tlom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place due to a defect of hearing . Possibly a child heard - tlom correctly and was satisfied with the approximation - clom , although we should not expect such satisfaction to be permanent . There is also a third possibility , which will serve to illustrate the complicated nature of many apparently simple linguistic phenomena . Perhaps the first at-tempt to reproduce the sound - tlom led to - clom , and then a correction was made by keeping the surface of the tongue in the c-position and at the same time putting the tip of the tongue in the t-position . The resulting sound would be much nearer the desired - tlom than the first attempt was , but the complicated articulation would be more liable to alteration than an ordinary t . A speaker who intended the combined articulation would frequently say - clom by mistake . Thus a faulty articu-lation of a nearly correct sound would form an inter-mediate step in the change . A similar case is dialectic German dlauben for glauben ; it may have started with a child 's defective hearing , possibly with a careless approxi-mation to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a defective articulation of a sound which was virtually the same as gl . Many cases of lisping probably began as a result of defective hearing , but in the later stages the lispers are likely to be conscious of their mistake , while not knowing how to correct it . Very few cases are due to physical defects . The mispronunciations of an adult who learns a foreign language are similar in origin to the mistakes of children in learning their mother-tongue . It is said that in the minutes of several French societies the name of the poet Schiller occurs with an initial G , as if it began with a voiced sound ( the zh of " azure " ) . Since French has a voiceless s/i , one must assume that the secretaries of the several societies heard incorrectly . No two languages employ precisely the same sounds , and therefore a foreigner knows no better than a child how to produce certain sounds in the language he is learning . But , instead of making a series of experiments , as a child would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own language . A Frenchman pronounces English " pin " so that it sounds to us more as if spelt " peen " ; he is substituting the French close short i for the English open short i . The vulgar American " dis " and " dat " for " this " and " that " may have originated with foreigners who had no th-sound in their native languages . Such phenomena as these really belong to the subject of dialect mixture ; the man who learns a foreign language may be said to have adopted a new model , and the mixture results from the difficulty he has in giving up his earlier linguistic habits . But since his mistakes are inadvertent , they stand in the same relation to the // language he is learning as do the mistakes of a child . As a rule the use of a language by foreigners who have imperfectly mastered it has little permanent influence upon that language ; the foreign peculiarities are felt to be undesirable by all who hear them , and so they are rarely imitated except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer ideas appear to be simple bits of mental experience , they are really composite . The simplest psychological fact is a sensation , that is , a mental process which comes to consciousness by way of one of the organs of sense . Sensations do not occur singly ; for example , if I touch a piece of ice , I get a sensation of cold and a sensation of pressure . If my eyes are open , I am at the same time getting some kind of a sight sensation . All these sensations combined form the basis of the perception " piece of ice . " An idea is a remembered or imagined perception , and , as a perception is based upon sensations , so an idea is based upon remembered sensations . A given sensation occurs in a great many ideas . The sensation of cold forms part of the basis of the idea of " ice , " of " snow , " of " frost , " of " winter , " etc . When for any reason the brain cells concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas based upon that sensation is likely to come into consciousness . Since the perception of " ice " involves such an excitation , that perception is likely to lead to the ideas " snow , " " frost , " " winter , " etc . Ideas which tend to accompany or follow one another in consciousness are said to be associated , but the term association of ideas should not suggest to us // that ideas are tied up in bundles as it were . Ideas are associated because they contain common elements . It frequently happens that two associated ideas come into consciousness in such quick succession that the reactions of the second interrupt the still uncom-pleted reactions of the first . This process is known as associative interference . Analogy Oertell tells of hearing Bishop Potter say " evoid " and at once correct himself , " both avoid and evade . " The idea " evade " first entered consciousness and set up its reaction , the pronunciation of the word ; then the idea " avoid " crowded out the first idea and interfered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistic point of view , at first the word " evade " was the more prominent of the two in thought , and then " avoid " intruded its second syllable . Very often , as in this case , a sound which is common to both words acts as a sort of switch to facilitate the shift from one to the other . We may figure the process thus ( after Oertel ) , using capital letters for the sounds actually spoken : Figure Such a common element , however is not necessarily present at the point where the shift occurs . Meringer and Mayer report Abscnatt resulting from the synonyms Abschnitt and Absatz . A similar case which has become normal is English " female . " In French , male and femelle have no etyPRIMARY // mological connection and only a slight similarity of form . When both words were borrowed by the English their close association in meaning changed femelle into " female . " Viewed superficially the process may be described as a modification of the one word on the analogy of the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since this suggests correctly enough the linguistic result , it would scarcely be worth while to substitute a term more exactly descriptive of the psychological phenomena . When two words interfere with each other in such a way that the resulting word contains about equal parts of both , the process is sometimes called contamination . Bawden ( p. 23 ) reports the slips " Equals " from the contamination of " liquids " and " linguals , " " ruvershoes " from " rubbers " and " overshoes , " " dreeze " from " draft " and " breeze , " " perple " from " persons " and " people , " " spaddle " from " ' spank " and " paddle . " " Beginning " and " commencement " yield " begincement . " A negro politician combined " insinuation " and " innuendo " in " insinuendo . " Sometimes the result of associative interference between two words is identical in form with one of the words , and we detect the interference only by the combination of the meaning of one word with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes " becomes " to wrench clothes , " the two words being associated on the basis of the twisting motion which forms an element of both ideas . The boys whom Mark Twain has immortalized in Tom Sawyer say " marvels " for " marbles . " If the association which leads to analogical change involves a false theory of the etymology of the word // affected , the change is said to be due to popular ety-mology . In Anglo-Saxon guma meant " man , " and brydguma meant " bride-man " ; but in the course of time guma fell out of use , and the second member of the compound was popularly connected with " groom " ; hence modern " bridegroom . " French outrage is connected with Latin ultra , being derived from *ultragiuml or *ultraticum " excess . " The English pronunciation with a full vowel in the unaccented syllable ( contrast " usage , " " courage " ) is due to a false etymology from " out " and " rage . " Shakespeare 's " mandragora " has become " mandrake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " drake . " Latin inuleus " stag " became hinuleus through a popular etymology from hinnus " mule . " Many people pronounce " carousal " as if it were " carry-Sal " ; pronunciation , however , does not determine whether the synonymous " merry-go-round " is interpreted " Mary-go-round . " Many association groups are based , not upon mean-ing , but upon function , that is , upon what James2 has termed the " transitive " parts of the stream of consciousness . Our thought moves now more , now less , rapidly , and the regions of less rapid change ( " substan-tive " states of consciousness ) stand out so much more vividly that we are in danger of thinking that they constitute the whole of the stream of consciousness . I awake and see the sunlight streaming in at the window . I wonder whether it is time to get up . I look at my watch . Here are three clearly marked states of conPRIMARY // sciousness , the perception of the sunlight , the thought of getting-up time , and the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the train of thought lie feelings of relation between " **36;248;TOOLONG " and " is-it-time-to-get-up ? " ? between the latter and " look-at-my-watch . " The phrase " the road to Mandalay " represents or may represent three successive states of consciousness ( " the road " ? " direction " ? " the goal " ) of which the first and third are substantive and the second transitive . In the phrase " John 's book " the transitive state of consciousness is represented in connection with the first substantive state ; the word " John 's " has both wordmeaning and the function of possession . Properly , the function of a word is the relation which it bears to its context . It is convenient , however , to extend the term to such semantic elements as number , person , and tense , which are really parts of the substantive states of consciousness ( or of word-meaning ) , but which nevertheless determine to some extent the relationship of words to one another . On the basis of meaning the word " feet " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand " and the other words for parts of the body ; but it is also associated on the basis of function with all other plurals . Just so all present participles form one association group and all genitives another . Such groups as these are impressed on the mind of all speakers from the very fact that they are expressed in language , and the strength of the association varies directly with the clearness of the linguistic expression . The speakers of the Latin language had a clearly defined association group composed of // accusatives ; every speaker associated bovem with bonum , exercitum , hanc , etc. , just because most accusatives were marked by form , and the category had to be reckoned with almost every time a sentence was formed or heard . Consequently mistakes in the use of these forms were comparatively rare . In English , on the other hand , most accusatives are not distinguished by form , and therefore we have great difficulty in keeping " me , " " us , " " him , " " her , " " them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An analogical change of form resulting from a functional group is the childish " feets " for " feet . " The familiar word " feet " is interfered with and altered by the associated words " hands , " " lips , " " books , " " plates , " etc . " Worser " and " lesser " are the irregular comparatives of " worse " and " less " modified by the influence of the regular type ; by a strange chance " lesser " has become correct , that is , usual , while " worser " remains an outcast . Latin fib is conjugated in the present-stem tenses like an active verb ; its meaning , however , is passive , and the present infinitive fiere , which was still used by Ennius , was remodeled into fieri under the influence of amari , audiri , etc . In many cases the analogical influence of the functional group is a more complicated matter which we call analogical creation . A child in counting the various parts of his body says , " One hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lip , two lips ; one foot , two foots . " In this case we have , not a modification of something old , as in the case of " feets , " but a new creation on the basis of a known relationship . The process may be stated as a problem in proportion : // " lip " : " lips " = " foot " : x . The child gives the correct solution , " foots . " Such creations are very common in the speech of children and illiterate adults . Everyone has heard " catched " for " caught , " " growed " for " grew , " " oxes " for " oxen , " " yous " for " you " plural , " littler , " etc . " Brung " for " brought " arose from the proportion " sing " : " sung " = " bring " : x . Latin ipse is a compound of is and a particle pse , and was originally declined is-pse , ea-pse , accusative eum-pse , eam-pse , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall consider later , and then the other forms ( except the neuter ipsum ) were created on the analogy of iste and ille , that is , iste : ista= ipse : x . It is often doubtful whether a change is due to the simpler or to the more complex sort of analogy ? to mere associative interference or to analogical creation . The occasional pronunciation " naytional " is of course due to the word " nation " ; but it may be either a modification of " national " with associative interference by " nation , " or it may be a new derivative from " nation " on the model of such pairs as " convention " : " conventional , " " culture " : " cultural . " There is similar doubt about the origin of " preferable " with the accent of " prefer , " and of Latin consacro with the vowel of sacro , in place of the regular form consecro . The original genitive of the Latin fourth declension was the form in - us . In Plautus we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the second declension and the third . These forms may be analogical creations : amicus : amici = fructus : x ( fructi ) , seni ( dative ) : senis=anui ( dative ) : x ( anuis ) . - But it is also possible // that the old genitives fructus and anus were present to consciousness when the new forms were first pronounced and were altered by the simultaneous remembrance of a word or words with the same function . In many instances , no doubt , both processes co-operate in originating a linguistic change . Association within the Sentence A quite different sort of association is that based upon the structure of a sentence , phrase , or word . One usually has a considerable part of a sentence shaped in his mind before he begins to speak . As he proceeds , the several parts of the sentence come successively into the focus of consciousness ; but at any given moment the words already spoken , although they have passed out of the focus , are still present in the fringe of consciousness where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence which are yet to be uttered are gradually becoming more distinct in preparation for their emergence into the focus . One or another of these may rise into the focus out of its proper turn and interfere with the sound then being uttered . The most common occurrence of this kind is the anticipation of a word or syllable or sound which belongs later in the sentence . Bawden reports many such cases . A person intended to say " spring chicken , ten cents a pound , " but anticipation of the t of " ten " changed " chicken " into " ticken . " Other examples are " put my coat in your pocket " for " put my cup in your coat-pocket , " " praying on the street " for " playing on the street . " Meringer reports among many others the lapse das instruirle ? konstruirte Instrument ; the speaker // intended to say das konstruirte Instrument , but the second main word interfered with the first and altered its initial syllable ; he then detected his mistake and corrected it before completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for " it outweighs in value . " The forms which appear in the other Indo-European languages would lead one to expect English " four " and German vier to begin with h . The labial spirant which we actually find comes from the following numeral , English " five , " German funf . Similarly , the Latin word for " nine " ought to be *noven , with the same nasal that appears in nonus , but the anticipation of decem changed *noven to novem . Such changes as these and the converse alteration of a numeral under the influence of the one before it bear witness to the frequency of counting among primitive people who do not understand the simple arithmetical processes . When one word interferes with another , the sounds which come into conflict usually stand under the same accentual conditions . In " spring chicken , ten cents a pound , " the interfering sounds , ch and t , are the initials of the most emphatic syllables of the sentence . In das konstruirte Instrument , kon- and In- have the secondary accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , " w and v are initial consonants of accented syllables , and the same holds true of the interfering sounds of the numerals " four " and " five . " In novem and decem the conflicting nasals are final consonants of unaccented syllables . Sounds which are contiguous or separated by only a few other sounds may interfere with each other , even though they do not stand under the same accentual // conditions . Bawden cites " has the belly been passed ? " " belly " is " jelly " with interference by the initial of the next word . Of great linguistic importance is the assimilation of contiguous consonants . The compound " cupboard " was once pronounced as it is spelled ; after the first vowel the vocal chords ceased to vibrate as the lips were closed for the p-sound , the closure was maintained a moment , and then the vocal chords began to vibrate as the lips were opened . But some speaker anticipated the voice which is proper to b while he was closing the lips for p ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double consonant . The assimilation seen in Latin appono for adpono is a little more complicated in the muscular changes involved . The original sound-group consisted of a closure of the mouth passage in the d-position while the vocal chords were vibrating , then a closure of the lips , a relaxation of the d-contact , and finally an opening of the lips without accompanying voice . When the d was assimilated both the closure of the lips and the cessation of voice were anticipated . The change of inmitto to immitto involved merely the anticipation of the lip closure of m , while the change of oprnitto to ommitto involved the anticipation of voice and of the opening of the nasal passage . In these cases the assimilation results in the virtual identity of the two consonants . Frequently only some characteristic of the second consonant is anticipated , as when a voiced consonant before an unvoiced consonant loses its vocal quality , or an unvoiced consonant before a voiced consonant becomes voiced . When *opduco became obduco , the only change was that the vocal // chords began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p . Less frequently a consonant partially assimilates a preceding vowel . Latin novus is the same word as Greek ve6s ( originally veFgs ) , and so novus was once *nevos . A comparison with Gothic niun shows that the Latin word for " nine " changed from *neven to novem ; in both of these words ev became ov . The consonant w ( Latin v ) involves two partial closures of the mouth passage , one with the lips and the other between the surface of the tongue and the soft palate . The vowel o involves a lesser degree of closure a little farther forward in the mouth and also a slight closure of the lips . The vowel e , on the other hand , is a front vowel without closure of the lips . A change of e to o before the con-sonant w is therefore a partial assimilation . The assimilation of one vowel to another is most easily studied in the case where they are separated by one or more consonants . In nearly all of Meringer 's examples the two sounds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in con-tiguous syllables with different accent only in a few lapses such as viellaucht for vjelleicht auch and hat sock for hat Bich dock . Bawden reports " accustim " for " ac-custom him . " , At an early stage in the history of the West Germanic languages ( English , German , Dutch , etc. ) unaccented vowels exerted a widespread influence over the accented vowels of the initial syllables . In particular the vowel i in inflectional endings and suffixes tended to convert // back vowels into front or intermediate vowels . In Old High German the plural of lamb is lembir . AngloSaxon exhibits the modern contrast between " long " and " length " in the equivalent lang and lenggu , the latter of which was originally *lang-iba . In AngloSaxon the plural ending - iz of consonant stems was lost before our earliest documents were written , but we still see traces of it in such plurals as " men " from prehistoric *manniz and " feet " from prehistoric *fotiz . The assimilative influence which was exerted by Latin v ( that is , w @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vowel u in a following syllable . Avestan vohu comes from *vahu ( Sanskrit vase ) , and mosu from *masu ( Sanskrit maksu ) . In Anglo-Saxon u converted a preceding front vowel into a diphthong ; beside Gothic miluks Anglo-Saxon has mioluc " milk , " and *sefum , the primitive Germanic word for " seven , " appears in Anglo-Saxon as seofon . Complete assimilation of a vowel to a following vowel is seen in Latin rutundus for rotundus and in the epigraphical Sabastianus and vixillo for Sebastianus and vexillo . Of the countless examples in Greek inscriptions and papyri we may cite 7'Ilevvv for aj ? iQv in many Attic inscriptions . It is not easy to detect cases of the assimilation of vowels in contact , for contraction usually results immediately . If , as many scholars assume , assimilation is a necessary preliminary to the contraction of unlike vowels into a monophthong , we must conclude that Latin plantes ( subjunctive ) from *plantayes passed through the stage *plantees , and that Anglo-Saxon na ( English // " no " ) came from *ne-d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every language . Just as a sound soon to be pronounced tends to be anticipated , so a sound already spoken tends to be repeated . The psychological process is almost the same , but the result upon language is different , and , he phenomenon is less frequent . The instances may be grouped in the same way as those of anticipation . Meringer reports many cases of the alteration of a word by a preceding word in the same sentence , for example , Durch den Wald fiihrt ein schoner Wag ( that is , Weg ) . A numeral may be affected by a preceding one ; several Greek dialects have oKr6 " eight " and EvvEa " nine " with the rough breathing of &-ra; " seven . " Assimilation of a consonant to another immediately preceding it is much less common than the progressive assimilation already discussed . Latin pello is from *pelno ( cf. Greek 7rAva ? at ) . The Greek name H0XV6EUKgs became in Latin first Polduces and then Polluces ( whence Pollux ) . Latin sallo " I salt " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English " salt . " In Oscan and Umbrian nd became nn , as in the Oscan gerundive iupsannam ( faciendam ) . Plautus ' dispennite and distennite for dispendite and distendite remind us that he was born in the Umbrian town of Sarsina . Assimilation of a consonant to a preceding consonant is seen in the Anglo-Saxon preterite grette from *grit-de , and partial assimilation in iecte from *iec-de . Partial assimilation is regular in the English plural suffix , which is s after voiceless consonants lips " ) , but z after voiced consonants ( " ears " ) . In Latin a short vowel before a single consonant regularly appears as i ( with certain exceptions ) in any So LINGUISTIC CHANGE syllable except the first and last of a word ; but the vowel of the initial syllable has assimilated that of the second syllable in alacer , elementum , vegetus , and some other words . An Attic inscription of the fourth century B.C. shows Xio Ma for MOvXAa . Quite frequently the assimilative influence comes from both directions , as in English " woman " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first vowel has been altered chiefly by the consonants preceding and following ; that the vowel of the second syllable was also of some influence is shown by the vowel of the plural " women " ( pronounced " wimin " ) . When two sounds or groups of sounds interfere with each other , the result is sometimes an exchange of places , a process which has long been called metathesis in our grammars . Here again most of Meringer 's examples fall under the case where the two sounds stand under similar accentual conditions , for example , But and Glut for Gut and Blut , and damin bit ich einig for and damit bin ich einig . He admits , however , that b and g sometimes suffer metathesis when they belong to syllables of different accentuation , as in gebinnt for beginnt , Begrauch for Gebrauch , etc . Several others of his examples are of the same character , although he seems not to be aware of the fact , for example , die Callaverie for die Cavallerie , Prular for Plural , Fraumeirer for Freimaurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfering sounds stand under similar accentuation in " feak and weeble " for " weak and feeble , " " the water the wetter " for " the wetter the water , " " plotoprasm " for " protoplasm . " The accentual circumstances of the transposed sounds differ in " ennaxation " for " annexation , " " doniPRIMARY // moes " for " dominoes , " " regural " for " regular , " " evelate " for " elevate , " and a number of others . In nearly all of his cases , however , as in all of Meringer 's , we have metathesis of sounds which are not immediately contiguous . That two consonants in contact may suffer Metathesis is shown by one of Bawden 's examples : wist " for " wits . " Similar instances that have become usual speech-forms are seen in Anglo-Saxon axian beside ascian , whence dialectic Modern English " ax " beside the normal " ask . " Similarly , Latin ascia " ax " is related to Greek &~; &?7.; French fixe , taxe , sexe become fisque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metathesis of a vowel and a consonant is seen in Chaucer 's brid for " bird " ( which had a full vowel in Chaucer 's time ) , and in many Greek words such as Cretan ' A0opBlTa for ' A0po8fT ? 7 and Homer 's &rap7r6s; beside Attic 6 ' 7-par5s . Sometimes metathesis simply moves a sound out of its position , as in " maganbli " for " magnolia , " a mispronunciation of a child of six years , and in Bawden 's " disintregation " and " standsone . " Of the same nature is Prancatius for Pancratius on a Latin inscription , and Syracusan Greek Spioos for &; &pos.; In Latin cocodrillus for crocodillus a sound is displaced in the other direction . We have noted that cases of associative interference which are not repeated or imitated , such as those observed by Meringer , usually concern sounds which stand under similar accentual conditions . Now the cases which become permanent features of a language almost as regularly concern neighboring sounds . The explanation seems to be this : since an accentual group commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference between sounds of similar accentual relations usually involves two or more words , and therefore can not recur until the same combination of words occurs again . An interference between neighboring sounds , on the other hand , usually involves only one word , and may therefore recur whenever the word is spoken . So , although changes of the second sort are far less common than the others , each one of them is more likely to be repeated and hence to find imitators . The phenomena of anticipation and repetition ( compare pages 44 ? 49 ) seem to be reversed in the somewhat less common process which is called dissimilation . There are four cases to be distinguished , the fourth of which is essentially different from the others : z . Repetition of a sound or group of sounds is avoided ( quite unintentionally , of course ) by the suppression of one of the two occurrences . Meringer reports hat Du 's gesagt for hast Du 's gesagt and a great many similar lapses . Latin vesti-silica becomes vestipica ; Greek bpbopaKros becomes SpV'OaKros , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire syllable is lost in " coborative " for " corroborative , " a lapse reported by Bawden , and in Greek ' A-7roAXcoOav-7s for ' AiroXXwvoOav-qs. 2 . Repetition is avoided by altering the sound in one of its two occurrences . From Meringer 's half-dozen examples we select ein grosser Gleu- ( immediately corrected by the speaker to Greuel ) . Latin turtur yields English " turtle-dove " and German Turtel-taube ; the Latin suffix alis ( sacralis , principalis , nivalis ) appears as axis when appended to a base containing 1 , for example , alaris , exemplaris , familiaris . The dissimilation of // vowels is illustrated by pepi for pipi , mema for mama , and Pape for papa in the speech of very young French children. , , 3 . Sometimes a regular sound-change is avoided if it would lead to the repetition of a sound . In Latin e , a , and o before single consonants in medial syllables became i , as in reficio beside facio . An intermediate stage in the change was e , and this was retained when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; variegare beside purigare ; aries , arietis beside miles , militis . Original o was retained after u in early Latin in such words as mortuos and arguont , although it had already become u in such words as bonus and agunt . Dissimilation certainly belongs under the head of associative interference , for one of the sounds could not influence the other if they did not somehow get into consciousness at the same time . The exact manner of the interference , however , is not fully understood . Brugmann founds his explanation upon an involuntary reaction of the speaker which he calls horror aequi . This Latin name leaves the psychological process quite unexplained ; and besides , certain facts indicate that there is no horror aequi . Extended alliterations have sometimes been admired ; one may cite Ennius ' lines : O Tite tute Tad tibi tanta turanne tulisti , and Sole luna 1tce lucet Alba leni Uctea . Even though modern taste condemns this as a poetic device , we find nothing difficult in the repetition of the sounds , and we can understand how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic pleasure or fail to find difficulty in the nonsense syllables : " Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers ; where is the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked ? " The trouble comes from the alternation of slightly dissimilar sounds ? in this case , the voiceless mutes p , t , and k . In the sentence , " an old cold scold sold a school coal skuttle , " the most difficult set of alternating sounds is c , sc , and s . To translate this into terms of the physiology of speech , it is easy to repeat a given articulation an indefinite number of times , but it is difficult to produce a succession of muscular co-ordinations which differ slightly from one another . In pronouncing these cacophonous combinations the tendency is toward a further assimilation ; we say " Peper Piper , " " pickled peckers , " or " scoal-skuttle . " Apparently the tendency toward dissimilation arises only in case the interfering groups are of such a character as to make assimilation inconvenient . The assimilated form of hast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? but this would introduce two unfamiliar forms into the sentence , and we shall see later that linguistic innovations tend to produce familiar sounds and combinations . The assimilated form of societas would be socicitas or socititas , either one of which would be easy to pronounce , but out of harmony with established linguistic habits ; sociitas would yield socitas , and that , too , would be a linguistic monstrosity . 4 . The term haplology is sometimes applied to any dissimilative loss of a syllable , but we shall restrict its use to a certain group of cases which seem to differ psychologically from other kinds of dissimilation . If a s // vowel stands between similar consonants or consonant groups , the vowel and one of the consonants or consonant groups tend to be lost , as when Latin *semimodius became semodius . The dissimilative character of the change is apparent ; but the distinctive feature of haplology is that the consonant forms a sort of switch from one syllable to the next . In the following diagram ( a modification of one in Oerteli ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter extending across both lines represents the sound which was common to both original syllables : A child intended to say " Post Toasties " ( the name of a certain cereal preparation ) , but actually said " Posties . " Our diagram stands : The process is obviously similar to the analogical changes which were discussed on page 38 . Other instances of haplology are Latin nutrix for *nutri-trix , scripsti for scripsisti , amatust for amatus est , Greek j ? ESl ? vov for jut- ? ESc ? vov , German Superindent for Superintendent . English " Gloucester " was once pronounced in three syllables , " Glousester , " the second of which has been lost by haplology . Chaucer pronounced the adverb from the adjective " humble " in three syllables , humblely , while we say " humbly . " Shakespeare 's verse requires us to read " prevent it " // as " prevent ' . " One often hears the pronunciation " libry " for " library " and " probly " for " probably . " Rhythm One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm , which results in large part from the swinging motion of legs and arms . " The four limbs , " says Titchener , I " are , so to speak , four pendulums attached to the trunk of the body . As we run or walk the legs swing alternately , and with each leg swings the arm on the opposite side . " Particularly important for our purpose is the auditory rhythm which may be observed in pure form by listening to the ticking of a clock ; although all the beats may be precisely alike , we hear them in groups : " tick tock , tick tock " or " tick tock , tick tock ; tick tock , tick tock . " Very commonly the tactual rhythm of walking is associated with the auditory rhythm of our footfalls . The importance of rhythm in poetry is too familiar to require comment , and all readers of this book are aware that there is much regularity of rhythm in artistic prose.2 The rhythmic modulation of even the simplest speech may be seen by analyzing a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sawyer . Musical notation is used for convenience , in spite of the fact that speech is too flexible to fit a mathematical scheme . Although in some instances the time indicated is only approximately correct , the intervals of time between accents are virtually the same throughout . The dynamic character of stress-rhythm appears quite clearly in such pairs of words as " transport " and " transportation , " " corroborate " and " corroboration " ; the fixed accent of the suffix - dtion induces a secondary accent on the second or third syllable preceding and sometimes , as in our first example , on a syllable which in the primitive is unaccented . Similarly , the initial accent of German V &urteilI; inverts the accent of the second member of the compound ( Urteil ) . The tendency appears even more impressively in longer compounds , such as RedlschuMberlehrer . Similar phenomena may sometimes be observed in the phrase . A number of Swedish and Danish dissyllables have the accent on the final syllable , except when they stand before an accented syllable , for example , Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Emil Hdnsen . At one time such a variation was common in English also ; in Chaucer we find cosyn , but cdsyn myn , etc. , and in Shakespeare " impfire " beside " impure blots , " and many other instances . Later poets occasionally use such phrases as " obscure death " ( Shelley ) , " despised monarch " ( Byron ) , " an occult hint " ( Whittier ) . The last-mentioned adjective still shows the variation in prose , at least in America , as also do " contrite " and " inverse . " We have seen ( page 22 ) that although the word " heaven " is normally a dissyllable a reduction of the stress of n until the total intensity of that sound falls below the intensity of v converts the word into a monosyllable . Since an increase of stress on a given syllable usually induces a diminution of stress on neighboring syllables , a strong stress-accent tends to suppress unaccented syllables whose most sonorous sound is a consonant . The weakened consonant may attach itself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but quite as often it goes with a neighboring unaccented syllable . The second syllable of " generally " has no vowel , but in careful , deliberate pronunciation we make the sonorous consonant r carry the syllable ( " gen-r-l-y " ) . When we speak more rapidly the stress on the first syllable reduces the stress of r until its intensity falls below that of the following sound , and we say " gen-rl-y . " A strong stress-accent also tends to reduce the sonorousness of unaccented vowels , a process which is called vowel-weakening . In prehistoric Latin there was a stress-accent on the initial syllable of every word , and it was this accent which changed a to 6 and then // ( before single consonants ) to , as in abigo beside ago and reficio beside facio . By degrees the most sonorous of the vowels changed to one of the least sonorous under the influence of stress on a neighboring syllable . Frequently a heavy stress-accent leads to the loss of unaccented vowels . Latin has many such " syncopated " forms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *per-rego . Sometimes when a vowel is lost in this way a sonorous consonant prevents the syllable from being lost . English " vocalic " has a vowel in the second syllable , but in " vocalization " the accent on the first syllable causes the vowel of the second syllable to be lost and leaves l as the most sonorous sound in its syllable . A further reduction of stress in rapid speech causes the loss of the syllable , " vo-cli-za-tion . " The rhythmic tendency of pitch-accent is scarcely less strong than that of stress-accent . Even in a language which makes as little of pitch as English , speech in a monotone is exceedingly disagreeable and quite rare . Our pitch , like that of French and German , is chiefly a function of the sentence ; we vary the pitch of individual words almost at will . In many languages the pitch of particular words and syllables is as definitely fixed as their stress is in English . In Chinese and some other languages a variation in pitch , even though the sound be otherwise unchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of carrying an entirely different meaning . Even where there is a relatively fixed system of pitch-accent , alterations are made under the influence of the rhythmic tendency , for example , Greek Qw ? a re : Xoyos re ( soma te : logos te ) . As far as we know , pitch-accent does not exert any 6o . LINGUISTIC CHANGE influence upon the quality or quantity of vowels or consonants . That the rhythmic tendency applies to quantity as well as to accent is shown by the quantitative verse of Greek , Latin , and many other languages and also by the quantitative rhythm of artistic classical prose . In most of the Greek and Roman authors , to be sure , we find few variations from the normal quantity for metrical purposes , except in foreign words and proper names . In Homer , however , such variation is frequent ( for example Evi:eivi 6upno't ) , and it has been plausibly suggested ' that in early Greek this was a feature of ordinary speech . Some scholars assume such variation in the Indo-European parent-speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8ovXoovvj : ie pwo uvrl , and the San-skrit reduplicated aorists acirriyam : ajijanam . In languages such as English , which have a strong stress-accent , quantitative rhythm is so largely domi-nated by accentual rhythm that it can hardly be studied separately ; nearly all unaccented vowels have been shortened . Speed of Utterance We have seen that an increase in the speed of utter-ance increases the effect of a stress-accent . The reason for this is that when we speak rapidly we have less time for making the complicated nervous and muscular adjustments that are necessary to the production of speech-sounds , and so some of the movements are incom-plete , inexact , or ill-timed ; we are more likely to make mistakes when we speak rapidly . Probably this applies // in varying degrees to nearly all sorts of mispronuncia-tion ; certainly it has an important connection with the phenomena of assimilation and dissimilation , as one discovers by reciting the syllables about Peter Piper at varying rates of speed . Rapidity of utterance is not an independent cause of sound-change , but only a re-enforcing cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reduction of vitality is related to disease : both reduce the patient 's powers of resistance , but neither can induce a particular malady . The analogy is not perfect , how-ever ; Meringer ' has not been able to detect a greater liability to mispronunciation in speakers of rapid utter-ance than in those whose rate of speech is slower . No doubt habitually rapid speech goes parallel with unusual speed and accuracy in making nervous and muscular co-ordinations ; whether the habit or the skill is the cause of the other is a question for a psychologist to answer . Ease of Articulation Many of the changes we have discussed result in an easier articulation ; it is easier to say " cubrd " than " cup-board , " Pollutes than Polduces , exemplaris than *exemplalis , semodius than *semimodius , repperi than *repeperi . Many sound-changes also among those that we have not mentioned simplify articulation . A mon-ophthong requires less muscular and nervous energy than a diphthong ( Latin ae became e ; Greek at became e ) ; a spirant is a less complicated sound than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced // ph , as in " hap-hazard , " in ancient Greek , but is now pronounced f ) ; the loss of a sound saves effort unless the resulting combination of sounds is difficult to articulate ( Latin v was lost between like vowels , Greek F was lost in all positions in some dialects ) . It seems probable , then , that in many cases the greater ease with which a new sound is produced is a contributing factor in its first production . Such a tendency is not always present , for changes in the reverse direction are not uncommon . Monophthongs sometimes become diphthongs , as in English a and o have become ay and ow ( for example , " pay , " " grow " ) . In the first Germanic mutation of consonants t became th ( Latin tenuis , English " thin " ) ; this th under certain circumstances became d ( Latin centum , English " hundred " ) ; original d , however , became t ( Latin duo , English " two " ) . These changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were more complicated than this summary statement would indicate ; but the fact remains that original t sometimes became English d , while original d regularly became English t . Not all of the changes concerned can possibly be due to a tendency toward ease of articulation . Indeed we can not often say that any simple sound is easier than another ; for no language makes common use of a sound which seems difficult to the speakers of that language . We should not invoke the tendency to avoid effort as a cause of any sound-changes except those which clearly result in the omission or simplification of muscular movement . In one case this tendency seems to operate quite regularly . If i or u is immediately followed by a disPRIMARY // similar vowel , a consonantal glide is developed between them ( unless the i or u itself becomes consonantal with loss of a syllable ) . Since i and u are less sonorous than the other vowels , the speaker can produce the decrease of intensity which marks the syllable division between i and a , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the close of the i-sound . If the sonorousness of the i is decreased at the same time , the change in stress need not be so great ; but when i becomes less sonorous the result is y . Many consonant groups involve an exact co-ordination of muscular processes . In order to produce the group sl one must close the s-aperture between the tip of the tongue and the gum and at the same moment open the 1-apertures between the sides of the tongue and the gum . If the former adjustment precedes , the result is a com-plete closure between the tongue and the gum in the t-position , and when this is relaxed by the opening of the 1-apertures we hear the explosion which constitutes the sound of t , as when English " scarcely " is pronounced " scarcetly . " Conversely , the group stl requires that the closure of the s-aperture shall precede the opening of the 1-apertures . If this is not done , the t-explosion is omitted , as when " beastly " is pronounced " beasly " ( the familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in " stream " from Indo-European sreu , " ches(t)nut , " Latin sum(p)si and sum(p)tus . In such cases we find changes in both di-rections ( " scarcetly " : " beasly " ) . Other consonant combinations which involve exactly timed changes of articulation are broken up by the development of a vowel , as when English " elm " and " Henry " become // " elum " and " Henery , " or early Latin periclum and vehiclum become periculum and vehiculum . In the cases mentioned in the last paragraph the only difficulty is that of making a movement at precisely the right moment . That , however , is not really a difficult thing to do when once it has become habitual . The development or loss of a t between s and 1 and of a vowel between 1 and m does not really result in greater ease of articulation unless those combinations are uncommon in the language concerned , or the speaker who makes the change is just learning the language . In these cases , then , we should not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to eliminate unfamiliar sounds or groups of sounds . Loan-words are peculiarly subject to this tendency ; just as those who learn a foreign language tend to substitute familiar sounds for the unfamiliar foreign sounds , so the borrowers of a foreign word adapt it to their own phonetic habits . When German Walz made its way into English , the unfamiliar initial sound of the German was displaced by English v or w , the latter of which has become usual on account of the identity of the written character with the German letter . Unfamiliar combinations arise occasionally in the development of a language , and then are eliminated ; the Greek for " seventh " should be 03i.tos , but we find 03o ? os in some dialects , 08e ? os in others . The tendency to avoid unfamiliar sounds often combines with other factors in producing a sound-change ; when Latin *is-pse became ipse an unfamiliar combination was eliminated by dissimilation . The German name Schlesinger is often pronounced with metathesis // Sleshinger in America , where the initial combination shl is unfamiliar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy with " air , " partly by metathesis , and partly also because ae is an unfamiliar combination in English . Spelling and Pronunciation In cultivated languages spelling frequently leads to a change in pronunciation . The French word faute was adopted in Middle English and was pronounced nearly as in French for some time . At length some schoolmaster noticed the connection with Latin fallo and heralded his discovery by spelling the word with an 1 . Presently some other pedant pronounced the l thus introduced , and now we all follow his example . The English names " Norwich " and " Greenwich " ( pronounced " Norij , " " Grinij " ) have been given to several American towns , but here they are usually pronounced as spelled . Although the t of " often " has been silent in normal speech for two centuries , many persons , misled by the spelling , now take great pains to pronounce it . Custom and Pronunciation The habits and ideals of different human groups differ widely . Laborers of some races habitually sing at their work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of folly . In some communities all decent women wear rings in their noses , in others in the lower lips , and in still others in the ears , while some communities regard a ring attached to any part of the head as a badge , not of respectability , but of the reverse . In one land it is proper to express emotion as fully as // possible by gesture , facial expression , and tone of voice ; but in another , people try to appear as if they had no emotions at all . Many linguistic facts must be connected with such social habits . It has been suggested that the comparative lack of facial expression in England is a cause of the weak articulation of the labials which is prevalent there . Perhaps the loss of pitch-accent in many highly cultured languages is in part due to the civilized habit of hiding emotions . A rather slovenly fashion of closing the mouth before one has quite finished what he is saying yields vulgar English " nope " for " no " and " yep " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the premature closure is in the t-position , and the result is " acrosst , " " sincet , " " clost , " " oncet , " etc . No doubt it will some day be possible to detect other and clearer cases of the influence of custom upon speech . Unknown Factors No doubt there are other causes of primary change of sound , and further study will probably bring some of them to light . Something is to be hoped for from further collections of momentary lapses , such as those published by Meringer , and something also from the laboratories of phonetics and psychology . In the meantime it would be well for linguists to study such changes of sound as recur independently in different languages . For example , z becomes r in West and North Germanic ( Gothic maiza , English " more , " German mehr , Swedish mera ) , in Latin and Umbrian ( Oscan ezum , Latin era , Umbrian erom ) , in certain Greek dialects ( Eretrian EXovpwv , Mipyos ) , in Sanskrit // ( sarvais tantraih @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other known languages were compared with these , the reason for the tendency might appear . At present we can merely say that z and some types of r are produced by similar articulations and that some types of r require less expenditure of breath than is needed to produce z . CHAPTER III SECONDARY CHANGE OF FORM We have now to consider the spread of new forms over a greater or a smaller territory . Many innovations do not spread at all or even establish themselves at the spot where they originate . Some of them are detected by the speaker and corrected at once ; others , which escape his notice , the hearer detects and mentally brands as mistakes . A great many phonetic changes do , however , gain currency , and this in two very different ways . Some changes establish themselves in hundreds of words , while others , such as that of Latin *nutritrix to nutrix , are confined to a single word . Changes Affecting Several Words Changes of sound which are common to several words are among the most frequent linguistic changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are usually regular in their operation . Unless they are hindered by some opposing tendency , they usually apply , not to a few words , but to all those in which the sound occurs in similar surroundings . Anglo-Saxon ad has become " oath , " and with almost perfect regularity Anglo-Saxon accented a in other words also has become o ( or , more accurately ow ; see above , page 18 ) . We have " own " from agan , " bone " from ban , " goat " from gat , " comb " from camb , " foam " from fam , " whole " from hal , " home " 68 // from ham , " moan " from man , " sow " from sdwan , " token " from tacen , etc . These and many parallel instances are summarized in the formula : AngloSaxon accented a became Modern English If ( or rather , ow ) . Such a formula is called a phonetic law . There is another phonetic law to the effect that Indo-European d became Germanic t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Germanic languages , such as these between the classical languages and English : decem : " ten " SEpw : " tear " duo : " two " dens : " tooth " dicere : " teach " cordem : " heart " domare : " tame " sedere : " sit " The phonetic law that in Latin s between vowels became r ( through the intermediate stage of z ) is a formulaic statement of many such relationships as these : genus : generis gestus:gero dis-tineo : dir-imo nefas : nefarius Roman grammarians record early Latin meliosem , foedesum , and lases for classical meliosem , foedesum , and lares . We might multiply indefinitely examples of each of these phonetic laws . We must carefully note , however , that phonetic laws operate only under certain conditions , or we shall not be able to trace their regularity . Although , as we have seen , Latin a if originally unaccented became many words show e from a . Contrast the second and fourth columns below . // The confusion disappears as soon as we recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a single consonant other than r , ' while before double consonants and r unaccented d became e . To put the matter in terms of historical development , unaccented d became e , and then unaccented e before single consonants except r became ' . Similarly , Anglo-Saxon d changed to Modern English o only when accented ; the regular development of Anglo-Saxon unaccented a is seen in " abide " from abidan , " arise " from drisan . Again , Latin s became r only between vowels . We have noticed s in genus , distineo , gestus , and nefas ; it occurs in a host of other words besides . Phonetic laws operate regularly wherever they operate at all , but they do not necessarily operate over the entire territory of a language . In the greater part of the United States r before a consonant is retained in such words as " cart , " " hard , " " barn " ; but in the South , in a large part of New England , and in the city of New York r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowel . In most Greek dialects original long a remained , so that first-declension nouns ended in that vowel as they do in Latin *tva ) . In Attic and Ionic , however , this sound became n , and so we have SECONDARY CHANGE OF FORM 7r first-declension nouns like robin . In Attic alone another phonetic law gives a after e , i , and p , so that we find xwpa contrasting with Ionic xwpn . Sometimes a phonetic law is confined to a particular class . In Southern England the lower classes have lost the sound h , but it is carefully retained by educated people . In New York City , before the New England loss of r before a consonant was introduced , ' a part of the words concerned had suffered a different change in the language of the lower classes ; the syllabic r of " bird , " " third , " " first , " " hurt , " " worm , " etc. , had developed into a diphthong whose first element is an abnormal vowel ( see above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose second element is i . One can easily distinguish the native from the imported delivery boys and street-car conductors by the presence or absence of such pronunciations as " boid , " " thoid , " " foist , " " hoid , " " woim . " Other local and class phonetic laws are illustrated by the western pronun-ciation " Americy , " " Sary , " " Nevady , " etc. , and by Cockney " lidy " ( " laide " ) for " lady , " and " roud " ( " raud " ) for " road . " A phonetic law continues in force only for a limited time , and after it has once ceased to operate a sound fulfilling all the conditions for the change may come to exist in the language and remain unchanged . If Latin causa had had that form at the time when s between vowels was being changed to r , the classical word would // have been caura ; but until the time of Augustus the word was caussa . So also caesus , rusus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ss in the early period ; when at last ss became s in these words the phonetic law had ceased to operate , and s between vowels persisted . Anglo-Saxon sc has become sh in " shin , " " shirt , " " shrew , " " shriek , " etc. ; but nevertheless sc ( often spelled sk ) is by no means uncommon in Modern English . In fact we have numerous by-forms in sk of words in sh ; beside " ship " we have " skiff " ; " shirt " and " skirt " are historically the same word ; and so are " shriek " and " screech " ; " shrew " and " screw " ( a skittish horse ) . The sk forms were borrowed from other languages ( chiefly Danish ) after the change of genuine English sc to sh . Borrowed words , even when they do not have a form that has previously existed in the borrowing language , often produce apparent exceptions to a phonetic law . In Modern English , beside " whole " from Anglo-Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which does not go back to the Anglo-Saxon word , but to Danish heel ; this is cognate , to be sure , with the genuine English word , but it acquired its peculiar form during its history as a Danish word . The genuine Latin word corresponding to English " red , " Greek ipvOpos , Sanskrit rudhirds , is ruber ; Latin rufus is borrowed from another of the Italic languages in which Indo-European dh in the middle of a word became f . It was the discovery of the regularity of the phonetic laws that made possible the science of comparative philology . As long as scholars thought , for example , that original dh in the middle of a word might appear // in Latin as b or f indifferently there was no way of showing that ruber is the native Latin word and that rufus is a loan-word ; both might be genuine developments of the same original stem . Furthermore , the fact that dh initial appeared as f in Latin fumus ( Greek 01 ) ? a ) and in many other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the assumption of an original initial dh . The equation of English " deer " with Greek OI p and Latin ferns on the basis of assumed Indo-European dh was for a long time a favorite etymology , in spite of the fact that Aeolic Greek has ck p instead of 0,0 . Indeed , it was possible to connect any two words of any two languages by merely assuming a sufficient number of sound-changes . Voltaire 's sneering description of etymology as the science in which the consonants count for little and the vowels for nothing continued to be deserved for many years after the death of its author . For some time after scholars began to speak of " phonetic laws , " they grouped under them only a part of the material and then added a chapter on " sporadic change , " in which they discussed what they thought to be exceptions to the phonetic laws . Sometimes they set up two contradictory phonetic laws , either of which might operate , it was supposed , in any given case . As linguistic knowledge broadened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of phonetic change , and to feel more and more skepticism in regard to " sporadic change . " The climax of thirty years of increasing strictness in the treatment of sound-changes came in 1876 , when Leskien , in an essay entitled Die Deklination im SlavischLitauischen and Germanischen , advanced the theory // that phonetic laws have no exceptions , except those which can be accounted for by the intervention of other phonetic laws or by some analogical influence . The matter was vigorously debated for many years , and the outcome of the discussion , for the present at least , is a compromise . Few scholars now deny the possibility of exceptions to the phonetic laws , but in practice all reputable linguists assume that these laws are regular , and all refrain from advancing etymologies which violate them . Although phonetic laws are usually regular in their operation , it is not hard to find cases where they are more or less vacillating . English o has been shortened to o-6 in " book " and " good . " Many speakers in various parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as " room , " " cooper , " " roof , " " proof , " " spoon , " " food , " " soot , " and " root . " In a third group of words FO is never shortened , for example , " fool , " " moon , " " Susan , " " shoe . " There is inconsistency in standard English between the first group and the other two , while with regard to the treatment of words of the second group one can find all imaginable differences between speakers . In the dialect of New England o is changed to the u of " but " in certain words . The shortened form is very common in " stun " for " stone " and the phrase " to hum " for " at home , " and it is heard in many other words also , but in different words in different localities . Latin mn is treated in no less than four different ways . In femina , nominalis , and guminasium for Greek yv ? vavwv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group remains unchanged in standard Latin . In the language // of the streets mn is sometimes assimilated to nn , as in alonnus for alumnus and lanna for lamna , while sometimes p is developed between the two nasals , as in dampnum for damnum , calumpnia for calumnia , solempnis for solemnis . Writers on scientific grammar try to explain away such irregularities by assigning the various sounds to different class or local dialects , by making them represent different chronological stages of a continuous development , or by pointing out the phonetic surroundings under which each one appears . Such procedure is entirely proper , and it has reduced numerous apparent irregularities to order . There remain , however , many cases which can not be explained away . We have record of temporary vacillation between rival pronunciations followed by the complete victory of one of them . In Shakespeare 's time " war " rhymed with " far , " " warm " with " harm , " " wanting " with " granting . " In the eighteenth century the modern pronunciation of such words was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound ah ( Continental a ) in certain words , as " wart , " " dwarf , " " wabble , " " wad , " " wallop . " For the last hundred years or so the standard English pronunciation has consistently employed the sound-group waw for earlier wah ; whereas the change was irregular in the eighteenth century , it was regular in the nineteenth . In American English the irregularity still persists ; most of us say ah in the words " wabble , " " wad , " and " wallop " ; many of us , in " wash " ; and some of us , in " water . " Probably American English will eventually work its way to uniformity , as the English of the mother-country has already done . // Sometimes a period of vacillation is followed by the victory of the original sound . In Latin there was at one time a tendency to lengthen short vowels before gn . It seems certain that people said dignus , signum , ignis , as well as dignus , signum , ignis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no evidence of a lengthened pronunciation . But even for the words first mentioned the inherited forms of the Romance languages and the borrowed forms of the Germanic and Celtic languages show that the pronunciation with a short vowel finally prevailed . In this case the net result of the incipient change was to leave things as they were at first . Sound-changes sometimes start in a particular part of a linguistic community and gradually spread , as waves radiate from a pebble dropped into a body of water . Sound-changes , however , need not spread in concentric circles ; they may move rapidly in some directions , slowly in others , and not at all in still others . A change of this sort which has been much studied is the so-called second or High German mutation of consonants , which caused the difference between the consonants of such English and German words as " two " and zwei , " foot " and Fuss , " sheep " and Schaf , " daughter " and Tochter , " brother " and Bruder . These changes began about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the tendency to shift the mutes moved farther from the starting-point , it became weaker and affected fewer sounds . The northern districts were almost untouched by it . Most remarkable of all , the change spread across dialect borders without interruption , while , on the other hand , the // Frankish dialect was only partially covered ; thenceforth we have High Frankish , which took part in the change , and Low Frankish , which did not . Another gradually spreading sound-change may be observed in the neighborhood of New York City just now . In a large part of New England r before a consonant is mute in such words as " cart , " " hard , " " first , " " horde , " and this pronunciation is gradually spreading to the southwest . Fifty years ago , I have been informed , it had not reached Greenwich , Connecticut . At present the boundary follows the New England line nearly to the coast , then it swerves westward to the Hudson , and presently moves westward again to include several of the Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natives as well as the commuters pronounce in this respect precisely as the city people do . A little farther back , in Hackensack and Newark , both pronunciations may be heard ; the boundary runs through these towns and the change has not worked out to uniformity there . There is little doubt that soon the whole district tributary to New York City will pronounce " caht , " etc . The most remarkable and most important soundchanges are those which are regular in their operation . For many years students of language have devoted much time to discovering , describing , and tabulating phonetic laws ; no other group of linguistic phenomena has been more extensively or more profitably studied . Many attempts have been made to account for their regularity , and some factors in the problem have been recognized ; but there is not today any generally accepted theory of sound-change . We shall consider two ways in which // regular changes of form occur . It is very probable that these two factors sometimes co-operate , and there may be other factors in the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not originate in a sudden and violent change , such as might be inferred from our formulation of the phonetic laws . Our grammars say that Latin unaccented a before a single consonant became i . But in reality we know that a was not changed directly into i ; there was certainly an intermediate stage e , and probably there were many other intermediate stages . The weakening of unaccented a was induced by the strong stress-accent of early Latin , an influence which must constantly have affected all speakers . Every time anyone pronounced a word like *refacio he tended to make the second vowel a little closer and less sonorous than before ; the change , however , was very slight in each case and therefore did not attract attention or provoke correction . Nevertheless each new stage on the road from a to i must have served as a point of departure for another change in the same direction . A sound-change may be made regular in this way , whenever one of the causes of primary change of sound operates upon all the speakers of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding by imperceptible stages . A change of social customs , such as an increase in the size of ornamental rings , worn in the upper lip , or a fashion of splitting the upper lip , or a habit of keeping the lips closed as much as possible , would certainly produce regular changes in some of the speech-sounds . If a whole community adopts a new language , there is a consistent tendency to modify the // sounds of the new language in the direction of the familiar sounds of the old . But there are many phonetic laws whose regularity can not be thus explained . Some changes can not take place by imperceptible stages ; for example , the change of qu to p in several languages ( Oscan pod is from quod ) , or the change of tl to cl in Latin ( poculum is from *potlom ) . Even some changes which might take place by imperceptible stages are nevertheless observed to involve at certain times an easily perceptible variation between words or between speakers ; for example , the eighteenth-century inconsistency between " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rhyming with " part , " and the present inconsistency in the pronunciation of " room , " etc . Even in case we can not disprove that a change took place by slow degrees , we are usually unable to point out any persistent cause of the tendency to change in the given direction . It is probable that we should assign an important role to the second method by which changes of form are known to become regular . In the dialect of Missouri and the neighboring states , final a in such words as " America , " " Arizona , " " Nevada , " becomes y ? " Americy , " " Arizony , " " Nevady . " All educated people in that region carefully correct this vulgarism out of their speech ; and many of them carry the correction too far and say " Missoura , " " praira , " etc . That plain soldier , the emperor Vespasian , had the vulgar habit of saying o for au , and , says Suetonius , a courtier named Florus once cautioned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial pupil greeted his instructor as " Flaurus . " Suetonius records this as one of Vespasian 's jests ; but 8o LINGUISTIC CHANGE many Romans changed o to an in the mere effort to speak correctly , as in scauria for Greek Quwpia in an inscription . Such over-corrections are common in all languages . ' For the native of Missouri the attempt to say " America , " " Arizona , " and " Nevada " is an attempt to substitute for his native y the more elegant sound a . The feeling inevitably arises that final y is wrong and should be changed to a ; this feeling has actually led to the pronunciations " Missoura " and " praira , " and it might easily lead to the conversion of every final y to a . Such a spread of a sound-change from word to word closely resembles analogical change ; the chief difference is that in analogical change the association groups are based upon meaning , while in this case the groups are based upon form . We may illustrate with the change of initial en- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now consider , e before the velar nasal ( English ng ) became 1 , and consequently words and phrases containing the preposition *en ( cognate with Greek iv ) or the negative prefix *en ( cognate with Greek a privative ) before a velar consonant changed the initial vowel to ; *enclaudo became includo and *encoctus became incoctus . By analogy the preposition and the negative prefix became in , even when other sounds followed , and so we have infero , ineo , inutilis , in arce , etc . ' The preposition *en was closely associated // with the compound preposition endo ( cognate with English " into " ) , which had the same meaning , and it was also associated with the prepositions *enter and *enfra ; analogy changed these to indu , inter , and infra . Now this extensive change of initial en- to in- might have induced a feeling that every initial en- should be made in- ; the change might have extended from the association group consisting of the words en and words of similar form and meaning to the partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That this spread did not actually occur is shown by enim and ensis ( which had short e at the time we are discussing ) , the only Latin words with initial en- which were not on the basis of meaning associated with either the preposition or the negative prefix . The prerequisite for any such spread of a change from word to word is that some speakers shall feel that one sound should be substituted for another . One may get such a feeling in various ways . The people of Missouri get it when they try to substitute standard English for their native dialect , and Vespasian got it when his courtiers instructed him in standard Latin pronunciation . In both cases there is a change of models ? a standard language is substituted for a local or class dialect . In other words , dialect-mixture may lead to the generalizing of a sound-change . The same result may arise from a change in the model itself . If I admire the speech of my employer , or superior officer , or elder brother , I am likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , and those who imitate my speech are likely to carry the process still farther . No records have ever // been kept of these first beginnings of regular changes of sound , and so it is not possible to refer phonetic laws to their origins . We know that English wah has changed to waw , and we can give approximate dates for some stages of the process ; but we do not know when or where or in whose pronunciation the first impulse toward the change occurred . We have seen that many sound-changes are irregular when they first appear and gradually become more and more regular . The reason is that each person who substitutes the new sound for the old in his own pronunciation tends to carry it into new words . The two processes of spread from word to word and spread from speaker to speaker progress side by side until the new sound has extended to all the words of the language which contained the old sound in the same surroundings . Isolated Changes Many changes of form , however , spread over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they originate . In some cases there is no other word with a similar combination of sounds ; Latin nutrix from *nutritrix could not influence other words with the sound-group trrtr because there were none . But the spread from word to word does not always occur when it would be possible . Two chief causes for the isolation of a change of form may be mentioned . Probably a change will not spread from a single word to other words on the basis of formal association alone . The past participle of Latin morior ought to be *mortus , but the analogy of vivus has changed it into mortuus ; // there surely never resulted from this change a tendency to change t to tu . The change of h to f in English " four " could not by itself cause a regular change of initial h to f . We are here forced to argue a priori , since objective data are almost wholly lacking for the reason stated on page 81 ; but it seems safe to say that the likelihood that a sound-change will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the words which induce it . A second cause for the isolation of a sound-change is an association of the change in question with a particular meaning . The reason why Latin enim did not become inim was that the change of initial en- to in- was felt to belong to the meanings " in- " and " un- . " Analogy has appended an s to numerous English genitives and plurals which formerly did not have that termination ; but the connection of the ending with the two meanings has been so close that there has not been the slightest tendency for this s to spread beyond the two categories . It is impossible to say just how strong the association of a sound-change with a meaning must be in order to hinder its spread beyond the semantic group . Apparently the pronunciation " Missoura " is favored by association with other geographical names , such as " America , " " Arizona , " and " Nevada " ; but the association is not strong enough to prevent the common noun " prairie " from becoming " praira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irregular change of form , and for the historian of language it is a distinction that must be carefully observed . Many scholars have supposed that the two were fundamentally different . It has been thought that // the phonetic laws belonged solely to the physical or physiological side of language and that their regularity was as relentless as the law of gravitation ? and for similar reasons ? while irregular changes were psychological in their nature and were incalculable in their effects , because the mind of man is a free agent . We have seen , however , that both kinds of soundchange are at once physiological and psychological . Indeed , the psychological factor of association is largely responsible for the regularity of many of the phonetic laws ; many irregular changes of sound ultimately become regular by the operation of psychological causes . And , on the other hand , we have seen that psychological causes may hinder a change from spreading to all words which contain a given sound . CHAPTER IV CHANGE OF MEANING Semantic Change Erratic While the regular operation of the phonetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different forms in various related languages , there is no similar clue to help us trace the changes which have affected the meanings of words . No scholar can doubt the etymological identity of Old Irish athir and Sanskrit pita , although they have not a single sound in common ; for all the differences accord with recognized phonetic laws . As wide a divergence in meaning can be traced only in case we have historic records of intermediate stages . One might well doubt the relationship of English " write " with Dutch rijten and German reissen " tear , split , " if it were not for such intermediate stages as Old Saxon writan " cut " and also " write " and Icelandic rita " scratch , write . " No one knows whether Latin ruo " fall " and ruo " rush " are related to each other or not , for we have no record of earlier stages of the Latin language which might show either greater similarity between their meanings or greater divergence . Nevertheless we may study many changes of meaning which have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruct a change which occurred in prehistoric times . The branch of linguistic science which treats of the meaning of words is called semasiology , or semantics , and change in meaning is called semantic change . 85 // Types of Semantic Change ? Shift of Emphasis Everyone who has used a dictionary knows that most words have several meanings ; but the variation is really more extensive than a dictionary could indicate . The word " horse " in its literal meaning suggests a very large number of sensations and experiences , for each man 's idea of a horse is a sort of composite photograph of the horses he has known of . But the photograph differs with every person who uses the word ; for no two people have seen precisely the same horses . The farmer will see a plow horse ; the drayman will see a heavy animal with hairy fetlock ; the jockey will see a slender-legged , nervous thoroughbred . Then again , the word will convey a different meaning according to when and where it is used . In a zoological lecture a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a particular physiological structure . On a farm a horse is the beast that draws the plow , or it may be an animal that must be fed three times a day . At the blacksmith 's a horse is an animal with four hoofs to be shod . In a treatise on meat supply in war-time , a horse is an animal whose flesh may be used instead of beef . In each case one side of the idea is emphasized at the expense of the others , and so the word has a different meaning . The hearer learns what meaning is intended , partly from the situation under which the word is spoken , and partly from the rest of the sentence and the surrounding sentences . Often a very little of the context is enough ; note the varying meaning of " goes " in " the train goes , " " the mill goes , " " the money goes . " The emphasis on one element of a complex idea may be so strong that the other elements are forgotten . // Latin vendito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " often by praising one 's wares . So , with shift of emphasis , Cicero ( Att. i. 16. 16 ) says to his friend Atticus , valde to venditavi , " I praised you a lot . " English " knave " is the same word as German Knabe , and its original meaning was " boy . " Many boys were servants , and emphasis on that element of the concept gave the word a new meaning ; the transition stage is to be seen in The kokes knaue , thet wasshe 5 the disshesl ( " The cook 's boy that washes the dishes " ) . Some servants are rascals , and emphasis upon that part of the idea yields the modern meaning of the word " knave . " The original meaning of English " to dress " was the same as that of French dresser " make straight , " and we still retain it in " dress ranks " and " dress timber . " The latter phrase implies the cutting away of surplus material , and with emphasis on this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress poultry , " " dress a vine . " In all these phrases the verb connotes prepara-tion , and this is the preponderant idea in " dress a salad , " " dress a wound , " " dress the hair . " In the last phrase , and to a lesser degree in some of the others , there is an idea of adornment , which becomes emphatic in " dress a shop window " or " he dresses his wife well . " The latter involves the idea of clothing , and so , finally , we get such phrases as " dress one 's self . " A simpler example is " end , " whose first meaning is " limit , " but which often means " goal , " as in the phrase " an end in itself . " The circumstances under which a word is used very often lead to a change of the predominant element in its // meaning . The word " doubtless " is rarely used unless some have doubts in the matter ; if a fact is really quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . The word therefore comes to imply more or less doubt-fulness , and sometimes this implication is the pre-dominant part of the idea ; the word " doubtless " may be employed to make a statement less positive , as " To this construction are doubtless to be referred all cases . " ' A change in customs or environment sometimes makes a shift in emphasis inevitable . Latin penny meant " feather , " and denoted a feather used as a writing implement as well as any other . A shift of emphasis was necessary when writing with quills became so common that this aspect of the whole idea was for many the most familiar one . The word " fee " once meant " cattle , " and one element of the concept was the idea that cattle might be used to pay a debt . When cattle ceased to be used for this purpose it was no longer possible to consider payment a subordinate characteristic of cattle ; it must necessarily become an independent idea . Political history is responsible for the change in meaning of Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally meant " he who goes before , " and it was the title of the highest military and civil officer . By successive limitations of power , this officer 's func-tions changed from those of general and chief magistrate to those of judge of a criminal court , and the predominant meaning of the word kept pace ; hence the inconsistency in classical Latin between praetor " criminal judge " and praetorium " general 's tent . " // In addition to their intellectual content words suggest certain emotions . The word " home " differs from " house " chiefly in its emotional content , and that is also the main distinction between " blockhead " and " fool , " " brats " and " children , " " sweetheart " and " lover . " Sometimes the emphasis on the emotional content of a word becomes so great that the intellectual content is lost sight of . Many conservatives regard " anarchists " and " socialists " with equally intense dislike ; and so one often hears the two words coupled , as if they applied alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really opposite extremes of political theory . In several of the cases just discussed the shift of emphasis has led to an increase in the range of applicability of a word . The change in the meaning of " knave " from " servant boy " to " servant " was due to an exclusive emphasis on one element of the idea and the consequent elimination of the other element ; and then the new meaning automatically applied to a serving man as well as to a serving boy . The decrease in the logical content of the word involved an increase in its range of applicability . Such an extension of application can not be consciously recognized by the speaker ; since " knave " means to him merely " servant , " he is not aware of an innovation when he applies the word to a servant of mature years . Worn-out Figures of Speech The causal relation of these two processes is sometimes reversed ; a word may be consciously employed in a wider application and consequently with a narrower logical content . The speaker who first called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been aware that he was applying the word to a thing very different from that which it had hitherto signified ; one result of the innovation was that " leg " in its new use immediately lost some of its content . Such a conscious and more or less arbitrary extension of the applicability of a word is called a figure of speech . It is often impossible to distinguish between semantic changes due to shift of emphasis and those which originate as figures of speech . A four-year-old boy saw a blanket on a horse and called it an " apron . " Did he suppose that " apron " meant merely " outer covering which is not always worn , " or did he mean to say , " The horse is like a woman with an apron on " ? Some of the following examples possibly belong in whole or in part under the preceding topic . Figures of speech are used for the sake of vividness , suggestiveness , and sometimes for clearness . We call a man an " ass " or we call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emotions associated with the literal meanings of the words . A figurative expression contributes to clearness when a language lacks a literal word for the idea , as when we speak of a " transparent character . " When a figure is used very commonly , its figurative nature is lost , and it is understood directly in its secondary sense . Whereas the word " transparent " in the phrase " transparent character " is still a genuine figure , the word " clear " in a " clear statement " has ceased to suggest " clear water , " a " clear sky , " and the like , as it once did , and thereby it has suffered a change of meaning . Faded metaphors are common in all languages . The " iris " of the eye was originally the " rainbow " of // the eye . " Tulip " originally meant " turban " and was applied to the flower on account of its shape . " Daisy " is properly " day 's eye " and was applied first to the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strong tendency to use concrete sensuous terms for abstract suprasensuous ideas . Some purely intellectual processes are denoted by words which primarily refer to physical action . " To compose a poem " is , according to etymology , " to place it together . " In the phrase " to get hold of an idea " the metaphor is still felt ; but the phrase " to comprehend an idea " has in ordinary use lost entirely its metaphorical character . Other instances are " simple , " which originally meant " without fold , " and its derivative " simplicity " ; " right , " which originally meant " straigltt " ; " hard , " in such phrases as " a hard task " or " a hard character . " Terms belonging to the sphere of one sense are often made to apply to the objects of another . In " loud colors " we still feel the metaphor ; " a sharp tongue " and " a high note " hardly suggest a comparison any longer . Metonymy is the use of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as when we say that one sets a " good table " and keeps a " good cellar . " The fading of metonymy gives us " board , " in the sense of " regular meals " ; " the pulpit , " meaning " the clergy " ; " the bar , " meaning " the lawyers " ; " a chair , " meaning " a professorship . " Synecdoche is the naming of a thing from one of its parts or qualities . A part is used for the whole in " hands " for " laborers , " " blade " for " a sword , " German Bein for " leg " ( originally the same word as // English " bone " ) . Similarly , quality nouns often become collective nouns . English " youth , " " the quality of being young , " comes to mean " those who are young . " Latin multitudo originally meant " the quality of being many , maniness , " just as magnitudo means " the quality of being large , largeness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many individuals , crowd . " A judge is called from a characteristic " your honor " ; a king , ? your majesty ? ; a king 's son , " your royal highness . " Sometimes clothing gives a name , as when the clergy are called " the cloth , " or when we speak of " the blue and the gray . " More Specific Meaning Due to a Modifier Whenever one needs an expression which is more specific ? that is , contains more information and applies to fewer objects ? than any word in his language , he is compelled to use several words . This is the reason why we have adjectives and adverbs ; there is no one word for " red book , " " large apple , " " six inches , " " sing sweetly , " and therefore we have to use phrases . Such a phrase is inconvenient and cumbersome if the idea represented is at all common , and there is a tendency to drop part of a much-used phrase , thus giving the word that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Massicum , Falernum , Caecubum for vinum Massicum , etc. , just as we say " Champagne , " " Madeira , " etc. , omitting the word " wine . " The word " meat " in early English meant any kind of food , and the phrase " flesh meat " was used where now we say " meat . ' // Latin sermo meant " talk " ; in the Middle Ages the phrase sermo religiosus was very common , and now we use " sermon " in that sense without an adjective . The Latin phrase hiberna castra " winter camp " was simplified to hiberna , and thus hiberna changed its meaning from " of winter " to " winter camp . " Ludi changed its meaning from " exhibitions " to " theatrical exhibitions " through the phrase Judi scenici . Momentum " movement " gets the familiar meaning " moment " from the phrase momentum temporis . Very striking instances of this process are the change of Latin rem " thing " to French rien " nothing " through the phrase ne Tien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step " to the French negative pas through the phrase ne ... pas , which originally meant " not a step . " Many indeterminate words have thus come to suggest one of the original alternatives ; English " luck " now regularly means " good luck , " whereas Latin venenum came to mean " an ill potion , poison . " More General Meaning Due to a Pleonastic Modifier Everybody is familiar with the attempt to make ideas clearer or more striking by expressing them twice . A preacher once announced , " An afternoon service will be substituted instead . " Livy ( xxi. 32. 7 ) says fama Arius . . . . praecepta res erat " the matter had been previously anticipated by rumor . " In such pleonastic phrases one word is shorn of part of its meaning . In the church notice the phrase " substituted instead " leaves only the meaning " held " for " substituted , " whereas it should mean " held instead . " English " with " is connected with German wider and originally meant // " against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of opposition was fully expressed in the verb , and there was nothing left to the preposition but accompaniment . The new meaning thus originated has now supplanted the old one , except in the compounds " withstand , " " withdraw , " " withhold . " Although such changes of word-meaning are extremely rare , the process is of importance for syntax , and we shall discuss further examples under that topic . Analogical Change of Meaning Any change in the psychological grouping of words involves a shift of meaning . The word " shed , " " a hut , " is a dialectic form of the noun " shade " ; but , since the word has come to be associated rather with the verb " shed " and the compound " water-shed , " we think of a " shed " as a protection , not from the sun , but from the rain . The word applies to the same buildings as before , but the meaning has changed nevertheless . The process seems at first glance to be the converse of analogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more words on the basis of meaning causes them to approximate one another in form . The noun " shed , " on the other hand , came to be associated with the verb " shed " because of their identity of form , and the result is an approximation in meaning . As a matter of fact , however , an association close enough to produce either sort of change must be based upon a certain degree of similarity between the words affected in respect both of meaning and of form . The word male could not have changed femelle into " female " if the words had not already been similar in form ; the noun " shed " would // not have been associated with the verb " shed " if sheds had not happened to shed water . The basis of analogical change of sound and that of associative change of meaning are similar . Furthermore , the processes often go on together . There is a more definite association between English " male " and " female " than between French mdle and femelle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant merely " excess , " and the large emotional content which the word now has comes from its association with the word " rage . " " Shamefaced " was formerly " shamfast , " formed like " steadfast , " and it meant simply " modest . " The popular etymology makes the word suggest blushes and at the same time changes its form . We may therefore extend the term analogy so as to speak of analogical change of meaning . While a false etymology may produce no change of form , it almost always alters the meaning of a word . The popular derivation of " corns " ( on the feet ) from " corn , " " grain , " instead of from Latin cornu " horn " has slightly modified the force of the first word . " Ears " of corn are somewhat different to our thought if we associate them with our own ears . The word " saw , " " a saying , " has undergone considerable change in meaning since it has been separated from the verb " say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting tool . " When we say that a ship is " bound for Liverpool " the word " bound " properly means " ready to go , " but association with the participle of " bind " leads us to understand it as " directed toward , compelled to go to . " Analogy may extend to an entire group of words a change of meaning which originates in a part of the // group . " Execution " means " performance " ; but the execution of a decree of a court may include putting a man to death , and so , with shift of emphasis , " execution " came to mean " capital punishment . " Similarly , " executioner " ( performer ) came to mean " hangman . " The verb " execute , " being transitive , was held to its original meaning by the accompanying object ? " he executes the decree " can not be the source of " he executes the criminal " ; but the analogy of the two words " execution " and " executioner " finally caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sense of " put to death . " Latin valeo meant " be well , " and the second-person forms of the imperative and subjunctive , vale , valele , valeas , were commonly used as formulas of leave-taking . With shift of emphasis they came to mean " go away , " as in the formula of divorce , valeas , tibi habeas res tuas . By analogy the third person got the same force . In Terence ( Andria 889 ) Simo disowns his son for insisting upon a disadvantageous marriage : immo habeat , valeat , vivat cum ilia ! " he may marry her ! goodby to him ! let him live at her house ! " Semantic Rivalry When a word changes in form , we expect the earlier form to be lost . There are some exceptions to this rule , as in case of an analogical change of form ; or when the phonetic laws give two or more forms of a word , according to the position it occupies in the sentence ; or when a word which has changed its form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either from its own earlier literature or from a related language . In such cases , however , the two forms of the word will scarcely // ever last a great while unless they are used in somewhat different senses ; for example , English " skirt " and " shirt , " " of " and " off , " Latin partim " partly " beside partem ( accusative of pars " part " ) . When a word changes in meaning , on the other hand , the old meaning is very likely to survive alongside of the new . English " youth " occurs in three meanings , which arose successively ( see pages 92 and 141 ) . Latin miles is much more common in its primary meaning " soldier , " but is not uncommon in the secondary meaning " soldiery . " English " dress " is most familiar in the sense " to clothe , " but several of the more primitive meanings are still in use . There is , nevertheless , some tendency to do away with one of two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of a word is lost , and only the secondary one preserved ; Latin multitudo never means " numerousness , " English " fee " never means " cattle . " Many have regretted the loss of old meanings and the fading of the figures of speech in which some current meanings originated . They have also urged that we could better understand the actual use of words if we were fully conscious of their history . The study of etymology , it has been supposed , is a practical help to the correct use and full understanding of a language . There is a certain aesthetic value in the knowledge that " Florida " originally meant " land of flowers , " or that " daisy " is properly " the eye of day , " or that " Margaret " means " pearl . " But it is not often that a consciousness of a word 's etymology helps to an understanding of its present meaning , and in many cases such // knowledge is actually a hindrance . If a knowledge of the true etymology leads anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he will miss the present meaning of the word . Archbishop Trench , in a book that was long used as a textbook , ' derived the word " desultory " from Latin desultor " one who rides two or three horses at once , leaps from one to the other , being never on the back of any one of them long . " He continues : " Take , I say , the word thus to pieces , and put it together again , and what a firm and vigorous grasp will you have now of its meaning ! A desultory man is one who jumps from one study to another , and never continues for any length of time in one . " But when I say that Archbishop Trench 's treatment of linguistic problems is desultory , I do not mean to compare the reverend gentleman with a circus rider ! If the metaphors did not die out of language , the most commonplace remark would be so overloaded with impertinent suggestions that we could not discover which idea it was intended to express . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect it to help us very much in understanding our mother-tongue . CHAPTER V CHANGE IN VOCABULARY Reasons for the Loss of Words When ideas are lost to a community , the words which denoted them drop out of use . There are many words in the English dictionary which we never have occasion to use except in speaking of the past . Since threshing machines have been introduced , we rarely speak of " flails " ; and since spinning is now done by machinery , the word " distaff " is wanting in most persons ' vocabularies . " Stocks , " " pillory , " and " whipping-post " are rare words . In another generation the schoolboy 's " slate " will be as completely forgotten as his " hornbook " is now . Unless synonyms come to be differentiated in meaning , one of them is usually lost . " Writing " and " scripture " once meant the same thing . The latter has been differentiated in meaning from the former , so that it is synonymous with " Bible , " and this word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yea " and " nay " were once distinguished from " yes " and " no " in that the former answered an affirmative question ( " Are you going ? " ) , while the latter answered a negative question ( " Are you not going ? " ) . When this distinction broke down , " yea " and " yes , " " nay " and " no " became exact synonyms , and now " yea " and " nay " have become obsolete . In early English the principal parts of " bear " and " break " were " bear , 99
