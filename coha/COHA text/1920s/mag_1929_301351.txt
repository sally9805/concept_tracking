In Tonypandy , Wales , 200 members of the Mid-Rhondda Choral Society gave first performance to a Christmas mass . It was composed by Edwin Gardner , local street cleaner , who , despite no technical knowledge of music , took inspiration from the noises of the street , worked out melodies on a wheezy home organ and turned out a mass that last week made him hero of the Rhondda coal district .
