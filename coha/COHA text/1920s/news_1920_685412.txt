txt That the Republican platform will contain a plank relative to the high coat of living and suggesting general policies for its reduction Is beyond doubt . The universal demand for relief from high prices makes consideration of the subject certain . No cure-all can be offered , but the party can pledge itself to specific remedies for specific evils , which will do much to win public confidence in support of declarations which must needs be general . The matter of an economical administration of public affairs offers such a specific case . A pledge can be made and kept to adopt a strict budgetary system for the administration of federal finances . It will be possible to eliminate wasteful expenditure in duplication of effort . A successful effort might be made , for instance , to coordinate the work of the twenty-seven separate federal agencies engaged in construction of public buildings , the sixteen departments building roads , and the nineteen engaged in hydraulics , rivers , and harbors work , .. Similar improvements could be made in other departments with an increase of efficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing depart . ments , such as the postal service , the customs service , and the internal revenue service , could be brought to increased efficiency with an elimination of great waste by a wise system of management . Pledges of policy to bring about such improvements could be convincingly made in the platform and would strengthen a general policy of reduction of the high cost of living . In so far as the platform deals with general reduction of the high cost of living it may consider although it will nett be able completely to dispose of such questions as taxation . There is little doubt , either among producers or consumers , that the present excess profits tax is one primary cause of high prices . With war debts and postwar expenditures still to be met , the government must keepai.up its revenues , but there is well founded doilbt as to the wisdom of the excess profits tax as a means to this end . We do not presume to write a plank upon taxation , but we can reiterate the statement frequently made by leading economists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax is a drag upon production . If 60 per cent of a factory 's excess profits are seized by the government , the source of production is injured at its root . Capital for new enterprises is thus diverted and extension of production handicapped . If , on the other hand , taxes should be levied upon private incomes to make up-for losses due to elimination of corporation taxes , it would seem that industry would be encouraged to put its earnings back into an increase of production which eventually would bring lower prices . The chief stockholder in a factory with a net income of a million dollars , for Instance , instead of having that income taxed twice  --  once as corporation income and once as private income  --  would have it taxed only as private income . If he put $900,000 back into development of the factory and increased production , and kept only $100,000 for his private use , he would be taxed only en the $100,000 . If he kept the whole $1.000,000 for the upkeep of his town house , his country estate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be taxed on the entire million . There are arguments on both sides of such a great economic problem , but there are experts available for counsel of the platform builders who , between them , should be able to suggest a solution . A direct effort to offer a solution of such specific questions , backed by as definite policy of , economy in governmental affairs , will develop a plank which will strengthen the entire platform .
