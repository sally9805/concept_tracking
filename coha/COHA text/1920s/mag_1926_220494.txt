The remaining seven included men of lesser rank and two notorious assassins , Lazo Ismail and a man known simply as " Horsehide . " He , bullnecked , nerveless , had snored through the preceding night . The others had not slept . All were to be executed in a few minutes for conspiracy to murder President Mustapha Kemal Pasha . <P> White , billowy garments were brought to the condemned . Placards setting forth their guilt were hung about their necks . Attended each by an executioner , they marched in silence to the Smyrna quay . <P> There were 13 white nooses dangled from 13 tripods . In deadly , rhythmic unison the executioners made ready all the nooses at once , slipped them over bent heads . : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Torgoud Bey screamed a protest cut short by the rope : " Allah ! Allah , save us ! We are innoce . ... " <P> Twenty two more alleged plotters against the President 's life were held in custody last week , may suffer a similar fate .
