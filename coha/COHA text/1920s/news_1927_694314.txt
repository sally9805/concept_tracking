txt Women in their present fashions look so free , so untrammeled , that it is not strange for men to believe that they feel as free as they look . It seems , however , that men are deceived by the mere appearance of ease . Those short , scant skirts are useful only for play , dancing , hikes and sports . For ordinary wear they are as troublesome as the weighty skirts worn by women of a bygone day . This is one count in the indictment of the styles of today by ELIZABETII ROBINS PENNELL in The North American Review for October . She knows something about clothes , for she has " appeared in basques , boleros , blouses and shirtwaists , " and until recently she conformed to the modern , straight-line modes . Now she has rebelled and picks flaws in the latest fashions . No one can deny that the burden of women 's dress has been lightened . Its bulk has been reduced , and iu Summer men look enviously at the light and airy nothings which permit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. PENNELL contends , that these straight , slim delicate garments are actually uncomfortable , ugly , and dangerous to the health of the wearer ? Doctors have had a variety of things to say on the last point . Some speak of reckless exposure ; others commend simplicity and a back-to-nature trend . Fashion experts discuss learnedly the origins of dress and compare the present passion for dresses draped from the shoulders to the ideals of the Greeks and Romans . A wealth of gorgeous color and metallic effects may be seen in the Fall fabrics in shop windows . This elaborate brilliance indicates a continuation of gowns plainly cut and hung , for furbelows do not grow on patterned materials . As for the beauty , or lack of it , in women 's clothes today , Mrs. PEN NELL makes that her strongest point . " The average " woman is hopelessly out of draw " ing in the ready-made one-piece " gown , for the excellent reason that " its lines have no relation to hers . " Discomfort , even dangerous exposure , she will forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures suitable to straight-line frocks . All other women , according to our author , must starve and massage I themselves to slenderness , or make use of uncomfortable restraint . They can not be at ease in the artificially attained simplicity and flatness of the moment . Women 's common sense , with regard to fashion , does n't exist . it is part of the formula nowadays to say that women 's new freedom is exemplified in their sensible clothing , bobbed heads and natural-shape shoes . Mrs. PENNELL , by blowing up the myth of comfortable clothes , starts speculation on the other questions . Bobbed hair requires clipping , curling , waving , neck shaves and some hind of " stiekum " to hold it in place . The amazing height of heels on slippers worn in the streets of New York recently gives the lie to rumors-of flat heels for walking shoes . Exposure of neck , arms and legs has been defended by some artists , but this wife of an artist says " the " revelation of the human lorm to " day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most women can " not stand the ordeal . " Perhaps this is the beginning of a revolt against the fashions of the last year or two , and next Winter may give us a return of the heavily upholstered ladies of long ago ..
