Let me suggest that Congress ought to pass a resolution memorializing Colonel Lindbergh not again to risk the hazards of the air or the perils of the sea , but to devote his life to leadership in America in the development of aircraft and in continuing before the young manhood of America that compelling inspiration w'hich his great example has already been .
