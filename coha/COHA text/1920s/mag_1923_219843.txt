Within ten days after it left Peking , the third Asiatic expedition of the American Museum of Natural History ( TIME , April 28 ) , under the leadership of Roy Chapman Andrews , unearthed a fossil carnivorous dinosaur in the Mongolian desert . The giant , lizard-like reptile has not been identified with other known species , but belongs probably to the Triassic period ( 4,000,000 to 10,000,000 years ago ) . The legs are nine feet long , almost as large as the great herbivorous brontosaurus , some specimens of which in American museums have legs ten feet long , a total length of 50 to 90 feet and a weight of 20 to 40 tons .
