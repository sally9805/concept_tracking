txt Van Cortlandt Park . I note THE TIMES protest against the spoliation of Van Cortlandt Park . It seems to be overlooked that Van Cortlandt Park was procured and laid out , through the efforts of General Louis Fitzgerald , as grounds for the exercises of the National Guard on " varied ground . " It was -. frequently used for that purpose before and during the war , and can be legally so used now . I believe the use of any part of South Van Cortlandt Park for streets is wholly illegal . When the park was created by Laws of 1834 , Section 6 devoted the south 120 acres , and such land as might be required for the purposes of a rifle range , which means a strip at least half a mile wide and 1,000 feet long , to the purposes of the National Guard , as a military parade , camp and drill ground . Subsequently additional land was devoted to this purpose , and the Guard , in grand manoeuvres , uses every part of the south end , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these acts ever were repealed and.uniess they are by the proposed act , that act is as wholly Illegal as it would be to deprive the Guard of the Peekskill camp , or any armory without consent of the Armory Board . NATIONAL GUARD . New York , March 20 , 1929.
