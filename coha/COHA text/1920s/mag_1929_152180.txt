It was the first all-U . S. women 's finals in the history of Wimbledon but by no means the first all-French men 's finals . <P> Helen Wills defeated her California neighbor and acquaintance , Helen Jacobs , 6-1 , 6-2 . Fifteen thousand people watched Miss Jacobs rush about the court , applauded with chilling politeness her brilliant recoveries . With no more enthusiasm did they greet the cold , feline accuracy of the Wills game . Helen Wills knows that the best Jacobs shot is a cross-court backhand . Rarely was Helen Jacobs able to use it . There was no drama as once there had been when Miss Wills , winning , was suddenly unnerved , defeated by the swarthy Suzanne Lenglen , who found new strength and boldness by drinking a glass of brandy . Helen Wills last week was simply the best woman tennis player at Wimbledon and she won . She played , in all , twelve sets of singles , losing none , dropping only 16 games . <P> For old times ' sake , and because such victories as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy more than Helen Wills was Wimbledon 's idol last week . She , before the enthusiastic eyes of William Tatem Tilden II ( who murmured , " It 's too good to be true " ) and to the anguished exhortations of her nine-year-old daughter ( the youngest of four ) , defeated England 's hard-hitting Eileen Bennett 3-6 , 6-4 , 6-4 . British newspapers reprinted oldtime photographs taken when Mrs. Bundy , then May Sutton , became Wimbledon 's first U. S. champion in 1905 , repeating in 1907 . Last week she was defeated in the quarter-finals by England 's Joan Ridley but one moment of glory had been hers . Then she did one of the little things which all celebrities sometimes do and which , when they are discovered , add affection to the public 's awareness . At the end of one day 's matches she purchased a newspaper from a boy standing by the entrance to the stadium . She peered curiously into his face , then asked : " Are n't you Wiggins who used to be ball boy ? " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . " <P> " Then I owe you a racquet , " she said and fetched a racquet on which she signed her name , presented it to onetime Ballboy Wiggins . Twenty-two years ago , pleased with the Wiggins alertness , Miss Sutton promised him a racquet next time she returned . Last week was the first time she had played at Wimbledon since 1907 . <P> William Tatem Tilden II , 36 , was defeated last week . Four games he won in the first set , only one in the second . In the third Henri Cochet was leading him 5-1 . Suddenly , for a moment , returned the Tilden touch . His serves streaked into the court , changed direction when they struck , bounded far out of reach . His drives skimmed the net , his kills were invincible . But when the score was 5 to 5 , Tilden 's last fling was over . Valiantly he fought but Cochet took the next two games , the match .               @ @ @ @ @ @
