" Decency Outraged " <P> The exhibitor of a painting depicting Mr. Bryan and other prohibitionists interrupting the " marriage at Cana of Galilee " - where Christ turned water into wine-was held guilty in a Manhattan magistrate 's court of an act which " openly outrages public decency . " The decision was based upon a proposition which most lawyers regard as long ago abandoned-that Christianity is " part of the common law of the land . " From this it was deduced that there was at least an outrage on public decency within the meaning of the law , because , to paraphrase the court 's language , " it seriously offends the religious beliefs and sensibilities of the adherents of the Christian faith and tends to undermine and weaken religious and moral restraints.
