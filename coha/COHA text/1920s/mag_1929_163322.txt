Pleasure Crazed ( Fox ) . This finely made but curiously colorless picture is an example of the talkie producers ' fumbling to find a middle ground between stage and cinema . It attempts no broad effects , no cardinal emotions . Its plot , involving a novelist whose wife is unfaithful to him and who finds solace in the love of a girl who has been planted in his house by a gang of crooks , is as complicated as it sounds , yet never quite silly and never vulgar . A drama of manner is intended . The dialog , written by Clare Kummer , is civilized . The settings are beautiful ; the cast , bought from the legitimate theatre and including Marguerite Churchill and Kenneth MacKenna , takes pains with its material . The result is tedious because the medium is still too crude for the effect attempted . You sorely miss the old-fashioned bathos of those pictures which tried hard , however ineptly , to make you cry or wriggle with excitement . Typical shots : Frederick Graham , cinema 's best butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philandering polo player has sent up for Mrs. Dean . <P> Dangerous Curves ( Paramount ) . It would not be fair to apply the term stale to this story about a circus performer who loses his skill when his female partner breaks up the team . Long ago it passed from being simply stale to an honorable status as one of the great stencils of picturemaking . Long research has proved that there are two ways in which the shaken fellow can be redeemed : 1 ) by the return of his original partner ; 2 ) by another girl in the company who has loved him all the time but whose sacrifices have never been appreciated until the night when , as he lies drunk , she takes his place on the tightrope . Dangerous Curves employs Solution No. 2 . Clara Bow gets the kiss in the fadeout . She is a better actress than her usual It-girl role would lead you to expect , but in most of her scenes she is not trying to act so much as to suggest , rather over-consciously , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis in front of a bedroom door . <P> Twin Beds ( First National ) . Comedian Jack Mulhall , who used to act only with Dorothy Mackaill , herein plays opposite Patsy Ruth Miller , supported by a good cast . The story is one of those anecdotes generally used as a framework for the less profitable shows of minor burlesque circuits . Miss Miller 's frustrated ambition to sleep in a bed beside her husband 's on her wedding night might have been funny in spite of everything but for the dialog-line after awkward line recited in singsong and divided from the next by little fences of silence . Twin Beds is partially redeemed by one tune , " If You Were Mine " and by a few seconds of Zasu Pitts as a half-witted servant-girl . Typical shots : a drunk caught in a revolving door ; Miss Miller 's stage father falling off a piano stool . <P>
