While international statesmen discussed reducing the world 's armaments , the sworn defenders of the U. S. went dutifully ahead last week making weapons . <P> New Cruiser . With a great splash the U. S. S. Chester , flagship of the " treaty cruiser " fleet , took the water from the ways of the New York Shipbuilding Co. at South Camden , N. J. Third to be launched of the eight 10,000-ton cruisers authorized in 1924 ( the first two : Salt Lake City , Pensacola ) , the Chester set a record for laying-launching time-one year , 59 days . Scheduled for completion by June 1 , 1930 , she typifies the long-range U. S. fighting craft which is most objectionable to Great Britain . <P> Cruisers Ordered . Quietly the Navy awarded construction contracts for five cruisers as the first third of the ship replacement program authorized by Congress last winter . Three contracts went to Navy yards , two to private plants . Shortly the U. S. will have 130,000 tons of cruisers building simultaneously . <P> Planes Ordered . Contracts for 147 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordered also were 168 motors . Total cost : $4,172,949 . <P> Monster Seaplane . To the Glenn L. Martin Co. went a Navy contract for the largest , most powerful , fastest flying boat ever developed . Specifications : three Pratt &; Whitney motors producing 1,725 h. p . Top speed , 140 m. p. h . Cruising radius , 2,000 miles . Crew , five men . Cost , $150,000 . Construction time , one year . This all-metal seaplane will serve the Navy as a " fighting patrol . " <P> Dirigibles for Offense . Up under the belly of the dirigible Los Angeles last week rose a Navy service plane . Both craft were traveling 60 m. p. h . On the top wing of the plane was a big hook . Down from the dirigible extended a rigid trapeze . The plane 's pilot successfully maneuvered to engage hook with trapeze so that the plane hung there , was carried along . Three times the plane thus made successful contact . The experiment had been effected previously with smaller , semirigid Navy dirigibles , never with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing big dirigibles from observation vessels solely to motherships for airplanes , weapons of offense . <P> The Los Angeles is a non-military airship , received by the U. S. from Germany under an Allied agreement specifying that it be used only for training and experimental purposes , never for war . But the plane-hooking experiment furnished knowledge of speeds , stresses , handling , valuable in the fabrication of the Navy 's two huge dirigibles , twice the size of the Los Angeles , by the Goodyear-Zeppelin Co. at Akron , Ohio . The new ships will have built-in hangars in which to store and carry planes . <P> Fast Tank . The Army sent a wicked-looking military contraption charging over a rough Maryland field and among sand dunes at 42 m. p. h . It was the newest thing in combat tanks . Powered by a 12-cylinder Liberty motor , it rushed 62 m. p. h. down a road on eight hard-rubber tires . In 14 minutes it was converted into a caterpillar tractor , ready to hurtle its ten tons , its three-man crew , its full armament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly armored had moved before .
