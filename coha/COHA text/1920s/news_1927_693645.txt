txt William J. Cameron , editor of Henry Ford 's Dearborn Independent , took the . witness stand today in Aaron Sapiro 's $1,000 , - 000 libel suit against Mr. Ford and permitted the public to take a peep into the mind of the automobile manufacturer . The Ford legal staff , led by Senator James A. Reed of Missouri , confined the scrutiny to a peep . One of the statements by the editor that got into the records was that Mr. Ford holds " lenient " views on the Soviets of Russia . By " lenient " Mr. Cameron said ho did not mean . that . Mr. Ford was proSoviet , but that he was more tolerant of the Soviet experiment than The Dearborn Independent , which , he asserted , was " anti-Bolshevik . " Mr. Cameron was called as a w tness for Mr. Sapiro . William H. Gallagher , of counsel for the plaintiff . put sixteen questions to the editor designed to show that the alleged libel of the Chicago attorney had been part of a general attack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Semitic views alleged against a series of articles in The Dearborn Independent were , in reality , the views of Mr. Ford . But the sixteen questions were objected to and Federal Judge Raymond sustained the objections . The result was that Gallagher made no headway along this line of his campaign After court went into adjournment until Monday , the plaintiff 's lawyer retired to the Judge 's chambers , with Ford counsel , to argue for the admission of evidence which would enable him to reopen his effort to link Mr. Ford personally and directly with the alleged libels . Decision was reserved until Monday . Mr. Ford will not take the stand when the trial is resumed after the week-end recess . This shift came about when Mr. Sapiro and his attorney changed their plans for evidence . The automobile maker will be called late next week . Mr. Sapiro will testify in advance of Mr. Ford . Hope to Cross-Question Ford . The plaintiff and his lawyers appear confident that they will be able to subject the defendant to severe cross-examination , despite a seeming legal barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit can not impeach through cross-examination the testimony of a witness called by them . Mr. Sapiro believes , however , that a recent decision in North Dakota grants him the right to crossexamine his own witness , providing the witness is called for " cross-examination . " An attempt to try this with Mr. Cameron . however , was promptly detected by the Ford legal talent , and , when Judge Raymond upheld them , the editor was called merely for direct and re-direct at the hands of Mr. Gallagher . Outstanding in the other developments of today 's session of the trial I were additional charges against Mr. Sapiro as an organizer of farmers ' cooperative marketing associations . The accusations were made by Senator Reed in completing his opening to the Judge and jury . He charged that Mr. Sapiro , although reported to have said he did not seek money in his cooperative labors , had collected more than $1,000.000 in fees . The Senator said that " if his dreams had come true he would have collected millions and millions more . " Still another accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowden of Illinois had participated in " a secret conference " with Sapiro in Chicago in 1922 . The conference , according to the Senator , was for the purpose of perfecting plans to , form a national and then an international organization of farmers ' associations . Senator Reed did not link this conference with his charge , made yesterday , that Mr. Sapiro and his associates aimed at world control of wheat . Ford Documents Demanded . The appearance of Mr. Cameron on the witness stand came quickly upon the conclusion of the Ford opening . Before calling Mr. Cameron Mr. Gallagher asked for an order excluding from the court all other witnesses . The only one present was Fred L. Black , business manager of The Independent . The request for an order of exclusion precipitated an argument , during which Mr. Gallagher demanded - that the de- fense produce documents and copies of The Dearborn Independent . Clifford B. Longley , general counsel for the Ford Motor Company , said that a truck would be required to haul the documents to court . Mr. Gallagher insisted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond ruled that Mr. Black could remain in the court room . " Did you ever have any discussions with Mr. Ford regarding the policies of The Dearborn Independent ? " Mr. Gallagher asked Mr. Cameron . " Mr. Ford used to drop in occasionally and chat quite frequently , " replied Mr. Cameron . " Did you and Mr. Ford ever have disagreement in regard to policy ? " " Yes , and we would give reasons , " said the editor . " Can you give us instances where the disagreements occurred ? " asked counsel . Senator Reed objected on the ground that the question being asked had nothing to do with the matter on trial . Judge Raymond decided that Mr. Cameron could give instances of disagreement between Mr. Ford and his publication on various topics . " Mr. Ford , for instance , " said the editor , " is strongly set against war . The Dearborn Independent stands for adequate preparedness . I think Mr. Ford looks with lenient eyes on the Russian people 's new experiment , and the paper is anti-Bolshevik . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is pro-Soviet and that you are anti-Soviet ? " " Oh , no , " said the witness , " I did n't say that he was pro-Soviet . He is just lenient . " Mr. Cameron added that Mr. Ford did not impose his views regarding Russia on The Dearborn Independent , nor , in fact , did he insist tha ' the paper reflect any of his ideas . Then came the first of the sixteen questions designed to fasten anti-Semitism on Mr. Ford and to show that it was his influence that produced The Independent 's articles alleged to libel Mr. Sapiro as linked with Communists and I. W. W. in the service of a Jewish ring " seeking domination of the agriculture of the world . " Almost monotonously , Stewart Hanley of Ford counsel droned his objections that these questions were immaterial , irrelevant and incompetent . The Court sustained the objections . One of the banned questions was : " What is the fact relative to discussions with Mr. Ford prior to April , 1924 , with respect to his attitude to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another was : " Prior to April , 1924 , had you and Mr. Ford ever discussed policy with regard to international Jews ? " Question on " Bank Ring " Barred . Mr. Gallagher then asked the witness whether , as a journalist , he thought The Dearborn Independent came within a special category in so far as its editorial sphere was concerned . He said that he thought The Independent had a particular niche in the field . " We feel , as a publication , " he added , " that we can go into fields which other papers can not go into because of their special interests . " " What fields , for instance ? " asked Mr. Gallagher . " Politics , economics , " replied the editor , " organisation of money power , and certain streams of trends in our life which other publications do not care to touch on or do not dare to touch on . " The attorney asked Mr. Cameron what he meant by " organization of money power " ; did he mean the " international banking ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alleged libels ? Mr. Hanley objected and was sustained . " Have you on any occasion ever disagreed with Mr. Ford on his attitude toward international banking rings ? " asked Mr. Gallagher . Mr. Hanley 's objection barred that one . Then Mr. Gallagher tried : " When you referred to certain tendencies in American life , did you refer to the Jewish people ? " That went unanswered , and so did : " What is the fact , where you and Mr. Ford have ever discussed the attitude of the paper on Jews , with regard to these articles ? " The question of Mr. Gallagher 's right to introduce a copy of every issue of The Dearborn Independent since its establishment then came up . The attorney said that he expected to show that Mr. Ford 's alleged bias against Jews in the early days of the weekly was part and parcel of the more recent alleged libels . Judge Raymond said that he would announce his decision on Monday . Protests Reed 's Outline . Senator Reed closed his outline of what Mr. Ford and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justification for the alleged libels by concentrating his charges against Mr. Sapiro . When he ended , Mr. Gallagher moved that the entire speech be excluded . This was denied , and the attorney in noting an exception said that if the case went against them he would make the Senator 's opening one of the grounds for an appeal . In charging that the " secret conference " was held with Mr. Sapiro and former Governor Lowden participating , Senator Reed also named as present Eugene Meyer Jr. , former director of the War Finance Corporation . The Senator said that some of the employes of the American Farm Bureau Federation had been invited to the conference , but that none of the officers was bidden to attend . Later the plans of the conferees became known and the federation refused to join in them . Mr. Gallagher declared that the federation and the meeting had nothing to do with the issues of the trial . Judge Raymond asserted that be was disposed to take the same view . Senator Reed said that Mr. Gallagher in his opening had complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the suit about proof of efforts to launch an international cooperative . " But , your Honor , " said Mr. Gallagher , " we did not claim any libel in having the intention to advertise to the farmers of the world to combine for their own interests . Our libelous charge is that they charge that we are one of a gang of international Jews who are organizing the farmers for the benefit of the international Jews . " Now , if Frank 0 . Lowden is a part of this conspiracy , is one of the gang of international Jews , and that is made very plain , all well and good . I will withdraw my objection . But if that is not ' very plain then this has no place here at all . " " Oh , " said Senator Reed , " Eugene Meyer was a Jew and Sapiro was a Jew and one of the others there , Sam Guard , was a Jew . " " Sam Guard was not a Jew , and never ' was a Jew , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after promising to connect the statement to proof later , was permitted to continue . He did so by putting Robert W. Bingham , publisher of The Louisville Courier-Journal , among the ranks at the " secret " conference . " I want to show in furtherance of the truth of these articles , " he said , " that they had for their purpose the creation of an organization , first to control the wheat of the United States and then to control wheat internationally . That is the charge that has been made and the very thing that Mr. Gallagher said that we could not prove . Now I want to show that Mr. Meyer and these people were acting in cooperation to carry out that scheme and that Mr. Sapiro was in with them . " We will show you that Bernard M. Baruch loaned this committee , these people who had gotten together , or advanced them , $5,000 . Julius Rosenwald of Sears , Roebuck &; Co. loaned heg ** as.r . Bingham loaned them $20,000 . I think Mr. Sapiro himself put up $5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than forty of these Sapiro associations failed , or substantially failed . These are just a few of the high points of the evidence that I have given , and when this evidence is in we will have shown these failures of these associations , and that with the exception of a few they have been unsuccessful , and that the members have received less money for their products than was paid on the open market to outsiders . " We will have shown that thousands of farmers have suffered terrible losses in Sapiro 's organization and that these losses run to millions and millions of dollars . We will also show that all of Sapiro 's claims that these associations could control prices turned out to be false , to be failures and that the whole plan and scheme of his organization was unsound and in many respects unworkable . " Senator Attacks Fees . Mr. Reed then turned to the question of alleged big fees paid to Mr. Sapiro by the cooperatives . " We expect to show , " he said , " that these fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sapiro had been slated for a fee of $100,000 for organizing tobacco growers in Louisville . Mr. Sapiro received $3G,000. said Mr. Reed . and a further fee of $12,500 for organizing several subsidiaries of the main association . Another fee said to have been paid to Mr. Sapiro was ** from the California Prune and Apricot Growers , Inc . The Senator charged that in connection with the management of this association while Mr. Sapiro was with it there was maintained a group engaged " in spying on the growers who were becoming discontented and were trying to organize for their own protection . " In discussing the Idaho Potato Growers Association , the Senator brought in the name of a San Francisco commission house , Weyl &; Zuckerman . Explaining that he did so not " at all in derogation , " Senator Reed said that the firm was " composed of several Jewish members . " He said that the firm members were acquainted with Mr. Sapiro and that ene of his law partners was counsel for Weyl &; Zuckerman . He declared that the firm became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers . He called this arrangement " a conspiracy or , if you please , a confederation . " which resulted in " a highly lucrative contract " for Weyl &; Zuckerman . He accused the plaintiff of coercing the potato growers to hire men he recommended . Charges Unethical Acts . Continuing , Senator Reed declared : " We will show you numerous acts entirely unprofessional ; that for a lawyer to go out and promote his own business is unprofessional ; that to solicit business , directly or indirectly , is for a lawyer unprofessional ; that to hold out false promises to clients is unprofessional . " It is also unprofessional to work for two or more clients having opposing interests at the same time ; that to connive with a lawyer to get business partly in his name and partly in the name of another lawper , and then to split the fees by previous agreement is unprofessional ; that to induce the organizers of an association without authority to secretly pay a large fee is unprofessional ; that in order to gain control of associations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations and to cause them to be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars more than the property is worth is unprofessional . " That to confederate with speculating agencies while at the same time claiming and pretending to be the enemy of speculators , and to be engaged in protecting the farmer clients from speculators ? " " Your Honor , " Mr. Gallagher interrupted . " this should not be allowed . Your Honor refused to let me make an argument in my opening statement . " " This is what counsel claims to be the unprofessional conduct of the plaintiff , " said Judge Raymond . " and I think it is proper . You may proceed . " Senator Reed went on : " Finally , we will show you that these articles were printed in good faith for the purpose of protecting the farmers and growers of the United States against these schemes of the plaintiff , Sapiro . And having shown all of this , we will ask you to find that Aaron Sapiro was an exploiter of the American farmer . " Senator Reed left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other members of the Senate committee investigating campaign funds . He plans to return on Monday , when the examination of Mr. Cameron , broken by the wrangle over The Dearborn Independent files and other documents , will be resumed .
