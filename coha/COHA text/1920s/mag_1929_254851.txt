Animals and Fellow Humans <P> THE PATHWAY-Henry Williamson- Dutton ( $2.50 ) . After the War , William Maddison crept back to his native Devon , to the burrows , the sandhills , the rising and ebbing tides , to starry nights in winter , to summer nights of mad lightning and serene moonlight . At the Manor of Wildernesse he still found Mary , " grave and beautiful and innocent , " who loved small birds and high winds as he did himself . <P> He thought of War and wrote , " The hair of my Mary is dark , and her eyes are shadowed deep , but the despair of the lost generation was darker , and the water in the shell-holes that drowned them was deeper . How may I rest against her heart which beats so gently , when the heart of the world is troubled , when its breast may be beaten again by the iron of the guns of the lightless people ? I am weary , but how can I rest having seen the Light ? " <P> For William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strange symbols , who spoke frankly about God and Jesus Christ and Shelley , taking them all so seriously that he seemed often to blaspheme . The simple villagers , understanding , caressed him with their sweet Devon accent , but their patroness , wealthy spinster , bristled with gossip about him . Alarmed for her daughter , Mary 's mother discouraged William 's presence at the manor . Hurt , miserable , William withdrew . <P> To write about a mystic without making him seem too queer is a distinguished accomplishment . Author Williamson 's mystic cuts strident across a maze of conventionalities , but he is never cheap , affected , sentimentalized . His theories may well antagonize , but his understanding of animals , his intuition regarding fellow humans , are faultless , impressive . <P> Henry Williamson is also author of the whimsical , profound , animal story , Tarka The Otter , His Joyful Waterlife and Death in the Country Of Two Rivers .
