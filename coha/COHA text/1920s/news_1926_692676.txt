txt President Coolidge 's economy policy and the good faith of Congress will be severely tested in the coming two months as Congress tackles the many important measures before it and the Republican Party prepares its program for this year 's elections . The note of warning sounded by President Coolidge yesterday when he approved the Spanish War Pension bill , it was asserted today by advisers Of the Administration , must be accepted literally by Congress . It was also declared that President Coolidge had won the confidence of the country and enjoyed great prestige regardless of party affiliations because of his insistence on economy . He is not going to wipe out this reputation , his friends say , to satisfy some members of ? his party who hope to strengthen themselves by particular legislation still before Congress . He intends to veto all other bills wherever it may be necessary to avert a real deficit next year , it is said . With farm legislation and half it dozen other individual appropriation ' measures being stoutly pressed , it is estimated that Congress probably will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated deficit of over $250,000,000 , unless he employs his veto power . President to Insist on Economy . . President Coolidge so far has al1 lowed Congress to have its way , and has not exerted undue pressure upon I the Republican leaders , but he has told them that he can not permit himself to sanction appropriation bills that will ' bring about a deficit next year and make additional taxes ' necessary . They are reported not to have regarded seriously the welts of caution that he dropped to them at numerous breakfast conferences and at his bi-weekly conferences with the press . It was for this reason that the President made his statement to the public Saturday in connection with the Spanish War Pension bill . According to close friends of the Administration , the President has decided to fight his own party in Congress , if necessary , and has placed his position before the public in the hope there will be a reaction fro= the taxpayers that would induce Congress to call a halt on further exper.

It was declared by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reason of having attempted to conduct the Government on business - lines , keeping the budget bal1 anced and at the same time reducing taxes to the lowest possible extent . President 's Policies Approved . The important Administration policies such as adherence to the World Court and reduction of taxes have been carried out . In connection with his financial program , President Coolidge made the settlement of war debts paramount , and he finds this also about completed , with the expectation that the French debt agreement will be ratified before Congress adjourns . There are other issues still in the legislative incubator such as farm relief legislation , consolidation of the railroads and the plan for the settle-1 ment of wage and labor disputes between the railroads and their men . All these are on the way to final 11 consideration , so that President Coolidge looks forward to a pleasant va- cation if he can hold the pursestrings tight enough to prevent a real deficit in 1927 .

If Congress will not aid him , President Coolidge intends to veto all other big individual appropriation bills sent to him . He hopes , however , that the party will I not make it necessary to , . take such action , feeling that it is their duty also to keep faith with the people . Farm Legislation Will Bring Test . That this struggle between Congress and the President will assume an important aspect in the next few days is now apparent . The first test will come this week when the House considers farm legislation . Even should Congress pass the Tincher bill , carrying the lesser appropriaItion of $100,000,000 , the charge upon the Treasury next year would be tremendous , it is stated , causing a large actual deficit rather than the estimated paper deficit of $40,000,000 now probable . In addition to the farm relief bill . there is pending in the House a soIcalled pension bill to modify the bonus I law ' which carries an appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems sure to come to a vote , but with present indications that it will not be approved by the Senate should it reach that body . There is pending in the Senate the ' $165,000,000 Public Building bill . This expenditure already has been estimated and would not increase the estimated deficit next year . Early Adjournment Appears Impossible Apart from controversial legislation which includes the Farm Relief bill and the modified bonus measure , the Radio bill is a source of some irritation between - the White House and Congress that tends to widen the present difficulties . With all these subjects still before Congress , there is every indication the session will be continued after June 1 , when it was originally thought adjcurnment would be taken . The Senate faces the prospect of the Judge English impeachment trial , with many leading Senators in favor of the trial being postponed until Fall . If Judge English should strongly insist on immediate Vial , there is a probability that it would be held this Summer . Differences are expected to develop between Congress and the President on the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question now asked is will President Coolidge assume the position against further appropriations that his advisers say he intends to do and as indicated in his recent statement ?
