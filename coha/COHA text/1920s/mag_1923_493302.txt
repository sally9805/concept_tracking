The New REPUBLIC Views of American Poetry Two Generations in American Poetry SOME fifty years ago , more or less , a handful of un- related men and women took to being born up and down these United States . What impulse was responsible for them , what submerged law of change and contradiction settled upon them as its tools , it is a little hard to say ? at least , to say in any sort of reasonable compass . They appear to have been sporadic efforts of some force or other , operating over a period of nearly twenty years ; but so disconnected were they , geographically ; socially , and atavistically , that one thing is certain : however they may have derived from a central urge , they did not derive in the least from one another . This little handful of disconnected souls , all unobtrusively born into that America which sighed with Richard Watson Gilder , wept with Ella Wheeler ' Wilcox , permitted itself to dance delicately with Celia Thaxter , and Occasionally to blow a graceful blast on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startle its progenitors . This was a world of , sweet appreciation , a devotee of caged warblers , which species of gentle music-makers solaced it monthly from the pages of the Century or the Atlantic Monthly . How pleasant to turn away for a moment from the rattle of drays and horse-cars and listen to a woodland strain repeated in a familiar and well-loved cadence ! That these robins of ours were doing their best to imitate the notes of English blackbirds and nightingales , only made their efforts the more precious ; and , to be sure , their imitations were done with a modesty worthy of all admiration . They knew their place in the world 's harmony and saw to it that they did not overstep it . This was expected and loyally adhered to . What of America had time for these not too exciting titivations of the emotions , harkened and was pleased ; the busy rest of the populace heeded not . at all and missed very little . Now how it was that a handful of young persons , growing up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus long ) , found themselves , one and all , so out of sympathy with the chaste and saccharine music wandering through the ambient air of current periodicals , is one of the wonders of psychological phenomena . It is a fact , nevertheless , that with no one to talk to or compare notes with , each as separate as conditions could well make him , one and all they revolted against the taste of their acquaintances , and launched , the whole flotilla of them , out into the turbulent sea of experiment and personal expression . Upheavals make for art , as is well known . The debacle of the Franco-Prussian war gave France the galaxy of poets and musicians which made the last two decades of the nineteenth century so rich a period in her annals . But here , in America , there had been no war sufficiently recent to cause an effect of leaf turning . The Civil War was too long gone by . No , the change in poetry seems to have sprung from something far more prosaic . From the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother of art , no matter how odd such an idea may seem . Look at the Elizabethan age in England . It followed immediately upon an expansion of the world 's markets , did it not ? But this expansion was all bound up with the romance of daring adventure and exploration . Quite so , and was not ours ? A continent crossed and settled at infinite peril ; rivers run into clacking factories ; electricity caught and chained to wires , forcing the very air to obedient echo ? arc not such things as these romantic and adventurous ? Whether people had the wit to see them in this light or not , the little devils who rule the psychological currents which man ignores and invariably obeys found them so . Nemesis is extraordinarily ironical . . While the men of the race were making fortunes , and the women were going to concerts and puzzling their heads over a Browning whom , having invented themselves , they could not in the least understand , so different was he from dear Mr. Gilder -- while all this was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pennsylvania and Arkansas , by . one , and one , and one , like beads before they are strung upon a string , the makers of this poetic renaissance of ours were obscurely working all toward one end and that as various as the strands in a piece of rope . Who the pioneers of this movement were , I am not going to say . They are perfectly well known to every one interested in present day literature . Besides , we are still too near to them to render absolute " statement possible . Were a suffrage taken , some names would appear in all lists , others would differ . Time alone can make the actual personnel of the movement secure . My intention here is to analyze a movement , not criticise individual talents . When I mention such , I do so as illustration merely . With all their diversity , there was a central aim which bound the group together . Conscious with some , unconscious with others , their aim was to voice America . : Nov you can not voice one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of these poets was to drop the perpetual imitation of England . It is interesting , if painful , to realize what a desperately hard time these young poets had . When they could get themselves printed , which , was seldom , they were either completely ignored or furiously lampooned . And still they were alone , none knew the others ; but they were a courageous little band , and on they went , writing , and putting their poems in their writing-table drawers . Suddenly , explosively , the movement came to a head in 1912 and the years immediately succeeding . In October , 1912 , Harriet Monroe brought out her magazine Poetry , shut , splendid work though that magazine has done , I can not subscribe to its often expressed opinion that it is largely responsible for the recognition the group began to achieve . Instead I should say that it was another manifestation of the fulminating spirit which produced the poets themselves . Every one of these poets had been writing for years , some . of them for many years , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived on the scene . It seems to me rather that the ferment had reached a point when it was bound to burst . For burst it did and bore down on the American consciousness with an indomitable violence not to be resisted . Horrified professors shuddered and took to umbrellas and arctics , newspaper fulminators tried all the weapons in their armories from snubs to guffaws . It was no use ; what must come , comes . The caged warblers were swept out of court . Those people who hated the new poetry were forced back on the classical . old which antedated the warbler era . And that alone was a good thing . But this movement which we speak of so glibly , do we really know what it was ? Let us observe it a little . In the first place , it was an effort to free the individual from the expression of the herd ; in the second , it had for its object the breaking down of mere temperamental barriers . This looks like paradox , but it is not . The poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with recording personal emotions , but recording them in a perfectly stereotyped way . The new poetry found that emotions were not confined to the conjugation of the verb to love , and whether it said " I love " or " Behold the earth and all that is thereon , " if it followed its natural inclina ? tion , it would say it quite differently from the way its fathers had said it . The truth is that this new poetry , whether written by men or women , was in essence masculine , virile , very much alive . Where the nineties had warbled , it was prone to shout . When it concerned itself with love , its speech was natural and unrestrained ; when not concerned with love , it found interests as manifold as the humanity crowding on its eyes from every street corner . It had so much to say that it simply could not say it , and so huge a country to speak for that no one poet could do more than present a little by-lane of it . It took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give any adequate expression of the movement or the age which produced it ; but , taking the work by and large , book after book , here was a volume of energy , a canvas so wide and sparkling , that something very like the dazzling tapestry of American life , thought , and activities , was obtained . As the poets were , so was their work . One gave simple facts ; another approached the central truth obliquely ; a third abandoned America as far as direct allusion went , and presented it the more clearly in reactions on distant countries and periods viewed through American eyes . For instance , take Frost and Sandburg and juxtapose them with " H. D. " Not one of these three could have sprung from any country but America , and yet where Frost and Sand-burg portray their special country-sides , town and open , " H. D. " occupies herself with an ancient loveliness alive again through the eager vision of a young race to which nothing is stale . Wherever posterity may place the group in the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the endeavor after a major utterance . They may have failed ; they dared the stars . They hitched their wagons to the tails of comets . There was nothing the matter with their aim ; success is another thing , and not for us to gauge . The world learned to like them pretty well , although they were not very much understood . It is not the way of our modern world to accord greatness its due , even when it slyly supposes that it may exist . The very feeble educations which are all most of us can boast tend to caution rather than to acclaim . It is safer to doubt , for then the odds are with you . No , the world was interested , but took refuge in the old cry : " These men are precursors , we await the great poet for whom they are clearing the way . " And what happened ? Rather a curious thing . At first the pioneers rolled up their tallies of disciples . Incipient " Spoon Rivers " rippled on every side ; bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared ; red-blooded followers travestied Sandburg 's least successful pictures , stupidly unaware that it was his tenderness and insight which made him the man he was ; the Imagists almost despaired of ever freeing themselves from the milk and water imitations with which young hopefuls flooded the non-paying magazines . Still the great poet who was to go all of them one better did not make his appearance . Instead came a volte face . Reaction , by Jove ! Or so it appeared . Reaction after ten years ! But things move swiftly nowadays . The bewildered elders rubbed their eyes . Had all their work been in vain ? By no means , for the reaction owed more to them than it has ever been willing to acknowledge . Without them , the younger poets could not have existed . Now constant reaction is a law of art . When one impulse is exhausted , the artistic undercurrents turn to another . Finding it impossible to outdistance the pioneers on their own ground , the next generation veered off at a tangent and sought other grounds of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must produce poets of something like the calibre of the poets reacted from . Without attempting to answer this question one way or the other , we can , at least , peer a little more closely at the type of poetry coming on the stage today . The younger group appears to be composed of two entire ? ly distinct companies . Unlike the pioneers , who had among them the tie of a concerted effort , these two sections are completely at variance with one another . To name them , one calls itself the Secessionists ; the other we may christen , for purposes of differentiation , the Lyrists . It is not a very good name , for all poets write lyrics , but as these poets write practically nothing else , it will serve . Of these two groups , the Lyrists are unquestionably doing the better work . They proclaim no tenets , but confine themselves to writing poetry , and doing it uncommonly well . Their expertness is really amazing . They have profited by the larger movement in finding an audience ready-made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and a considerable body of critical writing bearing on the poetical problems of the moment ? aids to achievement which the older group entirely lacked . Through the practice of the elders , the younger group has learned to slough off the worst faults of the nineties , and , in the matter of versification , there is scarcely a fault to be found with their work . I refer , of course , to that of the leaders . The strange thing here , however , the crux of the reactionary situation , is its aim . For where the older generation aimed at a major expression , these younger poets are directly forcing themselves to adhere to a minor one . The terms major and minor in poetry have nothing to do with good and bad ; a minor poet is often meticulously careful and exceedingly fine . Major and minor refer to outlook , and it is a fact that this younger group deliberately seeks the narrow , personal note . It is a symptom , I suppose , a weariness of far horizons , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief stock in trade , we should not expect a high degree of intellectual content , yet in one member of the group we find it ? in Elinor Wylie , who , unlike Edna St. Vincent Millay , that delightfully clever exponent of the perennial theme of love , is one of the most intellectual and well equipped of American poets . These two are the acknowledged chiefs of the company . For , while the older movement was innately masculine , the new one is all feminine . It is , indeed , a feminine movement , and remains such even in the work of its men . The Secessionists are quite apart . Their object is science rather than art ; or perhaps it is fairer to say that to them art is akin to mathematics . They are much intrigued by structure , in a sense quite other than that in which it is usually employed in poetry . They have a host of theories , and are most interesting when stating them , but the doubt arises whether a movement which concerns itself more with statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever going to produce works of art of a quality to justify the space taken up by pronunciamentos . The outcome of all this is somewhat hazy . It is a fact that , side by side with the youths , the elders are still writing . Whether the younger group will sweep aside the older , it is too soon to see . That the far easier poetry of the Lyrists will be , and is , immensely popular , is only natural . The question is how long can it maintain itself in the face of its wilfully restricted limits . Whether the future will bring a period of silence preceding another vigorous dash forward , or whether the present feminine mood will lead directly into the next advance , who shall say ? Not I , at any rate . Both possibilities are in orders and for the present I think we may be satisfied . The time has been short , and considerable has been done in a variety of ways by the two generations at the moment writing . As Whitman said , here is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .
