txt There will always be two great achievements to President Harding 's credit when . history comes to get itself written . He had plenty of backbone and exhibited a wise choice of men when he set the budget system on its feet and stood behind it against all the forces of militant bureaucracy . The adjustment of the British war debt will have incalculable benefits as the years go by , and here again success could not have been achieved without wisdom and foresight at the White House . President Harding is human and capable of mistakes . One of them was both the method and time of his advocacy of ship subsidy . It is true also that he took up membership of a world court at the wrong time and in the wrong way . ' It will startle people on both sides of the case to learn that the world court has nothing whatever to do with the League of Nations . The conception of it antedates that illusory project by many years . It was clearly in the mind of both Hague conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State in recent years , in his admirable , instructions to our delegates at the second Hague conference . The conception of a world court without a policeman to back its decrees stimulated William Howard Taft and Hamilton Holt in their project for a League to Enforce Peace . It was indeed the idea of the Taft-Holt League which Woodrow Wilson appropriated and failed , with his usual chivalry , to acknowledge . But it has long been felt that even with nothing but moral influence to back its decisions a world court could do much in crystallizing the inchciate gases and solids of international law . Temperately administered it would have the backing of enlightened public opinion anywhere , and especially among the English-speaking peoples who form today , without conscious partnership , the greatest guarantee for peace since the time of Julius Caesar . But President Harding introduced the proposition in the last moments of a Congress whose saner members were properly , and even desperately , anxious to quit and go home without the menace of a mischief-making special session behind them . This was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fruitlessly supported Wilson in 1920 promptly seized upon this small modicum of encouragement and claimed it as the first step to American member . ship in the League of Nations . So far as we are concerned that proposal is as dead as the dodo . American public opinion is apt to be hasty in its first expression . Its first thought is seldom right , or only right for the wrong reason . But America 's sober second thought has always stood the test of time , and in 1920 it said , with a plurality of seven million votes , 5that it would have nothing to do with any League of.Naltons . It is a pity that President Harding 's proposal stepped off so disastrously on the wrong foot . He should have an opportunity to educate public opinion on the real status of a world court in , the coming summer . To do so he may wisely discard all the false interpretations of its meaning which have been current since President Taft went out of office .
