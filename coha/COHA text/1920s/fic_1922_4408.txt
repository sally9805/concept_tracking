Wappin ' Wharf CHARACTERS THE DUKE PATCH-EYE THE CAPTAIN RED JOE DARLIN ' BETSY OLD MEG SAILOR CAPTAIN THREE SAILORS SETTING : For details of Stage Set turn to pages 35-6-7 . A PROLOGUE TO BE SPOKEN BY BETSY Our scene is the wind-swept coast of Devon . By day there is a wide stretch of ocean far below , and the abutments of our stage arise from a dizzy cliff . The time is remote , and ships of forgotten build stand out from Bristol in full sail for the mines of India . But we must be loose and free of precise date lest our plot be shamed by broken fact . A thousand years are but as yesterday . We make but a general gesture to the dim spaces of the past . The village of Clovelly climbs in a single street  --  a staircase , really  --  and it is fagged and out of breath half way . But far above , on a stormy crag , clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this topmost ledge fishwives sometimes scramble by day ; but when a wind shall search the crannies of the night , then no villager would dare to climb so high . You will seek today in vain the pirates ' cabin . Since the adventure of our play a thousands tempests have snarled across these rocks . You must convince your reason that these pinnacles of yesteryear , toppled down by storm , lie buried in the sea . We had hoped that our drama 's scene might lie on a pirate ship at sea . We had wished for a swaying mast , full-set with canvas  --  a typhoon to smother our stage in wind . We had hoped to walk a victim off the plank , with the sea roaring in the wings . But our plot deals stubbornly with us . Alas , our pirates grow old and stiff . They have retired , as we say , from active practice and live in easy luxury on shore . Yet we shall see that their villany still thrives . How shall we select a name for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is known as Wapping . In these days that we call the present it has sunk to common use and its rotten timbers are piled with honest unromantic merchandise . But once a gibbet stood on Wapping Wharf , and pirates were hanged upon it . It was the first convenient harborage for inbound ships to dispose of this dirty deep-sea cargo . So it was the somber motif of a pirate 's life  --  his moment of reflection after he had slit his victim 's throat . Tonight , although your beards grow long and Time has marked its net of wrinkles  --  tonight , the years spin backwards . Only the young in heart will catch the slender meaning of our play . We are too quick to think that childhood passes with the years  --  that its fine fancy is blunted with the practice of the world . Too long have we been taught that the clouds of glory fade in the common day . If a man permits , a child keeps house within his heart . Our prologue outstays its time . Already the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke limps for practice on his wooden leg . Presently our curtain will rise . We shall see the pirates ' cabin , with the lighthouse in the distance , Flint 's lantern and the ladder to the sleeping-loft . We shall hear a storm unparalleled  --  thunder , lightning and a rush of wind , if it can be managed . Then our candles burn to socket . Our pasteboard cabin grows dark . The blustering ocean , the dizzy cliffs of Devon , melt like an unsubstantial pageant . Once again , despite the signpost of the years , we have run on the " laughing avenues of childhood . " Illustration BY WAY OF EXPLANATION Several weeks ago an actor-manager requested me to try my hand at a play for the winter season . The offer was unexpected . " My dear sir , " I said , " I am immensely flattered , but I have never written a play . " Then I hastened to ask , " What kind of play ? " for fear the offer might be withdrawn . He replied with sureness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " with lots of pirates and  --  no poetry . " He stressed this with emphatic gesture . " And at least one shooting , " he added . It was a slim prescription . He left me to brood upon the matter . The proposal was too flattering to be rejected out of hand . After a furious week upon a plot and dialogue , I was given an opportunity to display my wares . The manager himself met me in the hallway . " Is there a shooting ? " he asked , with what seemed almost a suppressed excitement . I was able to satisfy him and he led me to his inner office , where he pointed out an easy chair . The room was pleasantly furnished with bookshelves to the ceiling . Evidently his former ventures had been prosperous , and already I imagined myself come to fortune as his partner . While I fumbled with embarrassment at my papers  --  for I dreaded his severe opinion  --  he himself fetched a basket of coal for a fire that burned briskly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now appeared that he had summoned to our conference several of his associates  --  the subordinates , merely , of his ventures  --  his manager of finance ( with a sharp eye for a business flaw ) , his costumer and designer , and another person who is his reader and adviser and , in emergency , fills and mends any sudden gap that shows itself . My notion of theatrical managers has been that they are a cold and distant race  --  the more sullen cousin of an editor . Is it not considered that on the reading of a play they sit with fallen chin , and that they chill an author to reduce his royalty ? It is naught , it is naught , saith the buyer . I am told that even the best plays are hawked with disregard from theatre to theatre , until the hungry author is out at elbow . They get less civility than greets a mean commodity . Worthless mining shares and shoddy gilt editions do not kick their heels with such disregard in the outer office . Popcorn and apples  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But none of this usual brusqueness appeared . Rather , he showed an agreeable enthusiasm as we proceeded  --  even an unrestraint , which , I must confess , at times somewhat marred his repose and dignity . Manifestly it was not his intention to depreciate my wares . He exchanged frank glances of approval with his subordinates  --  with his costumer especially , with whom his relation seems the closest . In the first act of my play , when it becomes apparent that one of my pirates goes stumping on a timber leg , his eye flashed . And when it was disclosed that the captain wears a hook instead of hand , he forgot his professional restraint and cried out his satisfaction . He was soon wrapped in thought by the mysterious behaviour of the fortune-teller and he said , if she were short and stout , he had the very actress in his mind . But it was in the second act that he threw caution to the winds . As you will know presently , Red Joe  --  one of my pirates  --  seizes his trusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must not expose my plot . At this exciting moment ( which is quite the climax of my play ) Belasco  --  or any of his kind  --  would have squinted for a flaw . He would have tilted his wary nose upon the ceiling and told me that my plot was humbug . What sailorman would mistake a lantern for a lighthouse ? Nor were there lighthouses in the days of the buccaneers . He would have scuttled my play in dock and grinned at the rising bubbles . Mark the difference ! My manager , ignoring these inconsequential errors , burst from his chair  --  this is amazing !  --  and turned a reckless somersault between the table and the fire . His costumer , who knows best how his eccentricity runs to riot , checked him for this and sent him to his chair . He sobered for a minute and the play went on . Presently , however , when the enraged pirates gathered to wreak vengeance on their victim , I saw how deeply he was moved . His exultant eye sought the bookshelves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be allowed a handstand with his heels waving against the ceiling . His excited fingers obviously were searching for a dagger in his boot . You may conceive my pleasure . If his cold and practiced judgment could be so stirred , might I not hope that the phlegmatic pit in shiny shirt-fronts would rise and shout its approval at our opening ? And to what reckless license might not the gallery yield ? I fancied a burst of somersaults in the upper gloom , and tremendous handsprings  --  both men and women  --  down the sharp-pitched aisle . It would be shocking  --  this giddy flash of lingerie  --  except that our broader times now give it countenance . Peeping Tom , late of Coventry , in these more generous days need no longer sit like a sneak at his private shutter . He has only to travel to the beach where a hundred Godivas crowd the sands . I saw myself on the great occasion of our opening night bowing in white tie from the forward box . Our conference was successful . When the reading of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of the gibbet , he thanked me and excused himself from further attendance by reason of a prior engagement . Under the stress of selection for his theatre he can not sleep at night , and his costumer wisely packs him off early to his bed . She whispers to me , however , that although he had hopes for a storm at sea and a hanging at the end , his decision , nevertheless , is cast in my favor for a quick production , whenever a worthy company can be assembled . Illustration : On the tip of each he has bargained for a spot of red But we have gone still further toward our opening . The manager has already whittled a dozen daggers and they lie somewhere on a shelf , awaiting a coat of silver paint . On the tip of each he has bargained for a spot of red . Furthermore , he owns a pistol  --  a harmless , devicerated thing  --  and he pops it daily at any rogue that may be lurking on the cellar stairs . All pirates wear pigtails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Kidds and Flints and Morgans )  --  and at first this was a knotty problem . But he obtained a number of old stockings  --  stockings , of course , beyond the skill of that versatile person who mends the gaps  --  and he has wound them on wires , curling them upward at the end and tieing them with bits of ribbon . The pirate captain is allowed an extra inch of pigtail to exalt him above his fellows . When he first adjusted this pigtail on himself , his costumer cried out that he looked like a Chinaman . This was downright stupidity and was hardly worthy of her perception ; but ladies can not be expected to recognize a pirate so instinctively as we rougher men . The stocking , however , was clipped to half its length , and now he is every inch a buccaneer . As for the captain 's hook , he is resourcefulness itself . These things are secrets of the craft , but I may hint that there is a very suitable hook in a butchershop around the corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage  --  would lend it for the great performance . I have no doubt but that the manager , from this time forward , will beg all errands in his direction and that his smile will thaw the friendly butcher to his purpose . Certainly two legs of lamb , if whispered that the drama is at stake , will consent to hang for one tremendous day upon a single hook . Our hook is to be screwed into a block of wood , and there is something about knuckles and a cord around the wrist and a long sleeve to cover up the joining . Anyway , the problem has been met . Illustration : His smile will thaw the friendly butcher to his purpose In the furnace room he has found a heavy sheet of tin for the thunder storm , and I have suggested that he dig in a nearby gravel pit for a basket of rain to hurl against the pirates ' window . But hard beans , he says , are better , and he has won the cook 's consent . For the slow monotone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a single bean , he tells me , dropped gently in a pan is a baffling counterfeit . The lightning seems not to bother him , for he owns a pocket flashlight ; but the mighty wind that comes brawling from the ocean was at first a sticker . The vacuum cleaner popped into his head , but was put aside . The fireplace bellows were too feeble for any wind that had grown a beard . His manager of finance , however , laid aside his book one night  --  a weary tract upon the law  --  and displayed an ability to moan and whistle through his teeth . The very casement rattled in the blast . He has agreed to sit in the wings and loose a sufficient storm upon a given signal . Our stage is cramped . Three strides stretch from side to side . " Can this cockpit " you ask , " hold the vasty fields of France ? " It is not , of course , the vasty fields of France that we are trying to hold ; but we do lack space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final scene . He wants nothing girlish . Sabers and pistols are his demand  --  a knife between the teeth  --  and more yelling than I could possibly put down in print . A bench must be upset , the beer-cask overturned , a jug of Darlin 's grog spilled , and one stool , at least , must be smashed  --  preferably on the captain 's head , who must , however , be consulted . Patch-Eye and the Duke are not the kind of pirates that lie down and whine for mercy at a single punch . At first our manager was baffled how the pirates were to ascend a ladder to their sleeping loft . They had no place to go . They would crack their ugly heads upon the ceiling . The costumer was positive ( parsimony ! ) that a hole  --  even a little hole  --  should not be cut in the plaster overhead for their disappearance . If the chandelier had been an honest piece of metal they might have perched on it until the act ran out . Or perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibly . At last the manager has contrived that a plank be laid across the tops of two step-ladders , behind a drop so that the audience can not see . No reasonable pirate could refuse to squat upon the plank until the curtain fell . Illustration : With uncertain , questing finger We are getting on . Our company has been selected . We need only a handful of actors , but the manager has enlisted the street . The dearest little girl has been chosen for Betsy , and each day she practices her lullaby at the piano with uncertain , questing finger . A gentle rowdy of twelve will speak the Duke 's blood-curdling lines . I understand that two quarrelsome pirates have nearly come to blows which shall act the captain . The hero , Red Joe , will be played by the manager himself , for it is he who owns the pistol . Is not the boy who has the baseball the captain of his nine ? I owe an apology to all the mothers of our cast ; for the rough language of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our actors meet there is used the vile language of the sea . By the bones of my ten fingers has replaced the anemic oaths of childhood . One little girl has been told she cries as easily as a crocodile . Another little girl was heard to say she would slit her sister 's wisdom  --  a slip , no doubt , for wizen . And Blast my lamps ! and Sink my timbers ! are rolled profanely on the tongue . In every attic on the street a rakish craft flies the skull and crossbones , and roves the Spanish Main on rainy afternoons . Innocent victims  --  girls , chiefly , who will tattle unless a horrid threat is laid upon them  --  are forced blindfold to walk the plank . If the wind blows , scratching the trees against the roof , it is , by their desire , a tempest whirling their stout ship upon the rocks . What ho ! We split ! Mysterious chalkings mark the cellar stairs and hint of treasure buried in the coal-hole . At every mirror pirates practice their cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk the plank And now the daggers are complete , and their tip of blood has been squeezed from its twisted tube . Chests and neighbors have been rummaged for outlandish costumes . From the kindling-pile a predestined stick has become the timber leg of the wicked Duke . The butcher 's hook has yielded to persuasion . Presently rehearsals will begin  --  * * * * * I have been reading lately , and I have come on a sentence with which I am in disagreement . I shall not tell the name of the book ( mere mulishness ! ) but I hope you know it or can guess . It is a tale of children and of a runaway perambulator and of folk who never quite grew up , with just a flick of inquiry  --  a slightest gesture now and then  --  toward precious rascals like our Patch-Eye and the Duke . Its author stands , in my opinion , a better chance of our lasting memory than any writer living . If you have read this book , you have known in its author a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years have never taken toll . And if you have lingered from page to page , you know what humor is , and love and gentleness . I think that children must have clambered on his familiar knee and that he learned his plot from their trustful eyes . Someone has been reading my very copy of this book , for it is marked with pencil and whole chapters have been thumbed . I would like to know who this reader is  --  a woman , beyond a doubt  --  who has dug in this fashion to the author 's heart . But the book is from a lending library . She is only a number pasted inside the cover , a date that warns her against a fine . Her pencil has marked the words to a richer cadence . I like to think that she has children of her own and that she read the book at twilight in the nursery , and that its mirth was shared from bed to bed . But the pathetic parts she did not read aloud , fearing to see tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must have floated a mist . She is a gracious creature , I am sure , with a gentleness that only a mother knows who sits with drowsy children . And now that it is my turn to read the book  --  for so does fancy urge me  --  I hear her voice and the echo of her children 's laughter among the pages . It is a book about a great many things  --  about David and about a sausage machine , about a little dog which was supposed to have been caught up by mistake . But when the handle was reversed out he came , whole and complete except that his bark was missing . A sausage still stuck to his tail , which presently he ate . And it proved to be his bark , for at the last bite of the sausage his bark returned . And David took his salty handkerchief from his eyes and laughed . There is a chapter on growing old  --  marked in pencil  --  a subject which the author of this book knew nothing about , never having grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinster , also marked . This chapter sings with exquisite melody , but breaks once to a sob for a love that has been lost . But the book is chiefly about children . There is one particular sentence in this book with which I am not in agreement . " ... down the laughing avenues of childhood , where memory tells us we run but once .... " I can not believe that . I can not believe we run but once . In the heart of the man who wrote the book there lives a child . And a child dwells in the heart of the woman of the lending library . We are too ready to believe that childhood passes with the years  --  that its fine imagination is blunted with the hard practice of the world . Too long have we been taught that the clouds of glory fade in the common day  --  that the lofty castles of the morning perish in the noon-day sun . The magic vista is golden to the coming of the twilight , and the sunset builds a gaudy tower that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child keeps house within his heart to the very end . And therefore , as I think of those whittled daggers with their spot of blood , of that popping pistol , of the captain 's horrid hook , of the black craft flying the skull and crossbones in the attic , I know , despite appearance , that I am young myself . I snap my fingers at the clock . It ticks merely for its own amusement . I proclaim the calendar is false . The sun rises and sets but makes no chilling notch upon the heart . Once again , despite the weary signpost of the years , I run on the laughing avenues of childhood . Illustration My preface outstays its time . Even as I write our audience has gathered . Limber folk in front squat on the floor . Bearded folk behind perch on chairs as on a balcony . Already , behind the scenes , the captain of the pirates has assumed his hook and villainous attire . Patch-Eye mumbles his lines against a loss of memory . Paint has daubed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his timber leg . Presently our curtain will rise . We shall see the pirate cabin , with the lighthouse blinking in the distance , the parrot , Flint 's lantern and the ladder to the sleeping loft . We shall hear a storm unparalleled , like a tempest from the ocean  --  hissed through the teeth . We shall see the pirates in tattered costume and in pigtails made of stockings . And now to bring this tedious explanation to a close , permit me to hush our orchestra for a final word . I have a most important announcement . It is the sum and essence of all these pages . This play of pirates  --  doctored somewhat with fiercer oaths and lengthened for older actors  --  this play and my other play of beggars I dedicate with my love to John Abram Flory , who , as Red Joe , was the most frightful pirate of them all . Illustration ON CHOOSING A TITLE I find difficulty in selecting a name for my pirate play . Children seem so easy in comparison  --  John or Gretchen , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike , and I have thought I would give it to a cow if ever I owned a farm . But this is prejudice . To name a child , I repeat , one needs only to run his finger down the column of his acquaintance , or think which aunt will have the looser purse-strings in her will . An unhappy choice , after all , is rare . Here and there a chocolate Pearl or a dusky crinkle-headed Blanche escapes our logic ; but who can think of a sullen Nancy ? Its very sound , tossed about the nursery , would brighten a maiden even if she were peevish at the start . I once knew an excellent couple of the name of Bottom , who chose Ruby for their offspring ; but I have no doubt that the infelicity was altered at the font . The fact is that most of our names grow in time to fit our figure and our character . Margaret and Helen sound thin or fat , agreeable or dull , as our friends and neighbors rise before us ; and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former ugly tenant . I confess that till lately a certain name brought to my fancy a bouncing , red-armed creature ; but that by a change of lease upon our street it has acquired an alien grace and beauty . Perhaps a scrawny neighbor by the name of Falstaff might remain inconsequent , but I am sure that if a lady called Messilina moved in next door and were of charming manner , a month would blur the bad suggestion of her name ; which presently  --  if our gardens ran together  --  would come to sound sweetly in my ears . But a play ( more than a child or neighbor ) is offered for a sudden judgment  --  to sink or swim upon a first impression  --  and its christening is an especial peril . I have fretted for a month to find a title for my comedy . My first choice was A Frightful Play of Pirates . In the word frightful lay the double meaning that I wanted . It held up my hands , as it were , for mercy . It is an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his art , attempt by a modest preface to disarm the critics of his Endymion ? " It is just , " he wrote , " that this youngster should die away . " Yet my title was too long . I could not hope , if my comedy reached the boards , that a manager could afford such a long display of electric lights above the door . It would require more than a barrel of lamps . The Pirates of Clovelly was not bad , except for length , but it was too obviously stolen from Gilbert 's opera . I could feel my guilty fingers in his pocket . ' S Death was suggested , but it was too flippant , too farcical . ' S Blood , although effective in red lights , met the same objection . The Spittin ' Devil , named for our pirate ship , lacked refinement . Certainly no lady in silk and lace would admit acquaintance with so gross a personage . Darlin ' was offered to me  --  the name of the old lady with one tooth who cooks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that with better spelling it would be an excellent title for musical comedy . But it was naught for a pirate play . Its anemia would soften the vigor of my lines . One could as well call the tale of Bluebeard by the name of his casual cook . Then Clovelly seemed enough . At the very least  --  if my publisher were energetic  --  it ensured a brisk sale of the printed play among the American tourists on the Devon coast , who travel by boat or char-a-banc to this ancient fishing village where we set our plot . For even a trivial book sells to trippers if its story is laid around the corner . Would it not be pleasant , I thought , when I visit the place again , to see them thumbing me as they waited for the steamer  --  to see a whole window of myself placed in equal prominence with picture postal cards ? When I registered at the inn alongside the wharf might I not hope that the landlady would recognize my name and give me , as an honored guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps , as I had my tea and clotted cream on the village staircase , I might mention casually to a pretty tourist that I was the author of the book that protruded from her handbag  --  and fetch my dishes to her table . It is so seldom that an obscure author catches anyone flagrante dilicto on his book . Will no one ever read a book of mine in the subway , that I may tap him on the shoulder ? Do travelers never put me in their grips ? Must everyone read in public the latest novel , and reserve all plays and essays for their solitary hours ? At the club I shuffle to the top any periodical that contains my name , but the crowded noon buries me deep again . At best , maybe , in a lending library , I see a date stamped inside my cover ; but , although I linger near the shelf , no one comes to draw me down . I think that hunters must look with equal hunger on the bear 's tread . ' T is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has escaped . Blackmore 's pleasant ghost frequents the shadowy church at Porlock where he married Lorna and John Ridd , or roams the Valley of the Rocks to see the studious pilgrims at his pages . Stevenson haunts the gloomy inlet where the Admiral Benbow stood and where old Pew came tapping in the night . In the flesh I shall join their revels as an equal comrade . Clovelly , however , although its lilt was pleasant to the ear , was an insufficient title . Skull and Crossbones was too obvious , and my next choice was The Gibbet . But there was the disadvantage of scaring the timid . Old ladies would pass me by . It would check the sale of tickets . My nephew , who is fourteen and not at all timid , was stout in its defense . He pronounces it as if the g were the hard kind that starts off gurgle . Gibbet ! He asked me if I had a hanging in the piece . If so , he knew how the business could be managed without chance of accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him that it was none of his business how I ended up the pirates . I would hang them or not , as I saw fit . He would have to pay his quarter like anybody else and sit it through . He suggested From Dish-Pan to Matrimony  --  obviously a jest . The sly rogue laughs at me . I must confess , however , that he has given me some of my best lines . " Villainy ' s afoot ! " for example , and " Sink me stern up ! " His peaceful school breeds a wealth of pungent English . I was in despair . Revenge ! Would that have done ? I see a maddened father stand with smoking revolver above the body of a silky-whiskered villain . " Doris , " the panting parent cries , " the butcher boy knows all and wants you for his bride . " And down comes the happy curtain on the lovers . The Wreckers belongs to Stevenson . The Pirates ' Nest ! It is too ornithological . The Natural History Museum might buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Channel Lights ! It sends us sharply to the days of the older melodrama  --  days when we exchanged a ten-cent piece for a gallery seat and hissed the villain . Do you recall the breathless moment when the heroine implored the villain to give her back her stolen child ? For answer the cruel fellow tied the darling to the buzz-saw . Or that darker scene when he tossed the lady to the black waters of the Thames , with the splash of a dipper up behind ? Hurry , master hero ! Your horse 's hoofs clatter in the wings . Gallop , Dobbin ! A precious life depends upon your speed . Our dangerous plot hangs by a single thread . It is quite a task to find a sufficient title . I have wavered for a month . But now my efforts seem rewarded . There is a wharf in London below the Tower , not far from the India docks . It has now sunk to common week-day uses , and I suppose its rotten timbers are piled with honest , unromantic merchandise . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient place for inbound ships to dispose of this dirty , deep-sea cargo . Doubtless hereabout the lanes and building-tops were crowded with an idle throng as on a holiday , and wherries to the bankside and the play paused with suspended oar for a sight of the happy festival . Did Hamlet wait upon this ghastly prologue ? Shakespeare himself , unplayed script in hand , mused how tragedy and farce go hand in hand . In those golden days with which our comedy concerns itself , a gibbet stood on Wapping wharf and pirates stepped off the fatal cart to a hangman 's jest . We may hear the shouts of the ' prentice lads echoing across the centuries . I can not hope that many persons  --  except dusty scholars  --  will know of the district 's ancient ill-repute , yet Wapping wharf figures often in my dialogue as the somber motif of a pirate 's life . It conveys to the plot the sense of mystery . It needs but a handful of electric lamps . If no one offers me a better title I shall let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pirates Illustration First produced in January , 1922 , at the Play House , Cleveland , under the direction of Frederic McConnell . The settings and costumes were designed by Julia McCune Flory . The cast was as follows : THE DUKE William C. Keough PATCH-EYE Howard Burns THE CAPTAIN Ewart Whitworth RED JOE K. Elmo Lowe DARLIN ' Mary Gilson BETSY Jeanette Geoghegan OLD MEG Emma Tilden SAILOR CAPTAIN Ganson Cook SAILORS Vance Stewart , Alvin Shulman , Arthur Kraus Illustration Wappin ' Wharf A Frightful Comedy of Pirates ACT I Our scene is the wind-swept coast of Devon . By day there is a wide stretch of ocean far below . The time is remote and doubtless great ships of forgotten build stand out from Bristol in full sail for western shores . Their white canvas winks in the morning sun as if their purpose were a jest . They seek a northwest passage and the golden mines of India . But we must be loose and free of date lest our plot be shamed by broken fact . A thousand years are but as yesterday . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide spaces of the past . The village of Clovelly climbs in a single street  --  a staircase , really  --  from the shore to the top of the cliff , and is fagged and out of breath half way . But on a still dizzier crag , storm-blown , clinging by its toes , there stands the pirates ' cabin . To this topmost ledge fishwives sometimes scramble by day to seek a belated sail against Lundy 's Isle . But after twilight a night wind searches the crannies of the rock and whines to the moon of its barren quest , and then no villager , I think , chooses to walk in that direction . I have visited Clovelly and have kicked a sodden donkey from the wharf to the top of the street , past the shops of Devon cream and picture postal cards , but have sought in vain the pirates ' cabin . Since our far-off adventure of tonight ten thousand tempests have snarled across these giddy cliffs and we must convince our reason that these highest crags where we pitch our plot have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lathers the shaggy headland , as if Neptune had turned barber , we must fancy that the pinnacles of yesteryear lie buried in the sea . We had hoped for a play upon the sea , with a tall mast rocking from wing to wing and a tempest roaring at the rail . Alas ! Our pirates grow old and stiff . They have retired , as we say , from active practice and live in idle luxury on shore . Yet we shall see that their villainy still thrives . Our scene is their cabin on the cliff . It is a rough stone building with peeling plaster and slates that by day are green with moss . But it is night and the wind is whistling its rowdy companions from the sea . Until the morning they will play at leap-frog from cliff to cliff . Far below is the village of Clovelly , snug with fire and candles . We enter the cabin without knocking  --  like neighbors through a garden  --  and poke about a bit before our hosts appear . A door , forward at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , at the right , a ladder rises to a sleeping loft . On the left wall are a chimney and fireplace with a crane and pot for heating grog , and smoky timbers above to mark the frequent thirst . On a great beam overhead are bags of clinking loot and shining brasses from wrecked ships . Peppers hang to dry before the fire , and a lighted ship 's lantern swings from a hook . At the rear of the cabin , to the left , a row of mullioned windows looks at sea and cliffs in a flash of lightning . Below is a seaman 's chest . Above , on the broken plaster , is scrawled a ship . In the middle , at the rear , there is a clock with hanging pendulum and weights . A gun of antique pattern leans beside the clock . To the right the cabin is recessed , with a door right-angled in the jog and other windows looking on the sea . A parrot sits on its perch with curbed profanity . The gaudy creature is best if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Hamlet 's player it would speak beyond its lines and raise a quantity of barren laughter . Our furniture is a table and three stools , and a tall-backed chair beside the hearth . On the table a candle burns , bespattered with tallow . The cabin glows with fire light . Illustration : Two pirates are discovered drinking at a table At the lifting of the curtain there is thunder and lightning , and a rush of wind  --  if it can be managed . Two pirates are discovered , drinking at the table . By the smack of their lips it is excellent grog . One of them  --  Patch-Eye  --  has lost an eye and he wears a black patch . His hair curls up in a pigtail , like any sailor before Nelson . It looks as stiff as a hook and he might almost be lifted by it and hung on a peg . But all of our pirates wear pigtails  --  except one , Red Joe . The other pirate at the table is called the Duke , for no apparent reason as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our finger down the peerage in hope of finding him , or think that he owns a palace on the Strand . He has only one leg , with a timber below the knee . He wears a long cloak so that the actor 's rusticated leg can be folded out of sight . The Duke has a great red nose  --  grog and rum and that sort of thing . His whiskers are the bush that marks the merry drinking place . Patch-Eye is melancholy  --  almost sentimental at times . He would stab a man , but grieve upon a sparrow . At heart we fear he is a coward , and stupid . The Duke , on the contrary , is shrewd and he does a lot of thinking . He has heavy eyebrows . He is the kind of thinker that you just know that he is thinking . Both pirates are very cruel  --  and profane , but we must be careful . And now we hush the melancholy fiddlers . If this comedy can stir the croaking bass-viol to any show of mirth , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw . Only the young in heart will catch the slender meaning of our play . Let 's light the candles and draw the curtain ! PATCH : Darlin ' ! Darlin ' ! ( He lolls back in his chair and stretches out his legs for comfort . ) Darlin ' ! ( At this a dirty old woman with one tooth appears from the kitchen . She is called Darlin ' just for fun , as she is not at all kissable . A sprig of mistletoe , even in the Christmas season , would beckon vainly . ) PATCH : Me friend , the Duke , is thirsty . Will yer fill the cups ? Hurry , ol ' dear ! And squeeze in jest a bit o ' lemon . It sets the stomich . DARLIN ' : Yer sets yer stomich like it were hen 's eggs . Alers coddlin ' it . ( She stirs and tastes the pot of grog , and hoists her wrinkled stockings . ) DUKE : There ' s no one like Darlin ' fer mixin ' grog . DARLIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' yer . ( She looks at him with admiration . ) Ain ' t he a figger o ' a man ? Wenus was nothin ' . Jest nothin ' at all . PATCH : It ' s grog beats off the melancholy . As soon as me pipes go dry , I gets homesick fer the ocean . Here we be , Duke , thrown up at last ter rot like driftwood on the shore . No more sailin ' off to Trinidad ! No tackin ' ' round the Hebrides ! We is ships as has sprung a leak . It was ' appy days when we sailed with ol ' Flint on the Spanish Main . DUKE : ' Appy days , Patch ! ( They drink . ) PATCH : Aye ! The blessed , dear , ol ' roarin ' hulk . No better pirate ever lived than Flint . Smart with his cutlass . Quick at the trigger . Grog ! A sloppin ' pail o ' it was jest a sip . DUKE : I used ter tell him that his leg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flint  --  jest a swishin ' keg . DUKE : Grog jest sizzled and disappeared , like when yer drops it on a red-hot seacoal . PATCH : Fer twenty year and more me and you has seen ol ' Flint march his wictims off the plank . DUKE : " Step lively ! " he ' d say . " Does n't yer hear Davy callin ' to yer ? " There was never a sailorman ever sat in the Port Light at Wappin ' wharf which could drink with Flint . Illustration : " Port Light " at Wappin ' Wharf PATCH : Wappin ' wharf and gibbets is nothin ' ter talk about . Funerals even is cheerfuller . DUKE : There ' s his parrot . PATCH : She used ter cuss soft and gentle to herself  --  ' appy all the day . She ain ' t spoke since Flint was took . Peckin ' at yer finger and broodin ' . DUKE : There ' s his ol ' clock . PATCH : As hung in the cabin o ' the Spittin ' Devil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . A ' ell of a clock fer a bouncin ' ship . Illustration : " A ' ell of a clock fer a bouncin ' ship " PATCH : She was tickin ' peaceful the day Flint was hanged . But she stopped  --  does yer remember it ?  --  the very minute they pushed him off the ladder . DUKE : She ain ' t ticked since . PATCH : It makes yer ' stitious . And she won ' t never run agin  --  that ' s what Flint alers said  --  till his death ' s revenged . DUKE : He told us never ter wind her  --  says she ' d start hisself without no windin ' when the right time came . PATCH : If I was ter look up and see that pendulum swingin '  --  Horrers ! Yeller elephants would be nothin ' ! DUKE : Pooh ! I ' d give a month o ' grog jest ter hear the ol ' dear tickin ' , and ter know that Flint was restin ' easy in his rotten coffin  --  swappin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved Flint like a brother . ( He is quite sentimental about this . ) It was him knocked this out . ( Pointing to his missing eye . ) But it was jest in the way o ' business . We differed a leetle in the loot . He was very persuasive , was ol ' Flint . DUKE : Yer talks like a woman . They loves yer to cuff ' em . Them was ' appy days , Patch . PATCH : Blast me gig what ' s left , Duke , but me and you has seen a heap o ' sights . I suppose I ' ve drowned meself a hundred men . It ' s comfertin ' when yer lays awake at night . I feels I ain ' t wasted meself . I ' ve used me gifts . I ain ' t been a foolish virgin and put me shinin ' talent inside a bushel . But me and you is driftwood now , Duke . DUKE : Aye . But it ain ' t no use snifflin ' about it , ol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' grog . And we ' ve a right smart cabin with winders on the sea . Since I stuffed yer ol ' shirt in the roof it hardly leaks . PATCH : My shirt ! Next week is me week fer changin ' . How could yer ha ' done it ? I ' m a kinder perticerler dresser . I likes ter wash now and then  --  if it ain ' t too often . DUKE : Darlin ' , me friend Patch is thirsty . And a drop meself . ( The cups are filled . ) Yer a precious ol ' lady , and I loves yer . DARLIN ' : Yer spoils me , Duke . ( Lightning and a crash of thunder . ) DUKE : It ' s foul tonight on the ocean . How the wind blows ! It be spittin ' up outside . The channel ' s as riled as a wampire when yer scorns her . How she snorts ! PATCH : The devil hisself is hissin ' through his teeth . DUKE : There ' ll be sailormen tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m not kickin ' much ter be ashore . I rots peaceful . ( Patch-Eye has opened the door to consult the night . It slams wide in the wind and the gust blows out the candle . ) DUKE : Hi , there , for'ard ! Batten yer hatch ! Yer blowin ' the gizzard out o ' us . Illustration : " Yer blowin ' the gizzard out o ' us " ( He hobbles on timber leg to the warm chair by the fire . Patch closes the door and sits . Darlin ' relights the candle . ) PATCH : Poor Flint ! He was took on jest such a night . Dropped inter the Port Light fer somethin ' wet and warmin ' . Jest ter kinder say goodby . Ship all fitted out . He ' d got three new sailormen  --  fine fellers as had been sentenced ter be hanged fer cuttin ' purses , but had been let go , as they had reformed and wanted ter be honest pirates . DUKE : I remembers the night , ol ' sea-nymph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' hell  --  with the leetle devils stoakin ' in the sinners . It ' s sinners , Patch , as is used fer kindlers , ter keep the devils in a healthy sweat . PATCH : He was ter sail when the tide ran out . Lord a Goody ! How the tide runs down the Thames , as if it were homesick fer the ocean ! DUKE : But someone squealed . PATCH : Squealers is worse ' n hissin ' reptiles . They ketched Flint and they strung him to a gibbet . Poor ol ' dear ! I never touches me patch , but I thinks o ' Flint . DUKE : This here life is snug and easy . We has retired from practice , like store-keepers does who has made a fortin . Ain ' t we settin ' here in style and comfert , and jest waitin ' fer the treasure ships ter come ter us ? We gets the plums without chawin ' at the dough . We blows out the lighthouse , and we sets our lantern so as ter fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rocks , well  --  all we does is stuff our pokes with the treasure that washes up . I prays meself fer fog and dirty weather . Now I lay me , says I , and will yer send it thick and oozy ? PATCH : I ain ' t disputin ' yer . ( He cheers up a bit . ) And we robs landlubbers once in a while . DUKE : Now yer talkin ' , ol ' sea-lion . I ' m tellin ' yer it were a good haul we made last night on Castle Crag . PATCH : Who ' s disputin ' yer ? DUKE : I ' m tellin ' yer . Silver candles ! And spoons ! Never seen such a heap o ' spoons . PATCH : What ' s anyone want more ' n one spoon fer ? Yer cleans it every bite agin the tongue . DUKE : Yer disgusts me , Patch . Yer ain ' t no manners . Fer meself I spears me food tidy on me knife . ( The Duke sits looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is deep in thought . ) DUKE : There ' s jest one leetle thing I does n't understand . I asks yer . ( He goes to the chest , opens it and draws out a rich velvet garment . He holds it up . ) What ' s the meaning o ' this here loot we took at Castle Crag ? I asks yer . Ain ' t we been by that castle a hundred times ? The Earl , he don ' t wear clothes like this . None o ' the arstocky does , ' cept when they struts on Piccadilly . I asks yer , Patch . I asks yer who wears a thing like that . ( He puts the garment around Patch 's shoulders . ) DARLIN ' : Yer looks like the Archbishop o ' Canterbury . PATCH : ( with strut and gesture ) . His Grice takin ' the air  --  pluckin ' posies . DUKE : Lookin ' like a silly jackass . PATCH : Yer hurts me feelin 's , Duke . ( The Duke folds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sits at the table in meditation . ) DUKE : I does n't like it , Patch . I does n't understand it . And what I does n't understand , I does n't like . PATCH : What ? DUKE : Them gay clothes . Who owned ' em , I asks yer , afore we stole ' em . PATCH : Darlin ' ! Me friend , the Duke , is thirsty . Yer had better mix another pot . Our cups is low . Yer does n't want ter be a foolish virgin and get ketched without no grog . DUKE : With this bit o ' slop what ' s left I drinks to yer shinin ' lamps  --  Wenus 's flashin ' gigs . DARLIN ' : I loves yer , Duke . ( She fills , mixes and stirs the pot . She tastes it like a practiced house-wife . Her apron is maid of all work . It is towel , dust-rag , mop and handkerchief . ) Illustration : Her apron is towel , dust rag , mop and handkerchief DUKE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the new recruit ? PATCH : Red Joe ? DUKE : Him . PATCH : He ' s a right smart pirate , I says . I never seen a feller as could shoot so straight . DUKE : I says so . But he ' s a wee bit nobby  --  kinder stiff in the nose . PATCH : Looks as if he knowed he was kinder good . DUKE : It ' s queer how he come ter us . Jest settin ' on top his dory on the beach , when we found him . And what he said about his ship goin ' down ! Blast me ol ' stump , but it were queer . PATCH : Queer ? DUKE : Yer said it , Patch . Queerer than mermaids . Did we ever see a stick o ' that ship ? I ' m askin ' yer , Patch . PATCH : Ain ' t I listenin ' ? DUKE : Ain ' t I tellin ' yer ? Nary a bit washed in . Did yer ever know a wreck ' long here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m askin ' yer . PATCH : You and me would starve if it happened regular . DUKE : It ' s what we lives by  --  pickin 's on the beach . PATCH : He ' s a right smart pirate , ' s Red Joe . The Captain  --  the most ' ticerler man I know  --  he took ter him at once . He ' s a kinder good-lookin ' feller . DARLIN ' : ( stirring at the pot ) . He ain ' t got whiskers like the Duke . ( She spits  --  must I say it ?  --  she spits into the fire . ) DUKE : Queer that never a stick washed in . PATCH : I ' m not denyin ' yer , Duke . Where ' s Red Joe now ? It ' s gettin ' on . I ' ll jest take a look fer him . ( He takes the lantern from its hook and stands at the open door . ) It ain ' t blowin ' so hard . Ol ' Borealis  --  I speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons like he was . DUKE : Igerence ! I pities yer . Borealis ain ' t wind . He ' s rainbows . ( Patch-Eye goes into the night . The Duke sits to a greasy game of solitaire . ) DUKE : It ' s queer , I says . Nary a stick ! Jest Red Joe on top his dory ! ( He sings abstractedly . ) Music : PIRATE CHANTY Bill Bones used ter say , on many a day , When takin ' a ship fer its loot , That a blow on the head was quickest dead And safest and best ter boot . But a wictim 's end , fer meself I contend  --  There ' s a hundred been killed by me  --  Is a walk , I ' ll be frank , on a slippery plank , And a splash in the roarin ' sea . ( He turns and surveys the drawing above the windows . He cocks his head like a connoisseur , critically  --  with approval . ) DUKE : I ' m the artist o ' that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rainy mornin ' . Genius is queer . ( Then he sings again . ) Ol ' Pew had a jerk with a long-handled dirk  --  His choice was a jab in the dark  --  ( He is engaged thus , fumbling with his cards , when Darlin ' , crossing from the fire , interrupts him . ) DARLIN ' : Duke , will yer have a nip o ' grog ? It eases yer pipes . Yer sounds as if yer had crumbs in yer gullet . Illustration : " It eases yer pipes " ( The Duke pushes forward his cup . ) DUKE : It ' s a lovely tune , and I wrote the words meself . ( He continues his song . ) Old Pew had a jerk with a long-handled dirk  --  His choice was a jab in the dark  --  And Morgan 's crew , ' twixt me and you , Considered a rope a lark . But a prettier end , I repeat and contend  --  And I ' ve sailed on every sea  --  Is a plunge off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor like me . DARLIN ' : Duke , does yer happen ter have a wife ? DUKE : ( deeply engaged ) . Some tunes is hard , so I jest makes ' em up as I goes along . Blackbeard had a knife which he stuck in his wife . Fer naggin ' , says he ter me  --  DARLIN ' : Has yer a wife ? A wife as might turn up , I mean . DUKE : Say it agin , Darlin ' . DARLIN ' : Most sailors has wives o ' course , strewed here and there from Bristol to Guinea  --  jest ter make all ports cozy . So ' s yer goin ' home ter a ' appy family , no matter where yer steers . DUKE : It ' s comfertable , Darlin '  --  I ' ll not deny it  --  when yer heads ter harbor to see a winkin ' candle in a winder on a hill , and know that a faithful wife and a couple o ' leetle pirates is waitin ' ter hug yer .

Has yer a wife , Duke  --  livin ' , as yer can remember ? DUKE : Yer a bold , for'ard creature . Are yer proposin ' ter me ? ( Something like a wink shows in the blush . ) DARLIN ' : I blush fer yer bad manners , Duke . I ' m a lady and I waits patient fer the ' appy question . I lets me beauty do the pleadin ' . I was a flamin ' roarer in me time . Lovers was nothin ' . Dozens ! There was a sea-captain once  --  ( She smiles dreamily , then seems to cut her throat with her little finger . ) Positive ! Jest ' cause we tiffed . And a stage-coach driver ! I had ter cool his passion with a rollin ' pin . He brooded hisself inter drink . ' Appy days !

DARLIN ' : Yer can have her , Duke , on one condition . DUKE : She ' s a pretty leetle girl . DARLIN ' : Yer must set me up in a pub in Bristol  --  with brass beer-pulls . DUKE : I ' ll not deny I ' ve given her a thought . Usual , wives is nuisances  --  naggin ' at yer fer sixpences . But sometimes I does get lonesome on a wet night when there are nothin ' ter do . I need someone ter hand me down me boots . Betsy ' d make a kinder cozy wife . Could yer learn her ter make grog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do worse . And roast pig that crackles ? DARLIN ' : I could learn her . DUKE : I might do worser . I ' d marry you , Darlin '  --  DARLIN ' : Dearie ! DUKE : But yer gettin ' on . Patch might marry yer . He ' s only got one eye . DARLIN ' : ( with scorn ) . Patch ! DUKE : I ' ll not deny I ' ve been considerin ' leetle Betsy . I was thinkin ' about it this mornin ' as I was cleanin ' me boot . Wives cleans boots . I ' m the sort o ' sailorman she would be sure ter like . DARLIN ' : And what about the pub ? DUKE : Blast me stump , Darlin ' , I ' ll not ferget yer .

There ' s a shoal ahead . Red Joe ' s a right smart feller . DUKE : Red Joe ? DARLIN ' : Him . He sets and watches her . DUKE : What can she see in a young feller like that ? DARLIN ' : Women ' s queer folks . They ' re wicious wampires . Jest yer watch ' em together . Red Joe ' s snoopin ' in on yer . DUKE : Yer can blast me . He ain ' t got whiskers . DARLIN ' : I ' m tellin ' yer , Duke . If I was you I ' d tumble that Red Joe off a cliff . I ' m hintin ' to yer , Duke . Off a cliff ! ( She sniffs audibly . ) It ' s the pig .

Jest a ' prentice pirate ! No whiskers ! Nothin ' ! ( At this moment there is a stamping of feet outside and Patch-Eye enters with Red Joe . If Red Joe were born a gentleman we might expect silver buckles and a yellow feather to trail across his shoulder , for he bears a jaunty dignity . His is a careless grace  --  the swagger of a pleasant vagabond  --  a bravado that snaps its fingers at danger . His body has the quickness of a cat , his eye a flash of humor  --  kindly , unless necessity sharpens it . As poets were thick in those golden days we suspect that the roar of the ocean sets rhymes jingling in his heart . He is , however , almost as shabby as the other pirates , although he wears no pigtail . His collar is turned up . He wrings the water from his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls asleep at once . He snores an obligato to our scene . Just once an ugly dream disturbs him and we must fancy that a gibbet has crossed the frightful shadow of his thoughts . ) DUKE : Evenin ' , ol ' sea-serpent ! Where has you been ? JOE : Up at the lighthouse . It ' s as mirky as hell 's back door . DUKE : See Petey ? JOE : I did . He was puttering with his light and meowing to his tabby cat . DUKE : We ' re a blessin ' ter ol ' Petey . I ' m bettin ' me stump he ' d get lonesome up there ' cept fer us . ( He points to the window to the right , where the lighthouse shows . ) There ' s ol ' Petey , starin ' at the ocean . Yer ain ' t never seen a light at that t ' other winder , has yer Joe ?

He sits up and rubs his eyes . ) PATCH : I dreamed o ' gibbets ! DUKE : Yer is lucky , ol ' keg o ' rum , yer does n't dream o ' purple rhinoceroses . Go back ter bed . ( Then to Joe . ) Smash !

DUKE : I ' m wonderin ' if she would lay off a bit from her jolly occerpation , and sing us a leetle song . DARLIN ' : ( calling ) . Betsy ! I wants yer . PATCH : I never knowed yer cared fer music , Duke . Usually yer goes outside . Yer jest boohs . DUKE : I does usual , Patch . Tonight ' s perticerler . Red Joe ain ' t never heard Betsy sing . Does yer like music , Joe ? JOE : I like the roaring of the ocean . I like to hear the trees tossing in the wind . PATCH : Wind ain ' t music . Yer should hear Betsy . She ' s got a leetle song that makes yer feel as good and peaceful as a whinin ' parson . DARLIN ' : ( beckoning at the kitchen door ) . Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betsy enters ( Betsy enters . She is a pretty girl . Our guess at her age is  --  but it is better not to guess . We have in our own experience made several humiliating blunders . Let us say that Betsy is young enough to be a grand-daughter . Plainly she is a pirate by accident , not inheritance , for she is clean and she wears a pretty dress . ) DUKE : ( as he rises and makes a show of manners ) . Betsy , yer is welcome ter the parlor . We wants Red Joe ter hear yer sing . That leetle song o ' yers . ( He returns to the recess at the rear of the cabin and covertly watches Joe . Patch-Eye is lost in heavenly meditation . Joe 's attention is roused before the first stanza of the song is finished . By the third stanza Betsy sings to him alone . ) Music : Betsy 's Lullaby BETSY : ( sings ) . The north wind 's cheeks are puffed with tunes : It whistles across the sky . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight ' s nigh . Rest , my dear one , rest and dream . The winds on tip-toe keep . In the dusk of day they hum their lay , And weary children sleep . The waves since dawn roared on the rocks : They snarled at the ships on the deep . But at twilight hour they chain their power And little children sleep . Rest , my dear one , rest and dream . The ships in a cradle swing , And sailormen blink and children sink To sleep , as the wavelets sing . The sun at noon was red and hot : It stifled the east and west . But at even song the shadows long Have summoned the world to rest . Rest , my dear one , rest and dream . The sun runs off from the sky . But the stars , it ' s odd , while children nod , Are tuned to a lullaby . ( She sings slowly , to a measure that might rock a cradle . This can be managed , for I have tried it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his emotions from exposure . But make him blow softly  --  soto naso , shall we say ?  --  so as not to disturb the song . In Red Joe the song seems to have stirred a memory . At the end of each stanza Betsy pauses , as if she , too , dwelt in the past . ) PATCH : When I hears that song I feels as if I were rockin ' babies in a crib  --  blessed leetle pirates , pullin ' at their bottles , as will foller the sea some day . ( He blows his sentimental nose . A slighter structure would burst in the explosion . ) DUKE : Yer ol ' nose sounds as if it were tootin ' fer a fog . Yer might be roundin ' the Isle o ' Dogs on a mirky night . ( He goes to the door and stretches out his hand for raindrops . ) DUKE : Joe , you and me has got ter put ile in the lantern .

Red Joe ' s castin ' his eye on Betsy . Off a cliff ! Tonight ! Now ! If I gets a chance . Off a cliff ! Come on , Joey ! ( He goes outdoors with Red Joe , singing Betsy 's song . The lullaby fades in the distance . Patch-Eye and Betsy are left together , for the roast pig again calls Darlin ' to the kitchen . ) PATCH : Will yer wait a bit , Betsy  --  askin ' yer pardon  --  while I talks to yer ? BETSY : Of course , Patch . PATCH : I don ' t suppose , dearie , I ' m the kind o ' pirate as sets yer thinkin ' of fiddles tunin ' up , ner parsons . No , yer says .

There he was , broke all ter flinders . And all the King 's horses and all the King 's men could n't fix him . Humpty Dumpty is me , Betsy . Regularly all split up , fore and aft , rib and keel . I mopes all day fer you , Betsy . And I mopes all night . Last night I did n't get ter sleep , jest fidgettin ' , till way past ' leven o ' clock .

There was jest one too many potaters in the pot . No , yer says , yer could n't love me . Cause why ? Cause Patch is a shabby pirate with only one eye . BETSY : I am sorry , Patch .

Yer nudges him off the wall , but yer can ' t fix him . But I never heard that Humpty Dumpty did a lot o ' squealin ' when he bust . He took it like a pirate . And so does Patch . I does n't sulk .

I came back to talk with you . ( Then bluntly , but with kindness . ) How old are you , my dear ? BETSY : I don ' t know . JOE : You don ' t know ? How long have you lived here ? BETSY : In this cabin ? Three years . JOE : And where did you live before ? BETSY : In the village  --  in Clovelly . JOE : Did your parents live there ? BETSY : Y-e-s . I think so . I don ' t know . Old Nancy , they called her  --  she brought me up . But she died three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did washing for the sailormen . Illustration : " She did washing for the sailormen " JOE : Was she good to you ? BETSY : Oh yes . I think  --  I do not know  --  that she was not my mother . JOE : And Darlin ' ? BETSY : Yes . She has been good to me . And the others , too . I seem to remember someone else . How long have you been a pirate ? JOE : A pirate ? Years , it seems , my dear . But I am more used to a soldier 's oaths . I have trailed a pike in the Lowland wars . The roar of cannon , and siege and falling walls , are gayer tunes than any ocean tempest . What is this that you remember , Betsy ? BETSY : It is far off . Some one sang to me . It was not Nancy . When Nancy died , Darlin ' took me and brought me up . That was three years ago . But last year the Captain and Duke and Patch-Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said , who had lost a ship . And these cliffs with the sea pounding on the shore comforted them when they were lonely . So they stayed . And Darlin ' and I cook for them . JOE : Do you remember who it was who sang to you ? BETSY : No . JOE : That song you just sang  --  where did you learn it ? BETSY : I have always known it . It makes me sad to sing it , for it sets me thinking  --  thinking of something that I have forgotten . ( She stands at the window above the sea . ) Some days I climb high on the cliffs and I look upon the ocean . And I know that there is land beyond  --  where children play  --  but I see nothing but a rim of water . And sometimes the wind comes off the sea , and it brings me familiar far-off voices  --  voices I once knew  --  voices I once knew  --  fragments from a life I have forgotten . Why do you ask about my song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Betsy sits beside him at the table . ) BETSY : Where ? Perhaps , if you will tell me , it will help me to remember . JOE : I heard the song once when I was a lad  --  when I was taken on a visit . BETSY : Were your parents pirates ? JOE : It was a long journey and all day we bumped upon the road , seeking an outlet from the tangled hills . Night overtook our weary horses and blew out the flaming candles in the west ; and shadows were a blanket on the sleeping world . Toward midnight I was roused . We had come to the courtyard of a house  --  this house where I was taken on a visit . BETSY : Was it like this , Joe  --  a cabin on a cliff ? JOE : I remember how the moon peeped around the corner to see who came so late knocking on the door . I remember  --  I remember  --  ( He stops abruptly ) . Do you remember when you first came to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think me silly  --  Are there great stone steps somewhere , wider than this room , with marble women standing motionless ? And walls with dizzy towers upon them ? JOE : Go on , Betsy . BETSY : In Clovelly there are naught but cabins pitched upon a hill , and ladders to a loft . And , at the foot of the town , a mole , where boats put in . And I have listened to the songs of the fishermen as they wind their nets . And through the window of the tavern I have heard them singing at their rum . And sometimes I have been afraid . I have stuffed my ears and ran . But the ugly songs have followed me and scared me in the night . The shadows from the moon have reeled across the floor , like a tipsy sailor from the Harbor Light . Joe , are you really a man from the sea ? JOE : Why , Betsy ? BETSY : The sea is never gentle . It never sleeps . I have stood listening at the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks . Even in a calm it moves and frets . Is it not said that the ghosts of evil men walk back and forth on the spot where their crimes are done ? The ocean , perhaps , for its cruel wreckage , haunts these cliffs . It is doomed through all eternity with a lather of breaking waves to wash these rocks of blood . And the wind whistles to bury the cries of drowning men that plague the memory . Joe  --  JOE : Yes , my dear . BETSY : You are the only one  --  Patch-Eye , Duke and the Captain  --  you are the only one who is always gentle . And I have wondered if you could really be a pirate . JOE : Me ? ( Then with sudden change . ) Me ? Gentle ? The devil himself is my softer twin . BETSY : Don ' t ! Don ' t ! JOE : What do you know of scuttled ships , and rascals ripped in fight ? Of the last bubbles that grin upon the surface where a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake ! Don ' t ! JOE : Is it gentleness to plunge a dagger in a man and watch for his dying eye to glaze ? BETSY : It is a lie . Tell me it is a lie ! JOE : My dear . ( Gently he touches her hand . ) BETSY : It is a lie . JOE : We ' ll pretend it is a lie . ( They sit for a moment without speaking . ) BETSY : How long , Joe , have you lived with us ? JOE : Two weeks , Betsy . BETSY : Two weeks ? So short a time . From Monday to Monday and then around again to Monday . It is so brief a space that a flower would scarcely droop and wither . And yet the day you came seems already long ago . And all the days before are of a different life . It was another Betsy , not myself , who lived in this cabin on a Sunday before a Monday . Illustration : " From Monday to Monday , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , Betsy , when friends suddenly come to know each other . All other days sink to unreality like the memory of snow upon a day of August . We wonder how the flowering meadows were once a field of white . Our past selves , Betsy , walk apart from us and , although we know their trick of attitude and the fashion of their clothes , they are not ourselves . For friendship , when it grips the heart , rewinds the fibres of our being . Do you remember , dear , how you ran in fright when you first saw me clambering up these rocks ? BETSY : I was sent to call the Duke to dinner and carried a bell to ring it on the cliff . I was afraid when a stranger 's head appeared upon the path . JOE : Yet , when I spoke , you stopped . BETSY : At the first word I knew I need n't be afraid . And you took my hand to help me up the slope . You asked my name , and told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin . And each day I have been with you . Two weeks only . JOE : I shall be gone , Betsy , in a little while . BETSY : Gone ? JOE : I am not , my dear , the master of myself . We must forget these days together . BETSY : Joe ! JOE : May be I shall return . Fate is captain . The future shows so vaguely in the mist . Listen ! It is the Duke . ( In the distance the Duke is heard singing the pirates ' song . ) JOE : We must speak of these things together . Another time when there is no interruption . ( Gently she touches his fingers . ) BETSY : I shall be lonely when you go . ( There is loud stamping at the door . Betsy goes quickly to the kitchen . The Captain enters , followed by the Duke . Patch-Eye enters by way of the ladder . The Captain has a hook hand . This is the very hook mentioned in my preface  --  if you read prefaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a frightful man to meet socially . I can hear a host saying " Shake hands with the Captain . " One quite loses his taste for dinner parties . There is a sabre cut across the Captain 's cheek .

There ' s news , me men ! I ' ve brought big news from the village . ( He wrings the water from his hat . He is provokingly deliberate . All of the pirates crowd around . ) CAPTAIN : By the bones of me ten fingers , it ' s a blythe night fer our business . It ' s wetter than a crocodile 's nest . When I smells a fog , I feels good . I tastes it and is ' appy . PATCH : What ' s yer news , Captain ? CAPTAIN : News ? Oh yes , the news . I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast me rotten timbers ! How can a man talk when he ' s dry !

It ' s sweatin ' with curiosity that kills cats . ( He yawns and stretches his legs across the hob . ) Down in the village I learnt  --  I was jest takin ' a drop o ' rum at the Harbor Light . It ' s not as sweet as Darlin 's . They skimps their sugar . Yer wants ter keep droppin ' it in as yer stirs it . I thinks they puts in too much water .

He has hopes of it for a breathless moment , but it proves to be a dud . ) CAPTAIN : There ' s Petey  --  PATCH : We ' re jest fidgettin ' fer the news . CAPTAIN : The news ? Oh , yes . Now yer hears it . ( He draws the pirates near . ) A great merchantman has jest sailed from Bristol . The Royal ' Arry . It ' s her . With gold fer the armies in France .

Any well-instructed nurse-maid would huddle her children close if she heard her tapping up the street . Meg walks to the table . She sniffs audibly . It is grog  --  her weakness . She drinks the dregs of all three cups . She rubs her thrifty finger inside the rims and licks it for the precious drop . She opens her wallet and takes from it a fortune-teller 's crystal . ) MEG : I tells fortins , gentlemen . Would n't any o ' yer like ter see the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here magic glass .

The Duke comes next , carrying his one boot which he has removed before the fire . Darlin ' kisses her hand to the Duke and retires to the kitchen . We suspect that she curls up inside the sink , with a stewpan for a pillow . Red Joe lingers for a moment and stands gazing at the ocean . ) JOE : My memory fumbles in the past .

They shines like the lights o ' a friendly harbor . BETSY : Darlin ' cooks roast pig that crackles . DUKE : I sets me heart on top me stomich . Ain ' t yer comfertable , settin ' on me knee ? Shall I shift yer to me stump ? Betsy , I calls after we are married , fetch me down me slipper and lay it on the hearth ter warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer me boot , all mud fer cleanin ' . And then yer passes the grog . And after about the second cup I limbers up and kisses yer . And then yer sets upon me knee . It will be snug on winter evenin 's when the blast is blowin ' . And when we ' re married yer can kiss me pretty near as often as yer please . And I won ' t deny as I won ' t like it . The ol ' Duke ain ' t slingin ' the permission ' round general . Darlin ' nags me . What yer laughin ' at ? BETSY : You silly old man ! DUKE : Yer riles me . Once and fer all , will yer marry me ? I ' ll not waste the night argyin ' with yer . I ' m not goin ' ter tease yer . I ' ve only one knee and it ain ' t no bench fer gigglin ' girls as pokes fun at their betters . I ' ll jolt yer till yer teeth rattles . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Red Joe ? Is it Red Joe , Betsy ? Is he snoopin ' ' round ? ( Betsy rises with sobered mood , and walks away . ) DUKE : There ' s somethin ' about that young feller I does n't like . He ' s a snooper . Betsy , does yer get what I ' m talkin ' about ? I have offered ter make yer the Duchess . I ' ll buy  --  I ' ll steal yer a set o ' red beads . I ' ll give yer a sixpence  --  without no naggin '  --  every time yer goes ter town , jest ter spend reckless . I ' ll marry yer . I ' ll take yer ter Minehead and get the piousest parson in the town . Would yer like Darlin ' fer a bridesmaid  --  and grog and angel-cake ? Me jest settin ' ready ter kiss yer every time yer passes it . I ' m blowed ! You are wickeder than ol ' Flint 's lantern . It must be Red Joe . Him with the smirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Betsy , as wants ter look out fer his wizen . ( But Betsy has run in panic to the kitchen . ) DUKE : I does n't understand ' em . I ' m thinkin ' the girl ' s a fool . A ninny I calls her . It ' s Red Joe . Off a cliff ! Yer said it , Darlin ' . Off a cliff ! ( He removes the sprig of flowers and tosses it into the fire . Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May , And summer 's lease hath all too short a date :  --  He retires to the rear of the cabin and strokes the parrot 's head . He jerks away his hand for fear of being nipped . The ungrateful world has turned against him . ) DUKE : Yer a spiteful bird . Yer as mean as women . Ninnies I calls ' em . It must ha ' been the moon . I should ha ' waited fer a moon . Illustration : " Yer as mean as women " ( He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whittles a little ship . Women are a queer lot . The Captain and Patch-Eye have climbed down the ladder . They burst with jest . The Captain sits on the chair by the fire , mimicing the posture of the Duke . Patch-Eye perches on his knee . ) PATCH : Darlin ' loves yer , Duke . CAPTAIN : Course she does . They all does . Youngsters , too  --  winkin ' and givin ' me the snuggle-up . PATCH : Yer has lovely whiskers , Duke . CAPTAIN : Yer can pull one , Betsy , fer the locket that yer wears . ( But the Duke ends the burlesque by upsetting the chair . The Captain and Patch-Eye , chuckling at their jest , sit to a game of cards . The Duke returns to the chest . Once in a while he lays down the ship and seems to be thinking . The broken crystal of the fortune-teller lies on the floor . He picks it up and puts it to his eye , as if the future may still show upon its face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Darlin ' , meantime , is heard singing in the kitchen with her dishes . ) Fer griddle cakes I ' ve a nimble wrist And I tosses ' em ' igh on a spoon . And the Duke and Patch yer can hardly match Fer their breakfast they stretch till noon . And I heaps the fire and I greases the iron , And the Duke , he kisses me thumb . Me Darlin ' , me dear , it ' s perfectly clear I ' ve lovin ' yer better than rum . Patch , also sings . She ' s cooked fer sailors worn down to the bone , Till they rolls like the Captain 's gig . At soup and stew we are never through , But our fav'rite dish is pig . And she cuts off slabs and passes ' em ' round , And the Duke , he takes her hand . Me Darlin ' , me love , by the gods above , Yer a cook fer a pirate band . And now Darlin ' again . Me grog is the best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sugar , too . And a hogshead vast will hardly last A merry evenin ' through . And I fills the cups till mornin ' comes , And the Duke , he talks like a loon . Me Darlin ' , me life , will yer be me wife , And elope by the light o ' the moon . ( Let all the tinware crash ! ) CAPTAIN : ( as he throws down his cards ) . There ! I done yer . Yer a child at cards , Patch . How ain ' t it that yer never learnt ? Did n't yer ever play black-ace at the Rusty Anchor down Greenwich way ? Crack me hook , I ' ve played with ol ' Flint hisself , settin ' in the leetle back room . With somethin ' wet and warmin ' now and then , jest ter keep the stomich cozy . Never stopped till Phoebus 's fiery eye looked in the winder . Illustration : " Did n't yer ever play Black-ace at the Rusty Anchor ? " PATCH : Poor ol ' Flint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops a tear . CAPTAIN : Yer cries as easy as a crocodile . And yer as innercent at cards as  --  as a baby bitin ' at his coral , a cooin ' leetle pirate . PATCH : It ' s frettin ' does it , Captain . CAPTAIN : What ' s frettin ' yer ? PATCH : It ' s what the ol ' lady said last night . She hung me ter a gibbet , jest like ol ' Flint . There ' s a gibbet , Captain , on Wappin ' wharf , jest ' round the corner from the Sailors ' Rest . Does yer remember it , Captain ? It makes yer grog belch on yer . CAPTAIN : ( to tease and frighten Patch ) . Aye . There was two sailormen hangin ' there when I comes in a year ago . PATCH : Horrers ! CAPTAIN : Jest swingin ' in the wind , and tryin ' ter get their toes down comfertable . ( He has hooked two empty mugs and he rocks them back and forth . ) Jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Jest swingin ' in the wind " PATCH : The ol ' lady last night made me a wee bit creepy . Gibbets and Wappin ' wharf ain ' t nothin ' ter talk about . CAPTAIN : I never see a flock o ' crows but I asks their pardon fer keepin ' ' em waitin ' fer their supper . Crows , Patch , is fond o ' yer as yer are , without neither sauce ner gravy  --  jest pickin ' ' appy , soup ter nuts , at yer dry ol ' bones . Here ' s ol ' Patch , they says , waitin ' in the platter fer his ' ungry guests ter come . PATCH : Me stomich ' s turned keel up . CAPTAIN : Patch , yer ain ' t got spunk ter be a pirate . Yer as soft as Petey 's pussycat . PATCH : I ain ' t , ain ' t I ? Was n't it me as nudged the Captain o ' the Northern Star off his poop  --  when he were n't lookin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I hit Bill , the bos'n , with a marline-spike  --  jest afore he woke up ? Sweet dreams , I says , and I tapped him gentle . I got a lot o ' spunk . Bill did n't wake up , he did n't . Was n't it me , Captain , that started that mutiny ? Was n't it me ? I ' m askin ' yer . CAPTAIN : Still braggin ' o ' that ol ' time . It was more ' n four years ago . What yer done since ? Jest loadin ' yer stomich  --  jest gruntin ' and wallerin ' in the trough  --  jest braggin ' . PATCH : I ain ' t ' fraid o ' nothin '  --  ' cept a gibbet . ( For a moment the ugly word sticks in his gullet . ) But the ol ' lady kinder got me . Yer looked down yer nose yerself , Captain  --  askin ' yer pardon . CAPTAIN : Struck me , Patch , she was jest a wee bit flustered by Red Joe . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And would n't say nothin ' ? Jest nothin ' at all . PATCH : And then the ol ' dear 's fingers slipped and the glass was broke . CAPTAIN : It looks almost as if she done it a purpose . ( The Duke has been thinking all of this time with necessary contortions of the face . It is amazing how these help on a knotty problem . ) DUKE : Course she done it a purpose . It was ter stop me lookin ' ' cross her shoulder in the glass . CAPTAIN : What does yer think she saw ? PATCH : Was it blood drippin ' ? DUKE : I ' ll tell yer . I ' ll tell yer . ( But he continues whittling . ) CAPTAIN : Well , ain ' t we listenin ' , Duke ? PATCH : Jest strainin ' our ears . DUKE : I ' ll tell yer . I squinted in the glass , meself , after it was broke . CAPTAIN and PATCH : What did yer see ? ( There is intense silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taps his fingers sagely . He looks mysteriously at his fellow pirates . They put their heads together . The Duke sinks his voice . In such posture and accent was the gunpowder plot hatched out . ) DUKE : Nothin ' ! Jest nothin ' ! ( The strain is over . They relax . ) CAPTAIN : The Duke , he jest seen nothin ' . PATCH : Jest nothin ' at all . DUKE : That ' s what gets me . If the ol ' lady ' d seen nothin ' , she would n't took ter fidgettin ' . And therefore she seen somethin ' . Does yer foller ? You , Captain ? I ' spects nothin ' from Patch . Illustration : " I ' spects nothin ' from Patch " PATCH : Yer hurts me feelin 's , Duke . DUKE : Somethin ' ' s wrong . Somethin ' ' s wrong with Red Joe . PATCH : Red Joe ' s a right smart feller , I says . CAPTAIN : He can shoot as straight as ol ' Flint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot as I ' ve seen in many a year . Patch , agin him , is jest a crooked stick . PATCH : Pick on the Duke jest once , why does n't yer ? DUKE : Ease off , mates ! Red Joe ain ' t goin ' ter hang on no gibbet . ' Cause why ? ' Cause I ' m tellin ' yer . I ' ll tell yer what the ol ' lady seen in the glass . ( Once more the Duke draws the pirates around him . He is Guy Faux and the wicked Bothwell rolled together . ) CAPTAIN : We ' re listenin ' , Duke . PATCH : Like kittens at a mouse-hole . DUKE : Captain , it ' s deuced strange that Red Joe 's ship  --  nary a stick o ' her  --  never come ter shore . Does yer remember a wreck ' long here where nothin ' washed ter shore ? CAPTAIN : Yer right , Duke . I never did . DUKE : Does you remember one , stoopid ? PATCH : I does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ol ' Flint , he had a pigtail , did n't he ? And you ' ve a pigtail , Captain , has n't yer ? And Patch-Eye , he ' s got what he calls a pigtail . CAPTAIN : Spinach , I calls it . DUKE : And ol ' Pew , he ' d got a pigtail , ain ' t he ? And every blessed man as sailed with him . I ' m tellin ' yer , Captain . PATCH : The sea-cook , he did n't have one . DUKE : Sea-cooks ain ' t sailormen . They ' re swabs . Jest indoor swabs . Did yer ever see a pirate snipped all ' round like a landlubber , with nary a whisp behind ? CAPTAIN : Yer can rot me keel , Duke , I never did . PATCH : I agrees with the Captain . DUKE : Red Joe , he ain ' t got a pigtail . CAPTAIN : No more he ain ' t . PATCH : Was n't it Noah , Captain ; as got his pigtail cut by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s gone and met a schemin ' wixen ? CAPTAIN : I scorns yer igerence . Yer thinks o ' Jonah . DUKE : Well ? Well ? I ' ve told yer Red Joe ain ' t got a pigtail . Does n't yer smell anythin ' ? CAPTAIN : ( as he turns his head and sniffs audibly ) . I can ' t say as I sniffs nothin '  --  leastways , nothin ' perticerler . I smells a bit o ' grog , perhaps . PATCH : I gets a whiff o ' garlic from the kitchen . DUKE : The two o ' yer never can smell nothin ' when there ' s garlic or grog around . I ' m askin ' yer pardon , Captain . Does Red Joe talk like a pirate ? Sink me , he can ' t rip an oath . Did yer ever know a pirate which could n't talk fluent ? CAPTAIN : What ' s bitin ' yer , Duke ? DUKE : Ain ' t I tellin ' yer ? CAPTAIN : Ain ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer tongue ? DUKE : Captain , you and me and Patch has seen a heap o ' sights . We knows the ocean . We knows her when she ' s blue and when she ' s kickin ' ' igher than a gallow 's tree . CAPTAIN : We has been ter Virginy . PATCH : We has traded slaves at the Barbadoes . DUKE : And does n't we set around o ' nights and swap the sights we seen  --  mermaids and sea-serpents and such ? Did yer jest once ever hear Red Joe tell what he ' s seen ? Yer can sink me stern up with all lights burnin ' , if I think the feller ' s ever been beyond the Isle o ' Dogs . CAPTAIN : What ' s bitin ' yer , Duke ? DUKE : It ' s jest this . Red Joe ain ' t no pirate . He ' s a landlubber . ( He says this as you or I might call a man a snake . ) CAPTAIN : ( And now a great light comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leans across the table to share his secret with Patch . ) I seem ter get what Duke means . He ' s hintin ' , Patch , that Red Joe ain ' t a pirate . PATCH : If he ain ' t a pirate , what is he ? I asks yer that . DUKE : ( as he brings down his fist for emphasis ) . He ' s a bloomin ' spy . CAPTAIN : A spy ! ( He gives a long-drawn whistle as the truth breaks on him . ) PATCH : If I thought he was a spy , I ' d ketch him right here with me dirk . I hates spies worse ' n empty bottles . CAPTAIN : I ' d scrape him with me hook . Illustration : " I ' d scrape him with me hook " DUKE : I ' ve been thinkin ' , Captain , while you and Patch has been amusin ' yerselves . Askin ' yer pardon , Captain , but cards rots the mind . Did yer ever know a pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wappin ' wharf ? CAPTAIN : Not as yet I never did . I never knowed a pirate as did n't have a double-barreled nose fer grog . DUKE : Well , when Red Joe comes in , we ' ll jest ask him . And we ' ll ask him if he ever played black-ace at the Rusty Anchor . CAPTAIN : It ain ' t no night ter have spies about . With the Royal ' Arry comin ' on so pretty . PATCH : And jest gettin ' ready ter smash hisself . DUKE : That innercent ship will be due in less ' n half an hour . CAPTAIN : If Red Joe is a spy , by the fiery beard o ' Satan , I ' m tellin ' yer that dead men tell no tales . ( He lifts the terrible hook and claws the air . ) DUKE : Askin ' yer pardon , Captain , bein ' as it was me as smelled him out , won ' t yer let me slit his wizen ? I does it pretty , without mussin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' favors often , Captain . And I ' ve ' ticerler reasons  --  reasons as touches me heart . ( For a moment he is almost sentimental . ) Reasons as touches me heart ! Red Joe ' s been snoopin ' . CAPTAIN : I loves yer , Duke . There ain ' t much as I won ' t let yer have . And jest ter show yer that I ' m all cut up by this here snoopin ' , when I ' m dead I ' ll will yer this ol ' hook o ' mine , as has scraped a hundred men . DUKE : Yer honors me , Captain . And if I is shoveled in first , me stump is yourn . CAPTAIN : It ' s handsome of yer , Duke . And I ' ll not be jolly till a year is up  --  jest like a widder . DUKE : Yer touches me . I ' ll tie a black ribbon on yer hook . ( At this pathetic moment Darlin ' is heard singing in the kitchen . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Duke , he talks like a loon . Me Darlin ' , me life , will yer be me wife , And elope by the light o ' the moon ? ( There is a stamping of boots outside . The pirates put their fingers on their lips . They are innocence itself . The Duke scratches the head of the parrot . The strange bird declines to taste his grog . Patch-Eye shuffles the cards . The Captain hooks the mugs toward him one by one for the last drops of their precious liquor . Red Joe enters . Also , Darlin ' from the kitchen . ) JOE : Hello , mates ! Evening , Captain ! Are n't you cozy ! As peaceful as old ladies with their darning . I ' ve just come from seeing Petey , up at the lighthouse . Petey says that along in about fifteen minutes the Royal Harry will be showing around the cliff . Is n't it time , Captain , to set up the lantern where ' s she ' s useful ? DUKE : Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t it , is what Red Joe means . CAPTAIN : Right yer are , Joey . We must be trottin ' . DUKE : What ' s the name o ' that tavern , Joe , at Wappin ' wharf where we gets the uncommon grog ? JOE : Wappin ' wharf ? I ' m blessed if the name ' s not gone from me . The grog ' s nothing to Darling 's . DUKE : What does yer call the tavern on the Isle o ' Dogs ? JOE : I ' m remembering the rum . What ' s the use of looking at the signboard ? DUKE : How does yer sight ter turn the bar at Guinea ? JOE : Sorry , Duke . It was my watch below . I was snoring when we turned . CAPTAIN : What happened to yer pigtail ? PATCH : Where does we ship the niggers ? DARLIN ' : Ain ' t yer got a mermaid on yer chest ? ( The pirates have risen and come forward . Their questions are put faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands in an easy , careless attitude . He seems ignorant of danger . He has taken a coal from the fire and slowly , deliberately , with back to the menace , he lights his pipe . Then suddenly he drops it from his teeth . He leaps to action . He draws his knife  --  two knives , one for each hand . He kicks away a chair , for room . He drives the pirates across the cabin . The candle  --  all the mugs upon the table  --  rattle to the stones . He cries out with bravado . ) JOE : Who offers me his carcass first ? What ! Is pirate blood so thin and white ? ( The pirates stand with knives drawn . It is an awkward moment of social precedence . ) PATCH : ( safe in the farthest corner ) . It ' s me patch , Captain . It ' s fetched loose . I follers yer . JOE : Come , Duke , and take your answer ! Have you no stomach for my message ? ' Fore God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shearing ? ( Joe 's is a dangerous gayety . His two knives glisten in the candle light . ) PATCH : Scrape him with yer hook , Captain , I follers yer . JOE : My knife frets . It is thirsty for thick red wine . Who offers me his cask to tap ? I ' ll pledge the King , although it is a dirty vintage . Come , Captain , I ' ll carve you to a dainty morsel . We ' ll have fresh meat for the platter . You ' ll not be known from scared rabbit-flesh . ( He drives them around the table . Patch takes refuge behind the door . Darlin 's red stockings run up the ladder . ) JOE : You bearded hound ! PATCH : He ' s tauntin ' yer , Captain . Hand him the hook ! The Duke and me is back o ' yer . JOE : Do you fear to cheat the gibbet on Wapping wharf ? A knife ' s a sweeter end . Who comes first ? I ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Flint waits in hell for three whelps to join his crew . PATCH : Captain , I ' m ' sprized at yer good nater . Scrape him one ! JOE : Who comes to the barber first ? Cowards ! I ' ll ram your pigtails down your throats . I ' ll wash your dirt in blood . ( The Duke proves to be the strategist . He has edged to the rear of the cabin . He circles behind Red Joe . And now in a flash he leaps on him . Joe is buried under the three pirates , for Patch 's valor returns when Joe is down . Joe is tied with ropes and fastened to an upright at the chimneyside . This is the terrible , glorious moment , now that the fight is over , when the actor-manager , as I first read the play  --  as explained in the preface ( you really must read the preface )  --  turned his excited somersault down the carpet . ) PATCH : Did yer notice , Captain , how I took him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was me tripped him . DUKE : Captain , I asks yer a favor . Can I stick him now . Dead men tell no tales . PATCH : Captain , yer jest makes a pet o ' the Duke . Ain ' t it my turn ? I gets rusty . DARLIN ' : Let the Duke do it . He has more reasons than Patch . CAPTAIN : Lay off , me hearties ! Does n't yer know we ' re in a hurry ? Red Joe ' s kickin ' up has wasted a heap o ' time . The Royal ' Arry will be showin ' ' round the cliff any minute now . Red Joe ' s safe . He ' s tied up double . We ' ll have a merry party arterward  --  with grog and angel cake . It ' s business afore pleasure . Here , Duke , take the lantern . ( He shakes it . ) It ' s full o ' ile . Jest stir yer timber stump , Duke . Yer can foller , Patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks is pussycats . Illustration : " It ' s full o ' ile " DUKE : He ' s pokin ' fun at yer , ol ' lionheart . PATCH : Yer hurts me feelin 's . DUKE : I ' ll hurt yer in a fatter place  --  where yer sits  --  if yer does n't step along . Yer a yeller-livered , maggoty land fish . I curbs me tongue . I scorns yer worse ' n cow 's milk . Go ' long , afore I loosens up and tells yer what yer are ! CAPTAIN : In about two minutes that blessed eye o ' Petey will go out . We must set up the lantern afore the Royal ' Arry sticks her nose in sight . DUKE : By by , Joey . See yer later , ol ' angel cake . Yer has jest time ter say " Now I lay me . " CAPTAIN : How ' s the night , Duke ? DUKE : Blacker than the Earl o ' Hell 's top-boots . DARLIN ' : I ' ll jest stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . It ain ' t proper fer a lady as has me temptin ' beauty ter be left alone with snoopers . ( The cabin is empty except for Red Joe . He strains at his cords , but is tied fast . You hear the voices of the pirates singing in the distance . ) I agrees ter this and ter give ' em bliss  --  From Pew I learned the trick  --  I push ' em wide o ' the wessel 's side , And poke ' em down with a stick . ( As soon as the pirates have left the cabin Betsy enters . She sees Joe but passes him in fright . She runs to the window and shields her eyes to see into the darkness . ) BETSY : God help the poor sailormen ! JOE : Betsy ! Betsy ! For the love of God ! ( Suddenly the lighthouse light vanishes . And almost at once the ship 's lantern shows at the window to the left . All sounds are hushed . ) BETSY : The ship ' s in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther cliff . I see her turning . She heads in from the sea . Her three masts are in line . She steers for the lantern . God have mercy ! She ' ll strike in another minute . ( She stuffs her ears and runs from the window . ) I can ' t bear to listen . I can ' t bear to look . JOE : Betsy ! Betsy ! Do you hear ? Margaret ! Margaret ! ( At the sound of Margaret she lifts her head , buried in her arms . She runs toward Joe . Her wits seem dazed . ) JOE : Quick ! Margaret ! Margaret ! That knife ! That knife on the stones ! Margaret , cut me loose ! ( Still dazed , moving as if in a dream , Betsy picks up the knife . She cuts Joe 's cords . Joe seizes the gun that leans against the clock . He takes deliberate aim through the window . He fires . The window glass is shattered . The ship 's lantern is hit . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , looking in his face . ) BETSY : You ' ve hit it ! Thank God ! The light is shattered . ( Then , after a pause . ) I seem to remember now . My name is Margaret . I remember  --  JOE : What do you remember ? BETSY : A great staircase  --  a room , with shadows from a candle . And when I was afraid , a lady sang to me . And she set the candle so that the fearful giant upon the wall ran off , and I was safe . JOE : What else do you remember ? BETSY : I remember  --  JOE : Margaret , do you remember me ? ( Margaret looks at him and a new memory is stirred . ) BETSY : Yes , I remember you . Were you not a great tall lad whose crook 'd elbow was level with my head ? And once we climbed a tower  --  or do I recall a dream ? You held me so that I might see the waves breaking on the rocks below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cried out our discovery of each glistening sail . Are these things real ? One morning you mounted horse , and I was held aloft so that you might stoop and kiss me . You rode off with a clatter on the stones . You turned and waved your hat . And now you have come back . You are Hal . We were playmates once . JOE : And by luck and God 's help we shall be playmates once again . ( He puts his arms around her and kisses her . ) BETSY : Quick , Hal ! You must escape . Quick ! Before the pirates come . Follow the path to the village ! You can escape by the Royal Harry . ( They are running to the door when there is a sound of voices on the path outside . Joe has just time to put himself in the posture in which the pirates left him . The pirates and Darlin ' enter in dejection . Betsy runs to the kitchen . ) CAPTAIN : Blast me , the lantern ' s out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DARLIN ' : Poof ! And there were n't no lantern ! DUKE : What done it ? What done it ? I asks yer . ( They stand at the window and look toward the ocean . ) DUKE : She is still headed on . Her nose is still pointin ' toward the cliff . CAPTAIN : What ' s that ? DUKE : I hears the rattlin ' o ' chains . She ' s droppin ' anchor . She has sniffed the willainy . Her anchor ' s down . She ' s saved hisself . Blow me , she ' s saved hisself . CAPTAIN : Yer can hang me ter a gibbet . PATCH : Yer can rot me bones . DARLIN ' : Me heart ' s gone palpy . DUKE : What done it ? What done it ? I asks yer . ( At this point let us hope that the curtain does not stick . ) Illustration : " What done it ? I asks yer " Illustration : ACT III ACT III The scene is the same as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship rocking on the sea . Our plot still twists us around its little finger . The curtain rises on the tableau of the second act . Old Petey shows again at the window to the right . DUKE : What done it ? What done it ? I asks yer . PATCH : Jest when everythin ' was goin ' pretty . CAPTAIN : Jest when she was about ter hit . DARLIN ' : Me heart near stopped  --  I was that excited . ( The pirates sit in deep dejection . ) DUKE : The mystery o ' this business is how the blinkin ' lantern went out . CAPTAIN : Ol ' Petey done his part . PATCH : He doused herself in time . CAPTAIN : It was the lantern done it . DUKE : When there were n't no light at all , the Royal ' Arry , she jest sniffed willainy and dropped anchor . PATCH : I was repeatin ' Smash yer devil ! Smash yer devil !  --  kinder hurryin ' her on . DARLIN ' : I was sayin ' Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It was n't ile . I put ile in the lantern meself . Captain , yer seen me put in ile . CAPTAIN : I seen yer . And I swished it meself ter be sure . PATCH : Nothin ' s been right since that ol ' lady hanged me ter a gibbet . CAPTAIN : There we was watchin '  --  PATCH : Pop ! CAPTAIN : And all of a sudden  --  quicker ' n seven devils  --  the bloomin ' lantern went all ter pieces . It ' s grog , I says . Snakes is next . It were a comfert to the ol ' Captain ter know that all o ' yer seen it . I seen a yeller rhinoceros once , runnin ' along with purple mice  --  all alone I seen it  --  and it kinder sickened me o ' rum . PATCH : Does yer think the lantern exploded ? DUKE : Did yer ever hear o ' a ship 's lantern explodin ' ? I asks yer , Captain . CAPTAIN : Yer talks silly , Patch . That lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship  --  swingin ' easy and contented all ' round the Horn  --  and it ain ' t never exploded once . DUKE : Swabs ' lanterns explode , stoopid . Ships ' lanterns don ' t . Captain , I feels as mournful as when Flint 's clock did n't tick no more and we knowed he was took by the blessed angels . CAPTAIN : I ain ' t meself as gay as a cuckoo  --  not quite I ain ' t . PATCH : Ever since that ol ' lady  --  DUKE : Lay off on that ol ' lady ! ( They sit in silence , in dejection . All stare stupidly at the floor . For a moment it seems as if nothing more will be said and the audience might as well go home . But presently the Duke sees something at the rear of the cabin . He looks as you or I would look if we saw a yellow elephant taking its after-dinner coffee in the sitting-room ; but , as he is a pirate , he is not frightened  --  merely interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make sure it is no delusion  --  not grog or rum . Then he rises softly . He crosses to the window . Very gently he touches the glass . He finds it is really broken . He loosens a piece of the shattered glass . The others are sunk in such melancholy that they do not observe him . He gazes through the window , studying the direction of the broken ship 's lantern . He traces the angle with his finger . The gesture ends with an accusing finger pointing at Red Joe . He whistles softly . For a moment his eye rests upon the gun , which leans against the clock . He has guessed the riddle . He advances casually , but with dirk in hand . He comes in front of Joe . Suddenly he presses the blade of his dirk against Joe 's stomach . ) DUKE : Captain ! Captain ! Quick ! Tie him up ! ( Joe is bound again with rope . ) DUKE : It ' s him that done it . It ' s Red Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( as he points to the knife on the floor ) . Does yer see that knife ? Does yer see Joe ? I ' m tellin ' yer . It was him shot out the lantern . PATCH : Did n't I help ter tie him meself ? DUKE : Askin ' yer pardon , Captain , but you and Patch has the brains o ' a baby aligator . A stuffed rhinocopoterus is pos ' - lutely nothin ' . Askin ' yer pardon fer speakin ' so plain . I does all yer thinkin ' for yer . There ' s some folks settin ' here as are fat-headed , and thinks ships ' lanterns explode . PATCH : Easy now , ol ' dear . Yer alers pitchin ' inter me , ' cause I ' m good-natered . CAPTAIN : Red Joe , I calls yer a dirty spy . A swab ! A landlubber ! Fer one copper farthin ' I ' d ketch yer one with this hook . DUKE : It was me discovered him .

Now jest toddle back to the kitchen . DUKE : This ain ' t no place fer a leetle girl . It will give yer bad dreams . Mince pie ' s nothin ' . ( Betsy attempts to leave the cabin by the door that leads to the cliffs  --  the door at the rear of the cabin . ) DUKE : Where you goin ' , Betsy ? BETSY : I ' ve an errand in the village . DUKE : Well , yer ain ' t goin ' . It ain ' t no night fer a leetle girl ter be out . I ain ' t goin ' ter have me Duchess snifflin ' with a cold . Go to grandma ! It was me discovered him , Captain . I ' m askin ' yer a favor . He ' s a snooper . PATCH : Captain , I gets rusty . CAPTAIN : Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves both o ' yer . I loves yer equal , like two mugs o ' grog as is full alike . Yer can pitch dice ter see which does it . ( He places the dice cup on the table beside the candle . The Duke and Patch take their places . Betsy , under cover of this centered interest , runs to Red Joe , who whispers to her . ) DUKE : I drops ' em in me mug , so ' s they can get a smell o ' rum . The leetle bones is me friends . I never throws less ' n a five spot . I makes a pint o ' shakin ' the bones till they rattles jolly . I likes the sound o ' it even better ' n the blessed scrapin ' o ' a spoon what ' s stirrin ' grog . Write it on me tombstone  --  if I rots ashore  --  He was the kinder feller as never throwed less ' n a five spot . Illustration : " The leetle bones is me friends " CAPTAIN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept waitin ' , sulks . PATCH : One or three ? DUKE : One ' s enough . I ' m talkin ' to yer , bones . I wants sixes , sweeties . ( As he throws Betsy jostles the candle with her arm . It overturns and falls . The cabin is dark . You can see her run from the cabin and pass the windows to the left . ) DUKE : Now yer done it ! PATCH : You is all thumbs , Betsy . CAPTAIN : Easy , mates ! It were jest an accident . Betsy , fetch a seacoal from the hearth ! Betsy ! We ain ' t goin ' ter wallop yer . Where are yer , Betsy ? DARLIN ' : Come out o ' yer hidin ' ! CAPTAIN : I ' ll light the candle meself . ( He takes it to the fire , lights it and returns to the table . ) CAPTAIN : There yer are  --  blazin ' like ol ' Petey . Yer had better sit down , Betsy . Crack me stump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' her ter run away . We ain ' t never walloped her . DUKE : Women ' s silly folks . I calls ' em ninnies . It don ' t do no good tryin ' ter understand ' em . Now then , ol ' lionheart , are yer ready ? ( He throws . ) Two fives ! I ' ve done yer , Patch . ( It is Patch 's turn . He kisses the cubes . ) PATCH : Yer as sweet as honey . Tell me yer loves me . Me dirk is itchin ' fer yer answer . Luck ' s a lady as dotes on me . ( He throws . ) A pair o ' sixes ! Does yer see it , Duke ? Stick yer blinkin ' eye right down agin the table ! It ' s me , Captain . ( He rises and draws his knife . ) Joey are yer ready ? JOE : God , if I were loose I ' d take you by the dirty gullet and twist it until you roared . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cur . Of what filth does nature sometimes compound a man ! Shall a skunk walk two-legged to infect the air ? Three cowards will hang on Wapping wharf before the month is up . PATCH : Are n't meanin ' us , are yer Joey ? JOE : And I ' ll tell you more . CAPTAIN : Ain ' t we listenin ' to yer ? Yer can talk spry , as Patch here has a leetle job ter do , and it ' s nearin ' bed time . DUKE : We does n't want ter sit up late and lose our beauty sleep jest listenin ' to a speech . JOE : A pirate takes his chance of death . You guard your dirty skins by wrecking ships upon the rocks . You dare not pit yourselves against a breathing victim . Like carrion-crows you sit to a vile and bloated banquet . PATCH : Tip me the wink , Captain , when yer has heard enough . JOE : Stand off , you whelp ! The King of England fights in France  --  DUKE : Ain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter help ? JOE : I ' ll tell you why I am not in France . I swore to his majesty that I would clear his coast of pirates . My plans are made . The channel is swept by gunboats . They will close in on you tomorrow  --  you and all the dirty vermin that befoul these cliffs . DUKE : He talks so big , ye ' d think he was the King himself . ( Everyone laughs at this . The Duke takes the cloak from the chest . In derision he hangs it across Red Joe 's shoulders . ) DUKE : We ' ll play ch'rades . Here ' s yer costume , Joey . There ! It fits yer like the skin o ' a snake . We makes yer King . Yer looks like yer was paradin ' in St. James 's park , lampin ' a Duchess . PATCH : Does yer majesty need a new ' igh chancellor . I asks yer fer it . I wants a fine house in London town , runnin ' ter the Strand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , I asks yer ter cast yer gig on me . I ' d be a right smart Archbishop o ' Canterbury . Me whiskers is ' clesiastical . DUKE : I offers meself , King , as Lord ' Igh Admiral o ' the Navy . I swears fluent . DARLIN ' : Has yer a Princess vacant ? I lolls graceful on a throne . ( The horrid creature spits . ) CAPTAIN : ' Vast there , me hearties ! I ' m thinkin ' I ' m hearin ' the sound o ' footsteps . DUKE : ( to Patch ) . Did yer lordship hear any sound ? PATCH : Askin ' your Grice 's pardon , I did n't ketch a thing . Did you hear anythin ' , Princess ? DARLIN ' : There ' s nothin ' come ter me pearly ears . CAPTAIN : Silence ! I wants ter listen . ( No sound is heard . ) CAPTAIN : Well , Patch , yer had better get yer dirk ready . I ' m uncommon sleepy . I wants ter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep one , Patch . PATCH : I takes it mighty kind o ' you , Captain . Yer has alers been a lovin ' father ter me . Joey , I ' ll tell yer what yer are . Yer the kind o ' feller I hates most perticerler . Yer a spy ! Say yer prayers , you hissin ' snake ! ( He sharpens his dirk and gayly tests it on his whiskers . ) JOE : My wasted day is done . In the tempest 's wrack the stars are dim and faith ' s the only compass . Now or hereafter , what matters it ? The sun will gild the meadows as of yesteryear . The moon will fee the world with silver coin . And all across the earth men will traffic on their little errands until nature calls them home . I am a stone cast in a windy pool where scarce a ripple shows . Life ' s but a candle in the wind . Mine will not burn to socket . DUKE : He ' s all wound up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe is tellin ' us poetical that his wick has burned right down to the bottle . Yer had better put it out , without more hesitatin ' . ( And now , as they are intent for the coming blow  --  suddenly ! quietly !  --  a woman 's hand and arm  --  a claw , rather , with long , thin , shrivelled fingers  --  have come in sight at the window with the broken glass . It quite terrifies me as I write . My pencil shakes . Old ladies will want to scream . The fingers grope along the sill . They fumble on the wall . They stretch to reach the gun which stands beside the clock . Another inch and they will grasp it and Red Joe will be saved . The arm rubs against the pendulum of the clock . It swings and the clock starts to tick . And still no one has seen the terrible hand . And now the fingers are thrust blindly against the gun . It falls with a clatter on the stones . The hand and arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrieks . ) DUKE : Does yer see it , Captain ? PATCH : Horrers ! DUKE : It ' s never went since Flint was hanged . CAPTAIN : And would n't run till his death ' s revenged and him layin ' peaceful in his coffin . PATCH : Does yer think it ' s grog ? Does all o ' yer see it ? DUKE : What done it ? ( From the distance is heard a long-drawn whistle . ) CAPTAIN : What ' s that ? PATCH : It makes me jumpy . DUKE : It ain ' t a night when folks whistles jest fer cows and such . Finish yer job , Patch . PATCH : Are yer feared o ' somethin ' special , Duke ? DUKE : Feared ? If we ain ' t quick , there ' ll be a gibbet fer all o ' us . CAPTAIN : Ain ' t the clock tickin ' peaceful ? PATCH : She ain ' t got no right ter tick . It ' s like a dead man talkin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll stick it in him . And when I ' m done , we scatters . There ' s trouble brewin ' . Termorrer night , when the tide is out , we meets at the holler cave . And may the devil lend a helpin ' hand . Snooper , are yer ready ? Does yer see this here blade shinin ' in the candle ? In about one minute I ' ll be wipin ' off a streak o ' red upon me breeks . Flint  --  blessin ' on yer gentle soul !  --  yer can rest in peace ! Illustration : " I ' ll be wipin off a streak o ' red upon me breeks " ( He approaches Joe with upraised knife . Suddenly he cries out . ) DUKE : It ' s him the fortin-teller mentioned . It ' s the man in a velvet cloak ! CAPTAIN : It ' s him ! Me God ! Me hook ! ( With a growl of rage the pirates leap forward toward Joe , but are arrested by the sound of running feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three sailors . The sailor captain cries " ' Vast there ! " and the pirates turn to face his men . They put up a fight worthy of old Flint . Darlin ' , to escape the rough-and-tumble runs half way up the ladder . The table is overturned . The stools are kicked across the room . Even the precious grog is spilled . But the pirates ' valor is insufficient . They are overpowered at last and tied . Red Joe 's cords are cut . Into the cabin Betsy comes running , followed by old Meg . ) BETSY : Joe ! Hal ! Thank God , you are safe . JOE : Margaret ! SAILOR CAPTAIN : I am the captain of the Royal Harry . JOE : Captain , I charge you to arrest these men . SAILOR CAPTAIN : Yes , your Royal Highness . DUKE : Royal ' Ighness ? Did yer hear what he said ? DARLIN ' : ' Ighness nothin ' . He ' s jest a snooper . ( She sits on the floor , with her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last  --  a true cook for a pirates ' band . ) JOE : You will transport them in chains to London to wait their sentence by a court of law . SAILOR CAPTAIN : Yes , your majesty . JOE : You mistake me , Captain . My father is the King of England . I am but the Prince of Wales . SAILOR CAPTAIN : Alas , sire , we bring you heavy news . Your Royal Father , the King of England , has been killed , fighting gloriously on the soil of France . JOE : Bear with me . My grief has leaped the channel . My thought is a silent mourner at my father 's grave . Shall a King sink to the measure of a mound of turf for the tread of a peasant 's foot ? Where is now the ermine robe , the glistening crown , the harness of a fighting hour , the sceptre that marked the giddy office , the voice , the flashing eye that stirred a coward to bravery , the iron gauntlet shaking in the pallid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spadeful of country earth . Captain , has Calais fallen to our army 's siege ? Are the French lilies plucked for England 's boutoniere ? SAILOR CAPTAIN : Calais has fallen . JOE : Then God be praised even in this hard hour . By heaven 's help I throw off the idle practice of my youth . The empty tricks and trivial habits of the careless years , I renounce them all . A wind has scoured the sullen clouds of youth . My past has been a ragged garment , stained with heedless hours . Tonight I cast it off , like a coat that is out at elbow . My father henceforth lives in me . ( Meg , at her entrance , has sniffed the wasted grog . Her nose , surer than a hazel wand , inclines above the hearth . She bends to the lovely puddle . She employs and tastes her dripping finger  --  covertly , with mannerly regard to the Prince 's rhetoric  --  sucking in secret his good health and happy returns , so to speak . The liquor warms her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . The hearth-stone is her tavern chair . ) MEG : ( not boisterously  --  with just a flip of her trickling finger , as if it were a foaming cup ) . Hooray ! I wants ter be the first , yer Majesty , ter swear allegiance to yer throne . I saw yer future in the glass . Ol ' Meg knowed yer , like she had rocked yer in the cradle . I told yer I would come in yer hour o ' danger . It was me reached through the winder fer the gun ter save yer . It was me whistle that yer heard , dearie , hurryin ' up the sailormen as Betsy went ter fetch . JOE : Thanks my good woman . We grant you a pension for your love . ( She quests back to her pool of grog . She finds a spoon . She sits to the delicious salvage , with back against the chimney and woolen legs out-stretched . Speeches to her are nothing now . We can not expect her help in winding up our play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a sentimental page or two . ) JOE : Ha ! My velvet cloak , which I left at Castle Crag when I laid aside the Prince and took disguise . These unintentioned ruffians by their dirty jest have clothed me to my office . SAILOR CAPTAIN : I swear my allegiance , your Majesty . JOE : I rely on my sailors to clear the coast and seas . But first I want your allegiance in another high concern . Some fourteen years ago , when I was a lad of ten , I journeyed with my royal father to the castle of the Duke of Cornwall , which stands high on the wind-swept coast . Its giddy towers rise sheer above the ocean until the very rooks nesting in the battlements grow dizzy at the height . It is the outer bastion of the world , laughing to scorn the ocean 's siege . In that castle , Captain , there lived a little girl ; and she and I romped the sounding corridors together . And once I led her to an open ' brasure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the waves curling on the rocks below . And tales of mermaids I invented , and shipwreck and treasure buried in the noisy caverns of the rock , where twice a day the greedy tide goes in and out to seek its fortune . And far afield we wandered and stood waist-deep in the golden meadows , until the weary twilight called us home . And I remember , when tired with play , that her mother sang to us an old song , a lullaby . Her voice was soft , with a gentleness that only a mother knows who sits with drowsy children . And to that little girl I was betrothed . It was sworn with oath and signature that some day I would marry her and that , when I became king of England in the revolving years , she would be its queen . BETSY : By what miracle did you know me , Hal ? JOE : It was the song you sang . Your voice was the miracle that told the secret . With unvarnished speech I woo you . I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . MEG : ( faintly  --  floating in a golden sea of grog ) Hooray ! ( Joe takes Betsy in his arms and kisses her . ) JOE : The magic of your lips , my dear , is the miracle that answers me . My loyal sailors , I present you . Margaret , Duchess of Cornwall , Countess of Devon , Princess of the Western Marches , by right and title possessor of all land ' twixt Exeter and Land 's End . And now , by her consent and the grace of God , the wife of Harry , King of England . CAPTAIN : Leetle Betsy , I fergives yer . DUKE : I asks yer health , though I swings termorrer . PATCH : And may yer live long and ' appy ! DARLIN ' : We ' re lovin ' yer , Betsy . BETSY : My gracious lord , for these three years this cabin has been my home . These are my friends  --  the only friends I have ever known . They fed me when I had no food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang ? I ask you to pardon them . DARLIN ' : Glory ter God ! JOE : The pardon is granted . Captain , strike off their irons ! DARLIN ' : We loves yer , Betsy . CAPTAIN : We are fonder of yer than grog and singin ' angels . PATCH : I thanks yer , King . DUKE : It were jest an hour ago , settin ' in that chair , I asks ter splice yer , Betsy , keel ter topsail . The ol ' Duke never thought the Countess of all them places , and the Queen o ' England , ter boot , would ever be settin ' on his knee , pullin ' at his whiskers  --  him askin ' her ter name the ' appy day . BETSY : It was a prior attachment , Duke . CAPTAIN : We ' ll serve yer , King , like we served ol ' Flint . PATCH : Top and bottom , fore and aft . DUKE : We ' ll brag how the King o ' England and us has drunk grog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MEG : ( in a whisper ) . Hooray ! JOE : And now , Captain , lead the way . We must speed to London . BETSY : Good by , Duke . Some day you will find a girl who cooks roast pig that crackles . DUKE : A blessin ' , Betsy , on yer laughin ' eyes ! CAPTAIN : A health ter King Hal and his blushin ' bride ! ALL : King Hal ! Leetle Betsy ! ( With a wave of the hand Joe departs , and with him , Betsy , who kisses her fingers to the pirates in farewell . The sailors follow . The pirates and Darlin ' are left . The pirates sit at the table . They exchange glances of satisfaction . They unbutton for a quiet evening at home . Kings are but an episode in a pirate 's life . They return to the happy routine of their lives . Our adventure has circled to its start . ) PATCH : Darlin ' ! Me friend , the Duke , is thirsty . Yer had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ter be a foolish virgin and get ketched without no grog . DARLIN ' : ( at the fire ) . Yer coddles yer stomich , Patch . PATCH : The Duke , he knows a leetle dear as is jest waitin ' ter come flutterin ' ter his lovin ' arms . I thinks it ' s yer whiskers , Duke . CAPTAIN : Yer can pull one , Betsy , fer the locket that yer wears . We is laughin ' at yer , ol ' walrus . DUKE : Kings is bigger than Dukes . I looses without no kickin ' up . There ' s no one like Darlin ' fer mixin ' grog . DARLIN ' : Fer that kind word I ' m lovin ' yer . ( She fills the cups . ) PATCH : It ' s grog beats off the melancholy . As soon as me pipes goes dry , I gets homesick fer the ocean . Here we be , Duke , thrown up at last ter rot like driftwood on the shore . It was ' appy days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN : ' Appy days , Patch ! ALL : ' Appy days ! ( They lift their cups in memory of a golden past . It is a contented family around the evening candle . They are as cozy as old ladies with their darning . Meg snores in peace as the curtain falls. ) * * * * * Our candles have burned to socket . Our pasteboard cabin is bare and dark . No longer do pirate flags flaunt the ghostly seas . The stormy ocean , the dizzy cliffs of Devon , melt like an unsubstantial pageant . Let 's put away our toys  --  the timber leg , the patch , the frightful hook . Once again , despite the weary signpost of the years , we have run on the laughing avenues of childhood.
