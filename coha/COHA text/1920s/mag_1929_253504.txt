Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh , prime Hero of the U. S. , is well used but by no means resigned to the idolatry of his public . When he landed in Havana from British Honduras one evening last week in a Sikorsky amphibian , he eyed the thronging newsgatherers more moodily than ever . He knew their eagerness this time was not solicitude for his safety . He knew that they were not going to ask him about the new Pan-American air mail route he had been inaugurating. * He knew , . alas , that they knew that he was going to do something that contained the essence of what is called " Human Interest . " It did seem to him that when a man , even a Hero , is going to get married , that he might be let alone . The newsgatherers were waving slips of paper which read : " Ambassador and Mrs. Morrow announce the engagement of their daughter Anne Spencer to Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh . " Well ? Col. Lindbergh compressed his lips and only opened them to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to say . I will confine my remarks to aviation . " The next day he flushed in angry silence at public comment and curiosity about his plans . Finally in Miami he said : " I believe the announcement is sufficient acknowledgement of the engagement . " But it really was romantic . The country gurgled its delight . The tabloids went wild with headlines about " Lindy and Anne , " " ' We ' now a Trio , " etc. etc . Arthur Brisbane pontificated : " It is pleasing to know that the chain of Lindbergh 's ancestry stretching back across the ocean to powerful men in the North is not to be broken . " Instead of sharing the not altogether delicate Brisbanal anticipation of a Lindbergh son and heir , other commentators preferred to ponder the social evolution represented in the conjunction of the Lindbergh tradition and the House of Morgan . The late Charles Augustus Lindbergh Sr. ( 1860-1924 ) was a " radical " Congressman from Minnesota . At least " radical " is the word that J. Pierpont Morgan must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Money Trust " and helping to precipitate the Congressional investigation of 1911 . <P> An interested spectator during the crusade against the " Money Trust " at that time was Dwight Whitney Morrow . He was then a member of an old Manhattan law firm . In 1914 he became a partner of J. P. Morgan &; Co . <P> A subtle metamorphosis has come to pass since 1914 . Not often or loudly , nowadays , is the House of Morgan called sinister or arrogant . Among men generally credited with helping this change is Thomas William Lament , who became a Morgan partner in 1911 . But even more credit has gone to Dwight Whitney Morrow . <P> The elder Lindbergh , it is true , was never satisfied that any change had come in the manner and method of large banking houses . To the end he saw them only as " accursed burdens upon the plain people . " In 1923 , in The Economic Pinch , he wrote : <P> " God pity our children for unless they compel the recognition of their rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens of increased wealth in profiteers ' hands to command and compound still greater interest , dividends and rent . <P> " But , " he added , " give the children the facts and they will correct things when it comes their time .
