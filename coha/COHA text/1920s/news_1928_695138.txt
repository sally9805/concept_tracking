txt 1 have arrived and I am happy  --  naturally . Why did I do it ? When one is offered such a tremendous adventure ' it would be too inartistic to refuse it . I have been a flier for years . i had ' planned to spend my vacation flying . I knew the moment this chance ' came to me that if I turned it down I would never forgive-myself . My trip across the . Atlantic.aboard the airplane Friendship was all I had imagined it to be as pleasure , . and much More , though pretty uncomfortable it times . This is my first trip to England , and it is rather funny dropping in by airplane . Nevertheless .1 hope tO make the trip akain some day and make it in the same way kwair .... What ! I wanted to demonstrate in this flight was that ** was comparatively safe and ought to be developed . Gives Great Credit to Companions . I was a passenger on the journey  --  just a passenger . Everything that was done to bring us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordan . Any praise I can give them they ought to have : You ca n't pile it on too thick . Transoceanic flying has to be done . by pilots who can fly by instruments alone am afraid *that Some accidents which marred past flights have been caused by pilots ' not too sure of instrument flying . . ? Despite.the fact that the weather reports promised us find visibility and fair weather , we had fog , rain and even snow practically all the way across . We only had clear weather for one hour out of the twenty-two we were on the way . The reason we came down here was because we could not see anything . We had just about enough gasoline left , we reckoned , to make Southampton , but we did not dare attempt it because we were flying blind and we knew we had come across : We will go on there tomorrow . Calls Waiting the Worst Part . To go back to the beginning , the hardest strain of all this flight in a way was the waiting at Trepassey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled on top of this worry . That is what made it so tiring . But we had been trying so much to take off at Trepassey that all I.can remember thinking of When we took off was that at last we were on the way . 1 was not really sure till we had flown for half an hour along the coast . and headed against the open sea , because I knew that if everything was not all right Bill would go back . When we started there Was such a burst of-spray that the Outside motors started cutting out : I was afraid we had made another false start , but the motors picked up again , and , although they stammered once in a while on the flight when coated with snow , I never had ' a moment of real trepidation about them and never doubted that we should arrive . I did not do much . I ' did not handle the controls once , although I . have had more than 500 hours ' solo flying and once held the women 's altitude record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio " Slim " would take them . Thought of Fishing in Newfoundland . - We got two messages from ships on the way , and when I found . out what ships they were I did a lot of thinking- and jotted down a lot of notes . about my feelings , which I hope to expand some day , perhaps . Leaving the American coast , it was beautiful weather . The jagged  --  coastline beneath us had ' a ' grandetir one neVe ? forgets , and passing over Newfoundland one could see ' lots of ' lakes where they told me there were good trout . I hope to fish there some time .. Beneath us the water was wonderful greens and blues , and everything was ' serene , though , of course the first thing we did was to start looking for the fog which we ? new would meet us off Newfoundland : The first hour over the open sea was the only time we saw it . We did not even see Ireland , though we passed right over it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not establish any landmarks and our yadio had quit us . We ' do not know yet how it got out of order , but it was-all right when Bill worked it last night and no good when , he tried it this morning . - ? Marvelous Colors in the Clouds. - Last night was gorgeous . The billows of fog , shot , with pink seemed like a vast-sunlit desert , and even when night ! can ; . there was am interesting color effect . There . was the glow of Wales and Enoland Join to Greet Intrepid Fliers our exhausts . At times we seemed to be flying straight into rings of all the colors of the rainbow . Once there were three rings at the same time . The air was not very bumpy and we had a good following wind . When we got above the clouds and flew very high the stars had a tremendous brilliance . Once we were 11,000 feet up , and it was pretty cold . Most of the time I lay close to the fuselage writing in my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time Bill came back from the radio he would tell me what he had received . He got a call from CEV , and I found out that this was the Chilean boat named Bet-Chala . It gave us its bearings . Then we got the position of the British ship Regent close by . That was 20 : 45 Greenwich Mean Time 4:45 P. M. New York Daylight Saving Time , Sunday , and I remember that the position was about 48 north and 39 west . Magnetic Compass Seemed the Better . I watched the petrol consumption and noticed that we kept climbing . Our earth inductor compass did not seem to work so well as our magnetic compass , and the radio went completely out . For food we carried half a dozen oranges , two vacuum bottles of coffee , one sweetened but without milk , some water , three hard-boiled egg sandwiches and spare rations of chocolate , malted milk tablets and pemmican. 1 ate three oranges and half a dozen malted milk tablets . I drank nothing and somehow did not feel hungry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not need coffee to keep me awake . Although it has been somewhat of a strain , naturally , I am feeling contented and very fit now that I am here . I did not train for the flight because I had planned to fly quite a bit during my vacation but had not known till six weeks before we started that I was going on such an adventure . One always likes real adventure on a vacation , and I am pretty fit physically . I do some horseback riding and last Winter took up fencing . Brought Only Her Flying Clothes . The only clothes I have brought with me are these flying clothes which I borrowed from a friend in Boston before I started . I lack toilet articles and will send out to buy clothes here . We were cutting down every ounce . . I do not know how long I am going to stay abroad this time . I am clue back pretty soon at Denison House from my vacation . Of course , I should like to browse around London and see all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the flight is enough of a good dream come true . Summing up , the trip thus far has been full of hardship because it is not comfortable aboard the floor of a plane . I can not exactly call it thrilling . It was a wonderful experience ? probably that is the best description ? an experience not to be missed if one is offered the chance . I never had any real doubt of the outcome . The Friendship has just had a great reception from the townspeople of the little Welsh village where we alighted . But I am not looking forward particularly to the repeated crowds which it seems likely we shall meet . It is all too recent , this flight , for me to compose my exact impressions or even to remember exactly what happened and when . But I know I would not have missed it for anything . Although I did not handle the controls , I believe a woman could if she were trained . I do not believe women lack the stamina to do a solo trip across the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of flying by instruments only , an art which few men pilots know perfectly now . Among the masters I should rank my two friends , Bill and " Slim , " who brought me over . In tomorrow 's issue Miss Earhart will continue her story , telling of her experience during the long wait at Trepassey , Newfoundland .
