txt Taxes on tickets have driven the American drama nearly to extinction and should be repealed since they are no longer necessary , William A. Brady , the New York producer , told the House Ways and Means Committee today . Mr. Brady appeared with Arthur Hopkins and other spokesmen for the theatre at the committee 's hearing on the tax revision bill of 1928 . This was the final session for hearings , and the committee will begin drafting the measure in exec ' utive session Monday . Among those besides Mr. Brady and Mr. Hopkins who declared that admission taxes have damaged the theatres were Burt New , counsel for the Motion Picture Producers and ' Distributors of America , Inc. ; Lignon Johnson of the International Theatrical Association ; M. J. O'Toole , for the Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America ; Frank Gillmore , for the Actors ' Equity Association and Chorus Equity Association ; Gilbert Miller , the New York producer ; Paul N. Turner , counsel for various theatrical organizations , and Representative Sol Bloom of the Nineteenth New York District . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . admission tax , the spoken drama was little heard in such States as Texas , Maine , Colorado and Montana . Secretary Mellon 's recent allusion to the Dempsey-Tunney fight receipts as justification for continuance of the admission tax was criticized by Mr. Brady and Mr. Hopkins . Mr. Brady said he admired Mr. Mellon , but could not agree that the tax was an ideal one , because a " couple of boxers went to Soldiers ' Field in Chicago and drew a gate of $2,600,000 for one performance . " Deny Any Reason for the Tax . " As an expert on the American drama , " Mr. Brady said , " I can say that all the theatres of the country last year did not draw that much . Two boxers for a half-hour 's show drew more than all the actors and actresses in the United States drew in a whole year . Surely there is no reason why you should tax us because two pugilists produced that much money . If you want to tax Tunney and Dempsey , do so ; but do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are doing some good for the nation . " Mr. Brady told of the " good war record " of the theatres , and Mr. Hopkins said : " We have come to you to find out when the war is over . " Describing the theatre as important to the life of the people providing . " mental and spiritual relaxation , " Mr. Hopkins urged that it should be taxed no longer , and added : " Mr. Mellon 's solicitude for the corporations apparently does not extend to the theatre , which is everywhere regarded as an important part of our social life . " Miller Points to Subsidy Abroad Mr. Miller said some European countries subsidize the theatre instead of taxing it . Representative Chindblom of Illinois , asked why some rich American did not endow theatres with funds , and Mr. Miller cited Otto Kahn as one who . had rendered great assistance to the theatre . At the same time , he characterized the Metropolitan Opera House as a " sorry antiquated barn " when compared with the . Dresden Theatre in Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was whether the small remaining segment of the war tax was to be made permanent . " I submit ; " he said , " that there is no occasion whatever for . the singling ' out of any one or two industries , which in common with all others pay their income - and other taxes , and . impose upon them a spe- cial and additional tax for permanent peace-time purposes . " Mr. New said it would be very unfair to say a tax on admissions to prizefights is a justifiable policy " and then to generalize with the further statement that , therefore , a tax on all admissions is likewise justifiable . " He estimated that 100 motion-picture theatres running feature programs were adversely affected by the tax . Road Companies Decline Rapidly . According to Mr. Johnson , the tax affects almost entirely the spoken drama , which is confined to the smaller theatres . He added that there are 1,000 fewer companies now on the road than a year ago . Mr. Gillmore estimated the reduction in the number of productions that have gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 298 in 1925 , he said , and 218 in 1927 . He contrasted the 10 per cent . tax with the 3 per cent . levy on automobiles , " one of the richest and most prosperous industries , " while , he said , ' acting is not a rich profession . " Mr. Bloom declared that the admission tax is " killing the theatre . " He asserted that there are not three booking agents in New York today . " You ca n't give a show away today , " he said . Henry Clay Anderson of Bowling Green , Ky. , amused the committee with his appeal for removal of club dues from the operation of the tax law . He spoke , he said , in the interest of golf . Mr. Anderson said $44,000,000 was paid to caddies last year , and that when consideration was given to the fact that some of them would be in mischief if not employed on the links , he thought it presented a good argument for eliminating the $10,000,000 tax collected on dues . Authors Present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authors ' League of America , recommended an amendment to the " earned income definition " of the existing law . " The section is construed as holdring the earnings of the freelance author to be ' unearned income , ' " he said . " The freelance authors constitute the bulk of the authors of the country ; their average income is much smaller than those authors who are able to obtain contracts ; they work in the same way as authors under contract and have the benefit of the ' earned income ' deduction . " Another appeal was from builders of yachts and pleasure boats , who asked for an increase by ten times in the taxes charged for the use of foreign built small craft . They asserted i that production abroad is much cheaper than in the United States , and that this applies not only to pleasure ships but to vessels required for the American merchant marine . Cites Boat Costs Here and Abroad . Henry R. Sutphen of New York , President of the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers , said there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4,000,000 , compared to $6,000,000 if built here ; twenty-one more are being constructed abroad at a cost of $3,700,000 , but they would cost $5,000 , - 000 in the United States . Boats , he said , were brought over on deck and delivered on their own power . He recommended an increase in the tax on foreign-built craft from $2 to $20 per foot fel. boats 32 to 50 feet long ; from $4 to $40 on those 50 to 100 feet long , and $8 to $80 on those 100 feet long and over . Henry G. Smith of New York , for the National Council of American Shipbuilders , said most of the foreign construction of yachts was in Germany . He declared the differential in cost in any American yard over the cost in a foreign shipyard was from 30 to 40 per cent . The same relative differential , he said , applied in the construction of large ships here and abroad . Says Shipyards Need Work . " The American shipyards , " he continued , " are in a deplorable condition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have they ever been in as bad a situation as today . As is well known to your committee , the Cramp Shipyard , which has been in existence for 100 years , has gone out of business during the past year owing to the shipbuilding depression , and the few yards that remain have had their activities curtailed to a point where it is almost impossible to maintain an efficient organization and conduct the business on an economical basis . " Representative Frank Crowther , Republican , of New York , said he would favor an amendment to the tariff law reducing the tariff rates on imported goods 5 per cent . if they are carried in American bottoms . " That is one of the best things we could do for our merchant marine , " he said . Representative Garner , Democrat , of Texas , suggested , however , that if such a proposition were really advanced , " Mr. Crowther would be the first man to object to it , " while Representative Rainey of Illinois , also a Democrat , said that if the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will take the tariff off . " Tomorrow the committee will receive a report on defects of the present law from the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation , which was created last year for studies of the administration problems of tax ' collection . It is composed of members of the Senate Finance and they House Ways and Means Committees . Insurgent Republican Senators today voted definitely to fight any ef-1 fort to repeal the Federal estate tax , which was urged this week before the Ways and Means Committee by the National Council of State Legislatures . Their decision to stand together meant they will be able , with the assistance of members of other parties opposed to repeal , to put u a formidable opposition whenever the issue goes to the Senate .
