txt During the hours when the bells of two neighboring churches were summoning the faithful to morning service yesterday , a staid brownstone house in a quiet street in Brooklyn yielded up the secret of a double Murder . While the worshipers ' tread was echoing from the tree-shaded pavements outside , policemen with flashlights looked into the inky blackness of the cellar below 23 Prospect Place . The beams glinted on the water that had flooded the floor and ' were trained on three ashcans at one side . The dismembered bodies of two women were in the cans . One woman had been struck down on the night of the Fourth of July . This was established with seeming certainty later . She was Miss Sarah Elizabeth Brownell , 76 years old , a seamstress who had turned rooming house keeper when the gray film of cataract had dimmed her sight . The police believe she was killed for spite or for gain . The second woman died in the cellar some time after 7 o'clock on Saturday night . She was identified as Mrs. Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had sold the furnished room house at the Prospect Place address to Miss Brownell on May 14 . The detectives attributed her death to the desire of the slayer to cover his first crime . She had stepped down to the cellar on Saturday night to locate a leak and had not been seen since . Suspect Is Held . A man with black brows and of rare strength was held at Brooklyn Police Headquarters last night charged with murder . He was Ludwig Lee , who four years ago came from Oslo , Norway , a carpenter and cabinetmaker by trade , but more recently caretaker at the murder house , Lee , whose neck is of the " bull " type , is short and broad ; black haired , smooth shaven , and with protuberant brown eyes that are seldom centred on anything or any one . He is 38 years old . Also held , but merely as a mateIda , witness , was Christian Jensen , another Norwegian , who had roomed with Lee at the house . Jensen , a tall , fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tea Company chain store . He and Lee had been taken to the cellar and forced to view the finds of the police . A third man , Otto Neilson of 353 Fifty-ninth Street , ? Brooklyn , was questioned with his friends , but no charge was lodged against him . The police said that Neilson had " put the whole thing up to Lee . " " Lee 's story is shot full of holes , " said Inspector John J. Sullivan . Despite this , Lee maintained his innocence . Relays of questioners including District Attorney Charles J. Dodd , Inspector J. J. Coughlin , Inspector Sullivan and Captain Arthur Carey failed to shake the man 's dogged insistence that he was not guilty . The police , however , stressed a chain of circumstances alleged against the carpenter and said that through him and the discoveries in the cellar they were confident they had cleared up the mystery of the parts of a woman 's limbs found early Saturday morning in Battery Park , Manhattan . Bits of Bedspread Link Crimes . Inspector Coughlin said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Pros- poet Place crime . He said that a piece of bedspread found wrapped about one of the limbs was identical with pieces of bedspread found wrapped about parts of the two victims . Several hours before the discovery in the cellar two bundles were found , one a block and a half from the rooming house and the second two and a half blocks away , containing evidence of the crime . Final decision on whether the find at the Battery and the crime in Brooklyn are related will be made today by city physicians . Lee was questioned for hours last night . He admitted ownership of a red stained shirt found drying just above the ashcans , the police said . and in his room were found the bankbook of Miss Brownell and several other of her b belongings . He also said that , unaware of the contents of the cellar , he had breakfasted yesterday morning in the kitchen just above . Crimson stains on the kitchen floor and other indications of a crime were so apparent , said the detectives . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police found several tools in the cellar . Among them were two saws , two hammers and an axe with a long black handle . The axe was coated with crimson and will he subjected to analysis . During Lee 's examination at headquarters the husband of Mrs. Bennett came in . Handcuffed to detectives , Lee was pasing from one room to another . The white-faced husband caught the man by the sleeve . " What did you do it for ? " he said . The carpenter turned his startled eves momentarily on the husband . Lee , according to his friends , had frequently given evidence of an eccentricity of , behavior . He did not display that last night . " I do n't know a thing about it , " he said calmly , pausing after each.word . He repeated the sentence when the husband reiterated his question , and the detectives moved the prisoner on to the second room . First Hint of Crimes . The first hint of the events in the cellar came to the police at 6:35 A. M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle merely part of the Battery park murder mystery . The first package was found by Edward Meyer , 16* years old , of 116 Fifth Avenue . as he played on the lawn of St. Augustine 's Roman Catholic Church , Sixth Avenue and Sterling Place . while waiting for 7 o'clock mast to begin . The boy saw the bundle lying back of the green hedge that fringes the lawn . its presence an the trim lawn aroused his curiosity and he was perplexed because he had scampered ' Past-the spot a few minutes before and was almost certain that it had not been there then . Mrs. Marie Donovan of 7 St. John 's Place was entering the church . The boy teed her of the-bundle . It was wrapped ? in a ? - ose and white check ' ered ? Manket and Mrs. Donovan thought that possibly.the bundle contained an , abandoned esaby. put there to catch the attention of those entering the church .

Second Package . Found . The red tape of routine was being unwound at 10:30 A. M. when the second package was reported . This was found under the iron stairway of a fire exit opening into the alley at the rear of the Carlton Theatre , a motion picture place at 135 Park Place .

Inspector John Fitzgerald , whom they had encountered at Seventh Avenue and Sterling Place . Fitzgerald after a glance at the 6 package had informed the police . Captain Bishop and Shaw untied the bundle as they stood in the alleyway , through which a fine rain was sifting . Both men are veterans of the department , but they explained later that horror had seized them when the parcel had been opened . It contained , among other things , the left shoulder and arm of a woman . The ring finger had been severed at the third joint . Gripped in the hand were several strands of black hair . The parcel had been wrapped in a red and white striped blanket , with inner wrappings of manila paper and the piece of white bedspread which Inspector Coughlin said was the same as found at the Battery . Assistant Medical Examiner Romeo W. Auerbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and that a cursory examination indicated that death had taken place anywhere from three days to twelve hours before . Husband Reports Wife Missing . At this time , however , there was still no thought of the cellar at 28 Prospect Place . The detectives Ltill believed only one murder had been committed , that of the young woman whose fate had been indicated by the discovery at the Battery . Then Mr. Bennett reported his wife missing . He said that she had left their home at 16 Lincoln Place early on Saturday night and had not returned . The address at Lincoln Place is directly at the rear of the Prospect Place house . He gave a description of his wife and said that until May 14 he had conducted a furnished room house at the Prospect Place address . He said that a daughter , Edith , was married and lived in Manhattan , and that two other children lived at home . They are Ruth . 17 years old , and John , 19 years old . It was from John that the police got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that shortly after 7 o'clock ca Saturday rtight he had seen his mother enter the house , but had thought nothing of it . He explained that on May 14 his mother had sold the house to Miss Brownell , who had paid a , small sum in cash and had arranged to pay the remainder in instalments under a mortgage . The youth knew little of Miss Brownell beyond the fact that about ten years ago she had conic to New York from Gloversville , N. Y. , to work as a seamstress and had been forced by ' failing sight to give that up . She had conducted a rooming house at 153 Sterling Place . he said , for some time and had sold that for cash , putting the proceeds into a bank . Detectives Visit House . I Finally the detectives decided to visit the house . They had learned from Mr. Bennett that his eldest son , Carl Bennett , had refused to move when the family did and had retained his own room on the top floor of the house . They rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anSevered . the ring and said that Bennett was out . The detectives decided to question Lee . They asked him if . he had seen Mrs. Bennett , whom he admitted knowing . and he said that she had called at the house on Saturday night and had demanded to be tall en to the cellar . The man said that Mrs. Bennett had complained that a leak in the pipes was causing a flood in the yard of the next door neighbor . Mrs. Emma Lohman , 75 years old . He said that he had taken Mrs. Bennett down to the cellar and had left her standing there , looking at the water , which was a foot and a half deep at some points . When the detectives asked Lee where Miss Brownell was , he told them , they said , that she had gone off on a visit to relatives in GloversVille . ' He explained that she had informed him of her contemplated visit on July 2 and that at her request he had cashed a check for $100 drawn on the Peoples Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later the police learned more about the check episode . Mies Brownell. he said , had not been home since the Fourth of July . The detectives demanded to see the cellar and a parley ensued . ? During this talk several detectives visited Mrs. Lohman at 30 Prospect Place . " I have n't teen Miss Brownell since the Fourth of July , " the pleasant faced old lady explained , " but ' Mrs. Bennett was sitting in that chair where you are now sitting ? " indicating a detective ? " only last i night . " Yesterday morning I found my I yard filling with water . It was , backing up through the drain iii ' the yard and I realized that it a-aa probably coming from the house next door . I telephoned to Mrs. I Bennett and told her that she should : : come over and see what the trouble ' ' was . A short time after I had tele-4 phoned I went out in the yard and ' I saw this Norwegian in his own-1 yard . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thing about attending to it right away " Last night I went to bed at 10:30 P. M. and a half hour or maybe an hour later  --  you ca n't tell the time once you have been asleep ? I heard a thumping on the wall . I did n't pay any attention to it . That 's all I know about it . " Well , to return . to Mrs. Bennett , she came here just before 7 o'clock on Saturday night . She sat down at the chair by one of the front windows and I took the one in the other window . She said that she had telephoned to the house next door three times and had called cnce without getting any response . She asked if she might sit at the window and watch for the return of this man Lee . I gladly told her that she might , and just at 7 o'clock , or maybe a bit after , Lee came down the street . " Oh , there he is now , " Mrs. Bennett said , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw ' icr at the gate , and I do n't know whether she went in or not . John , her son , however , told me that he was standing across the street and had seen her go in . He came ie to see me about 8:30 on Saturday night . " While the detectives had been interviewing Mrs. Lohman their colleagues had gone to the cellar . Even before they reached the basement they knew that a crime had been committed some days before . By the beams of their flashlights they found the ashcans and their contents . Although not placed under arrest , Lee was ordered to Brooklyn Police Headquarters for questioning . Detectives went to the man 's room on the first floor . They found Jensen sitting in there . He explained that he was a roommate of Lee , and he was questioned briefly . While this was being done the . detectives went through a trunk in the room . They said they found a passbook for the Peoples Trust Company issued to Miss Brownell and some of ? her clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address and detectives took him to headquarters with Jensen and Lee . Crowd Drawn to Scene . Meanwhile District Attorney Dodd was notified and he arrived with an assistant , E. J. Wynne . Inspector Coughlin , Inspector Sullivan and the reserves of the Bergen Street Station also went to the house . The reserves were called to handle the crowd of 1,000 which gathered quickly in front of the house . The spectators were driven back for a block on either side of the house . A police emergency squad drained the water from the cellar , and other parts of the bodies were found , including the severed finger . On a projecting lathe the police found a shirt . It was of the same make and had the same laundry marks as the shirts in Lee 's trunk and the one he had been wearing when taken to headquarters . An attempt had been mad to wash out red splashes on the front of it . Acting Chief Medical Examiner Thomas A. Gonzales joined Drs . Auerbach and Martin on the ground floor of the house where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be missing and the search was redoubled . Hours later one fragment was found concealed in an alcove of the cellar . The police found this when they started to rip down plaster and lathes . All yards of houses In the neighborhood were searched also , and employes of the Department of Public Works went to the house last night to determine what was clogging a sewer pipe serving the house . The men said that it might be necessary to rip up the street to remove the obstacle . The head of Mrs. Bennett was missing , but identification was made by other means . Canvass Near-By Houses . A canvass of the houses near by was undertaken by the detectives to see if any one had observed a man leaving the houses with bundles similar to those found at the church and the motion picture theatre . Inspector Sullivan announced that Fred Schmidt , who lives at 29 Prospect Place , directly opposite the furnished room house , had said that he had seen Lee leave the house at 5:30 A. M. yesterday . The man , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carrying a parcel . He was gone twenty minutes , returned and made another trip with a bundle . Armed with the knowledge of the contents of the cellar , the fact that Mrs. Bennett had not been seen since she went into the house and the allegation made by Schmidt , the detectives questioned Lee with added vigor . From Neilson and Jensen they obtained a story dealing with the hours when Mrs. Bennett had been killed . The two men said that they had called at the Prospect Place house at 9 P. M. on Saturday . They had trouble getting a response to their ring at the basement door , they said , but Lee had finally responded . He was scantily clad , they said , and did not seem glad to see them . He explained , they said , that he had been just about to take a bath because of the " heat . " He , asked them ? int however , , and , told them to wait in his room . They sat there for an hour , they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once Neilson rattled the door , after finding it locked , and Lee had shouted up : " Do n't do that . " " He came up at 10 P. M. and they sat around talking for an hour and then left , Jensen , according to his story , having planned to spend the night elsewhere than in his room with Lee . When the detectives questioned Lee about this story he admitted that he had been about to take a bath and insisted that he had not remained in the cellar but bad gone to the bathroom . He said that after Neilson and Jensen had departed he had gone to his room and fallen asleep in a chair . He said that he awoke at 4 A. M. and tumbled into bed . Inspector Coughlin said that Lee 's bed showed no signs of having been used . The man was also cross-examined intensively on his , statement that Miss Brownell had ieft during the day of July 4 . Was ' With Victim on Fourth . A Mrs. Wilson . an elderly woman who refused her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . She said that she had been a friend of Miss Brownell for years , and that on the Fourth she and the dead woman had gone on a little outing , Miss Brownell returned to her home that night and had planned to leave early on the morning of July 5 . Lee was questioned by District Attorney Dodd and Inspector Coughlin about a check for $1,000 , ostensibly signed by Miss Brownell , which , they charged , he had tried unsuccessfully to cash . According to Mr. Dodd the man admitted that he had contemplated forging the woman 's name to a check for that amount after he had found how easily one for 3100 had been cashed , but added that he had never put his design into practice . He said that he had wanted the money in order to return to Oslo , where , he said , jobs were more plentiful than here . The accused man said that he had first met Miss Brownell three years ago when she was conducting the house in Sterling Place . He said that a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood of Sterling Place said that Miss Brownell had put the man out because of his erratic conduct . Miss Elisa Roder , a roomer at the Prospect Place house , said that Miss Brownell and Lee had quarreled repeatedly . Confronted With Bodies . After being questioned hour on hour , Lee and Jensen were taken to the house and confronted with the reconstructed bodies . The head of Miss Brownell was pointed uut to Lee and he was asked if he ? could identify it . " It looks like Mrs. Bennett , " he said . The same question was put to Jensen . " It is Miss Brownell , " he said . " I know ths.t . I 've never seen the other woman . " Lee did not betray any signs of emotion during this test . He was rather ruddy , however , when he went into the house and it was noticed that he was pale when led out .
