CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN LITERATURE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND STUDY OUTLINES BY JOHN MATTHEWS MANLY AND EDITH RICKERT NEW YORK HARCOURT , BRACE AND COMPANY COPYRIGHT , 1922 , BY HARCOURT , BRACE AND COMPANY , INC .

In America today we have a few excellent writers who challenge comparison with the best of present-day England . We have many more who have been widely successful in the business of making novels , poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . In choosing from such a large number a list for study , it is our hope that we have not omitted the name of any author who counts as a force in our developing literature ; but , on the other hand , it is undoubtedly true that we have excluded many writers whose work compares favorably with that of some on the list . Our choice has been governed by two principles : ( 1 ) To include experimental work -- work dealing with fresh materials or attempting new methods -- rather than better work on familiar patterns ; and ( 2 ) to represent varying tendencies in the literary effort of our country today rather than work that ranks high in popular taste . The task of doing justice to every writer is impossible ; but we have been primarily concerned not with writers but with readers -- those who wish guidance to the best that there is in our literature and to the signs that point to the future . The word contemporary we have interpreted arbitrarily to mean since the beginning of the War , excluding writers who died before August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work since then . Space limitations made it impossible to go back to the beginning of the century , and no other date since then is so significant as 1914 . The biographical material is limited to information of interest for the interpretation of work . The bibliographies are selective except in the case of the more important authors , for whom they are , for the student 's purpose , complete . The following items have usually been omitted : ( 1 ) books privately printed ; ( 2 ) separate editions of works included in larger volumes ; ( 3 ) unimportant or inaccessible works ; ( 4 ) works not of a literary character ; ( 5 ) English reprints ; ( 6 ) editions other than the first . Exceptions to this plan explain themselves . The stars ( * ) are merely guides to the reader in long bibliographies and bibliographies containing works of very unequal merit . The Suggestions for Reading given in the case of the more important authors are intended for students who need and desire guidance . It is our hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion , for dissent is the guidepost to truth . As far as possible , we have avoided statement of our own opinions . The Studies and Reviews are the meagre result of long search in periodical literature . The fact that the photograph and the personal note bulk far more largely than criticism in America needs no comment here . Supplementary to the alphabetical list of authors with material for study , which constitutes the body of the book , are the classified indexes . These are intended for use in planning courses of study . The classification according to form suggests the limitation of work to poets , dramatists , novelists , short-story writers , essayists , critics , writers on country life , travel , and Nature , humorists , " columnists , " and writers of biography and autobiography . In this connection should be noted the supplementary list of poets whose names have not been included in our list but whose work can be studied in one or more of the anthologies indicated . The classification according to birthplace ( in some cases information could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local groups of writers . The classification according to subject matter ( including the use of local color and background ) , although it is necessarily incomplete , will , it is hoped , suggest courses of reading on these bases . Preceding the alphabetical list of authors are bibliographies of different types , which should be of use in the finding of material : lists of indexes and critical periodicals ; of general works of reference discussing the period ; of collections of poems , plays , short-stories , and essays ; and of bibliographies of short plays and short stories . * * * * * Our thanks for criticisms and suggestions are due to Professors Robert Herrick , Robert Morss Lovett , and Percy Holmes Boynton . To Mr. G. Teyen , of the Chicago Public Library , we are indebted for continual help in procuring books , verifying references , and , in general , for putting the resources of the library at our disposal .

A.B. , Harvard , 1912 . Has lived abroad , in London , Rome , and Windermere . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . A good introduction to Mr. Aiken 's verse is his own explanation of his theory in Poetry , 14 ( ' 19 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible , the following extracts may furnish some clue as to his aim and method : What I had from the outset been somewhat doubtfully hankering for was some way of getting contrapuntal effects in poetry -- the effects of contrasting and conflicting tones and themes , a kind of underlying simultaneity in dissimilarity . It seemed to me that by using a large medium , dividing it into several main parts , and subdividing these parts into short movements in various veins and forms , this was rendered possible . I do not wish to press the musical analogies too closely . I am aware that the word symphony , as a musical term , has a very definite meaning , and I am aware that it is only with considerable license that I use the term for such poems as Senlin or Forslin , which have three and five parts respectively , and do not in any orthodox way develop their themes . But the effect obtained is , very roughly speaking , that of the symphony , or symphonic poem . Granted that one has chosen a theme -- or been chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , which will not insist on a tone too static , it will be seen that there is no limit to the variety of effects obtainable : for not only can one use all the simpler poetic tones ... ; but , since one is using them as parts of a larger design , one can also obtain novel effects by placing them in juxtaposition as consecutive movements .... All this , I must emphasize , is no less a matter of emotional tone than of form ; the two things can not well be separated . For such symphonic effects one employs what one might term emotion-mass with just as deliberate a regard for its position in the total design as one would employ a variation of form . One should regard this or that emotional theme as a musical unit having such-and-such a tone quality , and use it only when that particular tone-quality is wanted . Here I flatly give myself away as being in reality in quest of a sort of absolute poetry , a poetry in which the intention is not so much to arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to employ such emotion or sense of reality ( tangentially struck ) with the same cool detachment with which a composer employs notes or chords . Not content to present emotions or things or sensations for their own sakes -- as is the case with most poetry -- this method takes only the most delicately evocative aspects of them , makes of them a keyboard , and plays upon them a music of which the chief characteristic is its elusiveness , its fleetingness , and its richness in the shimmering overtones of hint and suggestion . Such a poetry , in other words , will not so much present an idea as use its resonance . 2 . An interesting comparison may be made between the work of Mr. Aiken , and that of Mr. T.S . Eliot ( q.v. ) , of whom he is an admirer . See also Sidney Lanier 's latest poems . 3 . Another interesting study is the influence of Freud upon the poetry of Mr. Aiken .

In 1921 , received the prize of $2,000 offered by The Dial to further the work of the American author considered to be most promising . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . The autobiographical element in Mr. Anderson 's work is marked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional element is easily discoverable as patched on , particularly in the long books . 2 . To realize the qualities that make some critics regard Mr. Anderson as perhaps our most promising novelist , examples should be noted of the following qualities which he possesses to a striking degree : ( 1 ) independence of literary traditions and methods ; ( 2 ) a keen eye for details ; ( 3 ) a passionate desire to interpret life ; ( 4 ) a strong sense of the value of individual lives of little seeming importance . 3 . Are Mr. Anderson 's defects due to the limitations of his experience , or do you notice certain temperamental defects which he is not likely to outgrow ? 4 . Mr. Anderson 's experiments in form are interesting to study . Compare the prosiness of his verse with his efforts to use poetic cadence in The Triumph of the Egg .

A.B. , William and Mary College , 1898 , where he taught French and Greek , 1896-7 . Newspaper work from 1899-1901 . Since then he has devoted his time almost entirely to the study and writing of literature . His study of genealogy and history has an important bearing upon his creative work . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . Before reading Mr. Cabell 's stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance . He maintains that art should be based on the dream of life as it should be , not as it is ; that enduring literature is not " reportorial work " ; that there is vital falsity in being true to life because " facts out of relation to the rest of life become lies , " and that art therefore " must become more or less an allegory. " 2 . Mr. Cabell 's fiction falls into two divisions : ( 1 ) Romances of the middle ages . ( 2 ) Comedies of present-day Virginia . Both elements are found in The Cream of the Jest ( cf. with Du Maurier 's Peter Ibbetson ) . The romances illustrate different aspects of his theory of chivalry ; the modern comedies , his theory of gallantry ( cf. Beyond Life ) . 3 . In his romances he has created an imaginary province of France , the people of which bear names and use idioms drawn from widely diverse and incongruous sources . His effort to create mediaeval atmosphere by the use of archaisms does not preclude modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretense of non-existent sources of the tales and frequent allusions to fictitious authors are a part of the method . After reading some of these stories , consider the following criticism from the London Times quoted by Mr. Cabell himself at the end of Beyond Life : " It requires a nicer touch than Mr. Cabell 's , to reproduce the atmosphere of the Middle Ages ... the artifice is more apparent than the art .... " 4 . An interesting study is to isolate the authors for whom Mr. Cabell expresses particular admiration and those for whom he expresses contempt in Beyond Life and to deduce from his attitudes his peculiar literary qualities . 5 . Mr. Cabell 's style is notable for the elaboration of its rhythm , its careful avoidance of cliches , its preference for rare , archaic words and its allusiveness . Consider it from the point of view of sincerity , simplicity , clarity , and charm . Does it intensify or dull your interest in what he has to say ? Study , for example , the following exposition of his theory of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is structurally different from life , in that , were there nothing else , his book begins and ends at a definite point , whereas the canons of heredity and religion forbid us to believe that life can ever do anything of the sort . He must remember that his art traces in ancestry from the tribal huntsman telling tales about the cave-fire ; and so , strives to emulate not human life , but human speech , with its natural elisions and falsifications . He must remember , too , that his one concern with the one all-prevalent truth in normal existence is jealously to exclude it from his book .... For " living " is to be conscious of an incessant series of less than momentary sensations , of about equal poignancy , for the most part , and of nearly equal unimportance . Art attempts to marshal the shambling procession into trimness , to usurp the role of memory and convention in assigning to some of these sensations an especial prominence , and , in the old phrase , to lend perspective to the forest we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago observed my friend Mrs. Kennaston , is an expurgated edition of nature : at art 's touch , too , " the drossy particles fall off and mingle with the dust " ( Beyond Life , p. 249 ) . In summing up Mr. Cabell 's work , consider the following : ( 1 ) Has he a definite philosophy ? ( 2 ) Has he a genuine sense of character or do his characters repeat the same personality ? ( 3 ) Is he a sincere artist or " a self-conscious attitudinizer ? " ( 4 ) Is he likely ever to hold the high place in American literature which by some critics is denied him today ?

Like him Mr. Churchill has habitually moved along the main lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshaken by any adverse evidence and delighting in the American pageant with a gusto rarely modified by the exercise of any critical intelligence .

Here lies , without much question , the secret of that genuine earnestness which pervades all his books : he writes out of the contagious passion of a recent convert or a still excited discoverer . Here lies , too , without much question , the secret of Mr. Churchill 's success in holding his audiences : a sort of unconscious politician among novelists , he gathers his premonitions at happy moments , when the drift is already setting in . Never once has Mr. Churchill like a philosopher or a seer , run off alone . * * * * * Even for those , however , who perceive that he belongs intellectually to a middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand nor very shrewd or very downright on the other , it is impossible to withhold from Mr. Churchill the respect due a sincere , scrupulous , and upright man who has served the truth and his art according to his lights .... The sounds which have reached him from among the people have come from those who eagerly aspire to better things arrived at by orderly progress , from those who desire in some lawful way to outgrow the injustices and inequalities of civil existence and by fit methods to free the human spirit from all that clogs and stifles it . But as they aspire and intend better than they think , so , in concert with them , does Mr. Churchill . BIBLIOGRAPHY *The Celebrity . 1898 . Richard Carvel. 1899 . The Crisis . 1901 .

Born at Terre Haute , Indiana , 1871 , of German ancestry . Educated in the public schools of Warsaw , Indiana , and at the University of Indiana . Newspaper work in Chicago and St. Louis , 1892-5 . Editor of Every Month ( literary and musical magazine ) , 1895-8 .

Organized the National Child Rescue Campaign , 1907 . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . As Mr. Dreiser is considered by many critics the novelist of biggest stature as yet produced by America , the nature and sources of his strength and of his weakness deserve careful analysis . Observe ( 1 ) that his attitude toward life and his general method derive from Zola ; ( 2 ) that his materials are drawn from his extensive and varied experience as a journalist ; ( 3 ) that these two facts are exemplified in brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " human documents . " 2 . Note the dates of Sister Carrie and of Jennie Gerhardt , and work out Dreiser 's loss and gain during the long period of silence between them . 3 . Hey , Rub-a-Dub-Dub ( cf. Nation , 109 ' 19 : 278 ) should be read by every student of Dreiser , for its revelation of his attitude toward humanity , which contributes largely to the greatness of his work , and of his failure to think out a point of view , which is a fundamental weakness . Note his admission : " I am one of those curious persons who can not make up their minds about anything . " 4 . With what types of material does Mr. Dreiser succeed best ? Why ? 5 . Discuss Mr. Dreiser 's style in connection with the following topics : ( 1 ) economy ; ( 2 ) realism ; ( 3 ) suggestion ; ( 4 ) taste ; ( 5 ) rhythmic beauty . What deeply rooted defect is suggested by the following description of the Woolworth Building in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very maw of heaven " ? 6 . How far does Mr. Dreiser represent American life ? Do you think his work will be for some time the best that we can do in literature ? 7 . Read Mr. Van Doren 's article ( listed below ) for suggestion of other points for discussion . The following passage is especially significant : Not the incurable awkwardness of his style nor his occasional merciless verbosity nor his too frequent interpositions of crude argument can destroy the effect which he produces at his best -- that of a noble spirit brooding over a world which in spite of many condemnations he deeply , somberly loves . Something peasantlike in his genius may blind him a little to the finer shades of character and set him astray in his reports of cultivated society . His conscience about telling the plain truth may suffer at times from a dogmatic tolerance which refuses to draw lines between good and evil or between beautiful and ugly or between wise and foolish . But he gains , on the whole , more than he loses by the magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authority not sufficiently explained by the mere accuracy of his versions of life . Though it may indeed be difficult for a thinker of the widest views to contract himself to the dimensions needed for realistic art , and though he may often fail when he attempts it , when he does succeed he has the opportunity , which the mere worldling lacks , of ennobling his art with some of the great lights of the poets .

In 1892 , he spent a few months at Dartmouth College but disliking college routine , decided to earn his living , and became a millhand in Lawrence , Massachusetts . In 1897 , two years after he had married , he entered Harvard and studied there for two years ; but he finally gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , teaching , shoe-making , and newspaper work . From 1900-11 , he was farming at Derry , New Hampshire , but with little success . At the same time , he was writing and offering for publication poems which were invariably refused . He likewise taught English at Derry , 1906-11 , and psychology at Plymouth , 1911-2 . In 1912 , he sold his farm and with his wife and four children went to England . He offered a collection of poems to an English publisher and went to live in the little country town of Beaconsfield . The poems were published and their merits were quickly recognized . In 1914 , Mr. Frost rented a small place at Ledbury , Gloucestershire , near the English poets , Lascelles Abercrombie , and W.W. Gibson . With the publication of North of Boston his reputation as a poet was established . In 1915 , Mr. Frost returned to America and went to live near Franconia , New Hampshire . From 1916 to 1919 he taught English at Amherst College . But he found that college life was disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in Vermont and again became a farmer . In 1921 , the University of Michigan , in recognition of his talents , offered him a salary to live in Ann Arbor without teaching . This position he accepted , but it is reported that he intends to return to farming to secure the leisure necessary for his work . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . Make a list of subjects that you have not found treated elsewhere in poetry . Test the truth of the treatment by your own experience and decide whether Mr. Frost has converted these commonplace experiences into a new field of poetry . 2 . Read in succession the poems concerning New England life and decide whether they seem more authentic and more valuable than the others . If so , why ? 3 . Is Mr. Frost 's realism photographic ? Consider in this connection his own statement : " There are two types of realist -- the one who offers a good deal of dirt with his potato to show that it is a real one ; and the one who is satisfied with the potato brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is to strip it to form . " In view of the last sentence it is interesting to consider the kinds of details that Mr. Frost chooses for presentation and those that he omits. 4 . Read several of the long poems to discover his relative strength in narrative and in dramatic presentation . 5 . Examine the vocabulary for naturalness , colloquialism , and extraordinary occasional fitness of words . 6 . Try to sum up briefly Mr. Frost 's philosophy of life and his attitude toward nature and people . 7 . What do you observe about the metrical forms , the beauty or lack of beauty in the rhythm ? Do many of the poems sing ? 8 . What do you prophesy as to Mr. Frost 's future ? BIBLIOGRAPHY A Boy 's Will . 1913 . North of Boston . 1914 . Mountain Interval . 1916 .

During his boyhood , his father moved first to Iowa , then to Dakota . As a boy , Mr. Garland helped his father with all the hard work of making farmland out of prairie .

Two literary landmarks in Mr. Garland 's history are : Edward Eggleston 's The Hoosier Schoolmaster ( 1871 ) , and Joseph Kirkland 's Zury : the Meanest Man in Spring County ( 1887 ) . Read these and decide how much they influenced Main-Traveled Roads and similar volumes of Mr. Garland's. 3 . Mr. Garland says that he presents farm life " not as the summer boarder or the young lady novelist sees it -- but as the working farmer endures it . " Find evidence of this . 4 . Consider how far Mr. Garland 's success depends upon the richness of his material , how far upon his philosophy of life and his honesty to his own experience , and how far upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are his most obvious limitations ?

More important for interpretation of his work is the fact that he has carefully studied modern English and Continental literatures and is deeply interested in philosophy and the social sciences .

Of Welsh , English , Pennsylvania Dutch , and Irish ancestry . His father was a country editor , and Mr. Howells , living as he did under pioneer conditions , had very little formal education , but educated himself in working on newspapers as printer , correspondent , and editor . He read continually in boyhood , and taught himself to read six languages . As the result of a campaign life of Lincoln , he was appointed U.S. consul at Venice and lived there , 1861-5 . After a year on the staff of the Nation , he became assistant editor of the Atlantic Monthly , 1866-72 , and editor , 1872-81 . Later , he became an editorial writer for Harper 's Magazine , 1886-91 , and finally writer of the " Editor 's Easy Chair , " for the same magazine . Although Mr. Howells did not go to college , he received many honorary higher degrees , and was offered professorships by three Universities ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard ) ; but he refused these , not considering himself fitted for such work . In his editorial capacity he gave much advice and help to authors who afterward became famous . He died in 1920 . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . For just appraisement of Mr. Howells , it is necessary to be familiar with the facts of his life , and with his theories of fiction . For his life the two autobiographical books Years of My Youth and My Literary Passions are most valuable . After reading these , it is possible to see the large use of autobiographical material in the novels . 2 . It is interesting to group the books of Howells according to the sources of the material : ( 1 ) those growing out of his early life in Ohio ; ( 2 ) those growing out of his life abroad ; ( 3 ) those growing out of his life in Boston and New York . This last class might well be subdivided into those written before he came under the influence of Tolstoi and those written after . The turning-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howells 's interest in sociological problems add to or lessen the final value of his work ? 3 . The realism of Howells set a standard for American literature , the effect of which has not yet passed . Study his theories of fiction ( Criticism and Fiction , and Literature and Life ) and consider the good and bad effects of his work upon the development of the novel . 4 . Use the following quotation from Van Wyck Brooks , on Howells 's " panoramic theory " of the novel as a test of his work : To make a work of art , it is necessary to take a piece out of life and round it off ; and , so long as the piece is perfectly rounded off and complete in itself , so long as the chosen group of characters are perfectly proportioned in relation to one another , there is no need to introduce an artificial chain of action . 5 . Howells 's style has often been admired . Try to analyze it into its elements . Consider Mark Twain 's judgment : For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight and astonishment . In the sustained exhibition of certain great qualities -- clearness , compression , verbal exactness and unforced and seemingly unconscious felicity of phrasing -- he is , in my belief , without his peer in the English-writing world . 6 .

Younger brother of William James , the psychologist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard Law School . After 1869 , lived for the most part abroad , chiefly in England . Spent much time at Lamb House , Rye , a beautiful eighteenth century English house which he purchased in order to live in retirement . Just before his death , to show his sympathy for the part played by England in the War and his criticism of what he considered our backwardness , he became naturalized as a British citizen . In 1916 , received the Order of Merit ( O.M. ) , the highest honor for literary men conferred in England . His death in 1916 was attributed to overstrain caused by the War and his efforts to help the sufferers . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . A good approach to the work of Henry James is through the three articles from the Quarterly Review listed below . Mr. Fullerton sums up the material scattered through the prefaces to the definitive edition of 1909 . Mr. Percy Lubbock writes as the editor of the Letters . Mrs. Wharton adds to criticism of the Letters illuminating personal reminiscences . 2 . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his method of work is that to the Portrait of a Lady , from which the extract below is taken . In speaking of Turgenev 's attitude toward his characters , James says : He saw them , in that fashion , as disponible , saw them subject to the chances , the complications of existence , and saw them vividly but then had to find for them the right relations , those that would most bring them out ; to imagine , to invent and select and piece together the situations most useful and favourable to the sense of the creatures themselves , the complications they would be most likely to produce and to feel . " To arrive at these things is to arrive at my ' story , ' he said , " and that 's the way I look for it . The result is that I 'm often accused of not having ' story ' enough .... " So this beautiful genius , and I recall with comfort the gratitude I drew from his reference to the intensity of suggestion that may reside in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disponible . It gave me higher warrant than I seemed then to have met for just that blest habit of one 's own imagination , the trick of investing some conceived or encountered individual , some brace or group of individuals , with the germinal property and authority . I was myself so much more antecedently conscious of my figures than of their setting -- a too preliminary , a preferential interest in which struck me as in general such a putting of the cart before the horse . I might envy , though I could n't emulate , the imaginative writer so constituted as to see his fable first and to make out his agents afterwards : I could think so little of any situation that did n't depend for its interest on the nature of the persons situated , and thereby on their way of taking it .... The question comes back thus , obviously , to the kind and the degree of the artist 's prime sensibility , which is the soil out of which his subject springs . The quality and capacity of that soil , its ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , represents , strongly or weakly , the projected morality . That element is but another name for the more or less close connexion of the subject with some mark made on the intelligence , with some sincere experience . On one thing I was determined ; that , though I should clearly have to pile brick upon brick for the creation of an interest , I would leave no pretext for saying that anything is out of line , scale or perspective . I would build large -- in fine embossed vaults and painted arches , as who should say , and yet never let it appear that the chequered pavement , the ground under the reader 's feet , fails to stretch at every point to the base of the walls .... The bricks , for the whole counting-over -- putting for bricks little touches and inventions and enhancements by the way -- affect me in truth as well-nigh innumerable and as ever so scrupulously fitted together and packed-in . It is an effect of detail , of the minutest ; though , if one were in this connexion to say all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ampler part of the modest monument still survives .... So early was to begin my tendency to overtreat , rather than undertreat ( when there was choice or danger ) my subject . ( Many members of my craft , I gather , are far from agreeing with me , but I have always held overtreating the minor disservice . ) ... There was the danger of the noted " thinness "  - -  which was to be averted , tooth and nail , by cultivation of the lively .... And then there was another matter . I had , within the few preceding years , come to live in London , and the " international " light lay , in those days , to my sense , thick and rich upon the scene . It was the light in which so much of the picture hung . But that is another matter . There is really too much to say . 3 . Remember the following clues in reading James 's , work : " His one preoccupation was the criticism , for his own purpose , of the art of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His purpose is suggested by his own claim to have " that tender appreciation of actuality which makes even the application of a single coat of rose-color seem an act of violence . " 4 . There is suggestion of Mr. James 's limitations in the facts that he was tone deaf and so could not appreciate music , and that he is said not to have written a line of verse , and also in the fact that although his method of presentation in the novels is dramatic throughout and he strongly desired to write plays , the eight plays that he wrote ( three of which were presented ) were failures . 5 . Mr. James 's place in the sequence of great European novelists is as a follower of Balzac , Flaubert , De Maupassant , and Turgenev , and as a predecessor of Conrad ( whose study of him listed below should be read ) . 6 . Early in the nineties , a great change in method came about in James 's work ( cf. Cambridge , III , 98 , 103 ) . Judge separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then read several books of the period of change and decide what happened and whether or not it enhanced the value of his work . 7 . One of the remarkable facts about James 's style is its influence upon the critics who write about him . A close analysis of its qualities -- sentence length , the order and placing of the parts of the sentence , punctuation , vocabulary , etc. , might bring a more definite understanding of the reasons for this influence . 8 . A comparison of the work and qualities of Henry and William James might be made a valuable contribution to criticism . 9 . For a student familiar with Europe , a study of the reasons for James 's affinity with Europe and dislike for American life would make an interesting study . 10 . What different types of reasons can you bring to show that Henry James is likely to be a permanent force in American literature ? BIBLIOGRAPHY A Passionate Pilgrim , and Other Tales . 1875 .

Read for background A Handy Guide for Beggars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An important clue to Mr. Lindsay 's work is suggested in his own note on reading his poems . Referring to the Greek lyrics as the type which survives in American vaudeville where every line may be two-thirds spoken and one-third sung , he adds : " I respectfully submit these poems as experiments in which I endeavor to carry this vaudeville form back towards the old Greek presentation of the half-chanted lyric . In this case the one-third of music must be added by the instinct of the reader .... Big general contrasts between the main sections should be the rule of the first attempts at improvising . It is the hope of the writer that after two or three readings each line will suggest its own separate touch of melody to the reader who has become accustomed to the cadences . Let him read what he likes read , and sing what he likes sung .

How do you explain his choice , and his limitations ? 4 . What effect upon his poetry has the missionary spirit which is so strong in him ?

How does his use of local material compare with that of Masters ? of Frost ? of Sandburg ? 6 . Study his rhythmic sense in different poems , the verse forms that he uses , the tendencies in rhyme , his use of refrain , of onomatopoeia , of catalogues , etc. 7 . Does Mr. Lindsay offend your poetic taste ? If so , can you justify his use of the material you object to ? 8 . Do you judge that Mr. Lindsay is likely to write much greater poetry than he has hitherto produced ? 9 . Mr. Lindsay 's drawings are worth study for comparison with his poems . 10 .

Born at Brookline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of Percival Lowell , the astronomer . Distantly related to James Russell Lowell . Educated at private schools . Traveled extensively in Europe as a child . Her visits to Egypt , Greece , and Turkey influenced her development .

She is a collector of Keats manuscripts and says that the poet who influenced her most profoundly was Keats . She has also made special study of Chinese poetry . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . As Miss Lowell is the principal exponent of the theories of imagism and free verse in this country , careful reading of some of her critical papers leads to a better understanding of her work . Especially valuable are her studies of Paul Fort in her volume entitled Six French Poets , of " H.D.

In judging her work , consider separately her poems in regular metrical form and those in free verse . Decide which method is better suited to her type of imagination . 3 . To what extent does her inspiration come from cultural sources -- travel , literature , art , music ? 4 . Consider especially her presentation of " images . " How far do these seem to be derived from direct experience ? Test them by your own experience . What principles seem to determine her choice of details ? Which sense impressions -- sight , sound , taste , smell , touch -- does she most frequently and successfully suggest ? Note instances where her figures of speech sharpen the imagery and others where they seem to distort it . In what ways is the influence of Keats perceptible in her work ? 5 . It is worth while to make special study of the historical imagery of the poems in Can Grande 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressionistic method of painting , work out an analogy between it and Miss Lowell 's word pictures . 7 . Study separately her varieties of free verse and polyphonic prose ( cf. her study of Paul Fort and the preface to Can Grande 's Castle ) . Choose several poems in which you think the free verse form is especially adapted to the content and draw conclusions as to the problems of development of this kind of verse or of its possible influence upon regular metrical forms . 8 . Use the following poem by Miss Lowell as a basis for judging her work : FRAGMENT What is poetry ? Is it a mosaic Of colored stones which curiously are wrought Into a pattern ? Rather glass that 's taught By patient labor any hue to take And glowing with a sumptuous splendor , make Beauty a thing of awe ; where sunbeams caught , Transmuted fall in sheafs of rainbows fraught With storied meaning for religion 's sake . 9 .

For bibliography , see Who 's Who in America . +Edgar Lee Masters+ -- poet . Born at Garnett , Kansas , 1868 , but brought up in Illinois . His schooling was desultory , but he read widely . Studied one year at Knox College ; learned Greek , which influenced him strongly . Studied law in his father 's office at Lewiston , and practiced there for a year . Then went to Chicago where he became a successful attorney and also took an active part in politics . Mr. Masters ' fame was established by the Spoon River Anthology , which was suggested by The Greek Anthology . With this Mr. Masters had become familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Spoon River Anthology first appeared in Reedy 's Mirror , under the significant pseudonym , " Webster Ford . " SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . Begin with The Spoon River Anthology . ( Cf. the preface to Toward the Gulf . ) How much does it owe to its model ? to other literary sources ? to the central Illinois environment in which the author grew up ? What are its most conspicuous merits and defects ? How do you explain each ? 2 . Test the sketches by your own experience of small town life . Which seem to you truest to individual character and most universal in type ? 3 . Compare similar sketches of personalities by Edwin Arlington Robinson , which Mr. Masters had not read until after his book was published . 4 . Consider how far Mr. Masters has achieved his avowed purpose " to analyze society , to satirise society , to tell a story , to expose the machinery of life , to present a working model of the big world " ; to create beauty , and to depict " our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions , our poor little lives , rounded by a sleep , in language and figures emotionally tuned to bring all of us closer together in understanding and affection . " 5 . How do you explain the sudden popularity of the Anthology ? What are its chances of becoming a classic ? 6 . Read one of Mr. Masters ' later volumes and compare it with the Anthology as to merits and defects . 7 . Mr. Masters has always been a great reader . Trace , as far as you can , the influence of the following authors : Homer ; the Bible ; Poe ; Keats ; Shelley ; Swinburne ; Browning . 8 . Draw parallels between his work and the work of ( 1 ) Edwin Arlington Robinson , q.v. , ( 2 ) of Robert Frost , q.v. , ( 3 ) of Vachel Lindsay , q.v. , and ( 4 ) of Carl Sandburg , q.v . 9 . An interesting study might be made of the effects of Mr. Masters ' legal training upon his poetry . 10 .

London editor of The Little Review , 1917-9 , and foreign correspondent of Poetry , 1912-9 . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . Mr. Pound is an experimenter in verse , who has come under many influences and belonged to many schools . His work should be studied chronologically to discover these changes in interest and relationship . To be noted among the influences are : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek poets ; ( 3 ) the Latin poets of the Empire ; ( 4 ) among modern French poets , Laurent Tailhade ; ( 5 ) the poets of China and Japan , whom he learned to know through the manuscript notes of Ernest Fenollosa ; ( 6 ) the work of the English Imagists ( cf. especially the poems of T.E . Hulme , published in Mr. Pound 's volume called Ripostes ) ; ( 7 ) the work of the Vorticist school of poets and artists ( cf. Blast , edited by Wyndham Lewis ) , and the more accessible periodical , The Egoist , of which Richard Aldington ( cf. Manly and Rickert , Contemporary British Literature ) is assistant editor . 2 . Consider also this from his own theory of poetry : " Poetry is a sort of inspired mathematics , which gives us equations , not for abstract figures , triangles , spheres and the like , but equations for the human emotions . If one have a mind which inclines to magic rather than science , one will prefer to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arcane , mysterious , recondite . " Can this be related to the qualities of Mr. Pound 's poetry ? 3 . After reading Mr. Pound 's output , discuss the adequacy of the following : " When content has become for an artist merely something to inflate and display form with , then the petty serves as well as the great , the ignoble equally with the lofty , the unlovely like the beautiful , the sordid as the clean .... Real feeling consequently becomes rarer , and the artist descends to trivialities of observation , vagaries of assertion , or mere bravado of standards and expression -- pure tilting at convention .

Consider as a group the poems that grow out of Mr. Robinson 's New England origin . In what ways is he characteristic of New England ? Compare his work with that of Mr. Frost in this respect . 4 . Compare and contrast Mr. Robinson 's portraits of persons with names as titles with similar portraits in the Spoon River Anthology . This type of verse seems to have been developed independently by both poets . 5 . An interesting study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; another , of the influence of Hardy . 6 . Another interesting study might grow out of the consideration of Robinson as a poet born twenty years too soon . How much has the temper of his work been determined by the fact that he had to wait so long for recognition ? 7 . What are the main features of Mr. Robinson 's philosophy as suggested in the poems ? 8 . Can you find many poems that sing ? What is to be said of the poet 's mastery of rhythms ? 9 . After reading the best of Mr. Robinson 's work , it is interesting to look up the comments of various admirers of it published on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday , in the New York Times , December 21 , 1919 , or the quotations from this article in Poetry , 15 ( ' 20 ) : 265 , and to see how far your judgment bears out these extravagant statements . 10 .

Newspaper man , first on the Indianapolis Sentinel , later on the Cleveland Plain Dealer , in which he conducts a column . Besides his successful volume of verse , Piping and Panning , 1920 , Mr. Robinson has published a novel which has attracted attention as an honest record of a growing boy , Enter Jerry , 1920 . For reviews , see Book Review Digest , 1920 , 1921. +Carl Sandburg+ -- poet . Born at Galesburg , Illinois , of Swedish stock . Has little schooling but wide experience of life . At thirteen drove a milk wagon , and for the next six years did all kinds of rough work -- as porter in a barber shop , scene-shifter , truck-handler in a brickyard , turner apprentice in a pottery , dishwasher in hotels , harvest hand in Kansas . During the Spanish-American War served as private in Porto Rico . Studied at Lombard College , Galesburg , 1898-1902 , where he was captain of the basket-ball team and editor-in-chief of the college paper . After leaving college , earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , salesman , newspaperman , " safety first " expert . Worked also as district organizer for the Social-Democratic party of Wisconsin and was secretary to the mayor of Milwaukee , 1910-12 . In 1904 he had published a small pamphlet of poems , but his first real appearance before the public was in Poetry , 1914 . In the same year he was awarded the Levinson prize for his " Chicago . " In 1918 he shared with Margaret Widdemer ( q.v. ) the prize of the Poetry Society of America ; and in 1921 , shared this with Stephen Vincent Benet ( q.v . ) . Mr. Sandburg has a good voice and sings his poems to the accompaniment of the guitar . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . In judging Mr. Sandburg 's work , it is important to remember that his theory involves complete freedom from conventions of all sorts -- in thinking , in metrical form , and in vocabulary . His aim seems to be to reproduce the impressions that all phases of life make upon him . 2 . Consider whether his early prairie environment had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the appeal to him of enormous periods of time , masses of men , and forces . 3 . Do you find elements of universality in his exaggerated localisms ? Do they combine to form a definite philosophy ? 4 . What effect do the eccentricities and crudities of form have upon you ? Do you consider them an essential part of his poetic expression or blemishes which he may one day overcome ? 5 . Do you find elements of greatness in Mr. Sandburg 's work ? Do you think they are likely to outweigh his obvious defects ? 6 . Compare and contrast his democratic ideals with those of Lindsay . BIBLIOGRAPHY Chicago Poems . 1916 . Cornhuskers. 1918 .

Compare them with Mark Twain 's books about boys and with Howells 's Boy 's Town . 2 . Consider separately the historical novels . Is pure romance Mr. Tarkington 's field ? Why or why not ? 3 . Consider the justice or the injustice of the following : According to all the codes of the more serious kinds of fiction , the unwillingness -- or the inability -- to conduct a plot to its legitimate ending implies some weakness in the artistic character ; and this weakness is Mr. Tarkington 's principal defect .... Now this causes the more regret for the reason that he has what is next best to character in a novelist -- that is , knack . He has the knack of romance , when he wants to employ it : a light , allusive manner ; a sufficient acquaintance with certain charming historical epochs and the " properties " thereto pertaining ... ; a considerable experience in the ways of the " world " ; gay colors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also the knack of satire , which he employs more frequently than romance ... he has traveled a long way from the methods of his greener days . Why , then , does he continue to trifle with his threadbare adolescents , as if he were afraid to write candidly about his coevals ? Why does he drift with the sentimental tide and make propaganda for provincial complacency ? 4 . In what direction lies Mr. Tarkington 's future ? Is he likely to become more than a popular writer ? What , if any , elements of enduring value do you find in his work ? 5 . What " Hoosier " elements do you find in his work ? Compare him with Ade , Riley , Nicholson , and with the older writers of Indiana , Edward Eggleston , and Maurice Thompson .

Mrs. Wharton is a society woman and a great lover of outdoors and of animals . Chevalier of the Legion of Honor of France . SUGGESTIONS FOR READING 1 . Mrs. Wharton 's friendship with Henry James and the derivation of her methods from his suggest an interesting comparison of the work of these two writers . For this comparison , books treating of similar material should be chosen ; for example , Mrs. Wharton 's The Custom of the Country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lady or The Ambassadors . The result will show that Mrs. Wharton , having an essentially different type of mind , has worked out an interesting set of variations of Mr. James 's method . 2 . Mrs. Wharton 's novels of American social life should be studied and judged separately from her Italian historical novel ( The Valley of Decision ) and from her New England stories , Ethan Frome and Summer . 3 . Two special phases of Mrs. Wharton 's work which call for study are her management of supernatural effects in some of her short stories and her use of satire . 4 . Her short stories offer a basis of comparison with those of Mrs. Gerould ( q.v. ) , another disciple of Mr. James . 5 . Has Mrs. Wharton enough originality and enough distinction to hold a permanent high place as a novelist of American manners ? 6 . Use the following criticisms by Mr. Carl Van Doren as the basis of a critical judgment of your own . Decide whether he is in all respects right : From the first Mrs. Wharton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction the circumstances of a compact community in a way that illustrates the various oppressions which such communities put upon individual vagaries , whether viewed as sin , or ignorance , or folly , or merely as social impossibility . She has always been singularly unpartisan , as if she recognized it as no duty of hers to do more for the herd or its members than to play over the spectacle of their clashes the long , cold light of her magnificent irony . It is only in these moments of satire that Mrs. Wharton reveals much about her disposition : her impatience of stupidity and affectation and muddy confusion of mind and purpose ; her dislike of dinginess ; her toleration of arrogance when it is high-bred . Such qualities do not help her , for all her spare , clean movement , to achieve the march or rush of narrative ; such qualities , for all her satiric pungency , do not bring her into sympathy with the sturdy or burly or homely , or with the broader aspects of comedy .... So great is her self-possession that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chosen circles hold the barbarians . If she had a little less of this pride of dignity she might perhaps avoid her tendency to assign to decorum a larger power than it actually exercises , even in the societies about which she writes .... The illusion of reality in her work , however , almost never fails her , so alertly is her mind on the lookout to avoid vulgar or shoddy romantic elements .
