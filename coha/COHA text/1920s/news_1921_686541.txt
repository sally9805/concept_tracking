txt Bookings of General Electric Go . are still maintaining a rate equal to about 603/4 of plant capacity . This is approximately the average rate of incoming orders since the first of the year . There has been no appreciable change within the last month . Billings are still considerably above bookings , but are being shaded on ' gradually as long as there is no improvement of buying in sight . At the end of last year General ElCctric had $111,000,000 unfilled orders on its hooks . It is necessary to keep from $50.000,000 to $60,000.000 unfilled orders at all times . There was thus a margin of slightly over $50,000,000 at the beginning of the year against which the company could ' operate over its bookings rate . A considerable part of this margin has been worked off . Production will probably continue to be diminished gradually until the rate of bookings picks up , as capacity operation would exhaust the margin of unfinished - orders before many more months have elapsed .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
