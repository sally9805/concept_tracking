The Miraflores locks are in ruins , the Gatun spillways are broken , Gatun Lake is drained , the Panama Canal is dry land once more , our fleet is divided and our Pacific Coast is at the mercy of the " Black " Navy . These are the hypothetical results of the battle maneuvers of our fleet in the Pacific . The United Stales fleet under command of Admiral Jones put the Canal defenses to the most severe test possible and discovered weakness . The story of the attack was this : The fleet divided into a " Blue " fleet defending the canal and a " Black " or " enemy " fleet attacking . It was assumed that strained relations existed between the " Black " government and the United States , and that the condition was further aggravated by the Black fleet cruising off the Pacific Coast , while the greater part of the Blue or United States fleet was being hastily overhauled in the Atlantic navy yards . The Black fleet , under Admiral Eberle , after refueling at the Galapagos Islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lower California . En route it received orders to attack the Canal without waiting for a declaration of war . Vice Admiral McDonald , in command of the Blue defending fleet , which had been hurried through the Canal to the Pacific , tried to locate the Black fleet , but because of a lack of scout cruisers , was unable to do so . The Black fleet slipped into Culebra Gulf , Costa Rica , without his knowledge . From there , Black aeroplanes made a quick 385-mile flight to the Atlantic end of the Canal . No defending aeroplanes were at hand and the Gatun Spillway was blown to pieces by an avalanche of bombs . Then south from Culebra came the Black fleet , driving the Blue fleet before it down the Pacific Coast . Panama Bay was swept of mines and the Blacks proceeded to the bombardment . Laying down a smoke screen , the Black fleet battered the land batteries with its fourteen-inch guns from a range of 30,000 yards-5,000 yards beyond the range of the forts . Then , drawing closer , it destroyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen-inch guns concentrated on the forts . The destruction was complete . The Canal lay useless .
