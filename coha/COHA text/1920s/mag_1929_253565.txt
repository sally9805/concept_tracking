Recently the Metropolitan Museum announced an auction sale of paintings no longer deemed worthy of wall space . Last week the euphemistically-termed " surplus " art was sold . The highest price was $3,500 , paid by Circusman John Ringling for Hans Makart 's Diana 's Hunting Party , a giant canvas ( 15 by 32 feet ) , garish and breezy as a circus poster . This will hang in Mr. Ringling 's sunny , spacious museum at Sarasota , Fla . For more than 100 pieces the museum received $53,442 . Meticulous connoisseurs called it sheer profit , good riddance .
