IT IS the common man 's way to destroy what he can not understand . In that giant composite common man we call our civilization , ignorance , not content with simple destruction , sometimes gives rise to a blinding con ? tempt . We are scornful of alien cul ? tures . The religions of our farther neighbors seem at best childish relics , at worst , impertinences which must be punished . Magic , that strange far thing of the forests , has been utterly dismissed from consideration . It has mattered to no one that in the jungles of Africa for ten thousand years a whole race of mortals held magic to be their wisest and most precious possession . Now , it is late . The black tribes of Africa are tired . Our force and our scorn have more than half convinced them that all the things which are not ours are lies . They themselves have let the old memories grow dim , and the magi ? cian 's craft is no longer commonplace . But it is never too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . . . . Many men of intelligence who have lived and traveled along the steaming western coast of Africa , who have seen manifestations of the black men 's magic and heard still more of them , have asked a question which they think is worth an answer . They doubt the accepted cer ? tainty . They consider the possibility that perhaps what we call " voodoo " may be a science , a literal , marvellous thing the jungle men have adventuredfar in , even a technic and secret knowl ? edge which we might find useful if we could understand it . Magic , among the negro tribesmen of West Africa , seems to include a variety of practices . Under the heading , first of all , comes their science of healing . Closely allied to therapy , then branching off into innumerable other departments , is hypnotism . Then comes telepathy ? which the witchmen seem to have lifted to the status of a literal , teachable technic . And lastly there is that wholly mysterious craft which deals with man 's transmutation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , night , and wind . All men since the beginning have ex ? perimented with medicines and methods for combating disease . Judging by the healthiness of the people of African forest towns to-day ( a condition surely not due to the salubrity of the equatorial climate ! ) , negro medicine men have done as well as white ones . Pneumonia , half a dozen unpleasant sorts of fever , and a long list of complaints our medical sci ? ence scarcely has names for , do , as a matter of fact , occur fairly frequently among the forest tribesmen . But the witchmen know the properties of herbs , they know the virtues of sweating , mud packs , and hydro-therapy ; and they effect cures with astonishing rapidity . Ceremony and ritual , contrary to ordinary belief , rarely accompany these cures . They are performed with rather less ostentation than an American doctor displays when he gathers his eyebrows profoundly , purses his lips , and writes a hieroglyphic prescription for bicarbo ? nate of soda . Sometimes . however , be ? cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's attitude of mind , he brings his hypnotic skill into play . Then mystery accumulates . A few years ago an educated young negro of American descent who lives in Monrovia , the capital of the Republic of Liberia , was approached by a native witchdoctor from a village a short dis ? tance back in the bush . The young man had been born blind , and the witchman offered to cure him . The native waited for an auspicious moon-phase , then began his treatment . The young man was brought secretly each night to his hut , where the friends who escorted him left him . He was dosed internally with various brews , his blind eyes were packed with herbs and mud mixed with the witchman 's spittle , and each dawn when the night 's treatment ended the young man was warned that he must reveal no detail of the procedure and , above all , not mention to anyone the old man 's name , his secret , magic name , not his common one . If he disobeyed , his sight would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magician had predicted , his vision came back . The young Mon ? rovian saw for the first time in his life . But , so the story runs , in his enthusiasm he told his grateful wife the details of his cure and spoke the witchman 's secret name . The next morning he was blind again . The case seems well authenticated . Something of the sort certainly occurred . But why should the native 's threat have been so immediately fulfilled and for what reason ? The obstinate skeptics in the European colony of Monrovia suggested that it was just a " tempo ? rary " cure ( of permanent blindness ) and that obviously failing to keep a secret had nothing to do with it . Skepticism is inconclusive and easy . Without being too credulous , it seems far more likely that hypnotism played a vital part in the cure , that the patient 's faith , strengthened by the insistent op ? timistic suggestion imparted by the witchdoctor , helped his recovery , and that this faith expired with the realiza ? tion that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , with the revelation of the things he had been instructed not to reveal , the young man lost the hypnotic support of the native 's superior mentality . Deprived of that invisible stimulus , the nerves and tissues that had been building lapsed again . African tribal life rests upon two sup ? ports , the family and the philosophy of fetishism . Both are relevant to the cherishing of mysteries . Among a considerable percentage of West African tribes special professions are hereditary . Fishing , basket-mak ? ing , iron forging , and witchdoctoring are separate crafts that are frequently handed down from father to son ? or from uncle to nephew ? to the exclusion of all others in the village who are not of the same blood . A family 's profession is peculiarly that family 's identity . If trade secrets were too freely disseminated the family which had specialized in one trade since the immemorial past would lose its particular excuse for existence as a unit , would gradually disintegrate and , perhaps if the practice became wide ? spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chaos . The jealous guardianship of family lore applies with double force , naturally , to witchdoctoring , a science that gains much of its influence , as does medical science in the temperate zones , from the high esteem in which the medical man is held . Mystery , the aristocrats of Africa know full well , has a powerful effect on proletarian minds . It is useful . Fur ? thermore , some black tribesmen say the magician 's secrets , philosophically speak ? ing ( and nothing could be more unjust than to deny the African negro 's capacity for profound philosophy ) , are not his to tell , even if he would . Fetish ? ism teaches that all knowledge belongs to the spirits of the jungle , that for man to tell what has been entrusted him by powers and gods beyond himself would be to break an ancient contract , an un ? thinkable dishonor and mistake . Fetishism is perhaps , in its whole ? heartedness , its vitality , and complete democracy , the most taking of all reli ? gious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undying soul . But he thinks it stupid to say all other things are dead . Men and memories persist forever , but so do trees , the wind , and the pale stars that sprinkle the night sky . 4 The African , alone among mortals , suffers from no superiority complex . Nothing in his long experience in one of the most unfriendly environments in the world convinces him that his poor self is the solitary absorption and de ? light of God . He fails hopelessly to see that he , one naked man , is more impor ? tant in the permanent scheme than , say , a tree or an elephant or even a single leaf on a bending reed in the black mud of the marsh . The negro of the forest feels only that man is a partaker in a glorious adventure and that his soul is neither greater nor less than that of any ? thing else in profuse nature ? with one difference . Time , opportunity , and long friend ? ship , say the jungle men , have taught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beyond man , that belongs to the spirits about him . Mutual under-standing has induced the living qualities in trees and shadows and weird things to share their strength with man . . . . It is not the herb itself in the mud pack over the blind man 's eyes that will cure him . It is the living essence , the spirit of the herbs that heals . Therefore , they argue , if knowledge loaned by the jungle to a witchman is repeated by an out ? lander who is not of the jungle and does not love the old gods , it is cheapened , and the herb withdraws its spirit and help , and the mud pack and spittle , deserted by the living qualities of its component parts turns to ? mud , and the cure fails . Therefore , secrecy . There is another reason why high value is set on mystery . Since white aggression began its swarming slaughter over the lands beloved by the blacks they have felt with ever-increasing force that their one last hope for survival is to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the more the African closes in upon himself . They realize ? and state frankly ? that if magic , too , passed into our destroying hands there would be nothing left at all . Often West Coast witebdoctors de ? light to impress a " civilized " visitor with their tricks , tricks that in many eases are the purest hypnotism . A certain Mr. Cooper , whom I know , a resident of Monrovia , was once travel ? ing in the mining regions of French Guinea , in the hills of the Futa Djallon . Like most civilized men in the African bush , he felt it incumbent upon himself to be impressive . His equipment was needlessly large , and his desire for haste and efficiency , he admits , may have pro ? foundly irritated the tribesmen with whom he came in contact . Finally an important chief , who was reputed to be a skilled witchdoctor also , could stand it no longer and called Cooper aside . He took him to a little but on the out ? skirts of the village . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grassy plain . Night was falling and a moon already silvered the plateau . The chief told Cooper to remain alone in the but and keep his eyes fastened on the open space commanded by the window . In a little while he would see something that would repay him . Then the native , with no further explanation , departed . Mr. Cooper , slightly alarmed but pro ? foundly curious , stuck to his post . An hour passed . He grew restless . The sounds in the village behind him faded off into silence . The moonlit plain , save for a thin mist that hung over the grass , was empty . Then , without warning , he heard a furious pounding of hoofs . Twelve white horses appeared from a clump of trees to the left and galloped across the clearing . He could see them plainly . Each horse bore a rider , and each rider was a living man a foot tall . Mr. Cooper stared . His eyes and senses told him the tiny men were unquestion ? ably alive and , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liter ? ally no more than twelve inches from crown to heel . They moved to the rhythm of the gallop , and their small shouting came faintly to him . In a moment the twelve horses disappeared in the white accumulated mist of dis ? tance , and the startled watcher heard a sound of splashing as if they ran through a deep river ford , though he knew there was no considerable stream within many miles . Another moment and he saw them again . The horses charged back the way they had conic . This time the mounted men were negroes of almost giant stature , fully accoutered and bearing gleaming lances , as had the pygmies before them . They too shouted , but their voices were loud and booming . The twelve white horses dis ? appeared , and the traveler heard a low laugh behind him . The chief had joined him , but to Cooper 's questions granted only an enigmatic smile . The show , though purposeless , had been impressive , and that was all the witchman had desired . Apparently many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? quently evidenced by the fakirs of Brit ? ish India of hypnotizing groups of people without setting or preparation . On one occasion an American mis ? sionary , the Rev. C. H. Bouey , was traveling with some friends in the Libe ? rian interior not far from the little port of Cape Mount . The party rested in a native town during the day 's march , and Bouey fell into conversation with an old black man who sat by his mud house in the sun , a rather ragged , very silent old man of no visible distinction . Bouey in the course of the talk remarked that to his great disappointment he had never chanced to see wild elephants in Liberia , though he had lived in supposed elephant country for many years . The old man pointed , and Bouey and the men with him turned . The village where they rested stood in the center of a clearing of considerable size . At the edge of the wood two hundred yards away they saw the most superb of spec ? tacles , a herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging at the tender tops of palm trees . Several babies stumbled close under their moth ? ers . The cracking of the branches , the ponderous rasping of the great bodies against the trunks , and the loud blowing of the tuskers assailed the ears of the astonished men with vivid distinctness . This , they thought , was a coincidence as thrilling as it was curious . They turned to the old man . He still sat on the ground and had not spoken . He smiled and pointed again . They looked , and the place was empty . Palms leaned slowly in the feeble breeze , and the yel ? low equatorial sun illumined with crude brilliance the bare earth , the clumps of dry grass , and the mounting green wall where the jungle began . But of the elephants there was no trace . Bouey had marked a particular tree he had watched one of the bulls demolish . He ran over to it , and the traders and mis ? sionaries of his party came with him , all of them convinced there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground had not been trampled . The whole show had been an illusion . The gentlemen compared notes . All had seen exactly the same thing , down to the smallest circumstantial detail . The witchdoctor , as usual , vouchsafed no explanation . . . . But it is hard to bold a revival meeting in a town where one has just seen a non-existent herd of African elephants . There is perhaps nothing genuinely magic , i.e. inexplicable , in either cure of disease or hypnotism . But telepathy ? still for want of a better word ? as prac ? ticed in West Africa attains reaches of sheer marvel that defy explaining , surely until we have learned far more limn we at present understand . The most straightforward and corn-non telepathy in the jungles that march larkly back from the sea has been wit ? iessed by nearly every white traveler who has gone back among the hidden , owns where Africa 's identity still str ? ives : namely , the uncanny prewarning a visitor 's approach relayed invisibly rom one witchdoctor to another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions , special messengers . In ? ontestably , however , many natives can Leliberately convey by mental projec ? ion the most elaborate and minute letails of an event of importance or of a oerson for whose arrival preparations re to be made . A witchdoctor , or any use man , " sends , " and another witch-tan five or thirty or a hundred miles way " receives , " perhaps to send again trther on . Explorers , and especially ; aders of punitive expeditions , have ad innumerable proofs of this power . n African village is rarely surprised . he magicians admit the gift , see noth ? ig extraordinary in it and , what is lost intriguing , say it can be taught any intelligent pupil .. . but never , course , to a white man . Another common but far more in ? Jlved and curious manifestation of telepathic powers is displayed by the black sorcerers in the finding of lost objects , a procedure in which success depends , so far as one can see , upon the practitioner 's ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps he has never seen , who in any ease is unwilling to " send " or have his private knowledge " received . " There is one fairly conventional pro ? cedure . A single specific case is similar in its essentials to all the many instances one hears on the Coast ? from European sources more often than native . Not long ago an English wild-rubber buyer traveling in the Liberian forest lost a tin dispatch box containing busi ? ness papers of great importance , though nothing of intrinsic value . It disap ? peared in the course of a day 's march , he believed , though he did not discover his loss until he unpacked at a native town where he planned to camp for the night . The trader made inquiries , catechized his carriers , went back the way he had come , searched the trail , and found nothing . Then , despairing , he con ? tinued his way to the coast . The box had evidently been stolen . It was triply aggravating to realize its contents would be entirely useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English friend . They talked the case over and at last , in a somewhat embarrassed fashion , the friend suggested that they consult a certain educated witchdoctor ( a by no means uncommon phenomenon ) who lived nearby and had a high local repu ? tation as a telepathic detective . The magician was produced . He proved to be a frock-coated , bespectacled negro with a broad British accent and a sound knowledge of the classics , who had not , however , in the course of his educa ? tion seen any reason to go renegade to the old faiths of his people . The matter of the lost box was put before him , and he agreed to find it . He stipulated that he would have to be taken to the district where the loss had occurred . The rubber collector , unwilling to let any chance escape ( for a year 's accounts are important ) , agreed to the conditions , and a price , to be paid only in case of success , was fixed . Together they walked for three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered his loss . After they had rested , the witchdoctor consulted with the headman of the town , and soon after the whole adult population foregathered in the central dirt clearing surrounded by the round thatched huts . It was mid ? morning and the sun relentless . The old man removed his frock coat , laid it tenderly aside , and rolled up his sleeves . He then instructed one of the bystanders to build a small fire and find an iron pot . In a few minutes the fire was going and the pot suspended over it simmering with a brew composed of earth , palm oil , and a packet of dried herbs brought by the witchdoctor from the coast . The old man squatted morosely on the ground , and the townspeople , uneasy and interested , formed a circle around him . When the pot began to bubble he beckoned to a young man who stood near him . Apparently without the re ? motest possibility of prearrangement , he had selected his " subject . " The boy squatted beside him and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes for a moment . Then they both stood up . The witchman lifted the hot iron pot from the fire and placed it on the sub ? ject 's head . Neither seemed to feel the heat ? though it was obviously sufficient to sear flesh . With methodic slowness the old man then proceeded , first grip ? ping the boy 's hands firmly over the pot 's rim , to smear his face with the sim ? mering mixture . As it cooled it hard ? ened and the thickening paste apparently sealed the youth 's eyes , nostrils , and mouth . The movement of his breathing was no longer discernible . Naked ex ? cept for a loin cloth , he stood as quiescent and still as a black painted figure on a sarcophagus . The old man began to talk , and as he spoke the youth holding the pot began to sway . The words were in a language no one understood , but there was no mis ? taking the fiercely exciting emotionalism of their utterance . The invocation ceased with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran threc times around the ring of spectators anc on the third round brought the pot dowr with a vicious side swipe on the head o : a hitherto inconspicuous negro man it the crowd . As the victim fell ruoanin to the ground the pot bearer started a a run toward the nearby woods , the witchdoctor , half the town , and the ap palled English rubber trader at his heels He plunged into the bush , stumbled , fel headlong , tore his skin on briars , ca reeved full into tree trunks ? and kep on . Some of the more agile kept abreas of him and helped to clear the path h. followed . The performance had been in th blazing noon of a humid equatorial day and soon the Englishman was limp fron exhaustion . But for three interminable mad hours curiosity kept him going . A last the boy , still in a state of trance an . now fainting from exhaustion , fell pro : trate over a log at the edge of a swam and did not get up . Under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch box . The perspiring magician retrieved and with a great " I-told-you-so " a presented it to the Englishman . Th lock had been forced but the paper though damp , were intact . Later the rubber merchant mem strutted the story . The man who ha been struck with the pot was the thie as he immediately confessed on the return to the village . He had stolen ti box not during the day 's march , as tl Englishman had thought , but from h luggage a few minutes after his arriv in the town . He had thought the lx contained money , but on discovering h mistake , he had taken it with him a fe days later on a hunt and tossed it into tl remote swamp where it was found . A detail which impressed the Englis man was that the " subject " had ri toward the coast in his search for tl box ? in other words , directly away from the general region where the box had supposedly disappeared . The path he had taken had ignored all known trails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had run in an uncannily straight line directly to the box . The thief , the witchdoctor , and the " subject " all denied collusion . The witchdoctor did not , as a matter of fact , speak the language of the tribesmen of the village , nor did they speak his . To the Englishman 's queries he replied with the empty word he had learned from the white men magic . The most baffling , exotic , and wholly mbelievable aspect of the magic craft s zolknorphism , the belief that men can - ; onvert their bodies into animal forms , ; a through with an adventure and then , ) y simple willing , shift back to mortal : hape . Zotimorphism has yet to be ; eriously investigated ? for obvious rea ? sons . European and American an ? hropologists , followers of the most ) itifully conceited of all sciences , have eft that a decided shame attaches to anyone who even admits to curiosity in Lnything so palpably impossible . It is n ancient attitude and an unprofitable ine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , stories of zoismorphistic , henomena persist . Hard-minded Brit-3h colonial officials have put themselves n record as having seen black men turn o lions before their eyes . And there is he account of how a reverend bishop nee spent a night of terror in a town hat was raided by a herd of leopards. n bright moonlight , the bishop said , the ! opard pack came down upon the vil ? tge , made its streets a bloody night ? lare , killed and carried off certain men , nd then disappeared once more into the arkness of the forest . This much the ishop swears he saw . To what he saw e added two things he knew , first , that ie very men who were killed had been warned beforehand that they had in ? curred the fatal anger of the secret society of the Human Leopards ? a zodmorphistic sect ; and secondly , he knew , as everyone knows , that the African leopard is a solitary beast that never goes in packs . But that night he saw and smelled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . Possibly zoomorphism comes under the head of hypnotism . Possibly not . The dark gigantic forests still hide many things we are too young to understand . All African magic has its root in the ancient friendship of the jungle man for the brooding , dangerous and lovely world in which he lives . If one under ? stands , the witchmen say , and under ? standing , loves , then all living things will be one 's partners in the search for knowledge . Nowhere is this attitude better demonstrated than in the prac ? tices of the krajio of the Emu tribe that makes its home near the coast regions of Liberia and southern Sierra Leone . Krajio is an expressive word . To translate it " witchdoctor " is to do it scant justice . Literally kra means soul , shadow , spirit , or any everlasting quality , Jio means to play or experiment . So a krajio is " one who plays with the ever ? lasting qualities . " The krajio of the Liberian coast , though they are adept in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophecy which is peculiar to themselves ? tree-talking . " In childhood the most intelligent boys of a krajio family are apprenticed to elderly relatives . Through years of single devotion they study the tradi ? tional lore of their science , assist at demonstrations and ceremonials , and all the time cultivate a very human , though to us incomprehensible friendship , with a certain tree . Any tree of any species will do , though usually a tree in some remote , untrou ? bled part of the woods is favored . As often as circumstances permit , the young witchdoetor goes to his tree , at first with a master , later alone . He studies it in all moods and all weathers . He watches the fall and growth of leaves , the slow writhing of twigs that grow at last to branches , observes its lashing in hurricane winds and the way the heavy rains revive it . And soon he learns its language , and tree and man talk to ? gether . This language of the trees is a subtle thing , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a spoken language , for whoever heard a tree make human sounds ? No , it is a language of pale whisperings of wind , of faint gesturings , and essentially , one of spirit . When krajio and tree are in tune both can keep their silence and both can understand what the other says . No one knows all the precious secrets that they share , but one may assume safely that all they say is wise . Trees , you see , are the oldest things in the world . They are the giant sentinels , the very substance , form , and shape of the im ? mortal jungle . So it is natural to think they have garnered profound wisdom from the years past , and , since in the unchanging woods past , future , and pres ? ent all seem much the same , the trees can envision times when babes unborn will be old men . That is what the krajio believe , believe with the sim ? plicity and faith and literalness of sages . Occasionally in times of stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees have revealed to them . Two years ago , when an American rubber company was negotiating for a large tract of Liberian land , a matter of paramount importance to native as well as civilized Liberians , a krajio of the Krus called upon a high official of the State Department and told him that his tree had revealed to him the name of the man who was to come to Liberia to com ? plete the details of the agreement . The official was sufficiently curious to write out the prophecy , have it witnessed and dated , and file it away . Four months later the American arrived . His name , the date of his arrival , and the proposals he made , which he fondly thought were secret , checked perfectly with the kra ? jio 's statement . A comparison of dates proved that the krajio had put himself on record several weeks before the plenipotentiary received his appointment in the American middle-west , six thou ? sand miles away , and long before the date of his arrival or the proposals he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feat . His tree had told him , he said simply . . . . No one can explain magic . The white man 's attitude toward the African is too well-known to make for mutual confi ? dences . Unquestionably , however , it is the sheerest stupidity to dismiss it all with that contemptuous term " super stition . " Superstition does n't eves work , and magic very often does .
