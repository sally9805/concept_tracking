On Tuesday , March 26 , came the biggest stock market crash in Coolidge-Hoover history . For a week the market had been unquiet and harassed . Beginning with Wednesday , March 20 , the market had registered falling prices , small recessions every day . <P> On Monday , when the market reopened , speculators were nervous-their biggest bugaboo , the Federal Reserve Board , was to meet that afternoon . The usual Monday morning rally , produced by the accumulation of buying-orders during the weekend , failed to come . Call money was renewed at 9% . The rush of selling began . The bears pressed hot on the heels of their enemy ; amateur speculators took flight and fled . Pool and investment houses which had been boosting favorites acknowledged the stampede , stepped aside to let it pass . The money rate went to 14% , the highest in nine years . At the close , many industrial stocks were down nine points or more . <P> The banks had withdrawn 25 million dollars from the market , a mere bagatelle , less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market . The Federal Reserve Board had adjourned without speaking . The drop had been severe , but not quite so severe as the drop on December 6 and February 7 . It would soon be time , the market said , for the shorts to take their profit , for bargain hunters to appear . <P> The next day ( March 26 ) money opened not at 9% , but at 12% . It rose to 15% , exceeding the previous day 's high . Another and a greater selling wave set in-especially in coppers . The amateurs fled even faster than the day before and hundreds who did not flee were sold out , adding to the casualties . And money still rose , up , up , to 20% . <P> Total number of shares sold was 8,246,740-far greater than on any previous day . At its close came a sharp rally-some stocks closing higher than they began . Had the Federal Reserve won its battle to check speculation ?
