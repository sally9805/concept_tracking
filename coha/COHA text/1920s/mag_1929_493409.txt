tion of war . At this point the reader may inquire whether this proposal is merely the cloistered wis ? dom which Liberals exchange in their impotent seclusion , or is a policy which any government dare propose . The answer is plain and direct . This policy will be proposed at the . Five-Power Conference . The question is rather : will the British and American governments dare to reject it ? For it is the inten ? tion of France to propose it , and one can hear in advance the eloquence of M. Briand 's oration . It will be , of course , her answer to the Anglo-Ameri ? can suggestion for the abandonment of submarines . It will cost France nothing , and it will make an ef ? fective retort . Doubtless , M. Briand expects us to reject it . He will then keep his submarines with a clear conscience , and the Conference will end in stalemate . But can America , after Mr. Hoover 's offer to go " as low as others will go , " reject it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ac ? cepts ? My sober belief is that it wants only such a measure of courage as is within the compass of the practical politician , to adopt this radical policy , Years of expert skepticism as to the utility of the battleship have prepared public opinion for it , and even The London Times consents to print the able articles of Admiral Richmond , in which he argues that we require no warships over 10,000 tons . This immense advance towards a disarmed world is within our reach . If we would be wise , let us for once affect to be simple . The proposal may be nothing but a tactical maneuver . Let us be blind to its subtlety , and welcome it in all its literalness . I KNOW a lot of tough-minded farmers and orchardists out in California , and they are ask ? ing pregnant questions about federal farm re ? lief . Granted that they have been hornswoggled and frustrated so often that they would ask ques ? tions about any gift horse , still in this case their questions seem pertinent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Farm Board , with $500 , ? 000,000 to loan as it sees fit , has interpreted the new Farm Relief Act in a certain way , and by that interpretation has undertaken to stimulate , require and even demand the existence of cooperatives , tech ? nically grower-owned , for the marketing of crops . Chairman Legge says : " The funds entrusted to the care of the Board will be administered for the pur ? pose of carrying out its program , of which the central thought will be the strengthening of the cooperative movement . " The Board , under him , is manned with coOperative veterans . You belong to a coOperative of which this Board approves , or you get none of the federal farm-aid money , with its easy terms of interest and repayment . Well and good . It strikes a splendid note . We all are sold on the proposition that a thorough ? going cooperative structure would be the redemp ? tion of agriculture . What about the method ? A man of long experience in cooperative organization who is himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local coOperative , said to me of the Farm Board 's policy , before a single loan had been made : " That 's a hell of a way to upbuild cooperation 1 What we shall get will be the coOperative shape , not the substance . Cooperation bribed into the farmer from above wo n't last . In the end , this will set back the American coOperative movement another twenty years . " Was he right ? . Another veteran in progressive agricultural causes explained : " What people fail to see is that there are true and there are false cooperatives . The false ones are the worst enemies of the true . My guess is that the false cooperatives will have first call on the Farm Board 's money , and the true ones will continue to struggle along by themselves . Why ? Because the false ones will have all the banking influence . This $500,000,000 of easy-term federal money is the banks ' best chance to get rid of bad debts , or , con ? versely , to build up their chosen - friends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's bank relief . " Many readers will regard these opinions as ex , treme . However , let us consider one of the first of the great loans advanced by the Farm Board . The very first , as will be recalled , was $300,000 advanced to fight the fruit fly in Florida . The second , to which I refer , was a loan , or series of loans , totaling nearly $12,000,000 , to the grape in ? industry of California . It began one week-end , with the announcement that the Farm Board , together with three banks , had advanced $9,000,000 to the Sun-Maid Raisin Association . Now , the grape in ? industry , hit hard by federal prohibition , needs federal help . Were there , then , parades of re , joicing farmers all up and down the grape belt ? There were not . What happened was that the growers in several towns immediately held meetings of protest . In two raisin centers , they actually organized and pledged defense funds to be used if lawsuits should arise from their refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool " of raisin-grape growers published paid advertisements in the news . papers , declaring that its tonnage would not under the circumstances be sold to Sun-Maid . The first act of farm relief had brought a farmers ' strikel December 25 , 1929 THE NEW And the strike spread . Two weeks or so later , when the Board offered a second credit of $750,000 to the fresh-grape side of the industry , provided the growers would organize and put up $500,000 of their own for stabilization , it led to meetings all up and down the state . Five of these meetings I attended . As a matter of public record , the farm ? ers adopted resolutions favoring and accepting the offer ? then , individually , flatly declined to put up the required collateral . The really significant talk at the meetings occurred before , in the wash ? rooms , and afterwards . Men said ? many said it , and I heard them ? " That is n't farm relief ? that 's bank relief . " The phrase went all up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partici ? pate was abandoned ? rejected . And it was all be ? cause the growers believed that the first big loan , the one to Sun-Maid , was really a hand-out to the banks . That concern has outstanding a $5,000,000 bond issue floated by Dillon , Read and Company , and was indebted to certain banks for lesser sums . It is a coOperative , but many growers who do not regard it as being any longer under grower-control , have gradually withdrawn , until its one-time 90 per ? cent raisin monopoly has shrunk to about 40 per ? cent . The Farm Board , seeking , and perhaps rightly , to lift it , had picked up a hot iron . The situation is one to think about . Thinking about it , one wonders whether the two men quoted above really hit the nail on the head . Verbalism is our common curse , in American eco ? nomics no less than in politics . In California ? and this is probably true throughout the nation ? the coOperatives fall into two general classes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? operatives , and the big , state-wide or crop-wide , stridently influential , " overhead " cooperatives that gather together the output of the component locals and carry them a step or so onward towards the consumer . Nothing in the American industrial scene can be much finer than the former . These beautiful , model fruit-packing houses , creameries , olive-processing plants , nut-grading establishments ? owned by the surrounding growers , built by their cash and their credit , run by their elected leaders , managed , like as not , by a home-raised manager who grew up with the plant , went to the university and came back to give his skill to his neighbors ? these are indeed coOperatives , these show participation ; they have grown out of the community life and are psychological structures as well as factories . One can not always apply the superficial test of cash profits ? farming itself is n't prosperous , there are ups and downs in management ? but , at least , such structures do not go to pieces when hard times come , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their members than the com ? peting commercial concerns . They pack goods of a high quality . They work . REPUBLIC I. ? 1- , But the moment we go higher , into the showy " overhead " cooperatives , we find trouble . Some ? thing disappears , something else comes in . These super-organizations often do n't stay true . Again , there are exceptions , but the tendency is clear : the titular heads of these big concerns become farmer-kings , agricultural higher-ups . They hobnob with bank presidents , railroad presidents and all that ; their hired managers are wooed by bank-department heads and traffic superintendents and lumber-com ? pany agents and the representatives of the East ? ern produce-auctions . If they ever had the grower point of view , they incline to lose it , and if co ? operatives must be coOperative , these huge concerns show about as much " control from below " as Dodge Brothers . They were not started from below . They did not grow up from the local cooperatives ; they were put down on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these " higher-up " farm groups were state-organized . Always political , they now control agricultural legislation . Last spring they fought , and killed , legislation for State certification of quality ; they emasculated legislation for State aid in market-expansion . In so doing , they fought side by side with the powerful ? and thoroughly private ? cannery combine . Are these cooperatives ? Technically , yes . But they do not even attempt to ' eliminate the middleman . They do not save money for farmer and consumer by establishing coopera ? tively-owned outlets at the great marketing centers in this country or abroad . There are some excep ? tions , like the dairy group . However , the great bulk of perishables and semi-perishables which the " overhead " coOperatives take over from their fine little member-cooperatives are simply loaded aboard the cars , hauled East , and turned over for sale to the commercial auction companies ? dis ? tinctly racket-like concerns ? where the price to the farmer is directly ' determined by the bidding of private jobbers , and where cooperatively packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering that very loss of identity which it is the whole purpose of the coOperative movement to avoid . The coOperative control , in brief , is abandoned part-way to the consumer . Whether such kingly and reactionary concerns , none too favorable to the grower , are to figure in the foreground of farm relief and get the larger share of Farm Board money , only the event can determine . It is certainly something to watch for , as the farmers in California are watching . Whether , narrowing it down , those doubly influential " over ? head " coOperatives that are deeply in debt to the banks will now have these debts transferred to the federal government , with a saving of perhaps half the interest rate to the debtor concern as its sole gain , and a great rejoicing in banking circles over the liquidation of their most worrisome frozen assets , again the event will determine . Any real strengthening of the coOperative movement ' would have to be much more constructive than that . Since the local cooperatives must of course have joint structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be feasible for the Farm Board to determine , before advancing its loans , whether any such joint stricture has remained a genuine servant or whether it has become mani ? pulator and king . Control from below and sincere response to grower membership and grower needs are the psychological essentials of . the true coopera ? tive . On paper , there may be no distinction . Still , there is one practical test : the true cooperative would control its goods as near to the consumer 's December 23,192g back doorstep as possible , and would ceaselessty , work to get nearer . Under no circumstances would it admit the influence of private auctions or can . neries or jobbers , or the bankers thereof , and so leave its duty to grower and consumer half-done , If these essentials can be obtained through what my friend termed a " bribe from above , " then ail new federal policy will be a permanent national gain . But , if the use of this $500,000,000 be only such as to cement and strengthen a selfish farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bg pleased . S I PREDICTED two years ago , th-e California Legislature recently putbMrs . Aimee Semple McPherson on the rack in a final effort to make her confess adultery . Sister had confounded the Babbitts of Southern California , their police , their newspapers , their courts , their clergy , and thousands of voluntary snoopers . This grand final trap was known as the impeachment trial of Superior Judge Carlos S. Hardy . The jurist , however , was only a ventriloquist 's dummy . He had demonstrated his unfitness for the bench by his conduct in the Hickman trial ; the American Bar Association had expelled him ; his " acquittal " was a foregone conclusion . No one was interested in Hardy . He was just Exhibit A , displayed to prove that IVIrs . McPherson exerted a sinister influence over Big Men , as well as over obvious morons . The campaign against her was never an effort to expose mountebankery in terms of sense . It was simply an under-cover attempt to suppress her ? and later an open civic crusade to punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The efforts to suppress her began in 1923 , with sniping and sowing of discord at Angelus Temple , when the clergy , the boosters , the civic-pride patriots and the new esthetes began to realize that Mrs. McPherson , by her success , was making a laughing stock out of Los Angeles in the eyes of the civilized world . She was a magnet , drawing to her the moronic , the bucolic , the sick , the aged ? and a whole army of former back-East Christians who , growing mel ? lowed in the warm sunshine of Paradise , were turn ? ing against the Hell-fire religion under which they , had quaked all their lives . Angelus Temple was a mirror , reflecting the mentality of a multitude of tax payers and legal voters . The under-cover efforts to put down Aimee went on for three years . The open crusade against her started in the summer of 1926 , when Sister ' disappeared in the Pacific Ocean and re-appeared thirty-two days later at Agua Prieta , Mexico , with her kidnapping story , .
