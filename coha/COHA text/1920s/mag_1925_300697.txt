Recently Parisians added a new and delectable connotation to one of the most famous of French names , Curie . In the world 's eye this name conjures up the image of an austere , almost emaciated woman , Mme. Marie Curie , famed co-discoverer of radium . Last week an appreciative concert audience packed the Salle des Agricultures while the youngest ( 20-year-old ) daughter of the great scientist made her dbut as a pianist . <P> Mlle. Eva Curie , it was shortly revealed , is delicately fleshed and possessed of an attractive figure set off by a striking head of jet black hair . She appeared in a low-cut black satin gown , to which was pinned a single scarlet rose . For two hours she rendered with admirable technique and expression a program including selections from Bach , Chopin , Faure , Saint-Sans , Beethoven . Paris was momentarily charmed .
