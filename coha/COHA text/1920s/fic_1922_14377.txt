The curtain rises on a high-ceiled , oblong room apparently of stone and darkened , save for the soft afternoon light that comes in through a tiny barred window high up in the wall at the rear . In the center of the room sits a man dressed in loose fitting hospital ward clothes , with his elbows resting on his knees , and his chin propped up on his hands . The features of his face are indiscernable , but from the contour of his head and shoulders outlined against the light , one would say that he is a young man somewhat past thirty . A dimly seen bed at the left rear completes the furniture of the bleak room . At the right front is a door that opens into the corridor . This is cell number 38 in the State Insane Asylum . It is late afternoon in March . Through the little square window can be seen the swelling tips of maple twigs perfectly still against the glow of the setting sun . From the hedge outside come the notes of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other than the birds ' notes , there is no sound to break the complete stillness of the passing day . This is one of those queer calms that often come near night in March ; when the winds have blown all day , just before the sun goes down they let things be . One can almost feel the stillness . Night will fall soon . The sounds of footsteps are heard coming along the corridor outside . The man raises his head quickly , listening intently . The steps pass by . He relapses into his former position . There is nothing about his actions to show that he is nervous , despairing or beaten . Rather , as he sits staring into the shadows he might be Rodin 's Thinker or a man with a mighty purpose caged by change behind the unheeding thicknesses of stone walls . Or , too , he might be brooding on some wrong he would make right for his fellowman , when his deliverance from a life of stone should come . In the State hospital for the Insane an inmate may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to spring again and repeating many times , arrive where he can sit resolutely , chin in hand listening calmly for footsteps he has waited years to hear . The door is opened almost silently , and a young woman about twenty-six or seven , fashionably dressed , enters . The man sits bolt upright for an instant and then relapses into an easy posture , still looking straight before him . The woman stands timorously holding to the grating of the half-closed door behind her . There is light enough in the room to disclose the fact that she is exceedingly beautiful . From all appearances she is a society woman , one of the petted type . And evidently for her , life is a round of dinner parties , theatre-going and delirious balls . She might have no ambition higher than taking care of her own beautiful body and humoring its desires . One knows her kind . Or she might have had ambition to do great things . She might have dreams . Who knows ? It is easy to be fooled in this world.1 For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking towards the door , says quietly and in a pleasant voice , firm and even . FRANK Is that you , Marie ? p. 3 MARIE hesitating.Yes . FRANK stretching his arms indefinitely toward her . I 've been expecting you . MARIE hiding her face.Do n't ! Do n't look at me . Do n't , I shall run away ! The Man lets his arm fall and sits silent in his seat . When he speaks , it is kindly , without bitterness . FRANK I 've been waiting five years . MARIE I received your letter only today.2 FRANK Yes , and all the others I have written every month for four years received  --  MARIE petulantly.No , yes  --  but I  --  FRANK You found your way in all right ? The watchman left the door unlocked ? Genially . He 's done several things for me  --  MARIE Yes , Yes . FRANK Clos the door . There 's no danger here and I shall not look at you . And maybe you would not mind calling me by my name . Abruptly . No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glorious thing is that you are her . Oh , how wonderful ! Something like joy comes into his voice , but it is joy that appears to frighten Marie , for she draws back into the doorway. p. 4 MARIE Yes , oh dear !  --  FRANK coaxingly.Close the door and do n't draw away from me ! Oh , I have starved ! starved ! She impetuously closes the door and moves a few feet away from it towards the man . The man raises his head boyishly . Ah , you still use that faint far-away perfume  --  that wonderful Claire de Lune.3 Oh , the old times ! MARIE putting her hands to her face.Do n't  --  you hurt ! FRANK eagerly.Do I ? He stops . Call me by my name , wo n't you ? MARIE Yes , yes  --  Frank  --  I  --  oh , I do n't know !  --  FRANK with a deep sigh.Five years to wait for that . Silence for a moment . Outside th thrush sings . MARIE bursting out and moving towards the door.Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and this darkness . No wonder people are crazy here  --  oh ! FRANK Do n't leave me ! Marie ! She turns from the door. p. 5 MARIE Well , I 'll stay a little while then , but it 's growing late . Mother 's waiting in the car . I told her I would n't be long . It 's near night . FRANK Yes , it 's near night . It 's growing cold . The west must be almost a pale gray now . But the thrush still sings.4 He sings every year . Did you say it was near night ? Yes , it is near night . Broodingly . And when night coms it is so long . MARIE Yes , I know . FRANK quickly.Do you ? Slowly . Yes , five years is a long night , but a lifetime is longer . Oh , let 's forget it . Tell me about yourself . Tell me about your world . What you do during the long days . Tell me everything . MARIE I ca n't . Oh I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , little girl , do n't notice a blind old  --  MARIE Do n't , Frank . Do n't oh , I shall  --  She bursts into sobs . FRANK calmly . Forget it , dear  --  " Dear . " How strange and sweet that word sounds . Five years ! It almost makes me hope  --  that  --  He bows his head. p. 6 MARIE drying her eyes . After a moment.What ? FRANK It almost makes me hope that I might  --  that I might  --  even touch your hand again ,  --  Why do you cry ? Did I hurt you ? MARIE shuddering and drawing towards the door.No , no . FRANK But I ca n't ask that , I am  --  blind  --  and too horrible . Brightly . But you need n't touch my face , and my hands are smooth . He makes a movement as if to turn towards her . But she cries out . MARIE No ! no ! He turns back in his chair . FRANK Pardon me , dear ; but I am so thoughtless of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be night , and then you 'll let me touch your hand , wo n't you ? 5 MARIE Oh , my God  --  hush ! You 're breaking my heart . FRANK deeply moved.Forget it ! I 've forgiven long ago . I 've had time to think . Time a plenty ! You could n't help it  --  the acid  --  Maybe you did n't know it would blind . I was so careless to leave it open in the laboratory . p. 7 MARIE Please  --  I ca n't stand to think of it any more . Has n't it driven me wild in the hours when there was no one to talk to  --  oh ! FRANK But we were both so happy then , just starting in life together and I wanted you to know the secrets of my work . I was to do great things . We should not have quarreled . It was all in fun , was n't it dear ? Accusingly . But then afterwards you would n't look at me , my face MARIE half sobbing6.Frank  --  FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been so lonely these years . And  --  you never came  --  MARIE half wailing7.Oh , I could n't , I could n't , knowing that I had done it , and they thought it was you yourself who  --  FRANK laughing softly8.Yes , an accident , and then I had to play crazy to get rid of myself  --  But it is n't so bad . Maybe I ought n't to complain . One always has a window . It 's near night , is n't it ? MARIE Yes , and Mamma  --  oh , you are so wonderful ! How could you forgive me ? FRANK interrupting.To play crazy ! Crazy ! And I could have done wonders . Do married ? MARIE after a moment.No. : FRANK It would have bothered you , would n't it ? You should have , you know . You were free . I did n't want to ruin your life because mine was ruined . Has he married yet ? MARIE Who ? Oh  --  no , Frank , do n't ! With a sob she falls on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh you are so good , and noble ! Forgive me , oh forgive me ! For a moment Frank sits motionless and then he begins stroking her hand . Suddenly Marie springs to her feet and stands away from him shuddering . What is it ? I 'm afraid . FRANK Do n't be frightened you little goose . What became of that Tiffany emerald I gave you ? 10 You no longer wear it . Whose ring is that you 're wearing ? MARIE confusedly.I  --  I could n't wear it . I could n't after that had happened . FRANK Oh , I do n't know what I 'm saying , dear . Let 's forget it . Tell me about yourself . Is n't it dark yet ? MARIE looking out of the window and shivering.Nearly , there 's just a faint glow in the sky now . p. 9 FRANK Are the stars out ? and I guess the moon is on the river now . Quickly . But let that wait . Ca n't you tell me of everything , little woman ? I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toz and Jim and all the set we used to run around with ? MARIE Have n't you known ?  --  these years ? Like most people they 're married now , most of them . FRANK Yes , quite naturally , do they ever ask about me ? MARIE Sometimes , but they all FRANK They all think I 'm crazy , do n't they ? MARIE hesitatingly.Yes , Oh , it 's too horrible . What a mess things in this world can get into ! Oh , Frank ! Beginning to sob . FRANK heedlessly continuing.Thought I went crazy and tried to kill myself . Well , that 's what I made them all believe . You never told them your part in it , did you ? MARIE horrified.Oh , how could I !  --  Frank , let me go ! I  --  FRANK Wait , dear , you know I promised I should never ask you to come again . It is too terrible for you , but may I ,  --  may I touch your hands again  --  your face ? You must be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . Oh , I can remember your eyes  --  so deep , so true , and your neck and shoulders , your bare white arms  --  How they shone those evenings when we loved so . And the dances  --  and all  --  To remember it all ! I remember them now as a great sea of gladness  --  those long ago years . Marie starts towards him , but stops. p. 10 MARIE sobbing.Oh , my God , if it had never happened ! FRANK sadly.Do n't cry , do n't . It was n't your fault . But I 've needed you so ! Pushing his hand through his hair . How can I endure it , dear ! Do n't be afraid . Ca n't you come nearer to me . He reaches out and touches her dress ; then he catches her hand , all the while sitting with averted face . She shudders at his touch . Five years to wait for this night and never to have you again . But I want you to know that I forgive you , dear . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . MARIE Please do n't , oh Frank I must go . It 's dark ! FRANK calmly.Then do n't mind if it 's dark . You can not see now , sweet . He fondles her hands . Then he reaches up and brushes his hand across her face . She starts away . Do n't ! please , for this night . Ah , you 're beautiful still  --  so beautiful . And you were all mine once . Please , ca n't you imagine that it is back the way it used to be , before it happened . Make yourself do it and let me be happy once  --  once , for there will never be another time , so sweet  --  for  --  me  --  Stay with me close a minute now and I can mock at these walls forever . p. 11 MARIE O , why ca n't I ? But I ca n't . No ! No ! Let me go ! Frank  --  I 'm afraid . FRANK passionately.You sha n't go  --  you sha n't ! Oh make me happy once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a wave of emotion she leans towards him . Suddenly he sweeps her to him across his lap and holds her to his breast . MARIE half-screaming.Do n't , do n't kiss me ! Oh  --  FRANK reassuringly.No , dear , I sha n't kiss you . Do n't be afraid . Rest now and I 'll let you go presently . Your mother is waiting . Do n't tell her you came to see me . Do n't . Brushing back her hair . What might we have accomplished together ! Your lips ! Your eyes ! Beautiful , beautiful ! Her sobbing ceases after a while and both remain quiet . The last notes of the thrush are heard from the hedge . MARIE moving restlessly.I 've done my best now . You must let me go . I 'm so sorry . Why did it have to happen like this ! Oh  --  In rising terror . Let me go ! It 's dark ! Oh , Frank ! My God ! Sobbing . FRANK sadly.Why did it have to turn out like this ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . I should n't have had the acid open . Do n't worry , dear , you know I forgive you . As he speaks he reaches around her with his left arm and takes both her hands in one. p. 12 MARIE I must go now . Uneasily . What is it , Frank ? FRANK Nothing . I 'm just thinking how I shall dream all my life about this hour . One minute more , please  --  MARIE I must go . Let me go . FRANK Yes , yes , dear , you must go . Remember me to your mother . Oh ,  --  do n't forget me . With his right hand he has reached into his coat pocket , silently unstopped the bottle , and taken it out . You may go now , dear . And with this he calmly pours the acid into her eyes . She utters one wild shriek , " The Acid " and lies unconscious in his arms . He smothers her groans by holding her to him . Yes , it hurts . How it hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are blind now , for ever and ever . Your beauty is gone . You are horrible . Your face is like a dirty mop.11 No one can bear to look at you . He throws her from him . MARIE writhing on the floor.Oh , My God ! my God ! FRANK calmly .
