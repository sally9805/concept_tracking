The glittering pageant of an Admiralty Court-martial unfolded , last week , upon His Majesty 's aircraft carrier Eagle as she rode at anchor , huge , grim and ominous , in the harbor of Gibraltar . <P> From the shore came eight pinnaces , carrying eight captains , all in full dress uniform , who were piped aboard the Eagle with traditional honor . They were the Court . They sat down to give judgment , without removing their imposing cocked hats . With portentous gravity they took into custody the sword of the accused . . . . <P> And what was all this about ? What high crime or mighty treason loomed ? A man from Mars would have laughed to learn that the whole impressive pother sprang from a few oaths and reprimands uttered by peppery Rear Admiral Bernard St. George Collard ( TIME , March 26 ) . <P> The accused was Commander Henry Martin Daniel . As a subordinate of Rear Admiral Collard aboard the flagship Royal Oak , he is charged with making known to brother officers complaints against the conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Captain K. G. B. Dewar of the Royal Oak to superior naval officials . The act of making known the contents of this secret letter laid open Commander Daniel to the grave , technical charge of " subverting discipline by bringing a superior officer into contempt . " <P> The chief sensation of the trial , last week , was the reading of the fatal letter . Captain Dewar had written : <P> " On January 12 Admiral Collard threatened me in the presence of several guests , that if I did not make Commander Daniel do his duty in introducing people to each other at a dance he would make him do it . I thought his complaint unjustified and his manner of address improper . <P> " Later in the evening Admiral Collard sent for Commander Daniel and ordered him to clear the Marine Band off the quarter deck . Rear Admiral Collard abused the bandmaster in front of the whole band . <P> " The Admiral said he never heard such a bloody noise in his life , and the bandmaster must be sent to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that on his ship . These remarks were heard by several guests . <P> " Despite the unreasonableness of Admiral Collard 's request , the band was dismissed and a jazz band summoned . The attack on the bandmaster caused great dissatisfaction among the lower deck and intense indignation among the officers organizing the dance . " <P> When Rear Admiral Collard was called upon to give his version of the incidents described he gruffed : " . . . Commander Daniel should have made proper introductions at the dance . . . disgraceful to have so many ladies sitting out the dances without partners . . . . <P> " The band was playing abominably . ... I spoke to the bandmaster in the sight of other persons but not in their hearing . . . . " <P> Citizens of the U. S. learned with interest that the defense of Commander Daniel would be carried out by onetime Assistant Attorney General of Massachusetts Day Kimball . Last week he , not yet accustomed to the heavy wig worn by British barristers , sweated excessively in the balmy air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
