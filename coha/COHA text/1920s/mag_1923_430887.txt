T HE difference between the age in which we live and all previous ages is mainly due to the invention of machinery . It has been found that machines will make satisfactory pins much more easily than they could be made before . It has been inferred that human beings also should be made by machinery , and that those who do not like the machine-made product are old fossils who have no place in the modern world . This view is influencing education increasingly in all industrially advanced countries . The evils which it entails are by no means confined to education , but it is the educational aspects that I propose to deal with on this occasion . I believe that everything really valuable in the life of the mind will be crushed out among the white races if the attempt to assimilate men to machines continues . Machines are admirable servants , but until we have made them mere servants we shall not reap the benefit of their services . At present they threaten to become our masters , spiritually and materially . Against this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly as it shows itself in the education to which the leading democracies of the world are subjected . There are two aims which an educational system may endeavour to realize : to make good citizens , or to make good human beings . Conceived broadly and philosophically , these two aims do not conflict ; but conceived narrowly , as administrators are likely to conceive them , they conflict very seriously . The man who is imbued with the mechanistic outlook will try to make good citizens rather than good men , and will conceive good citizenship in a way which almost excludes good humanity . In the notion of good citizenship as conceived by governments I see three disastrous errors : First , each man or woman is conceived as the citizen of a single State , not of the world ; Secondly , the State or the community is supposed to have a good other and higher than that of its several citizens ;  | Thirdly , the good is conceived as something which can be realized by purely mechanical means , not as something dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors , namely nationalism , has no intrinsic connexion with mechanism , but has been enormously strengthened by the way in which industrialism has been developed nationally , so that the connexion is very close in fact , if not in logic . Of course the basis of any public educational system must be the imparting of that necessary minimum without which a man can not play his part in a modern community . It is necessary that everybody should be able to read and write , add up a column of figures , and so on . As time goes on , the State increases the minimum of knowledge , which may come gradually to be quite considerable . But I am not concerned to discuss this basis , important as it is , since it may be taken as agreed . I am concerned rather to discuss those things as to which disagreement is possible . In the course of instruction , a school-master has the opportunity to instil certain mental habits . It is here that disagreement begins : what mental habits shall he teach ? There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving admirable instruction , taught their pupils to accept unquestioningly the dogmas of the Catholic Church . American elementary schools teach the children to become i oo per cent Americans , i. e. , to believe that America is God 's own country , its constitution divinely inspired , and its millionaires models of Sunday-school virtue . English elementary schools teach that our Empire is great and beneficent , that it has never oppressed India or forced opium on China , that it has been invariably humanitarian in Africa , and that all Germans are wicked . Russian elementary schools teach that communists are virtuous , anarchists wicked , and the bourgeois misguided ; that the social revolution is imminent throughout Europe ; and that there can not be any imperialism in the communist party because all imperialism is due to capitalism . The Japanese teach that the Mikado is a divine being descended from the Sun Goddess ; that Japan was created earlier than other parts of the earth ; and that it is therefore the duty of the Chinese to submit meekly to whatever commands the Japanese may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines are taught in Uruguay , Paraguay , and San Marino ? each of which is specially favoured by Heaven , and vastly more virtuous  | than its neighbours . In short , wherever a sovereign government exists , it uses its monopoly of the teaching of writing and reading to force upon the young a set of ridiculous beliefs of which the purpose is to increase their willingness to commit homicide . And for the sake of these beliefs , mental habits of a peculiar kind are also encouraged : credulity , blind prejudice , and group ferocity ? all of them characteristics natural to primitive man , which education might have been expected to soften . The governors of the world believe , and have always believed , that virtue can only be taught by teaching falsehood , and that any man who knew the truth would be wicked . I disbelieve this , absolutely and entirely . I believe that love of truth is the basis of all real virtue , and that virtues based upon lies can only do harm . Perhaps I should in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact there is abundant evidence of it . The case of nationalism is admirable as an illustration . The text-books out of which history is taught are known by every Education Minister in the world to be deliberately and intentionally misleading owing to patriotic bias . It is not merely that the history taught is false ; the really bad thing is that its falsehood is of a sort to make wars more likely . Much is said by socialists , very justly , about the importance of internationalism in the economic sphere ; but internationalism in the educational sphere is at least as important . If children in all civilized countries were taught the same history , different countries would hate each other less , and no country would feel so confident of victory in an appeal to arms . Text-books ought to be drawn up by an international authority , which should direct the training of historical teachers . The present practice increases each nation 's belief in its own righteousness and power and therefore its willingness to go to war . Indeed this appears to be the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this evil that it may well be found , in the end , to outweigh all the good that is done by instruction . The illiterate peasant in Russia or China is not a nationalist , because he can not realize anything so large or abstract as his nation ; when his country is at war , he regards it as an affair of the government , in which his part is limited to reluctantly obeying orders . This is the reason why Russia and China can not do so much harm to other countries as is done by England or France , or was done by Germany . If Russia and China develop elementary  | education on the lines which Western nations have made familiar , they will be able to rely upon their vast populations for the degree of patriotic blindness which made the late war possible ; and when that happens the little nations of Western Europe will be sorry that , like Macbeth , they taught " Bloody instructions , which being taught return To plague the inventor . " All the accumulation of horror which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prevented if education aimed at teaching facts instead of fictions , or if education authorities could conceive of boys and girls as future citizens of the world , not only of the particular geographical area in which they happen to live . It would of course be unfair to put down the whole pugnacious nationalism of our time to faulty education . Loyalty to one 's group , pride in its achievements ( real or imaginary ) and hostility to rival groups , are all part of the instinctive apparatus of man . All that has been done by education is to appeal to this instinct , and to direct it into a certain channel . The men who direct education are themselves subject to it , and do not consciously or deliberately go against what they believe to be right . It is quite possible that , when they come to realize the imminent collapse of Western civilization as a result of their yielding to instinct , they may come to understand that , in this respect as in many others , education ought to aim at the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the training of instinctive passions so as to help rather than hinder the life of the world . At present , in private life , very few of us are murderers , though in a savage community of head-hunters most men are , and sometimes public opinion does not allow a man to marry until he can produce at least one head as a proof of his manly prowess . In such communities , everything is done to strengthen the instinct towards private homicide , which among ourselves is successfully repressed except in unusually violent people . But as regards public homicide , in war , the line taken among ourselves is exactly analogous to that which head-hunters take as regards private homicide . The methods which have enabled us to overcome the instinct of private murder would enable us to  | overcome the same instinct when it takes the form of love of war . Such methods ought to be used in education , instead of the present methods , which nourish the little seed of instinct until it grows into the vast tree of national armament and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and that the division into nations is a trivial folly , could very easily be produced in the average boy or girl if education were directed to that end . A book like Wells ' history of the world , which begins with the geological and biological antecedents of the human species , and treats human progress always as a single movement to which many nations have contributed , is likely to produce a far broader and more humane outlook than chauvinistic teaching about Agincourt and Trafalgar , or Lexington and Saratoga . Perhaps it may be necessary to the due exercise of all our instincts to have some object of hatred . In the middle ages , the Devil could be hated without harm to human beings ; but in our time few people have any vivid belief in his existence , in spite of the war and the peace . We must therefore find some other non-human object of hatred , if men are to be prevented from hating their neighbours in other countries . One might hate matter , like the Manichaeans , or ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and by a little symbolism it could be made to satisfy our instinctive craving for hatred . But to hate other groups of human beings can only do harm , and it is monstrous that education should aim at instilling such hatred by means of lies and suppressions . Yet such is the case in every one of the great nations , except China , which is bullied and despised in consequence . I come now to the second error which , as I think , mechanism has encouraged in our education : the error of imagining that the State , or the community as a whole , is capable of some different kind of good from that which exists in individuals , and that this collective good is somehow higher than that which is realized in individuals . This belief constitutes what I should propose to call the " administrator 's fallacy . " It is , of course , by no means a fallacy to suppose that an individual can only enjoy the best life when he lives in a community having certain qualities ; I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ( say ) an Athenian citizen in the age of Pericles . ( Perhaps the age of Pericles was really no better than our own , but it is correct to suppose that it was good ,  | and I accept the supposition for the sake of illustration . ) The fallacy that I am attacking is not the obvious truism that certain kinds of communities are a means to good things in the lives of their citizens , but the quite different proposition that , when account has been taken of all the good things in individual lives , there remains something good or bad belonging to the State or community as a personified entity . This doctrine was preached by Hegel , and adopted by his British disciples . It has an elaborate logical foundation , which I believe to be wholly erroneous , for reasons which I have often set forth . On the present occasion , it is its consequences , not its premises , that I wish to examine . Those who accept this theory of the peculiar value attaching to States or communities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . This name is somewhat misleading , for it is of course an obvious truism that a society is more or less organic , in the sense that it has interrelated parts which minister to common ends , as the parts of an animal 's body minister to the life of the whole . The obviousness of this fact makes people willing to accept without much scrutiny a view which says that it is only asserting the organic nature of society . But in fact the sociologists in question use the word " organic " in a peculiar philosophical sense of their own . They mean that a society is a single entity with a life of its own , not merely a number of more or less co-operating interrelated persons . They would argue that a person enjoys good things which belong neither to his head nor to his arms nor to his great toe , but to him as a single whole , and that , in like manner , the State enjoys good things which are not to be found in the lives of single citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens is to minister to the life of the State , just as the highest function of the various organs of a man 's body is to minister to the life of the man . Thus our duty to the State becomes something more imperative than our duty to our neighbour , and the good of the State might conceivably have to be pursued by measures involving injury to the great majority of its citizens . In practice , this view leads to the advocacy of an aristocratic and mechanical society . " The good of the State " is , in practice , " the good of the statesman . " I do not mean this in a crude sense : by the " good of the statesman " I do not mean merely his wealth , or any of the things which conventionally constitute the aims of self-in- terested people . These things may , of course , be involved , but a high-minded man will be on his guard against them . There are other subtler forms of selfishness against which men are much less on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciously . A man who is in the habit of thinking about the State finds pleasure in contemplating a certain kind of State , and almost inevitably falls into the habit of thinking that this kind of State is good . A man of administrative temperament finds pleasure in contemplating a State in which there is a great deal of administration , where there is a tidy system , and every person has his place as a cog in the machinery . Such a State will be intolerable to men of different temperament , for instance to artists . But such men , just because of their temperament , will not become politicians or civil servants or captains of industry . Thus one kind of temperament , and that not a very common one , is , in practice , alone concerned in establishing what it considers the " good of the State . " This kind of temperament , so long as the " good of the State " is believed in , will feel free to force its tastes upon the community , since they are supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecution of decent people by busy-bodies , and a gradual crushing out of art and thought and simple enjoyment of life . Men who advocate what they call the " organic " view of the State always imagine that what they believe in is an antithesis to mechanism . This is a most curious delusion . A machine is essentially organic , in the sense that it has parts which co-operate to produce a single useful result , and that these separate parts have no value on their own account . A machine may not be so perfect an example of an organism as an animal is , but we can make machines and we can not make animals . Therefore when we are exhorted to make society " organic , " it is from machinery that we shall necessarily derive our imaginative models , since we do not know how to make society a living animal . Moreover , nothing has done so much to make communities organic as the introduction of mechanical industrial processes , which have necessitated the co-operation of vast organizations in great enterprises such as railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , far more dependent on other men than they were in simpler times . Thus mechanism , in the concrete form of machinery , ministers to the belief in the " good of the State , " and in turn dictates the form which that belief is to take .  | The good of the State consists in having as much machinery as possible , regardless of what it produces , whether useful commodities or poison gases . It is interesting to note that the Bolsheviks , who , as disciples of Marx , have retained what Marx retained of Hegel 's teaching , are among the most ardent believers in the good of the State as opposed to the good of the citizens . Their aim ? I speak of those who are public-spirited and not self-seeking -- is to produce a certain type of society , which they believe to be good in itself , quite regardless of the question whether it will bring happiness to those who have to live in it . One can not but observe ( though they themselves are unconscious of the fact ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators having a good position in the official hierarchy , and probably to no one else . Similarly the Kaiser and the Junkers sought the good of " Germany , " as opposed to the good of Germans ; but it happened that the good of " Germany , " as they conceived it , coincided with that of the Kaiser and the Junkers . And to come nearer home , those who glory in the British Empire are willing that for its sake all its citizens should suffer ? excepting , of course , those who govern it , who will have the pleasure of contemplating the sort of Empire that suits their tastes . One might say the same of the industrial and financial magnates in America , and of governing persons generally . All such persons , unless they are very much on their guard against the administrator 's fallacy , will have a conception of the public good which is unconsciously biased so as to secure their own good . It is not merely the injustice of this view that constitutes its harmfulness ; it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mechanical quality of the goods valued by the ordinary administrative temperament . The great artists , the great thinkers , and the great religious teachers of the world have had quite other standards : they have valued the individual , they have praised spontaneous impulse , they have conceived the good life as one lived from within , not forced into conformity to an external mechanism . They have not sought to make men convenient material for the manipulations of rulers , but to make them spiritually free to pursue what they believed to be good , regardless of law and public opinion . This was the teaching of Christ , of Buddha , of Lao-Tze ; in another form , the same emphasis on the individual is to be found  | in Shakespeare , and in Galileo 's resistance to the Inquisition . All that is best in human life depends upon a certain kind of selfrespect , of self-determination ; a man who has allowed outside pressure to dictate the ends for which he shall live can never be more than a slave . Our modern State education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare not encourage spontaneity , since all spontaneity interferes with system . There is a tendency to uniformity , to the suppression of private judgement , to the produc - ion of populations which are tame towards their rulers and ferocious towards " the enemy . " Even if our civilization escapes destruction in great wars , this tendency of State education to produce mental slavery will , if it is not checked , kill out everything of value in the way of art and thought and even ultimately of human affection . And it inevitably kills the joy of life , which can not exist where spontaneity is dead . It must not be supposed that democracy , by itself , offers any cure for these evils , which come from the intensity of government and are independent of its form . Wherever there is great intensity of government , effective power is in the hands of officials , and the bias of officials ( apart from rare exceptions ) is always towards mechanism . A majority may be quite as oppressive as a minority ; and the champions of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room for individual initiative , absence of uniformity , are essential conditions of progress ; without them , society must rapidly become stereotyped . The tyranny which threatens us in the future is not so much that of any privileged class , as that of the energetic people who like politics and administration . Formerly , the power of such people was very limited ; now , owing to industrialism and the consequent destructiveness of wars , the power of the State is enormously greater than ever before in the history of mankind . If there were only one world-wide State , the danger would still exist , but would be easier to combat . Owing , however , to the existence of many States , the main purpose of every great State is success in war , and it is to this end that the immense power of the State is chiefly devoted . This end is not served by the preservation of individual initiative , and thus the tendencies to a mechanical enslavement of ordinary men and women are enormously strengthened by the need of preparing for war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tendencies upon education in all the leading countries of the world . It may be thought that I have strayed rather far from the subject of education in the course of these remarks . But a system of education embodies the ideals of the society which establishes it , and can not be radically reformed except by a reform of ideals . If I had to direct the training of teachers , there are two things that I should specially impress upon them : First , that a man 's public duty is towards mankind as a whole , not towards any subordinate group such as a nation or class ; Second , that a good community is a community of good men and women ? of men and women , that is to say , who live freely , but not destructively or oppressively . As to the first point , I should try to bring about a realization of the disaster which faces our civilization if science invents continually new means of destruction without being counteracted by a simultaneous ethical advance . Many people see the danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and popular forces which are making for new wars , and few are willing to face the fact that patriotism , in its commoner forms , is the worst vice of which a modern man can be guilty . To bring a realization of these things should be part of the business of every educator ; he should try to teach impartiality of judgement , the habit of searching for impersonal truth , and distrust of party catchwords . He should try also to counteract the natural tendency to believe that men belonging to opposing groups or nations are specially wicked . Under the influence of skilful propaganda , our impulse to moral indignation is exploited to make us hate those whom our masters wish us to hate ; and under the influence of the resulting hatred , we do things which rouse the moral indignation of those whom we hate . Thus moral indignation has become a source evil in the world . Punishment is seldom the best way to deal with men 's imperfections , and there is hardly any one so blameless as to have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our enemies , but not our own sins ; thus indignation produces merely an increase of mutual enmity . Americans , for example , know the atrocities of which Japan has been guilty in Korea , which are unknown to nine Japanese out of ten ; Japanese , on the other hand , know the worst that is to be said about the lynching of negros in America far better  | than Americans do . Thus hatred is stimulated on both sides , and nothing is done on either side to check the evils . Indignation against the criminal is seldom useful ; what is useful is compassion for the victim , and willingness to face the fact that it is not only our enemies who make victims . I think , however , that in education it would be more useful to dwell upon the interconnexion of different parts of the world than upon what may be called humanitarian arguments . It is easy to see and to teach that we can not ruin our enemies without ruining ourselves , and that , from mere selfpreservation , enmities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its present population . As to the second point ? the freedom of the individual ? this is quite peculiarly a matter for the educator , because the freedom that we can hope to preserve is rather mental and spiritual than economic or material . Industrialism has made it necessary that , in what concerns the material side of life , men should co-operate in vast organizations . It is just that the community should exact from every able-bodied adult an amount of productive work corresponding to what he or she consumes . It seems inevitable that , as regards this necessary minimum of labour , there shall be less freedom in the future than has been enjoyed hitherto by the fortunate minority . But if we could abolish wars and armaments and advertisement and the waste of commercial competition , we could all subsist comfortably on four hours ' work a day . The rest of our time ought to be free , and education ought to prepare us for an intelligent use of the twenty hours a day during which we should be left to our own initiative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of socialism or communism may be instituted , we must expect that all the best work will be done voluntarily , without reward , owing to an impulse from within . Given equal opportunity for all , we may hope that there will be much more of such work than there has hitherto been . But there will be none at all if the State , in its schools , sets to work to mould the minds of the young according to a uniform plan . There must be the utmost encouragement to freedom of thought , even when it is inconvenient to bureaucrats . There must be opportunities for voluntary teachers ? especially after childhood is past ? who will teach because they wish to do so , and not merely for a livelihood . In everything that lies outside the provision of the necessaries of  | life , there must be individualism , personal initiative , variety . The fight for freedom is not to be won by any mere change in our economic system . It is to be won only by a constant resistance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom is the most precious of all goods . Mechanism has its place : its place is the material side of life , the provision of the food and clothes and houses without which we can not live . But it has no place in what makes life worth preserving , in art and thought , in friendship and love , or in simple enjoyment . These things demand freedom ? not only outward freedom , but freedom in our minds and hearts . Such freedom is too little respected in our schools and in the schemes of our economic reformers . It is in danger of being lost through the tyranny of purely material aims . But no perfection of organization can ever compensate for its loss ; and nothing can prevent its loss unless we can remember that man can not live by bread alone .  |
