Wily thieves tiptoed into the U. S. consulate at Zagreb one night last week . They wanted the consular seal . With it they could forge visas , and thus wangle Jugoslav emigrants into the U. S. <P> They found letters , typewritten reports , money . They could not find the seal . Taking nothing , the thieves , unapprehended , tiptoed out of the office . Many a U. S. consul sleeps with seal under pillow . <P> To Belgrade last week returned King Alexander of Jugoslavia and spouse Queen Marie . Their eldest son , Crown Prince Peter , 5 , was at the station , in care of Prime Minister Monsignor Koroshetz , and giggled gleefully , perhaps at King Alexander who has just shaved off his royal mustache . <P> To Belgrade also came Seor Alfonso , staff-member of the Brazilian Foreign Office .
