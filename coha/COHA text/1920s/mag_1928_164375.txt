Mathias Blau of Chicago persuaded his wife , Helen , to have all her teeth pulled . Then he refused to buy her false teeth because , he said , it was cheaper to feed her on soup than on solids . Mrs. Blau went to court , was awarded two sets of store teeth and at least a beefsteak a week . Judge Jonas told Mr. Blau that he had committed " the meanest trick " he had ever heard of . <P> <P> Watches <P> Joseph Davidson of Chicago had a pretty girl , an automobile , a dozen watches and diamond rings . He drove into a gasoline station , said to the attendant : " Listen , sport , I 'm in a jam . I 've got to take my girl to a party and I 'm broke . Can you loan me 25 bucks on this here watch ? " The attendant obliged Mr. Davidson , who then went to other gasoline stations to dispose of his watches and rings . Mr. Davidson was no philanthropist . His watches were tin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arrested . <P> <P> Rats <P> There are 7,800,000 rats in Detroit . They do a damage of $60,000,000 a year . So says the U. S.

Well , I will fine you $75 and costs and tell you that if there is anything more unsportsmanlike than what you did I do n't know of it . To walk up and shoot a tame deer at all is anything but sportsmanship . And no sportsman would shoot a roe if he knew it . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
