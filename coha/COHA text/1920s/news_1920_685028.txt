txt The prospect for favorable action by Congress upon the Army and Navy Pay bills has been clouded by reluctance upon the part of so-called friends of economy in the House to approve of any legislation at all upon measures of that kind at this session , or even of the consideration of the bills by conference committees . It has been charged that an attempt was being made in the House to prevent the naming of conferees and thus to " kill " the pay bills . The outlook is not as dark as that . There seems to be no doubt that the Senate bill introduced by Mr. WAnswottra of New York will go to conference carrying the provision of the House bill of Mr. KELLEY for increase of the pay of enlisted men in the navy only . Senator WAnswoirra had maintained that additions to the pay of enlisted men in the services were not really necessary . The case of the officers was different . Many of them were married and had families to support and children to educate . Opposition in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the increases of officers ' pay was a figure that interfered with the plans of those who wanted to impress the country with their devotion to economy . As late as Feb. 19 Senator Pam , Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs , was much concerned about the attitude of the House obstructionists . The Senate Committee on Military Affairs as well as his own committee , he said , was in favor of increases in pay for officers and men in all the services . " Such a bill , " the Senator declared , " should be passed " and not a ? bill discriminating in " favor of a certain portion - of the " navy personnel . " The fact that there are still members of the House . no inconsiderable number , who would deny relief to officers and who ire inclined to make a. fight for the limited principle of the Kelley bill is disquieting , but the feeling at both ends of the Capitol at the present time is that the cry of economy is false in this tzustazicex and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without- passing the amended Wadiiworth bill . That . measure was drafted " to meet " fluctuation in the cost of living so " far as it affects commissioned of " ficers and certain non-commissioned " officers , and is intended to be flex " ' his and elastic . " Accordingly , it provides that the pay of such officers shall be increased 10 per cent . and , in addition , that they shall receive " one " ration per day for each room allowed " for quarters . " To the uninitiated this seems rather technical , but it may be said that the result would be an increase of about 31 per cent . in the pay of officers . The Senate sub-committee 's report explains that " for the " present fiscal year the ration Is to " be commuted on the basis of 55 " cents . " The Wadsworth bill applies to the army , navy , Marine Corps , Coast Guard and Public Health Service . There is no Inflation in it . Its provisions for pay increase are moderate and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he will be fair in argument . Of the urgency of relief legislation it need only be said now that the present schedule for officers dates back to 1908 , and that it has become woefully inadequate because the dollar of 1920 as a purchasing medium goes no further than half the dollar of 1908.
