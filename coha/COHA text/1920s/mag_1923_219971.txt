With more than 1,300,000 unemployed , Britain is gripped by two strikes and menaced by a third . The first is a farm laborers ' strike , involving 10,000 hands , in Norfolk . The farmers say that they can not pay the present scale of wages and escape bankruptcy . The farm laborers state that they can not exist on the present wages , and demand an increase . In the meantime milk maids and police-men are doing the farm work . King George , who farms one of the largest estates in Norfolk-the Sandringham estate-has sided with the laborers , as have some of the other large landowners . The King has refused to give notice of a wage reduction , and has intimated that if the result of the farmers ' and workers ' parley is abortive , he will make separate arrangements with his men . The second is a strike about the employment of non-unionists in South Wales . The dispute is purely an inter-union affair , but 17,000 miners are idle . It is feared that they may repudiate the national miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike is threatened by building operatives , who have rejected their employers ' offer of increased hours and decreased wages by a majority of three and a half to one . There will be further negotiations before an actual stoppage occurs .
