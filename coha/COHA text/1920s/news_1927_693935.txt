txt We closed our second article on our . flight with . night settling down and our plane winging east over the ocean . In the darkness of that first night of our flight , with the waves of the Atlantic rolling beneath us , the wind shifted to the southwest and helped drive us forward , for which we were most thankful . What impressed us most in those hours of darkness was to look downward , where we knew there was nothing but ocean , with icebergs floating around . In the long twilight which preceded that first night we had seen some of these icebergs in the bluish green water down below , and it looked so cold that we decided to ? do everything possible to keep our plane in the air and avoid falling into that enormous ice bathtub . It was cold enough up in the air , but down there in that water ? whew ! Even the color of it looked cold ? it was a bluish green , entirely unlike the muddy sort of color which you see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were over the Labrador current , which brings down icebergs and cold water from Greenland . " What Are Two Men More or Less ? " " If we fall into the ocean it will be good-night for us , " said Levine . " I guess 1 will not struggle much . " And Chamberlin remarked , " What are two men more or less ? " As we roared along up there in the air , all sorts of things struck us as funny ? we kept getting a laugh , no matter how serious the situation was . Once Levine asked : " Say , where are you taking me , anyhow ? To Rome or to Berlin ? " And he got the reply , " I do n't know , I should n't wonder if it was Spain . " Another time Levine felt in one of his pockets and discovered that he had come away with the payroll for John Carisi and the other mechanics employed by his company . Saturday , the day we started , was nayday , you see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlin later as the plane flew through the night over the Atlantic . " How much have you ? " Chamberlin fumbled around in his pockets . " Eleven dollars and fourteen cents , " he replied . He had seen no reason for sinking lots of good American money in the ocean , so he left every other penny he had in the bank for his wife . Ice Forms on Wings in Fog at 15,000 Feet . About 11 o'clock we began to pass patches of a fog , proving that our friend , Mr. Kimball of the New York Weather Bureau , . knew what , he was talking about when he warned us against it . Toward midnight we kept getting into more patches of fog , larger and closer together than those encountered earlier , until finally the fog closed in on us altogether , and we lost sight of the water completely . We kept on climbing until we reached an altitude of 15,000 feet , our limit with the heavy load of gasoline we were carrying . At 15,000 feet we had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we immediately started to pick up ice on the wings of the plane . This was really serious . We thought we were goners when we saw the ice was weighting down the wings and threatening to force us into the sea . When Lindbergh struck . the fog he managed to climb above it , but we could n't . Our only hope was to get down as fast as possible into warmer air , where the ice would melt before we struck the water . It was that or nothing  --  regardless of the fog and of everything ' else . Warmer Air Saved Them From Watery Grave . Well , we dropped down , and still further down , with that deadly ice glistening along the wings of the plane , until we finally got into warmer air , which melted the ice and saved us from a wet , cold grave . After that little lesson , we shifted our course further south , as we had been advised that by so doing we should get out of the storm area and on to the shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which pleased us most among the big stacks received since we got across the ocean was one which we got here in Berlin from Mr. Scarr and Mr. Kimball , New York Weather Bureau experts , and which read : " For Clarence Chamberlin , aeronaut and meteorologist , Berlin : Congratulations . " This reply was immediately sent : " Thanks for your cable . Levine and I appreciate your accurate information . We got out of the storm area ' in midatlantic - by. ' going southward , following your advice . " CLARENCE CHAMBERLIN . " Until we saw the first two boats our ocean flight had been a lonesome experience . ' Shortly before the fog closed in on us we sighted at a distance the lights of these two vessels , presumably ice . patrol or tramp steamers . The second one returned our flashlight ' signals , showing they saw us . We hoped this one would wireless , having swapped signals with us . " Ocean , Ocean , More Ocean , Hours and Hours . " ' All through this part of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shipping lanes . Toward sunrise the fog cleared somewhat , and when the sun came out we were able to get our approximate position . This reassured us , since it showed us we were making good progress , despite the fact that we had wasted a lot of gasolene trying to climb over the fog . During the early hours of Sunday morning we passed over two small tramp steamers , which indicated that we were holding approximately to our course along the steamship lanes . By going south to the steamship lanes we had got rid of bad weather and had the advantage of wonderful visibility , with a quartering tail wind . Until the middle of the afternoon we flew along without any special incident and with nothing to see below us but that mass of cold salt water . During those lonely , monotonous hours we realized more and more how big that darned ocean was . When you fly over land you get accustomed to the constantly changing panorama below you  --  plains , mountains , rivers , towns , all sorts of landmarks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ocean , for hours and hours , until we began to wonder whether we were going around in circles . Sight a Steamship and Read Name " Mauretania . " At about 4:30 in the afternoon we spotted our first real liner  --  about ten miles off to our left  --  and then we knew positively that we were above the shipping lanes . We flew straight for that ship and dropped down until we were from 50 to 200 feet above it and read the name " Mauetania " on it . It was then we got out our copy of THE NEW YORK TIMES , which Mr. Lyman of that paper had put out at the last moment before our departure from New York . We found that the Mauretania had sailed from Southampton on Saturday noon , which would indicate that she must be some 400 or 500 miles out from that port . One of our charts had the steamship lanes for June , so we could locate ourselves almost exactly . After circling a couple of times over the ship , we flew ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly over it and along the wake behind it , taking careful compass readings that gave us exactly the course we could follow to Land 's End at the southern tip of England . Two hours after passing the Mauretania we ran into patches of fog again , which became thicker and thicker , until they had again closed in on us entirely . Transylvania Looms Up , Then " Land ! Land ! " Toward evening we spotted another big ship and dropped down to investigate . She turned out to be the Transylvania . Again we got out our NEW YORK TIMES , but we could n't find the sailing date of the Transylvania from England for the simple reason that she had sailed after that issue of THE TIMES had been printed . What we did find , however , was the date of her arrival at Dover ? June 3 ? indicating that she could not have got away again before the fifth  --  the day we sighted her . That showed we must be very near the English coast . The fog was getting thicker all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear we could n't see land when we finally succeeded in getting over some . Then all of a sudden we let out a whoop , for some chalky cliffs and rolling green hills burst upon our eyes straight ahead . " Land ! Land ! " we yelled . What it was or where it was we did n't care in the slightest . Levine felt sure it was Ireland . He was born on St. Patrick 's Day . Chamberlin had a notion it might be . As a matter of fact , it was England . But all we thought about at the moment was that it was land , real land , a solid chunk of Europe . We only caught a glimpse of it . A few minutes later we were over salt water again . Then at sunset darkness spread over sea and sky , and we were roaring along through the night toward the European Continent . This is the third of a series of five articles written for The New York Times , tn which Messrs . Chamberlin and Levine narrate their transatlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series is expected in time for tomorrow 's Times .
