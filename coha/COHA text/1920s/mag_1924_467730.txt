A NEW phrase is on the tongues of men : " stabilizing the dollar . " Ten years ago a few economists began to use this phrase ; five years ago a few bankers also ; and recently a vague ap ? prehension of the evils which gave birth to the phrase have set business men to using it . Even the general public is get ? ting interested . Some of these have thought the mat ? ter through ; some have thought it through nearly enough to give their votes to a congressional candidate who had thought it quite through , and who had made the stabilized dollar a plank in his platform for re-election . This can ? didate , Mr. Goldshorough of Maryland , having been duly re-elected , has tried to make good his pledge to his constituents by sponsoring a bill now pending before Congress ? pending but ( at this writing ) not passed . The specific purpose of this bill is to correct the evil of flighty prices by taking the flightiness ? not out of goods , but out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of things mone ? tary mankind has been harassed by mys ? terious , periodic price-floods ? both ebb ? ing and flowing ? comparable to the plagues of Egypt . We have always blamed the wrong man ? the " gold-bug " if prices went down ; the " profiteer " if prices went up . Yet both of these al ? leged scoundrels have been merely car ? ried by the mysterious tide they were accused of consciously making . Within the past three years this tide has surged up and down in such quick and bruising succession that the real truth has begun to get itself knocked into a few of us . Fur who can now go on believing thatmere little cliques of human beings whose interests are opposed could take turns at controlling the tides in opposite ways three times within a year ! When , therefore , most economists , some busi ? ness men , a few bankers , and a legislator or two begin to talk " unstable dollar , " the rest of us may at least feel justified in taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nary citizen from detecting the motions of the dollar is the same thing which pre ? vents the child on a train from detecting the train 's motion . To the child the fences seem to go scooting backward when it is the train carrying him forward . Even to the grown man the sun seems to move from east to west when it is the earth carrying him from west to east . So we . who ride the tide of dollars , think the price-shore is receding when it is the money-tide carrying us out to sea . Naturally , then , we trust to the wrong expedient to bring prices down . We trust to increased production . But pro ? duction is already adequate . It is a fact , however , that increased production would lower prices , and therein , if we but look , we shall find the real secret of high prices . Prices are a mutual thing . If money buys goods , goods buy money . If , there ? fore , over-produced goods mean cheap goods , why does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap money and not dear goods from which we are suffering : When the abun ? dance of money is sudden , as in war , we sometimes come to acknowledge it and call it by the name of " inflation . " But war-inflation is sudden inflation . What we fail to notice is the stealthy , slow in flation that has been the cause of the mysterious slow rising tide of prices through the ages ( for prices have mostly risen ) , and the occasional slow deflations that have been the cause of the occa ? sional historic ebb-tides of prices . Sud ? den deflation has also been tried , in 1921 , as a counter-active against high prices , and it proved so successful that nobody liked it . But that is another story . Suffice it here that during the ages the rise of prices ( namely the weakening of the pur ? chasing power of money ) has in fact been preceded by an influx of the money-tide which acted as a diluter . Either new mines ? as in California , Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money had flowed from the government printing press ; or else banking facilities had been automatically widened . There is , for instance , the story of gold . When prices have gone up or down in one gold country , they have gone up or down in all gold countries concurrently with the tide of gold and other money redeem ? able in gold . There is also the story of silver . When prices have gone up or down in one silver country , they have gone up or down in all silver countries concurrently with the tide of silver or other money redeemable in silver . But then there is the story of both gold and silver together . For prices have some ? times gone in opposite directions simul ? taneously : down in all gold countries , up in all silver countries , because simul ? taneously the gold tide was ebbing and silver tide rising . As if this were not enough to lay the blame on money rather than goods , there have been times when goods have been notably abundant and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would expect by observing goods alone , actu ? ally went up . For ( as the trained ob ? server saw ) though goods were abun ? dant , money , as it were , " beat goods to it " by becoming super-abundant . Such was the case just before the war . Prices had been stubbornly rising for eighteen years ; therefore people thought thatgoods must have been growing scarce for eighteen years . But statistics now prove that goods had not been growing scarce at all , but that money and money-facilities ( including paper money and banking facilities ) had been glutting the market . But , I hear someone say , we could endure a rising tide of inflated prices if our salaries rose proportionately . And would n't they ? No , they would not . They do not . The very case in which we all acknowl ? edge inflation to he the real cause of ris ? ing prices namely , the case of Germany to-day -- is a case of rising prices without equally rising salaries . It is the law of inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly but trickles slowly into the salary-market ? and the wage-market . So in Germany the middle class , who are the stabilizers of society , are being wiped out by the unstable mark . German teachers and clerks and others of their class were recently reported to be com ? mitting suicide at the rate of fifty a day . Why do salaries and wages thus lag behind prices ? Because when a man agrees to accept a salary or a wage he does not feel justified in at once de ? manding an increase just because he finds he must pay a bit more for bread , shoes , and rent . He hardly expects the rise to be permanent : Nor does his em ? ployer , who is entirely innocent of the rise ( though he profits by it ) , see why a demand should be made for a rise in wages . Between the two classes there is a kind of understanding ? a semi-con ? tractual relationship which provides that a salary-rate , or even a wage-rate , once fixed is fixed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frozen on the edge of a salary-earner 's pocket and keeps out the slowly rising flood of money which invades all other cavities . There are other contractual relation ? ships still more frozen . They are those existing between borrowers and lenders . it is the time clement in these borrower lender contracts which is the undoing of one party to them or of the other party to them as the case may be . For if I lend money just as prices begin to rise and if I get the same money back when prices have reached their predestined high level , I cannot. then buy the same goods with that same money . Its pur ? chasing power has meanwhile fallen , and I have been cheated for my thrift . Such a process began in 1896 , when the gold-flood began to rise once more , causing a rise of prices , or fall in the purchasing power of the individual dollar . The working girl who in 1806 put her money in a Savings Bank was , of course , able , in 1920 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 a great hole had been made in the purchasing power of each individual dollar . The loss in each individual dollar had become so great as entirely to offset the gain in the number of dollars . With her principal and in ? terest together in 1920 , that girl could buy as much as she could have bought in 1896 with her principal alone . She had been cheated for her thrift . Like Alice in the Looking Glass , she had run hard and long and still found herself in the same place ! Widows are also lenders . They inherit loans in the form of bonds ? very gilt-edge bonds indeed . The law insists on this . Yet when a certain trustee boasted to me how thrifty he had been on behalf of a widow whom I knew , I gently pointed out to him that lie had , after thirty years of diligently going through all the motions of thrift , left his unfor ? tunate beneficiary $15,000 in the hole . For her capital and interest together , though nominally more , would actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had very carefully put her into the very careful hands of her trustee . " Heavens ! " said the latter , " that 's not my fault ! " " No , " I said , " it 's the fault of the law which compels the widow to accept cheaper dollars than she lent . " The story is told of a Polish clothier who , after the World War , retired frombusiness , selling out his stock of a hun ? dred suits of clothes for 100,000 Polish marks . He then lent his 100,000 marks at 10 per cent interest . When three years later he was repaid not 100,000 but 130,000 he found that with this ap ? parently augmented sum he ' could buy himself exactly one suit of clothes ! This is what diluted or depreciating money does to the lender and to the employee . What does it do to those on the other side of these time-contracts ? the borrower and the employer ? The farmer is a good example of both . He is a borrower of the money lender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent rise of prices con ? tinued , the farmer did a humming busi ? ness at the expense of these two . Every day he got more for his produce while he paid the same to his hands ( less in purchasing power ) , and repaid the same ( less in purchasing power ) to his money lender . What really happened , there ? fore , was that the furtively thieving dol ? lar robbed the farmhand and the lender and slipped the loot into the pocket of the farmer . The farmer did not know this , but he enjoyed it all the same . Is the farmer happy ? Oh , no , not now . For as soon as he had adjusted himself to a better life , and stocked up for a new drive , money got scarce ? was deflated ? prices went down ; so that while he went on paying the same to his hands and repaying the same to his lender ( more in purchasing power ) . he was getting less for his goods . The fur ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking the farmer 's pocket and handing the loot to the others . The farmer got worse caught . than if he had not prospered in the first place . He was lured to his doom . The same fate that overtook the pros ? pering farmer falls also upon the giants who , like him , borrow and employ . A luring prosperity , based not on merit but on a thieving dollar , leads the business-giant , just like the farmer , to overstock and to overborrow . Then the tide turns . Hard times come . A crisis develops . Often a panic follows with a " linked chain " of bankruptcies , " long drawn out . " Thus a rise in prices robs Peter to pay Paul and then a fall robs Paul to pay Peter ; and both movements end by lassooing and throwing the fancied winner . But the punishment of the fancied winner does not wait for the rising price-tide to turn . Long before this more or less automatic vengeance for automatic cheating the cheated laborer takes ven ? geance into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sees who is richer , He takes no stock in automatic fraud . Therefore he strikes . He strikes with fury . Sometimes he runs amuck and destroys the machinery that feeds him . In either case he sterilizes produc ? tion on which both he and his employer feed , not to mention the rest of us . Thus , rising prices eventuate in hn ? paired production . Do falling prices then eventuate in augmented produc ? tion ? No ; falling prices too eventuate in impaired production because they wipe out the producer 's incentive ? that is , profits ; and further because , after the producer is bankrupt , his business passes into less experienced and there ? fore less competent hands . On top of economic injustice comes so ? cial disease . For he who laughs at the idea of automatic unconscious fraud becomes a fount of discontent plus animus . In the memory of the present generation there have been two great price-tides eventu ? ating in social disease . From 1873 to 1896 prices fell 30 per cent . There fol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populism . " For the farmer was then the great automatic sufferer . And then from 1896 to 1014 prices rose .50 per cent , and during the war 100 per cent more . There followed the recent sickness which we all remember . The labels of it were " high cost of living " and " profiteer " ; and there were strikes and bread-riots and even blood-letting . Then came the deflation of 1920-21 with its disastrous depression of trade . And now for two years prices are more stable . Now , social disease always leads to foolish legislation and to the constant menace of the quack panacea . Is deflation a cure for inflation , and rice versa ? It could be so only upon the following impossible condition : that all of these frozen time-contracts be entered into at one time , and no more made , and the makers of them live through two equal and opposite tides precisely . In that case the precise set of people who had profited by a change of prices at the expense of the other set could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other set to gain precisely what it had lost , by an equal and opposite dose of deflation or of inflation , as the case might be . This was Mr. Bryan 's idea iii 1896 . In 1806 he wanted to punish the lenders of 1873 . But , alas , in 1896 most of the existing frozen contracts did not date back to 1873 . They involved two entirely new sets of people ? new sets of borrowers and lenders , new sets of wage-earners and wage-payers , many of them horn since those of 1873 had died . Instead , therefore , of recouping the borrowers of 1873 , Mr. Bryan would have mulcted the lenders of 1896 ? in ? cluding servant girls . It would have been a case of two wrongs not making a right . Nevertheless , the second wrong which Mr. Bryan meditated managed to get it ? self done without Mr. Bryan 's help . What Mr. Bryan wanted was inflation by means of silver . Well , inflation came right enough , but by means of gold . The gold-mine owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copi ? ously as Mr. Bryan would have poured in silver ; but as Elijah said of his troubled life , " it is enough . " And as Mercutio said of his mortal wound , " ' t is not so deep as a well , nor so wide as a church door ; but ' twill serve . " The evil does not consist in either high prices or low prices . It consists in the unequal and incalculable and deceptive transitions from level to level . What is needed is price-stability . But that means stability of the great price-maker ? the dollar . MI commercial units but the dollar were stabilized long ago . Once upon a time the unit of weight was a stone . Now it is the weight of an object so ac ? curate that you can weigh a hair by it . Moreover , this accuracy is prescribed by law and , in America , protected by the Constitution . Once upon a time the unit of length ( called a " yard " ) was the king 's girdle . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in Washington , kept under a glass case , and kept at a fixed temperature lest it expand or contract a hair 's breadth . This , too , is a legal defi ? nition protected by the Constitution . What would have become of modern American business if the yard had been the girth of the President , first in the ad ? ministration of Roosevelt , then of Taft , and then of Wilson ? Yet the tribula ? tions of American stockholders , bond ? holders , servant-girls , widows , laborers , and pathetic little Mr. Public have been even worse , under the affliction of a fluctuating dollar , than they would have been under the handicap of a fluctuating yardstick . For yards measure only a few kinds of goods , while dollars measure the values of all kinds of goods . What is the unit of length ? A fixed length ? the yard . What is the unit of volume ? A fixed volume ? the bushel . What is the unit of weight ? A fixed weight ? the pound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed value ? Alas no ? it is a fixed weight . For the word " dollar " stands for weight , not value . And the law which sa.netifies the clarity of the yardstick and the clarity of the bushel and the clarity of the pound , sanctifies equally this confusion of the dollar . As a creditor , you must accept a fixed weight though its value be half what you lent . As a debtor , you must pay a fixed weight , though its value be double what you borrowed . Such is the law . To be sure , a dollar ( that unit of weight ) does have value also . But so has a yardstick that unit of length . So has a bushel-basket ? that unit of volume . Yet we do not use the value of a bushel-basket to measure its volume , nor do we use the value of a yardstick to measure its length ? nay , nor the value of a pound-weight to measure its pound-hood . It is high time , therefore , to re ? lease ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a gambler 's burden . We should not care how the value of a yardstick gamboled if only its length keep sober . We should not . rare how the value or the length or the vol ? ume of a pound-weight might skip about if only its weight be the same every day . Why , then , be solicitous about the weight of a dollar if only its value or purchasing-power stay put ? Such is precisely the plan of the pro ? posed legislation now pending before Congress . It proposes to turn the tables and make the weight of the dollar dance attendance on its value instead of its value dancing attendance on its weight . Specifically , it proposes to reduce that weight whenever its value ( or purchasing power ) starts to go up , and to increase that weight whenever its value ( or pur ? chasing power ) starts to go down . It is a continuous , steadying process , like steering . Simon Newcomb , the great astrono ? mer and all-around man of science , and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes . Without wearying the reader with all the details , suffice it to describe in a general way the two elements which constitute the gist : First , how to establish a good criterion of value , second , how to vary or steer the weight of the gold dollar so as to make it conform to the criterion . First , then , what is the criterion of value ? It is an average assortment of goods ? an average family-budget of goods ? what you want . to buy with your dollar and what you had in mind to buy with it when you earned it . It is this budget of usable things which has fixity in your mind . Suppose we take a fif teen hundred-dollar yearly budget . To re ? duce it to about the present value of a gold dollar , take one fifteen hundredth of it ? one fifteen hundredth of every item in it ? and in imagination put this assortment into a basket and call it " one goods-dollar . " This must not vary . It is a composite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a group they are to be our standard to refer to ? our criterion . It will be clearly the most fixed criterion of value ; for though the physical conditions which vary supply and demand may still act upon any item in - the basket ( whether gold or goldfish ) , they will never unite to affect all the items in the basket in any one direction at one time . The aver ? age pressure will be more nearly bal ? anced and motionless than any other one thing you could namefar more so than gold or silver . The goods-dollar is , of course , not meant to circulate . It is a statistical concept , to he used as a cri ? terion of value . The reason why this criterion has never before been tried is that never till recently have we possessed that ingeni ? ous device for statistical averaging known as " the index number . " Having thus established our criterion ? a goods-dollar ? the second problem confronts us : how to vary the gold coin to conform to it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worth more than one " goods-dollar " in the market , and increase its weight when it starts to be worth less than one " goods-dollar " in the market . Vary the weight of a coin ? Now , of course , we can not vary the weight of a circulating coin . But few gold dollars take the trouble to circulate , and none need to . Most of them are content to repose comfortably in the Treasury , and all might well repose there . For it is by thus reposing that they perform their chief function , which is to confer upon the paper dollars which do circulate whatever purchasing power these have ; that is , whatever purchasing power the gold dollars would themselves exercise ifthey circulated . The purchasing power of paper is vicarious . It exists because any paper dollar can at a moment 's notice be redeemed at the Treasury for one of these restful gold dollars . ( Some paper dollars can be redeemed directly , some by a roundabout journey which need not here be followed out . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in redemption of your paper dollar may be changed so as to entitle you not to a gold coin reposing in the Treasury , but to a quantity of gold bullion reposing in the Treasury ? not a fixed quantity of gold bullion , but whatever quantity hap ? pens , at the moment of redemption . t o he equal in value to one goods-dollar . What this quantity would be at the moment would have been previously as ? certained by the use of the Index Number . The effect on prices in terms of the legal dollar will he as follows : The prices of separate commodities represented in the goods-dollar will still vary , but the average price of those commodities will remain fixed ; or , to he more exact , will be constantly refixed before it has had time to vary more than one or two per cent . So that at the end of a year the **33;639;TOOLONG just described will find that , though he may have spent more of his fifteen hundred dollars for shoes and less of it for rent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same amount of shoes , rent , bread , salt , gasoline and the other items of his yearly budget . But some people may refuse to be sat ? isfied because the component articles in the goods-dollar are still free to vary in price , individually . For will not any ar ? ticle whose price thus varies vary the income of the man whose livelihood is made by the sale of that article ? Cer ? tainly . A stabilized dollar is not the phil ? osopher 's stone nor perpetual motion . The stabilized bushel-basket relieved the world 's incomes of many ills formerly incident to sale and loan , and a stabil ? ized dollar will confer a similar boon of much greater importance ; but no recti fying of a standard of measurement can relieve the human race of drought and boll-weevil and other natural vicissi ? tudes . Incidentally , however , a stabil7 ized dollar will reduce many fluctuations in expenditure and some fluctuations in income ? this in proportion to the numer ? ousness of the articles involved . Aver ? age prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore the in ? come of a department store if its vol ? ume of trade is fixed will remain more nearly constant than hitherto . But the income yielded by a single crop will still be subject to rainfall and other condi ? tions . How much worse , however , would be the fate of such an income if not only the income itself depreciated but each dollar of it depreciated at the same time ! This is the gist of the plan to stabilize gold money which is the foundation of our monetary structure . But " foundation " implies " super ? structure , " and a superstructure is not necessarily stable because the foundation is . What is the superstructure of our monetary system ? Chiefly it consists of two circulating categories : paper money is one ; the other is credit or bank-deposits subject to check . Both paper money and credit are quite as inflatable and de ? flatable as gold and silver . In time of war , paper is usually the chief offender . But in this last war , in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper money often goes so far as to carry it entirely away from its parity with metal ; but before this point of sep ? aration is reached the inflated paper re ? acts upon the metal itself so as to im ? pair the purchasing power of both equally . During the war , for instance , our gold was inflating , therefore losing purchasing power ; paper and credit both were inflating , therefore losing purchas ? ing power ; paper and credit were react ? ing on gold and helping to deplete its purchasing power . Since the gold base and the paper and credit superstructure are thus parts of one total circulating medium , both should he regulated . To regulate either alone , though it would tend to regulate the other , would not al ? ways be sufficient . An unregulated con ? traction or expansion of one medium could for a time more than offset a regu ? lated expansion or contraction of the other medium . Therefore , besides providing for the adjustment of the weight of the metal dollar , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its printing press . In the second place , through the Fed ? eral Reserve Board , it . must regulate the flow of credit ? bank deposits subject to check ? for bank deposits come from bank loans . The flow of credit is there ? fore governed by the rate of interest . The rate of interest is like a valve . Tighten it and less credit will How . Re ? lax it and more credit will flow . This is an old art in Britain , whose financial wisdom has hitherto led the world . In America this art of consciowly using the rate-of-interest as a valve to gov ? ern the total credit-tide is compara ? tively new . As a really conscious American art , it dates from the inaugu ? ration of ithe Federal Reserve System in the year 11 ) 14 . By means of that act we strode abreast of Britain , If now we complete the machinery of stabiliza ? tion by stabilizing the metal foundation of our currency , we shall have stridden ahead even of Britain . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the path that leads away from Bolshe ? vism , populism , and socialism , because it leads away from the automatic injus ? tices which beget these immensely dan ? gerous quack remedies . I do not mean that social disease will utterly disappear . A stable dollar will not precipitate a mil ? lenium . But it will be a seven-league stride in progress . At the Genoa Economic Conference , thirty-one nations unanimously approved of stabilization by banking methods . In England Reginald McKenna , J. Maynard Keynes , Lord Vernon , and others are preaching stabilization . Probably Eng ? land will soon become its chief battle ? ground .
