Bombs , bullets and blood . Disease , dying and dead . Hunger , horror and hell . Such is a description of Tegucigalpa , capital of Honduras , in which Hand a revolution has been in progress more than two months ( TIME , Feb. 11 et seq . ) . <P> A bright glow appeared on an otherwise nocturnal horizon . U. S. President Coolidge instructed Sumner Welles , U. S. Commissioner to the Dominican Republic , to proceed to Tegucigalpa and offer the friendly assistance of the U. S. for the establishment of peace in Honduras . <P> Cynics professed to see in this move a final gesture to the Honduran Republic before the U. S. marched into the country , in the same manner as she had done in Haiti in 1915 , which action resulted in a virtual protectorate by the U.S.
