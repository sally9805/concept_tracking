The day was balmy , fair and germinal-a day appropriate for dalliance , or at worst for relaxation . Therefore , the practical citizens of France bustled forth in unusual numbers to elect members of the Chamber of Deputies . <P> When votes were counted , last week , it was seen at first blush that not a single Communist had been returned and that the country had swung toward supporters of the Sacred Union Cabinet of Prime Minister Raymond Poincar , savior of the Franc . The second blush would come seven days later , when Frenchmen will vote again in those constituencies where no candidate obtained a majority last week . <P> The chief sensation of the polling centred around War Minister Paul Painleve , who has twice been ousted from the Prime Ministry since the last election and was thought last week to be in danger of losing his seat as a Deputy . In the nick of time there arrived to bolster up his candidacy the two least likely persons imaginable : Dieudonn Costes and Joseph Lebrix , famed ' round-the-world aviators ( TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a welcome , Costes and Lebrix flew in from Marseilles on the last lap of their journey . Heroes , they revealed a fact which seemed scandalous . They declared that the French government had hindered their flight in several instances by intimating through French consuls that they ought not to continue their hazardous program . The only effective aid vouchsafed to them by the State came , they said , indirectly through War Minister Paul Painleve . <P> Shortly , Heroes Costes and Lebrix proceeded to thank M. Painleve by going down into his constituency and electioneering for him . In vain they were charged by his opponents with debasing , if not prostituting , their heroism to politics . True heroes , they stuck to their electioneering . Further , they revealed that on the last stages of their flight they were so reduced in funds that they skimped on food in order to buy gasoline , and hastened home in order to avoid begging for meals . <P> Paradoxically , not even this last and touching story availed to elect Paul Painleve last week , though he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the enormous number of 3,712 candidates were seeking election to the scant 612 seats in the Chamber meant inevitably that many strong candidates failed to poll a majority . Among these was famed Louis Lucheur , Finance Minister in 1925 , and " the richest man in France . " <P> Among candidates safely returned to the Chamber are six members of the Sacred Union Cabinet : Foreign Minister Aristide <P> Briand , Minister of Public Instruction Edouard Herriot , Minister of Marine Georges Leygues , Minister of Public Works Andr Tardieu , Minister of Commerce Maurice Bokanowksi , and Minister of Pensions Louis Marin . <P> Unique was the electioneering of Candidate Georges Claude , a well known chemist . He ignored politics completely , and lectured to his constituents in crisp , entertaining style on scientific subjects . Intrigued , the ballot-casters gave him a thumping majority .
