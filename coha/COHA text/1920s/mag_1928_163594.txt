It was a dull evening for Fire Engine Company No. 9 , one of those lazy April evenings in Washington when you can smell the park cherry blossoms all over town and a fireman 's life is just one repression after another . The men of Number Nine sat in their chairs mooning , or wishing some one knew a funny story newer than the one about red suspenders . Nobody got excited when-Dang-galang ! - an alarm came in . <P> " Ho hum . Probably just another baby playing with matches , " thought the men of Number Nine as they reached for their coats and eased down the pole . <P> But as Engine No. 9 thundered out of its mechanical stable , the faces of the men of Number Nine were illuminated with sudden glee . <P> " Two thaousan ' nine Mass Avenue , " exulted the man on the bouncing tail-step . <P> And sure enough , dashing through the sleepy streets , Engine No. 9 snorted up to No. 2009 Massachusetts Avenue , a modest little French-style mansion of Indiana limestone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night last January ( TIME , Jan. 16 ) , stood a pink-cheeked , slightly rotund little man with a perky mustache and amusing eyes . <P> As in January , the trouble was soon put right . Last time it was a furnace pipe " gone flooey ; " this time it was a blazing chimney . And , as in January , the men of Number Nine were well rewarded for their labors . Doffing helmets , wiping hands on shirt , they soon were regaled with coffee , sandwiches , perfectos , etc. , etc. , not to mention genial wisecracks and charming smiles , all served with a maximum of relish after the excitement by perhaps the most persuasive host and hostess in all U. S. politics-Speaker of the House and Mrs. Nicholas Longworth .
