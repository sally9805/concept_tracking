ADAM &; EVE-John Erskine-Bobbs-Merrill ( $2.50 ) . The simplicity of Author Erskine 's formula is so evident that definition is unnecessary . What escapes definition is this : why should talk that would be only mildly witty coming from the mouths of imaginary characters be continuously entertaining when imagined as spouting from mythical Helen of Troy , legendary Galahad or biblical Eve ? Here is the triangle of Eve , Lilith , and poor old Adam , who gets tossed up and down in the web of their attractions like a fresh-man in a blanket . First Lilith gets him , then Eve , then Lilith , then Eve . ( Then he gets a son . The gaieties of Author Erskine 's dialog which can be so easily minimized by an understanding of his easy tricks remain as insidious as ever ; and now as he points out once more the original sophistication of woman and the enduring naivet of the male , he can be called shallow or specious , but he can not be called dull .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
