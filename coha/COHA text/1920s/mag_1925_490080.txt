THE TALK OF THE TOWN FIFTH Avenue is consistent only in being the most feminine thoroughfare in the world . So it was no great surprise to me last Tuesday to discover that a good old-fashioned Fire Sale was going on in the Dobbs store in the upper Forties . A week or so ago the Avenue parade had stopped to watch the place burning , and it was now being ushered in groups of twenty-five into the bargains inside by a cordon of police . There were easily five hundred thrifty shoppers waiting for admission when I passed the place about noon . Answer to week before last 's puzzle ( presuming that anybody besides W. C. W. Durand bothered to guess it ) : Kenesaw Mountain Landis . " Hollywood has certainly changed considerably since I was a boy , " said Donald Ogden Stewart , in a reminiscent mood after his return last Tuesday to New York from a lecture tour . " I suppose , " continued Mr. Stewart , " that it would be a surprise to a great many people to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indeed it was a surprise to me at the time and even more of a surprise to my parents who had come overland in a covered wagon to see the Grand Canyon but had taken the wrong road at Cincinnati and , to their chagrin , landed in California instead of Arizona . " The trip to the Coast in those days , " went on Mr. Stewart , " was one of considerable diThculty . We left New York ( 125th Street ) early in the Spring and with favorable winds and a message from Mayor Hy-Ian to the mayor of San Francisco tied around my grandmother 's leg , we were able to reach the Grand Central Station by May , where we got our mail and fresh meat . " But from then on the trip was no longer child 's play and indeed none of the children played anything except my grandmother who played the flute , but nut very welt . " At Kansas City we had a shower and a change of horses and after that we pushed on into the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , however , except my grandfather , and indeed by the time we reached Hollywood the old gentleman had spent all his money for Indian blankets and postcards so that he had to start He all over again at the age of 128 , which was not easy in those days , especially as his matches all got wet . " My father soon made friends with the Indians who inhabited Hollywood and they later took him into the tribe and gave him the name of ' Ugh . ' But when my grandmother died my grandfather sort of gave up hope and drifted into the real estate business . At the time of his death he was developing a section ( which he called the ' Bronx ' ) by bringing Gordon gin from Gordon , 125 miles away , by pipe line over the mountains to the orange groves . Had this succeeded , he would certainly have increased land values and besides would have been a lot of fun and kept the children out in the open and given them lots more color . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and perhaps it is for the best . " Among those who have long been fed up with indictments against the First Night Audience is your annoyed correspondent . George Jean Nathan and others from time to time have lots of fun commenting on the raffishness of the assemblage at the premiere of a play so many bulging stockbrokers , so many extremely protected ladies , so many Broadwayish actors and actresses , playwrights , ticket speculators , etc . The implication of all these critics is that First Night Audiences are made up of gangs of murderers ready to kill the play or equally detestable claques of personally interested huzzahers . A combination cheerfully determined to ruin whatever pleasure a well-bred pew holder might get out of the proceedings on the stage . Well , where in the name of polite society , are the virtues of the audiences who attend the sixth , twenty-fourth or two hundredth and ninety-ninth performance of a play which had such a lamentable first night attendance ? To get to the point ( and attach it hopefully to the seat of the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several times in the last few weeks I have gone to plays at these later performances and on any one of those evenings there was more late arriving , coughing , snorting , whispering , and general hysteria than I have ever seen at a first night . Irrespective of their worthiness as individuals an opening night audience comes to the theatre prepared to see a play . Charges against the amoebae in afterthe-opening audiences who do n't know when to laugh and what 's worse , when not to , will be made by me to a Higher Court , as beginning next Monday I intend to shoot to kill at the drop of a hat . The fact that the police are finally devoting a little attention to New York taxicab drivers , with a view to getting rid of some of the worst of them , makes this as good a time as any to call attention to a little known fact . Taxi drivers , under the law , are required to carry a passenger to any destination that he may name  --  within the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked inclination on the part of drivers , particularly when had weather puts cabs at a premium , to turn down passengers whose destinations are not just what the drivers think they ought to be . It is just as well , at these times , for the passenger to be acquainted with the law . The return of Patricia Collinge to New York in " The Dark Angel " exhumes out of the past a story that probably is n't true , but is just as good for all that . In the days of yore , when Miss Collinge was appearing with Douglas Fairbanks in such offerings as " The New Henrietta , " " The Show Shop , " and the vaudeville " The Regular Business Man , " Fairbanks toted around with him a fully equipped electric chair , upon which it was his pleasure to induce sensitive strangers to sit . One night in Boston , a thin lipped Brahmin brought his debutante daughter back stage to meet the engaging comedian . Fairbanks asked her to he seated in his electric chair , and then proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , or million volts were hurled against her by her host , but the young woman betrayed no sign of perturbation . The next day Fairbanks , somewhat worried , sought out her father and explained the situation . " Oh , " said the proud old Bostonian , " my daughter experienced the sensation , but merely ascribed it to the way a girl should feel upon being introduced to an attractive actor , and , believing that breeding counts for something , was above remarking about it . " Now that the sartorial season is nearly over , vernal rejoicings rise in my heart over the defeat of a dinner coat upstart which threatened for a few weeks to make uncomfortable a lot of men who dress decently . It was a double-breasted jacket that made its appearance in a dozen theatres and dinner parties during the last few months , Why anyone should want such a " novelty " I could n't quite grasp . While I have not dedicated my life to keeping up the styles of the Wilson-Harding period I have yet to see an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . God knows they do n't realize the majesty of vir sapiens to any degree but how are you going to bring it out by making his clothing even more ridiculous than it is ? I wonder how many of you have ever attended  --  or even heard  --  of the Yorkville Theatre . It is situated on Eighty-sixth Street , just east of Lexington Avenue , and through the medium of a stock company , known as the Blaney Players , presents former Broadway successes and failures . The other night I attended the performance of " Cheaper to Marry " ? an opus by one S. Shipman . I recall little of interest about the piece , but particularly recollect the Esquimau . Pies , peddled by the ushers during the intermission . Which charmingly rural touch must have caught the attention of the Messrs . Selwyn , for only last night at the Times Square Theatre I noted the blue-jacketed usherettes selling ice-cold lemonade at twenty-five cents a throw . The business of peddling the very late ( or early morning ) editions of the newspapers around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In restaurants , in hotel lobbies , and even at the theatre , one is continually being pestered nowadays by these nocturnal vendors .
