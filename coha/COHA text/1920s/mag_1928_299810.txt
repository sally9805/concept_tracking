Politics makes strange , not only bedfellows , but antagonists . <P> In Manhattan this week , Republican voters in the Congressional district which contains most that is interesting on the wealthiest U. S. island-i.e. , it contains the glittering end of Park Avenue and the staccato sectors of Fifth Avenue and Broadway-were asked to choose , for G. O. P. Congressional nominee , between <P> 1 ) Phelps Phelps-sometimes-written " Phelps ! Phelps ! " <P> 2 ) ( Mrs. ) Ruth Sears Baker Pratt , wealthy widow , mother of many , vivacious , ambitious . <P> Mr. Phelps is put first because he is a New York Assemblyman and thereby the political senior of Mrs. Pratt , who is only a New York City Alderman ( albeit the first New York woman alderman in history ) . He is also put first because he drew top place on the ballot , after performing a " luck rite . " Just before the drawing , he rushed out of the Board of Elections office and touched a Negro on the shoulder . <P> Mrs. Pratt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facetious Mayor Walker , who calls her " Ruth " and " so charming " when she asks him pertinent questions . She considers him amusing , yes , but a feather-and-glue obstruction to the serious party reforms she thinks Manhattan needs . Her boys go to Groton and Harvard . Her husband 's father founded Pratt ( Fine &; Applied Arts ) Institute in Brooklyn after helping to found Standard Oil . Her husband was the Pratt who jotted the memorandum which revealed " Andy " Mellon ( Secretary of the Treasury Andrew William Mellon ) as one of those who were invited by Will Hays to take over some of the Liberty Bonds which Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair gave to the Harding-Republican deficit . <P> Like most New Yorkers , she is for modifying Prohibition . She is " sporting " and hearty . She has said : " Politics seems to me to be like a game of college football , " and , " When I play tennis and lose , I make it a point to get to the net first to congratulate my opponent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smooth , young , curly-haired , Princeton-educated son-of-the-system whom she defeated for the Council , took her to lunch the day after she beat him . Debating against Mr. Phelps last week she cried : " I am not running on my looks , my age , possessions or sex . I ask no chivalry . " <P> Getting nominated for Congress-and elected-is different from Aldermanic campaigns in Manhattan . Mrs. Pratt 's opponent , Phelps Phelps , is experienced and determined . Politics is a passion with him . He is a sort of Republican Tammanyite who spends all but a fragment of the $70,000 per annum or so which his father left him , on presents for his precinct voters-milk , Christmas stockings , coal , Easter eggs . <P> Phelps Phelps began petting the voters before he was through college ( Yale , Williams ) . He dances at all functions-motormen 's , modists ' , the Social Register 's . His grandfather , the late William Walter Phelps , was ( 1889-93 ) U. S. Ambassador to Germany. * The grandson is an ambassador of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , generous , shrewd , a smoker of cigars at every waking moment . He professes not even to afford a motorcar in which to battle Matron Pratt .
