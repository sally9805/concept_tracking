No mention of liquor cases , according to Mr. Van Riper , was made in the report . The first intimation the public had of the impending break between Mr. Van Riper , who is a political prot  --  g ? of Senator Walter E. Edge , and the Department of Justice was when Mrs. Willebrandt telegraphed Mr. Winne not to take the Weehawken liquor cases to the Federal Grand Jury unless he had evidence other than that presented to the Hudson County Grand Jury .

Mr. Bingham resigned a few months ago . giving as his reason his inability to secure cooperation In enforcing the Volstead act either from Mr. Chamberlain or Mr. Winne . " We need somebody in the Prohibition Department , " Mr. Bingham wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stand as Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt has taken in. the Department of Justice . Sbe has not been afraid to run up against the stone wall of Senatorial courtesy and . scale it . She has also not been afraid to carry the battle into the enemy 's country . I am proud to have been a member of the same army as Mrs. Willebrandt . ' For the past six months I have been trying to persuade the department to investigate the Newark office of the Prohibition department . When the Field Supervisor was here months ago ; ? I turned over certain information to him which should have been ' followed . up . In August . 1924 .
