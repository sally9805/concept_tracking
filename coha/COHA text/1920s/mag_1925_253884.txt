Prince of Bourbon was as clean a horse as you could wish to see-small head , thin hock , deep chest , round blue hoof ; moreover , he was being ridden in the famed $50,000 Belmont Stakes ( Belmont Park , L. I. ) by Earl Sande , who has been called , not without justice , " world 's greatest jockey . " So it seemed curious that obliging gentlemen with receipt-books were willing to offer $10 to every $1 of yours that Prince of Bourbon would not win the race . But if you thought that American Flag , for instance-swift son of Man o ' War-or By Hisself , another son of that famed sire-were faster than Kentucky Cardinal , Marconi , Backbone , Swope , Dangerous , you would have to put up more money to win less . Various opinions Upon this state of affairs were expressed in U. S. currency or friendly promises . The horses went to the barrier , leapt away . <P> In three strides , Prince de Bourbon was in front , Backbone close behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already dizzy , had slipped back . The mile . Prince de Bourbon was lengths in front . The obliging gentlemen loosed their striped collars with trembling forefingers . But ho ! - American Flag , in second place , was behaving queerly . Jockey Johnson , on his back , did not lift his hands , raise his whip . But American Flag bounded past Prince de Bourbon as if the latter were shod with billets . To his owner , Samuel D. Riddle , went the stakes , and a great silver basket donated by the late Major August Belmont . The obliging gentlemen thoughtfully relit their masticated , short cigars . They had , as usual , been right .
