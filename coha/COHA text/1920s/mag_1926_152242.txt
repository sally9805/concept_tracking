One of the best of Cornell University 's track athletes , a few years ago , was C. Curtis Woodruff Jr. , sprinter . When he was graduated he went into the contracting business with his father in Forest Hills , Long Island . One warm evening last week he came home from work and began to play with his dog " Spot " . The dog dodged behind a lilac bush , raced around the house ; Sprinter Woodruff dashed after him . An hour later his father found his body crumpled on the floor of the garage , dead . The run had been too much for his heart .
