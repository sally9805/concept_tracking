But they were not used to elaborate , detailed advertisements of champagne . As everyone knows , bootleg champagne in the U. S , market is priced at $10-$15 a quart . These beguiling advertisements suggested the possibility of better-than-bootleg champagne for $2.30 . Immediate reactions of cautious clubmen were : 1 ) It ca n't be legal ; and 2 ) It ca n't be good . But the advertisement gave chapter and verse of the Volstead Act in defense of is legality , and as proof of its potability offered an iron-clad guarantee : " If you are not satisfied with the champagne you make , your money will be returned to you . " If you are not satisfied , we will send a man to destroy the champagne and he will give you a check . " If you spoil it through your own negligence , you get your money back . " If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money back . " If for any reason , or for no reason at all , you are not satisfied , you get your money back . " Reassured by the brute force of guarantees , but still bewildered , serious clubmen sought the facts about the new , post-prohibition , U. S. champagne industry .
