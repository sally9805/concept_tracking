Football writers are sentimental artists who enjoy calling things what they are not . Thus they speak of the Princeton team as " Tigers , " though no live , wild tiger has been seen near New Jersey for many millions of years and they refer to the team which plays for the University of Nebraska as " Cornhuskers , " merely for want of a better name . Last week , Coach Bearg and the Nebraska squad boarded a special train for West Point ; on the squad were 34 men , though one of them , Willard Urban , who lost a coin toss to be the last man taken , had his fare paid by friends . The newspapers of Lincoln , Neb. , printed advertisements saying " Beat the Army , " Nebraska 's Governor sent a telegram ; a great parade of students moved through the streets ; the noise of the train as it pulled out of Lincoln was not so loud as the noise made by those who watched it go ; a day later the team got off at Albion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to West Point-an unbeaten team . <P> Blue Howell , 185 pounds , one of the lightest men on the Nebraska team , was supposed to have been going to a duel with " Red " Cagle , the Army 's unkind star . As it turned out , neither he nor Fay Russell , the 205 pound quarterback , who has a wife and ranch of his own , damaged the Army . Nor was Clair Sloan , who has not missed a kick for point after touchdown since the season began , able by himself to win , though he kicked a field goal in the second period and nearly kicked another to tie the score in the third . In the last quarter Allan , an Army substitute , grabbed a forward pass and made the second touchdown for the Army . The final score was 13-3 . Vice President Dawes , in a fur-lined coat , let out a dignified yelp and the people who listened to their radios in Nebraska clicked them off , with forlorn disappointment , in their chilly parlors . <P> Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie behind the Rocky Mountains . California and Stanford are two giants who ravage the countryside and then clash together . Last week , before the game , Stanford had won 15 of these clashes and California 12 . California rapidly scored 13 points ; after the half , Simkins made a touchdown for Stanford ; in the last minute Frentrup of Stanford made another . The giants had played their seventh tie . <P> Before the Harvard game it is customary for Yale to have a football rally and at this football rally it is customary for all Yale undergraduates to yell and cheer . This year , however , only 500 were gathered together in the name of Yale . President James Rowland Angell , having campaigned so vigorously and with such notable success for Herbert Hoover , apparently supposed that his moral support might also take happy effect upon the football team . " The bigger they come , the harder they fall , " he said . Then Tad Jones , onetime Yale coach , spoke scornfully of the decline of the Yale spirit and the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undergraduates who were not present as " yellow " and he asked . " What has become of the old Yale spirit . . . perhaps they are too cultured to come here . . . . " President Angell gave nod : of gloom .
