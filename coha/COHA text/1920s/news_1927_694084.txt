txt The important tobacco companies engaged in the manufacture of cigarettes , the most popular form of tobacco product today , are competing with each other more strongly than any other time in their history . More extensive advertising , backed by heavier appropriations than ever before , reflect this condition . However , profits for the first half year of the largest domestic manufacturers , R. .7 . Reynolds , American Tobacco and Liggett &; Myers , ail ran ahead of those for the first six months of 1926 . Strong working capital positions , favorable raw material prices , ' overhead economies through increased production , maintenance of finished product prices , and steadily increasing demand for cigarettes all played their part . Three important developments have occurred in the industry recently , which can only tend to snake competition keener . One is the entrance of P. Lorillard Co. into the field of the popular-priced blended cigarette , the really profitable part of the business , through nation-wide campaign on their Old Gold brand . Then there is the new policy of the American Tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , of concentrating their efforts on Lucky Strike , their leading cigarette brand . Results of this policy are shown in the fact that - American Tobacco in the first six months of 1927 sold over 30% more of this brafili than in the first half of last year . FOREIGN COMPANY ENTERS FIELD Another factor which seems likely to intensify competition is the probability that the British-American Tobacco Co. will soon bring out a popular-priced blended brand in the United States market . The industry hears that this probably will be under the name of " Old North State , " a brand formerly sold in a moderately small way by the Brown &; Williamson Tobacco Co . British-American Tobacco has purchased several plants of this company . and early announcement of the foreign company 's venture into the domestic field is expected . British-American Tobacco has expanded its operations in China , always one of its strongholds . through an alliance with the Liggett &; Myers Tobacco Co . The latter , early this year , incorporated a concern , known as Liggett &; Myers Tobacco Co . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China . British-American has acquired an interest in this company , and will henceforth conduct operations in the Liggett &; Myers brands in the Far East . Imperial Tobaceir of Canada , * subsidiary of BritishAmerican ; boa , - comesiudad - negotiatiii- no whereby it will dandle the Liggett &; Myers products in the Dominion of Canada . CHAIN STORES A FACTOR A factor of no small importance in adding to already strenuous competition is the fact that the two important tobacco chain store systems , United Cigar Stores and Schulte Retail Stores , are pushing popular-priced brands of the Continental Tobacco and Philip Morris companies , with which they are allied . Notwithstanding conditions , officials of the larger companies feel that there is room for all in the cigarette business . An extremely important field still remains in the woman smoker . Undoubtedly she has had much to do with the tremendous gain in cigarette sales over the years since the war , despite the fact that the large manufacturers are still loath to make direct advertising appeal to women . There is still a large number of potential women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appeal , and on this , . together with normal growth of population , and the apparent swing of American youth in favor of cigarettes , the cigarette manufacturers base their predictions of continued expansion and growth in earnings of individual companies .
