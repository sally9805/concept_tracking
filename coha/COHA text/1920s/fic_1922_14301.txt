The scene is a small suburban kitchen in the modest home of MR. and Mrs. GORDON JOHNS . A meal has recently been cooked , as is shown by a general confusion of pots and pans and dishcloths . Along the back wall we see an icebox standing in the corner , an oil range , and two shelved cabinets , one containing groceries and household sundries , the other dishes and glassware . Some baby linen and very small shirts ( such as would be suitable for a child of about ten months ) are hanging on a clotheshorse near the stove . A door in the right wall leads out to the back porch ; there are two windows in this wall , one each side of door . A door in the left wall leads to dining room . Near the icebox is a door opening on back stairs , which ascend to upper parts of the house . Below the dining-room door is a sink and oilcloth-covered drainboard or shelf beside it . In the center of stage a small table covered with oilcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the scene opens , GORDON and LAURA are carrying in soiled dishes through dining-room door . They come in and out several times , making methodical arrangements for cleaning up . They pile the dishes on the shelf by the sink . GORDON takes dishpan from a hook under the sink , and fills it with hot water from the kettle on the stove . LAURA , who is an attractive little person , aged about twenty-three , is in that slightly tense condition of a young hostess who has had a long and trying day with house and baby , and has also cooked and served a dinner for four . GORDON All right , Creature , just wait till I light my pipe and we 'll polish this up . ( Lights pipe and rolls up shirt sleeves. ) p. 3 LAURA ( taking an apron from chair in corner ) : Put this on first . That 's the only decent pair of trousers you 've got . ( Enter Mrs. SHEFFIELD , carrying dishes . ) MRS . SHEFFIELD Now you children run along and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAURA No , no , Mother . You go and talk to Mrs. Johns . ( Pointedly ) Do n't let her come in here . MRS . SHEFFIELD ( ultramaternally ) : Poor baby , she 's tired . You 've been on your feet all day . Now let Mother wash up for you . That was a big dinner to cook . LAURA No tireder than you are , Mother , darling . You cooked lunch . GORDON Both of you clear out ; I can get this done in no time . MRS . SHEFFIELD ( patting LAURA 'S cheek ) : Busy with the baby all afternoon , and then cooking such a delicious dinner  --  Dearie , wo n't you let Mother do this for you ? LAURA There is n't room in this kitchen for everybody  --  ( Enter Mrs. JOHNS , carrying dishes . ) MRS . JOHNS Gordon , you and Laura go and rest . Let the two grandmothers  --  p. 4 GORDON Now listen , little people , this is my job . I always wash up on Thursday evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see you 're all fagged out after that long day in the office  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD ( to LAURA ) : Please go and lie down , baby . You 're so tired . LAURA ( with wanting patience ) : You two go and amuse yourselves ; Gordon and I 'll attend to this . ( They gently eject the two mothers-in-law . ) GORDON Come on , now , the good old system ! ( He takes the small table from center of stage , and puts it carefully midway between sink and dish cabinet . Takes chair from corner and sets it beside table . LAURA sits down on chair and wipes silverware and dishes as he hands them to her after washing . ) LAURA The silver first , while the water 's clean . GORDON Right . We make a pretty good team at this , do n't we ? LAURA ( holds up a small silver jug ) : That darling old cream jug . Mother used that when she was a little girl . GORDON I love our little Thursday-evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other night . p. 5 LAURA I 'm glad , Gordie . GORDON We get better grub on Thursdays , when Ethel goes out , than we ever do when she 's in . LAURA I tried to have everything specially nice tonight . Some visitors are very critical . GORDON It was lovely . I 'm afraid it was hard for you ; Creature , to have Mother come just now . ( A short pause . ) Especially when your mother was here . LAURA Did n't she know Mother was here ? GORDON No . I had n't told her . You see , your mother is here so much more often . I did n't know your mother would still be here . I was afraid Mother might be a little hurt  --  LAURA Mother helps me a great deal . I think it 's a queer thing if a wife ca n't have her mother stay with her once in a while  --  GORDON ( aware of danger , changes the subject ) : Ye Gods , Ethel has cracked the Copenhagen platter . ( LAURA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother gave us when we were married . LAURA It 's a stock pattern . You can get another at any department store . GORDON I 'll bet Ethel did n't empty the icebox pan before she went . I never saw a cook yet who could remember to do that  --  p. 6 LAURA If you had to go out and hunt for them , you would n't be so particular . She 's better than no one . GORDON ( goes to icebox and removes a large , brimming pan from under it ) : What did I tell you ! ( The water slops over from pan as he carries it gingerly to sink and empties it . He replaces the pan under icebox . ) LAURA You 'd better heat some more water . You 've poured that ice water into the dishpan . GORDON ( getting a little peevish ; refills kettle and puts it on stove ) : It 's perfectly absurd not having any pantry to keep the icebox in . In here , the heat of the stove melts the ice right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut . ) Of course , she never keeps the doors properly closed . ( He returns to sink and resumes dishwashing . ) It 's a funny thing . LAURA What is ? GORDON Why , that a presumably intelligent person ca n't understand the doors of an icebox are meant to be kept tight shut , to save ice . What does she suppose those little clamps are for ? ( LAURA is silent . There is a pause , while GORDON scrapes portions of food off the soiled plates . He examines some of these plates rather carefully , and picks out several large pieces of meat , lettuce , butter , etc. , which he puts on one plate at one side . Then he seems to resume his good humor and relights his pipe . ) Well , it 's jolly to have both the grandmothers here together , is n't it ? p. 7 LAURA Gordon , dear , put the silver away in the sideboard before it gets wet again . ( He gathers up silver from the table in front of her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch , and returns , bringing garbage can , which she puts down by the sink . She begins to wash dishes , and sees the plate of odds and ends which GORDON has carefully put to one side . She scrapes its contents into the garbage pail . While she is washing , GORDON enters . ) GORDON Now , Creature , let me do that . You do n't want to spoil those pretty hands . ( Takes them , with an attempt to be affectionate . ) LAURA I guess it is n't any worse for them than washing the baby 's things . GORDON Come on , old man , let me . ( Gently removes her from sink , and pushes her to the chair by the table . She sits down and wipes dishes as he hands them to her . ) It does n't take long when there are two of us . LAURA Gordie , these dishes are n't properly clean . You ca n't get that grease off without hot water . GORDON I guess that kettle 's hot by now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give it a minute longer . ( Stands by stove and puffs at his pipe . In a moment of false security , he foolishly reopens a dangerous topic . ) You know , I 'm a little worried about Mother . p. 8 LAURA ( putting away dishes ) : Why ? GORDON I do n't think she 's as well as usual . She hardly ate any of her salad . LAURA ( turns as though about to say something , but checks herself and pauses a moment . This time it is she who tries honorably to avert the gathering storm ) : Oh , Gordie , I forgot to tell you ! Junior drank out of a cup today  --  the first time ! GORDON He did ! The little rascal ! LAURA Look , here 's the cup . ( Shows a small silver cup . ) GORDON ( affectionately , putting his arm around her ) : Well , well . ( Looks at cup . ) What cup is that ? I do n't seem to remember it  --  LAURA Why  --  Mother brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby . GORDON Where 's that nice old christening mug of mine ? I think Junior would like to use that once in a while , too . LAURA I put it away , dear . I was afraid Ethel might dent it . GORDON ( takes kettle from stove , goes back to sink ) : I hope Mother is n't feeling poorly . I noticed at supper  --  p. 9 LAURA When hot meat is served , refined people usually call it dinner  --  GORDON ( looks at her cautiously , and suddenly seems to realize that they are on the edge of an abyss ) : Now , honey , you 're tired . You go and rest ; I 'll finish up here . LAURA No , thank you . I like to see that everything gets cleaned up properly . Someone might come snooping out here , and then there 'd be hints about my housekeeping . Of course , I 'll admit I was n't brought up to be a cook  --  GORDON ( seeks inspiration by relighting his pipe , and takes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make out is how to prevent coffee grounds from going down the sink . ( He talks desperately , trying to tide over the mutually realized danger point . ) Perhaps if I could invent some kind of a little coffee-ground strainer I 'd make our fortune . That coffee was delicious , Creature . LAURA Take care of that urn ; it 's one of the few handsome things we have . GORDON It is a beauty . LAURA Jack Davis gave it to me  --  GORDON ( puts it down with distaste ) : I guess I 'd better attend to the garbage . p. 10 LAURA ( nervously ) : It 's all fixed . GORDON I always like Thursdays because that 's the one evening Ethel does n't get a chance to throw away about five dollars ' worth of good food . LAURA I fixed the garbage . You can put the pail outside . GORDON ( hunting among plates on the shelf beside sink ) : Where 's that plate I put here ? There was a lot of perfectly good stuff I saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you think I 'm going to keep a lot of half-eaten salad your mother picked over  --  GORDON ( seizes garbage pail , lifts it up to the sink and begins to explore its contents . His fuse also is rapidly shortening ) : My Lord , it 's no wonder we never have any money to spend if we chuck half of it away in waste . ( Picking out various selections . ) Waste ! Look at that piece of cheese , and those potatoes . You could take those things , and some of this meat , and make a nice economical hash for lunch  --  LAURA It 's a wonder you would n't get a job as a scavenger . I never heard of a husband like you , rummaging through the garbage pail. p. 11 GORDON ( blows up ) : Do you know what the one unforgivable sin is ? The sin against the Holy Ghost ? It 's waste ! It makes me wild to think of working and working like a dog , and half of what I earn just thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just look at it ! ( Displays a grisly object . ) There 's enough meat on that bone to make soup . And ye gods , here 's that jar of anchovy paste ! ( Holds it up . ) I thought you got that for me as a little treat . I wondered where it had gone to . Why , I had n't eaten more than just the top of it . LAURA Well , you left it , and left it , and it got mildewed . GORDON Scrape it off . A little mildew wo n't hurt anybody . There 'll be mildew on my bank account if this kind of thing goes on . ( Still examining garbage pail . ) Look here , about half a dozen slices of bread . What 's the matter with them , I 'd like to know . LAURA I think it 's the most disgusting thing I ever heard of . To go picking over the garbage pail like that . You attend to your affairs and I 'll attend to mine . GORDON I guess throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? LAURA You 're always quick enough to find fault . I know Ethel 's careless , but she 's the best I can get out here in this godforsaken suburb . Maybe you 'll be good enough to find me a better servant . A well-trained girl would n't work in this old dump , where there is n't even gas . You do n't seem to know when you 're lucky . You come back at night and find your home well cared for and me slaving over a hot dinner , and do you ever say a word of thanks ? No , all you can think of is finding fault . I ca n't imagine how you were brought up . Your mother  --  p. 12 GORDON Just leave my mother out of it . I guess she did n't spoil me the way yours did you . Of course , I was n't an only daughter  --  LAURA I wish you had been . Then I would n't have married you . GORDON I suppose you think that if you 'd married Jack Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to see the inside of a kitchen  --  LAURA If Junior grows up with your disposition , all I can say is I hope he 'll never get married . GORDON If he gets married , I hope it 'll be to some girl who understands something about economy  --  LAURA If he gets married , I hope he 'll be man enough not to be always finding fault  --  GORDON Well , he wo n't get married ! I 'll put him wise to what marriage means , fussing like this all the time  --  LAURA Yes , he will get married . He shall get married ! GORDON Oh , this is too absurd  --  LAURA He shall get married , just to be a humiliating example to his father . I 'll bring him up the way a husband ought to be . GORDON In handcuffs , I suppose  --  p. 13 LAURA And his wife wo n't have to sit and listen to perpetual criticism from his mother  --  GORDON If you 're so down on mothers-in-law , it 's queer you 're anxious to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be vulgar . I dare say you ca n't help it . GORDON Great Scott , what did you think marriage was like , anyway ? Did you expect to go through life having everything done for you , without a little hard work to make it interesting ? LAURA Is it necessary to shout ? GORDON Now let me tell you something . Let 's see if you can ratify it from your extensive observation of life . Is there anything in the world so cruel as bringing up a girl in absolute ignorance of housework , believing that all her days she 's going to be waited on hand and foot , and that marriage is one long swoon of endearments  --  LAURA There 's not much swooning while you 're around . GORDON Why , I believe you actually think your life is wrecked if you are n't being petted and praised every minute . You pretend to think marriage is so sacred and yet you 're buffaloed by a few greasy dishes . I like my kind of sacredness better than yours , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be performed before an altar , but before a kitchen sink . p. 14 LAURA ( furiously ) : I ought to have known that oil and water wo n't mix . I ought to have known that a vulgar , selfish , conceited man could n't make a girl happy who was brought up in a refined family . I was a Sheffield , and why I ever became a Johns is more than I can imagine . Johns  --  I suppose that 's camouflage for Jones . You 're too common , too ordinary , to know when you 're lucky . You get a charming , aristocratic wife and expect her to grub along like a washer-woman . You try to crush all the life and spirit out of her . You ought to have married an icebox  --  that 's the only thing in this house you 're really attentive to . GORDON Now listen  --  LAURA ( will not be checked ) : Talk about being spoiled  --  why , your mother babies you so , you think you 're the only man on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tries so hard and gets all fagged out in the office and struggles so nobly to support his family ! I wonder how you 'd like to run this house and bear a child and take care of it and shuffle along with an ignoramus for a maid and then cook a big dinner and be sneered at and never a word of praise . All you can think of is picking over the garbage pail and finding fault  --  GORDON ( like a fool ) : I did n't find fault . I found some good food being wasted . p. 15 LAURA All right , if you love the garbage pail better than you do your wife , you can live with it . ( Flings her dish towel on the floor and exits into dining room . ) ( GORDON stands irresolutely at the sink , and makes a few gloomy motions among the unfinished dishes . He Aglares at the garbage can . Then he carefully gathers those portions of food that he had chosen as being still usable , contemplates them grimly , then puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the plate in the icebox . He takes the garbage can and puts it outside the porch door . He returns into the kitchen , but then a sudden fit of anger seizes him . ) GORDON It 's always the way ! ( Tears off apron , throws it on the floor , and goes out on porch , slamming door . ) ( After a brief pause , the door at the rear , opening onto the back stairs , is cautiously opened , and Mrs. SHEFFIELD enters quietly . She takes one swift look around the disordered kitchen , picks up dish towel and apron from the floor , and sets to work rapidly to clean up . Then the back-stairs door is again opened in the same stealthy way , and Mrs. JOHNS enters . The two ladies seem to take each other 's measure with instinctive shrewdness , and fall into a silent , businesslike team play in putting things to rights . Mrs. JOHNS takes charge at the sink , and the remaining dishes spin under her capable hands . Mrs. SHEFFIELD takes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on the shelves . There is unconscious comedy in the trained precision and labor-saving method of their actions , which are synchronized so that every time Mrs. JOHNS holds out a washed dish , Mrs. SHEFFIELD is moving back from the cabinet , ready to receive it . They work like automatons . For perhaps two minutes not a word is said , and the two seem , by searching side glances , to be probing each other 's mood. ) p. 16 MRS . JOHNS If it was n't so tragic I 'd laugh . ( A pause , during which they work busily . ) MRS . SHEFFIELD If it was n't so comic I 'd cry . ( Another pause . ) I guess it 's my fault . Poor Laura , I 'm afraid I have spoiled her . MRS . JOHNS My fault , I think . Two mothers-in-law at once is too much for any young couple . I did n't know you were here , or I would n't have come . MRS . SHEFFIELD Laura is so dreadfully sensitive , poor child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . You know he 's trying to get promoted to the sales department , and I suppose it tells on his nerves  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD If Laura could afford to have a nurse to help her with the baby , she would n't get so exhausted  --  MRS . JOHNS Gordon says he wants to take out some more insurance , that 's why he worries so about economy . It is n't for himself ; he 's really very unselfish  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD ( a little tartly ) : Still , I do think that sometimes  --  ( They pause and look at each other quickly . ) My gracious , we 'll be at it ourselves if we do n't look out ! ( She goes to the clotheshorse and rearranges the garments on it . She holds up a Lilliputian shirt , and they both smile. ) p. 17 MRS . JOHNS That darling baby ! I hope he wo n't have poor Gordon 's quick temper . It runs in the Johns family , I 'm afraid . I was an Armstrong before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper was until I married  --  either my own or his . MRS . SHEFFIELD I was a Thomson  --  Thomson without the p , you know , from Rhode Island . All families are hot tempered . All husbands ' families , anyway . MRS . JOHNS Gordon 's father used to say that Adam and Eve did n't know when they were well off . He said that was why they called it the Garden of Eden . MRS . SHEFFIELD Why ? MRS . JOHNS Because there was no mother-in-law there . MRS . SHEFFIELD Poor children , they have such a lot to learn ! I really feel ashamed , Mrs. Johns , because Laura is an undisciplined little thing , and I 'm afraid I 've always petted her too much . She had such a lot of attention before she met Gordon , and was made so much of , it gave her wrong ideas . MRS . JOHNS I wish Gordon was a little younger ; I 'd like to turn him up and spank him . He 's dreadfully stubborn and tactless  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . Laura was having such a good time as a girl , I was always afraid she 'd have a hard awakening when she married . But Mr. Sheffield had a good deal of money at that time , and he used to say , " She 's only young once . Let her enjoy herself . " p. 18 MRS . JOHNS My husband was shortsighted , too . He had had to skimp so that he brought up Gordon to have a terror of wasting a nickel . MRS . SHEFFIELD Very sensible . I wish Mr. Sheffield had had a little more of that terror . I shall have to tell him what his policy has resulted in . But really , you know , when I heard them at it , I could hardly help admiring them . ( With a sigh . ) It brings back old times ! MRS . JOHNS So it does ! ( A pause . ) But we ca n't let them go on like this . A little vigorous quarreling is good for everybody . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . MRS . SHEFFIELD They 're awfully ingenious . They were even bickering about Junior 's future mother-in-law . I suppose she 's still in school , whoever she may be ! MRS . JOHNS Being a mother-in-law is almost as painful as being a mother . MRS . SHEFFIELD I think every marriage ought to be preceded by a treaty of peace between the two mothers . If they understand each other , everything will work out all right . MRS . JOHNS You 're right . When each one takes sides with her own child , it 's fatal . MRS . SHEFFIELD ( lowering her voice ) : Look here , I think I know how we can make them ashamed of themselves . Where are they now ? p. 19 MRS . JOHNS ( goes cautiously to dining-room door , and peeps through ) : Laura is lying on the couch in the living room . I think she 's crying  --  her face is buried in the cushions . MRS . SHEFFIELD Splendid . That means she 's listening with all her ears . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think he 's walking around the garden  --  MRS . JOHNS ( quietly ) : If we were to talk a little louder he 'd sit on the back steps to hear it  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD Exactly . Now listen ! ( They put their heads together and whisper ; the audience does not hear what is said . ) MRS . JOHNS Fine ! Oh , that 's fine ! ( Mrs. SHEFFIELD whispers again , inaudibly . ) But wait a moment . Do n't you think it would be better if I praise Laura and you praise Gordon ? They wo n't expect that , and it might shame them  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD No , no ! Do n't you see  --  ( Whispers again , inaudibly . ) MRS . JOHNS You 're right . Cunning as serpents and harmless as doves  --  ( They carefully set both doors ajar. ) p. 20 MRS . SHEFFIELD I only hope we wo n't wake the baby  --  ( They return to the task of cleaning up , and talk very loudly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dessert plates go ? MRS . SHEFFIELD On this shelf . MRS . JOHNS You 're here so much more often than I , naturally you know Laura 's arrangements better . MRS . SHEFFIELD It 's a lucky thing I am here . I do n't know what poor Laura would do without me at such a dreadful time  --  MRS . JOHNS Poor Laura ! I should say she 's very fortunate , such a good husband  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD I think it 's rather sad for a girl who has had as much as she has to come down to this  --  MRS . JOHNS It 's perfectly wonderful how Gordon has got on in business  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD He ought to , with such a lovely home , run like a clock  --  MRS . JOHNS Yes  --  an alarm clock . MRS . SHEFFIELD Well , I 'm not going to see my daughter 's happiness ruined  --  MRS . JOHNS I always knew he 'd make some girl a fine husband  --  p. 21 MRS . SHEFFIELD Perhaps . But he seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit to be bullied  --  MRS . JOHNS Well , perhaps it was all a mistake . Poor Gordon , he works so hard . I believe his hair is going white over his ears already . MRS . SHEFFIELD Stuff ! That 's lather from where he shaved this morning . He 's too slovenly to wash it off . MRS . JOHNS It is n't right that a young man should have to slave the way he does  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD ( apparently in a passion ) : Do you think that business slavery can compare to household slavery ? I think it 's heart-rending to see an attractive girl like Laura shut up in a poky little house doing drudgery and tending a baby . Think of it , having to take care of her own baby ! Why , it 's an outrage . If Gordon was half a man , he 'd get her a trained baby nurse so she would n't have to look at the poor little thing  --  MRS . JOHNS ( scathingly ) : Yes , how sad that Gordon should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs scientific attention . MRS . SHEFFIELD Poor darling Laura  --  she never ought to have had a baby . MRS . JOHNS Gordon is too intellectual to be bothered with these domestic details . He ought to be able to concentrate on his work . p. 22 MRS . SHEFFIELD ( coming close to Mrs. JOHNS , feigning great rage , but grimacing to show it is merely acting ) : Well , if you do n't think my daughter is good enough for your son , I can always take her home with me . I guess I can find room for her and we can put the child in an institution . ( Both nearly laugh , but recover themselves . ) MRS . JOHNS Do n't worry . I 'll take the child . He 's a Johns anyway , not a Sheffield . And you just watch Gordon , when he 's relieved of all this family worry and quarreling . He 'll make his mark in the world . He 's too fine to be tied down by a wife that does n't understand him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to hear this . My sweet , clever , attractive , economical , sensible little girl , free at last . Her married life has been a nightmare . That great , hulking , selfish man has tried to trample all the joy out of her . He sha n't do it . MRS . JOHNS I never heard of a young husband as self-sacrificing as Gordon . I do n't believe he ever goes out for an evening with other men , and he never spends anything on himself  --  MRS . SHEFFIELD I think the way Laura runs her little home is just wonderful . See how she struggles to keep her kitchen in order  --  this miserable , inconvenient little kitchen  --  no gas , no pantry , no decent help . I think it 's terrible she has had to put up with so much  --  ( They pause , and listen at the dining-room door . The kitchen is now spick and span . Mrs. JOHNS makes a gesture to indicate that LAURA is taking it all in , off stage. ) p. 23 MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . SHEFFIELD Yes . As Laura 's mother , I ca n't let her go on like this . A husband , a home , and a baby  --  it 's enough to ruin any woman . MRS . JOHNS It 's only fair to both sides to end it all . I never heard of such brutal hardships . Gordon ca n't fight against these things any longer . Throwing away a soupbone and three slices of bread ! I wonder he does n't go mad . MRS . SHEFFIELD We 've saved them just in time . ( They look at each other knowingly , with the air of those who have done a sound bit of work . Then they stealthily open the door at the rear , and exeunt up the back stairs . ) ( There is a brief pause ; then the dining-room door opens like an explosion , and LAURA bursts in . She stands for a moment , wild-eyed , stamps her foot in a passion . Then she seizes one of the baby shirts from the rack , and drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buries her head in her arms , concealing the shirt . Enter GORDON , from porch . He stands uncertainly , evidently feeling like a fool . ) GORDON I 'm sorry , I  --  I left my pipe in here . ( Finds it by the sink . ) LAURA ( her face still hidden ) : Oh , Gordie , was it all a mistake ? p. 24 GORDON ( troubled , pats her shoulder tentatively ) : Now listen , Creature , do n't . You 'll make yourself sick . LAURA I never thought I 'd hear such things  --  from my own mother . GORDON I never heard such rot . They must be mad , both of them . LAURA Then you were listening , too  --  GORDON Yes . Why , they 're deliberately trying to set us against each other . LAURA They would n't have dared speak like that if they had known we could hear . Gordon , I do n't think it 's legal  --  GORDON I 'm afraid the law does n't give one much protection against one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . I am spoiled , and I am silly , and I am extravagant  --  GORDON Do n't be silly , darling . That 's crazy stuff . I 'm not overworked , and even if I were I 'd love it , for you  --  LAURA I do n't want a nurse for Junior . I would n't have one in the house . ( Sits up , disheveled , and displays the small shirt she has been clutching . ) Gordon , I 'm not an amateur ! I love that baby and I am scientific . I keep a chart of his weight every week . p. 25 GORDON Yes . I know , ducky , Gordon understands . Soon we 'll be able to buy that scale you want , and we wo n't have to weigh him on the meat balance . LAURA Nobody can take away my darling baby  --  GORDON It was my fault , dear . I am obstinate and disagreeable  --  LAURA I 'll speak to Ethel about the garbage  --  GORDON Ethel 's all right . We 're lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work too hard . You know you 're all I have ( a sob ) since Mother 's gone back on me . GORDON ( patting her ) : I think it 's frightful , the things they said . What are they trying to do , break up a happy home ? LAURA We are happy , are n't we ? GORDON Well , I should say so . Did you ever hear me complain ? ( Takes her in his arms . ) LAURA No , Gordie . It was cruel of them to try to make trouble between us ; but , perhaps , some of the things they said  --  GORDON Were true ? LAURA Well , not exactly true , dear , but  --  interesting ! Your mother is right , you do have a hard time , and I 'll try  --  p. 26 GORDON ( stops her ) : No , your mother is right . I 've been a brute  --  LAURA I 'm lucky to have such a husband  --  ( They are silent a moment . ) GORDON I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ? GORDON Suppose we have something to eat ? LAURA ( happily ) : Good idea . Quarreling always makes me hungry . ( They go to the icebox . ) I did n't really get any supper to speak of ; I was worrying about everything so  --  GORDON ( opening icebox ) : You mean dinner , honey  --  among refined people ! LAURA Do n't be a tease . Come on , we 'll have a snack  --  ( She discovers GORDON 'S plate of leftovers . ) GORDON Throw out that junk  --  I was idiotic to save it . LAURA No , Gordie , you were quite right . We must save everything we can . Four or five heads of lettuce would make a new shirt for Junior . GORDON ( bewildered ) : Lettuce ? p. 27 LAURA I mean , if we saved that much , it would make enough money to buy him a new little vest . He 's getting so enormous  --  ( She puts plate of leftovers on the table , with some other cold food . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sit down at table . ) LAURA ( thoughtfully ) : You know , Gordie , we must n't let them know we heard them .
