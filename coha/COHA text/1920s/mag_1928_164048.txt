EDEN-Murray Sheehan-Dutton ( $2 ) . " When Adam delved and Eve span , who was then the gentleman ? " The gentleman was Author Murray Sheehan who , so intimately has he delved into the domestic relations of the primates , must certainly have been there . This book , although it lacks the lightness of famed John Erskine 's <P> Adam and Eve , the black and elaborate magic of James Branch Cabell 's Something About Eve , should please readers of Shaw 's Back to Methuselah . The volume is not without a certain philosophic realism . Anthropomorphic deities grow ponderously chatty over the direction of human destinies . Nonetheless Author Sheehan , after working for years , has produced a novel which treats of gods and men with such tenuous charm that one is almost sure the writer must have drowsed in Paradise .
