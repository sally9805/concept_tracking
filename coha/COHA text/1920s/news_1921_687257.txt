txt Out of the cloud of mystery and secrecy which those directing the Washington conference threw about the negotiating of the four-power treaty comes the apparent fact that the United States , with Great Britain and France , has undertaken , so long as the agreement would remain In effect , to apply to the islands constituting the Japanese Empire the same course of protective procedure that the language of the treaty plainly extends to the outlying island possessions of all the contracting powers . The ratification of the treaty , according to this con ! , truction , might in an extreme case result in the United States giving to Japan the degree of protection which was proposed for France in the tripartite treaty which President Wilson negotiated at Paris , but did not trans:ait to the Senate . Article I of the treaty begins : " The Ugh Contracting Parties agree as be : ween themselves to respect their rights n relation to their insular possessions Ind insular dominions in the region of : he Pacific Ocean . " It can now be stated that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of Japan proper , as well as to her separate island possessions . That was understood among ? he diplomats during the negoiiaions , and the point of view is fully ' ceepted by the American negotiators , . ecretary of State Hughes , Senator Lodge , Elihu Root and Senator Underwood . Article II . of the four-power treaty provides that , in case of aggression by rai outside power , the contracting pow ? s shall intervene to meet the exigeni : : s of the situation . Inasmuch as the " rights " of any nation with regard to any given territory certainly include .. - overeignty over that territory , and in:t =much as the treaty is intended to include the territory of Japan proper , : he treaty , it is held , obviously constiietes a promise to Japan that , if any attack is directed against the islands which make up the empire , the other three powers will make it their business to consider the matter . No Pledge by Japan to Same Purport . The treaty carries no such promise by Japan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these being neither " insular possessions " nor " in4ular dominions . " She does not promto come to America 's aid in the event an attack on this country . The treaty also carries no such promise by Japan with respect to England or France . A realization of this cunsti uction of the four-power treaty would indicate that Japan has obtained a good price for giving up her claim to the maintenance of the Anglo-Japanese alliance . It is true that Japan promises to respect and to help maintain American rights in the Philippines and our other Pacific islands . She promises the same with regard to Australia , New Zealand and the other islands of the British Empire in the Pacific . She promises the same with respect to Fruneli islands in the Pacific . But Japan , an island ? ? npire , is the only party to the agreement , it is held , which gains from it a . definite promise in regard to her main territory . The four-power treaty , applying to islands in the Pacific , does not protect Japan its her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get with regard to Manchuria , one must await tilt , announcement of the nine-power treaty with regard to China , which is now being negotiated . The Senate debate on the treaty Monday showed clearly that the Senators did not consider that the treaty term of " insular possessions " included the islands forming the Japanese Empire . Senator Borah said tonight that he did not understand it in Chat way and a perusal of the remarks of Senator Poindexter ' shows that he stated emphatically that the treaty contained no guarantee of the territorial integrity of any of the four powers . The new four-power treaty , under this construction , might shield Japan against " aggressive action of any power . " That this provision is not theoretical and devoid of possibilities of conflict may be shown by citing the case of gaktialin , the island to the north of the Japanese group . the southern half of which is owned by Japan and the northern half of which belongs to Russia , but is now occupied by Japan . Were it to come to pass that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the northern half of the island to try to retake it , anu %etc tue oy . utable manoeuvres , staged on the southern half , it might well be that the situation would come within the terms of the treaty . In any conflict into which Japan might - nter her rights on her home territory ' might easily be " threatened by the aggressive action of any other power , " to ' Ise the words of the beginning of Article IL of the four-power treaty . The treaty , which has now been signed , excludes Germany from the Pacific , so far as the islands now held by the four powers go . Japan-is confirmed in the possession of the North Pacific islands which Germany , lost in the war . The British Dominions of Australia and New Zealand are confirmed in their possession as mandataries of the former German islands in the South Pacific . The four-power trcaty.does not include the islands owned by Holland or Portugal . Suppose that Germany could persuade either of these countries to cede some of its islands to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent relations with Germany were those of enemies , should object that Germany 's re-entrance into the Pacific ? they have blamed their action in leasing Chinese territory in 1898 on G ? trinany 's aggressive action in the Far East ? affected their interests in insular possessions . suppose Germany by that time had succeeded in her dr .. : am of dominating Russia  --  one of the greatest international pols.bil.tlea existing  --  and suppose that China and Russia found some way to put into effect the results of their common hatred of , Japan  --  suppose a lot of other circumstances in the same category , and dine see in the treaty the possible ' effects of entanglement . Compared ' Witlt League Pledge . The obligations of America may be considered with regard to Japan under the four-power treaty and hypothetically under the covenant of the League of Nations . Article X. of tho covenant says that the members of the League .. " undertake to respect and preserve against external aggression " the territorial integrity and political independence of all members of the League . Under Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three nations undertake to " respect their rights in relation to their insular posscss.ons and insular dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean . " mean " territorial integrity and political Rights ' must independence " if it means anything . Therefore , under the four-power treaty , it is held , the United States agrees to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of Japan . in Article IL it is said that if the " said rights , " in this case obviously Including the territorial integrity and political independence of Japan , " are . hreatened by the aggressive action of any other power , the high contracting parties shall communicate with one another fully And frankly in order to arrive at an understanding as to the most efficient measures to . be taken , jointly or separately , to meet the exigencies of the particular situation . ' Article X. or ale League Covenant says : " In case of any such aggression or in case of threat or danger of such aggression , the council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-power Treaty amounts to America . giving Japan the promise which she would give to protect her territory under Membership in the League . There is , however , a difference in the working of the two pledges . The Covenant provides in Article XVII. that in the event of a dispute between a member of the League and a country which is not a member the outside nation shall be invited to come into the League temporarily to state its case and receive a chance to prove that it is right . The provis:ons of the four-power treaty arc more simple . There is no provision for the outside nation stating its case . Article II . says nothing about hearing the other side . It says that the four powers shall meet and see what is to be done " if the said rights are threatened by the aggressive action of any other power . " The League Covenant says that if the outside power should refuse to come and talk matters over . it shall be blockaded . The . four-power treaty does not say what would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
