txt Battling Siki , the brunette fighter from Senegal , who is alleged to train on hard liquor and blows from a hammer on the sconce , has laid the idol of France , Georges Carpentier , in the rosin , and thereby lifted himself to fame and probable fortune , lie rises as another dark cloud , considerably bigger than a man 's hand , upon the horizon of our Mr. Dempsey 's future . That makes two clouds which threaten to deprive Dempsey of sunlight for a period of ten seconds or more . ' The first is Mr. Wills , who , in bulk at least , is much more menacing - than the battling Sene , galeie . We have long pined to see Dempsey either obliterate that cloud or take a definite place in itishadow . But so far he has avoided it . And now comes another cloud , smaller , but apparently oven more dense . It begins to look like a. storm . It Dempsey does n't want to get soaked he will retire indoors or put up'an umbrella . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color . Slid follows so closely upon the successes of Mustapha Kemal , the independence of Egypt , the rise of Poncho Villa , flyweight , not bandit , and the imminence of King Feisal 's restoration . Ills victory over Georges is probably being celebrated in the jungle in a manner somewhcit similar to the Persian and Arabian and Indian celebrations of Kemal Pasha 's victory . If the league of nations could be called upon to control him , all might be well . But it probably would not function in his card any better than It does in Asia Minor . Therefore other means must be sought . Wo have wanted to see Wills meet Dempsey . But we are willing to . forego that if he will meet Mi . We could bet then as we shall bet on New York to win the world 's baseball championship . There would be no. racial uprising after that . Later we might suggest timidly that Dempsey meet the winner . That certainly would save him one clash with a b/ack man . And It , he won , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain open , and the league of rations might survive .
