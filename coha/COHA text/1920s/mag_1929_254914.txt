General Crack ( Warner ) . A fairly successful effort has been made to bring speed and glitter to this costume romance . It has all been expertly tailored for John Barrymore 's profile , for his bark , his meditative scowl , his glance of an amorous lion , his strides in high , patent-leather boots . On a white charger he leads his mercenaries into battle and pushes back with long , stiffened fingers the cloaks attached to various 18th Century uniforms . He is a soldier of fortune who earns his living fighting wars for popinjay princes and who takes a dislike to his current employer because of a remark the latter has passed about his ( Crack 's ) mother . Best shot : Crack , at the battle front , making sissified King Leopold ( Lowell Sherman ) drop a handkerchief as a signal for shooting an officer . <P> Untamed ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . Any picture acted by so handsome a young woman as Joan Crawford is not hard to watch , even one so foolish as Untamed . There were possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a South American jungle becoming a social success in a modern U. S. city . These possibilities were neglected ; Untamed becomes a routine , highly improbable love story built around the man Miss Crawford meets on the boat coming north . Except for a song in The Hollywood Revue , it is the first time her voice has been photographed . She sings with a deep , throaty twang ; even her mutterings as Bingo , the jungle girl , do not spoil the effect of her natural vivacity and physical outlines . Silliest shot : fistfight between Bingo 's sweetheart and another suitor in a ballroom during a fashionable party . <P> The New Babylon ( Amkino ) . In mood and technique , this makes pictures like General Crack look like amateur theatricals , but it is inferior as entertainment . The difference is a matter of intention . The Amkino producers were not interested in making this product salable but in expressing a dogma passionately clear and important to the patriots of new Russia . The setting in France of 1870 is adventitious . The storyless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first coherently to show what happened in the rebellion that followed the German invasion , becomes disordered and tedious . Best shot : French troops stimulated to attack doomed rebels by the ironical singing of " La Marseillaise . " <P> Caucasian Love ( Amkino ) . There is further angry propaganda in this one , directed now at the Cossacks whom the Tsar sent to drive the people of Tersk out of their village . The situation is presented less consciously and vehemently than in The New Babylon ( see above ) . Good shots : the illiterate Chechens signing a document by pressing it with thumbs first rubbed on a sooty pot ; a crowd of people on a mountain road ; villagers squatting with bowed heads in the road as they await a charge by cavalry .
