The scene is the living-room in the suburban home of DULCINEA and her husband  --  in Westchester County , within commuting distance of New York . It is a room that is splashing rather than merely striking . The furniture , for no particular reason , is old Italian , but most of it is hidden beneath beautiful and variously colored batiks and drapes . Over the divan , for example , is a golden brocade , and on it three blue pillows . Across the grand piano is a red drape , and on it a blue book . The window curtains are also of blue ; there are two or three striking lamps in the background , and the tinted walls are covered here and there by a couple of good-looking tapestries . There are no pictures , for DULCINEA is nothing if not modern . On a platform at the rear , where the stairs begin to ascend , stands a great blue urn , filled with hydrangeas . On a cabinet at one side is an iridescent bowl containing tea roses ; at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . In a word , the room is DULCY . If there were a telephone DULCY would have it covered with a cute little doll  --  but this is a play without a telephone In addition to the stairs there are three means of exit  --  at the rear are French windows which open onto the lawn and DULCY 's cherished garden ; at the right is a door that leads to the interior of the house , and at the left another that leads to the hallway and the outer door The time is five o'clock on a Friday afternoon in late summer . The French windows are closed , subduing somewhat the light in the room . The rising curtain reveals WILLIAM PARKER , DULCY 's brother , stretched out in an easy chair , reading a magazine . After a moment HENRY , the buttler , enters . He goes up to the windows , opens them , and comes back to BILL HENRY Mr. Smith has just come in sir . p. 3 PARKER after a pause , not looking up from his magazine.Yeh ?

PARKER observing a folded newspaper in GORDON 's pocketWhat 's that  --  the Sun ? SMITH No  --  Post . He hands him the paper  --  BILL drops into a chair with it . There is a considerable pause while BILL reads and GORDON indulges in another yawnDulcy not home yet , huh ? PARKER reading the paper at the same timeNo .

SMITH About half the trade . I 'm to get sixteen and two-thirds per cent of the stock of the combine . PARKER Just for the factory ? SMITH unwillinglyWell , the plant and the pearl formula . p. 7 PARKER Oh , I see . SMITH justifying himselfOf course , that means a cash payment when the papers are signed , and that will just about see me through . PARKER You think that 's enough  --  sixteen and two-thirds ?

We 're only too glad to have you . DULCINEA enters through the French window . She is dressed in a gown that is just a bit too much for an afternoon gathering ; she carries an armful of flowers , and she is in her customary bubbling good humor p. 15 DULCINEA Hello , everybody !

Either you have it , or you have n't it , and there you are ! PARKER Mr. Sterrett is in the advertising business  --  not the music business .

DULCINEA Oh , several places , and this afternoon he was at Mrs. Kennedy 's and played for us . He had a lot of invitations , and he accepted mine . DULCY returns to the table and replaces the newspaper neatly , then gives the sofa cushions a touch . GORDON follows her , speaking as he goes SMITH But , my dear , having this man here with Forbes  --  how do we know it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Dyck 's a business man too , darling .

Has it got to do with Forbes ? DULCINEA Yes , darling , and it 's something that 's going to help you a great deal with Mr. Forbes .

That 's why I 'm doing it . SMITH But , Dulcy  --  DULCINEA Well , Mr. Forbes is taking advantage of you and I 'm not going to let him  --  that 's all ! SMITH desperatelyBut that is n't the point ! In the position that I am I have to go ahead with it . I would n't want anything to happen . Pleading affectionatelyDo n't you see , dear , if I 'm not in that merger , I 'll lose  --  everything !

I was reading where Dr. Crane said it in the Globe the other day  --  by worrying you can catch things . HENRY opens the door . The voices of the FORBESES are heard ; they enter . First , MR . FORBES  --  then MRS . FORBES  --  then ANGELA . The greetings are ad lib . DULCY shakes hands with each , passing them to GORDON , who does likewise DULCINEA Well , here is Mr. Forbes now , and Mrs. Forbes ! How charming you look ! Green 's your color ! She turns to GORDON to tell him about itGreen 's her color , darling ! And Angela ! ! You 've come to see me at last ! My , such red cheeks ! Just like two ripe apples ! FORBES is already deep in business talk with SMITH , but DULCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herDid you have a nice ride out from the city ? Awfully pretty , is n't it  --  Westchester ? FORBES agrees with a nod  --  is about to turn back to SMITHDid you come out the short way or the long way ? p. 33 FORBES it is already evident that DULCY is going to be just the person for himAh  --  what was that ? DULCINEA Did you come out the short way or the long way ? FORBES Ah  --  let me see . A pauseDo you know , Eleanor ? MRS . FORBES his second wife ; a very feminine person of about thirty-five ; good looking and a bit flightyWhat , dear ? FORBES Mrs. Smith was just asking if  --  DULCINEA Did you come out the short way or the long way ? MRS . FORBES Which is the way through Hartsdale ? DULCINEA Oh , that 's the short way  --  you should have come the long way . No , I think that is the long way , is n't it ? Hartsdale ?  --  Yes . No  --  SMITH diplomaticallyWell , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ways are awfully pretty . She has said this to MRS . FORBES , and FORBES and SMITH have turned immediately to each other to renew their conversation . They have n't a chanceThough I do n't suppose you got much chance to look at the scenery , did you , Mr. Forbes  --  driving the car ? Do n't you think driving is awfully hard work , Mr. Forbes ? p. 34 FORBES Why , no , I rather like it . DULCINEA Like it ? Really ! Oh ! Well , it would n't do if all our tastes were alike , would it ? Turns away just as HENRY entersHenry , take the things right up  --  you know the rooms . DULCY turns to MRS . FORBESyou and your husband are to have the shell-pink suite . It looks just like a bridal suite . MRS . FORBES giggles and DULCY laughs with her The bridal suite ! Oh , Mr. Forbes  --  She goes to himMr . Forbes  --  you and your wife are going to have the bridal suite ! FORBES tries to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there you are !

HENRY goes DULCINEA Angie is going to have the cutest little room of all ! Just wait till you see it ! ANGELA Oh , thank you . VAN DYCK comes downstairs DULCINEA turning ANGELA away as if for a confidenceAnd wait till you see what else I 've got for you ! You 'll be surprised , and  --  oh , here 's Mr. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyck ! MRS . FORBES How do you do ? DULCINEA And Miss Forbes  --  VAN DYCK bowingMiss Forbes ! ANGELA bows DULCINEA And Mr. Forbes  --  Mr. Schuyler Van Dyck of New York . VAN DYCK C. Roger Forbes ? FORBES I 'm certainly glad to know you , Mr. Van Dyck . I believe I know something of your interests . In fact , I just missed meeting you at the International Metals conference last week . VAN DYCK Yes ? Well , I hope we can have a little chance to talk down here . I 'm very much interested in jewelry . p. 36 DULCINEA with a triumphant look at her husbandYou see , Gordon ? FORBES aware that something is going onWhat 's that ? SMITH Oh , it was just  --  ah  --  that is , Mrs. Smith thought  --  HENRY comes downstairs DULCINEA Oh , we 're all forgetting Mr.  --  What's-his-name  --  in the library  --  a gentleman to see you , Mr. Forbes , on business . Henry , tell the gentleman in the library to come in . HENRY departs again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes  --  Sterrett . ANGELA turns sharply at the mention of the name I took the liberty of leaving word for him to come here  --  I had to get away early . SMITH Why , certainly . DULCINEA And so that you 'll have lots of time to talk business , I 've invited him to stay for dinner . She looks proudly toward her husband as though asking approbation for this remark . GORDON is pleased with her for the first time ANGELA Oh ! Mr. Sterrett is going to stay for dinner ? p. 37 DULCINEA Yes  --  because he 's a friend of yours , Angie , dear . QuicklyAnd because of the business , of course . Well , what do you girls say ? Shall we leave the men to talk business ? Would n't you like to see your rooms ? You have n't been over the house at all , you know . MRS . FORBES Why , we 'd love to . DULCINEA Gordon , darling , you must show Mr. Forbes and the others over the grounds . She is shepherding MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view from the lawn , Mr. Forbes . And do n't forget to show him the garden , darling  --  all our vegetables are out of our own garden , Mr. Forbes . Then later you must see the garden , Mrs. Forbes  --  and Angie . You know , there 's nothing like country life , is there ? Out next to Nature , you know . We 're just gypsies  --  regular gypsies . New York is a wonderful place to visit , but I would n't like to live there . They go up the stairs PARKER breaking the spellAll in favor of the garden , say " Aye . " SMITH Smoke ? FORBES Thanks . He selects a cigar VAN DYCK Thank you . Takes a cigarette . FORBES , after a glance around the room , heads for a stiff chair p. 38 SMITH indicating an easy chairOh , sit here , Mr. Forbes ! FORBES Thanks  --  I prefer a stiff chair  --  my back , you know . STERRETT returns STERRETT Ah ! Good afternoon , Chief ! FORBES Hello , Sterrett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but  --  STERRETT Not at all  --  not at all ! Particularly , as Mr. Smith has insisted on my staying to dinner . Has Angela come ? FORBES patting him on backOh , yes , she 's come . You 've . met Mr. Parker ? STERRETT Oh , yes . FORBES And Mr. Schuyler Van Dyck ? STERRETT Mr. Schuyler Van Dyck ? VAN DYCK shaking his handMr . Sterrett . STERRETT I 've heard of you , Mr. Van Dyck . VAN DYCK Yes ? STERRETT crisplyYes , sir . They tell me you have advertising interests , on the q. t . VAN DYCK Well , it 's  --  it 's possible , yes . p. 39 STERRETT I 'm an advertising man myself . VAN DYCK Really ? PARKER helping alongS . S. Q. &amp; L. Agency . STERRETT Yes , I personally handle all of Mr. Forbes ' business . VAN DYCK That so ? STERRETT Yes , sir . I 've made the nation Forbes-conscious . PARKER Forbes  --  what ? STERRETT Forbes-conscious . I have made Forbes Jewelry Products a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful what the younger generation is doing in a business way . SMITH It certainly is . FORBES Why , when I was breaking into business , sir , do you think that a young man like that would have been entrusted with the handling of such important matters ? SMITH No , sir . FORBES No , sir  --  he would not ! Would he , Mr. Parker ? PARKER with a look at STERRETTNo , sir , he would not ! FORBES But to-day , not only is he entrusted with them , but he is actually given the preference over an older man . I find myself doing it . p. 40 STERRETT Oh , I do n't know , Chief , I 'm no unusual specimen  --  that is , so far as my youth is concerned . Mozart was composing at fifteen ; William Cullen Bryant wrote Thanatopsis when he was nineteen ; Homer did part of the Iliad  --  PARKER risingSuppose we all go out and look at the garden ? SMITH Yes , that 's a good idea . FORBES If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SMITH Certainly . FORBES That is , if there 's room . SMITH Oh , plenty . Our car is n't here at present . It 's being repaired . PARKER to VAN DYCKYou must find it rather a relief to get away from business occasionally . VAN DYCK Yes , just to relax . It 's very wonderful . FORBES turning back to VAN DYCKI imagine you 've been kept pretty well tied down lately . All except STERRETT have strolled up to the window VAN DYCK Well , yes  --  to a degree . Of course , I have things pretty well systematized. p. 41 FORBES Of course . SMITH Now , right here at the left is where the garden begins . You can see for yourself  --  They go out through the windows  --  SMITH , FORBES , VAN DYCK and BILL . STERRETT , somewhat puzzled at losing his audience , decides to go along . ANGELA comes down the stairway ANGELA very impersonallyOh , hello , Tom ! STERRETT Angela ! I 'm here , you see ! ANGELA selecting a magazineYes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me ? ANGELA You came to see father , did n't you ? STERRETT Why , no  --  that is  --  yes  --  but  --  ANGELA Have you seen him ? STERRETT Yes , but  --  that was business and  --  ANGELA I know  --  it 's always business with you men . You 're all alike . STERRETT You talk as though you 'd examined the whole city . ANGELA Well , I did know another man who was just like you . p. 42 STERRETT Who is he ? ANGELA looking up from the magazine for first timeOh , do n't be silly . I should n't tell you even if you were n't so rude . I simply say you are all alike . Your idea of romance is to sit in the moonlight and talk about the income tax . STERRETT sitting beside herNow , look here , Angela  --  you know I 'm crazy about you , and I 've told you what I 'll do for you . I 'll devote my entire life to you . ANGELA And give up business ? STERRETT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , would you ? Right at the beginning of my career ! Why , when your father signs these new contracts  --  ANGELA throwing the magazine down beside her and risingContracts ! Bother the contracts ! It 's always contracts ! STERRETT But they mean our future . ANGELA Our future ? I did n't know that we were going to have any ! STERRETT Well , we are ! You just watch me ! I 've always got what I was after in business , and  --  ANGELA Well , I 'm not  --  business ! p. 43 STERRETT I  --  I did n't mean just that , Angela . ANGELA Oh , sometimes I feel that I do n't ever want to talk to another business man in my life ! STERRETT I notice that you do n't mind talking to a moving picture man , though ! ANGELA wheelingWhat do you mean by that ? STERRETT I saw you with that bird Leach at the Biltmore yesterday . ANGELA Well , what of it ? Mr. Leach is a very charming man . STERRETT He 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STERRETT Look here  --  has he been making love to you ? ANGELA Well , at least he has n't been talking business . STERRETT Now look here , Angela  --  ANGELA Oh , Tom , do n't be silly ! If I did n't know any more about girls than you do , I 'd go some place and learn ! That other man talked business , too , and that 's why I  --  what does a girl care about business , and things like that ? She wants something else in her life  --  that 's what makes her a girl ! She wants romance  --  and a thrill  --  and something real  --  and she wants a man to be like all the heroes she ever read about  --  if she cares about him at all ! It may be foolish and all that , but that 's what she wants and she 's bound to have it ! She wants someone to tell her how wonderful she is  --  whether she is or not  --  to sweep her off her feet and  --  carry her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells her that all this has been wastedOh , I 'm going out into the garden ! She flounces through French window . STERRETT follows p. 44 STERRETT Now look here , Angela ! I did n't mean  --  Enter FORBES and SMITH . FORBES looks back after ANGELA and STERRETT FORBES Smart chap , Sterrett . SMITH Yes , he  --  seems to be . FORBES Wide-awake ! That 's what I like about him . SMITH eager to agreeYes , wideawake chaps certainly have an advantage . FORBES blufflyNow , that 's the kind of a man I 'd like for a son-in-law . SMITH mindful of DULCY 'S plansSon-in-law ? FORBES Yes . Good business head . No foolishness , like most young people . Substantial  --  that 's what I mean . Lord knows , Smith , I 'm just as tolerant as anybody , and a little bit more so , but if there is one thing I ca n't stand it 's this frivol-headed , gad-about way of doing things they 've got now-a-days . SMITH Oh , absolutely . Yes , indeed . FORBES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't work . And it 's not just the young people that have notions . The worst of it is that  --  oh , well , what 's the use ! He pausesThat reminds me . I must apologize for not answering that letter of yours . My wife comes into my office occasionally and uses my stenographer  --  the one that writes English . He tries to appear half-jokingAll day yesterday . She likes to write little stories and movie scenarios . Of course she never sells them . p. 45 SMITH Well  --  ah  --  probably she 's just  --  seeking self-expression . FORBES Yes , I suppose so . She 's quite young  --  Angela 's step-mother , you know . DULCY and MRS . FORBES come downstairs DULCINEA Come right down , Mrs. Forbes . Well , here we are ! No more business now ! It 's time to play ! To FORBESYou know one thing poor Gordon has never learned is how to play ! He takes everything so seriously . Now , what I like to do is cut loose once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mrs. Forbes ? MRS . FORBES Yes , indeed  --  away from everything . DULCINEA Gordon , darling  --  why do n't you take Mrs. Forbes for a stroll out in the garden before dinner  --  she has n't seen it yet . GORDON realizes this would leave DULCY with FORBESWould n't you like to see it , Mrs. Forbes ? MRS . FORBES Indeed , yes . DULCINEA Gordon ! SMITH turning to MRS . FORBESWhy , of course . MRS . FORBES It 's awfully good of you . You have a beautiful place here . There are some lovely places in Westchester , are n't there ? MRS . FORBES . and GORDON go through the window , GORDON looking back nervously at the possibilities he is leaving p. 46 DULCINEA I 've got the most wonderful day planned out for you to-morrow , Mr. Forbes ! You 're going to play and play and play ! FORBES alarmedMe ! Thank you very much  --  but you know I  --  DULCY Oh , but you play golf , do n't you ? FORBES Well  --  ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  DULCINEA pursuing him You 'll love our links  --  they 're wonderful ! FORBES Yes , but I 've been having a lot of trouble with my back lately and  --  DULCINEA Oh , really ! That 's too bad ! What you need is exercise . It would be the finest thing in the world for you . Now , you play nine holes of golf with Mr. Van Dyck first thing in the morning . FORBES But , really , Mrs. Smith  --  DULCINEA indulgentlyYou remind me so much of Gordon  --  that poor darling . All men are children . You know he gets hardly any exercise at all  --  he works so hard , the poor boy . I do n't suppose he 's told you , Mr. Forbes , but he 's really got a lot of things on hand . FORBES Why , no  --  p. 47 DULCINEA You might just as well know  --  it is n't only the pearl business . He has lots of other interests , too . FORBES What 's that ? DULCINEA It 's really asking too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come into the jewelry combination  --  that is , unless it were made worth his while . DULCY effects her master strokeOf course , if he just got sixteen and two-thirds per cent , he could n't afford to give up all his time to it  --  no ! VAN DYCK and BILL come strolling through the window He 'd have to look after his other things , too , and you 'd be the loser . FORBES Why , I did n't know he had any other  --  Door bell rings DULCINEA Oh , there 's Mr. Leach now ! CallingGordon ! Gordon , bring Angela in ! She sees VAN DYCKAre you having a nice time , Mr. Van Dyck ? We want everybody to have a nice time . GORDON and MRS . FORBES return . HENRY enters to answer the door bell VAN DYCK Oh , delightful ! DULCINEA You 're to play eighteen holes of golf with Mr. Forbes the first thing in the morning . FORBES is delighted p. 48 VAN DYCK That will be splendid ! SMITH Now  --  now , I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose that to-morrow we just let everybody go the way they want to , and  --  Enter HENRY , followed by VINCENT LEACH . DULCY swings down to greet him DULCINEA with great enthusiasmOh , here he is ! LEACH Mrs. Smith , dear lady  --  VINCENT LEACH is young , very languid , a bit effeminate DULCINEA Ladies and gentlemen , this is Mr. Vincent Leach , the great scenario writer ! FORBES looks up , puzzled and annoyed . BILL is merely puzzled . VAN DYCK is politely interested . GORDON is all but crazy with apprehension . MRS . FORBES is quite in her element . DULCY passes LEACH over towards MRS . FORBESMrs . Forbes , Angela 's step mother ! LEACH enthusiasticallyOh , how do you do ! DULCINEA And Mr. Forbes , her real father ! FORBES rises slowly  --  his dislike has been immediate and intense . LEACH does all the bowingAnd Mr. Van Dyck ! They bowYou 've met Gordon , have n't you ? LEACH shakes GORDON 'S handAnd my brother , Willie . p. 49 PARKER Parker  --  William . DULCINEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! Well  --  She leads ANGELA down to LEACH ANGELA Why , Mr. Leach ! LEACH Miss Forbes ! STERRETT with cold emphasisHow do you do , Leach ? LEACH Oh , how are you ? DULCINEA Did n't I tell you I 'd have a surprise for you ? FORBES to ANGELA , as she stands with her hand still in LEACH 'S , to STERRETT 'S great annoyanceOh , then you 've met Mr. Leach before ? ANGELA Oh , yes ! DULCINEA Why , did n't you know about it ? Mr. Leach showed us through his studio the other day . He almost kidnapped your Angela , and made a motion picture star out of her . FORBES not quite succeeding in being pleasant about itOh , is that so ? DULCINEA We saw his new picture being taken . Oh , tell us about it , Mr. Leach ! Whispering loudly to everyoneMr . Leach is a scenario writer  --  a scenario writer . p. 50 LEACH correcting herIf you will pardon me , not scenario writer  --  scenarist  --  really . PARKER in mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . The scenarist of to-day is quite different from the scenario writer of yesterday . DULCINEA in her elementMr . Leach says the motion picture business is still in its infancy . LEACH The surface has hardly been scratched . The possibilities are enormous , and the demand for new people  --  new writers  --  He turns to MRS . FORBESOh ! Mrs. Smith tells me that you are writing for the films , my dear Mrs. Forbes ! MRS . FORBES Well , I 'm  --  trying to  --  LEACH Well , you go on writing  --  do n't give up  --  do n't let anyone discourage you . FORBES turns away with a mild attack of apoplexyThat was my experience . I just kept on and on until  --  well , you see . PARKER What ? DULCINEA in a quick asideYou shut up , Willie ! p. 51 LEACH to MRS . FORBESYes , you just keep on writing . Then generously taking them all inAll of you  --  and go and see the pictures . See them and see them and see them . To MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORBESLearn how they 're made ! Now in my last picture , The Sacred Love  --  you 've all seen that , I take it ? DULCINEA Oh , yes  --  a wonderful picture ! MRS . FORBES Yes ! ANGELA I saw it twice . Once with you , Tom . STERRETT Was that his picture ? LEACH There were some points in that  --  did you see it , Mr. Forbes ? FORBES wild withinNo , I  --  I do n't believe I did . LEACH Really ! You must come to one of our trade showings at the Hotel Astor  --  FORBES What ? LEACH Just a moment . Consults note-bookAt the Hotel Astor , next Tuesday , at 3 : 30 . Of course , it 's  --  it 's only a little thing . We 're going to do some big things later . The possibilities  --  p. 52 PARKER ever helpfulAre enormous . LEACH falling for itOh , very big you 'd be surprised ! Yes , we 're going to do some of Shakespeare 's things next . DULCINEA Shakespeare 's ? Well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes him to pick up the cue SMITH coming toReally ! LEACH Yes , I 'm at work on his continuity now . I was telling my director yesterday  --  I said , you know , Shakespeare had a tremendous feeling for plot . Of course , the dialogue is stilted for modern audiences  --  but then , you do n't have to listen to that in the pictures . But he 's still the master . DULCINEA He 's going to organize his own company next . PARKER Who  --  Shakespeare ? DULCINEA No , Willie ! Mr. Leach . LEACH Yes  --  the Vincent Leach Productions , Inc . The stock will be placed on the open market very soon . DULCINEA Mr. Van Dyck can tell you how to do it ! He owns lots of moving picture companies  --  do n't you , Mr. Van Dyck ? p. 53 LEACH Is that so ? VAN DYCK modestly , as alwaysWell , I 'm interested  --  in a small way . LEACH I 'd enjoy talking to you about it later . To MR . FORBESAnd how about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were interested in pictures ? FORBES turning away and smothering the lineI do n't care a damn about pictures . LEACH not believing his earsWhat 's that ? FORBES I said , I make jewelry . LEACH Well , of course , that 's very necessary too , in its way . FORBES mouth opens  --  GORDON rises hurriedly SMITH Dulcy ! DULCINEA Ah  --  let 's play a rubber of bridge before dinner ! It 's so nice and soothing . Patting LEACH for fear he has been offendedLet me see  --  To MR . FORBESMr . Forbes , you play bridge , do n't you ? FORBES No , I 'm afraid not . DULCINEA Oh , yes , you do  --  you 're just modest . Mr. Forbes  --  She is picking the card players out with cool intentAnd Mr. Sterrett  --  and Gordon  --  And I 'll make the fourth . Mr. Leach .

Of course it does n't matter  --  She continues her chatter , as The scene is the same as Act I ; the time is immediately after dinner , on the same day .

For an appreciable period after the rise of the curtain only the sound of this merry gathering can be heard . Over the others the voice of VINCENT LEACH rings out clearly  --  " I said to Mr. Breitenstein , ' Do n't you worry about those German films . " Then the babble drowns his further remarks DULCY , resplendent in a golden evening dress , presently enters , peering back as though expecting someone to follow her . She beckons excitedly to someone in the other room , and MRS . FORBES enters DULCINEA in excited tonesIs n't he wonderful ? MRS . FORBES also flushed with excitementWho ? DULCINEA Vincent Leach ! BanteringlyAh , you thought I meant Mr. Van Dyck , did n't you ? Ah , ha ! p. 62 MRS . FORBES confusedWhy  --  I did n't know  --  DULCINEA Now , now ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But seriously , he 's mad about her ! MRS . FORBES with just a touch of apprehensionDo you really think so ? DULCINEA And she has n't taken her eyes off him since he arrived ! I tell you , they 're in love ! MRS . FORBES looking offThere is  --  something about him . The only thing is  --  DULCINEA I would n't be surprised if they became engaged  --  right here in my house . Would n't that be nice , after my bringing them together ? MRS . FORBES But you 're sure it 's all right  --  positive that Mr. Leach is  --  DULCINEA Of course , I am  --  he 's just the man for Angela . Ssh ! Here 's Mr. Sterrett ! The two women draw up against the wall as STERRETT enters . His hands are deep in his pockets , and he is sore . He looks back as he enters , then starts across the room . A few steps further he looks back again , as ANGELA 'S laugh is heard . He stalks out the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ! ANGELA comes running on . She is happily excited , being pursued . LEACH follows her , capturing her at the piano , and holding her with her back toward him , giving MRS . FORBES and DULCY a chance to escape into the dining room unseen p. 63 LEACH Now I 've got you ! ANGELA And what are you going to do with me ? LEACH turning her aroundI 'm going to tell you  --  how wonderful you are . ANGELA liking itOh , my ! LEACH You are ! You 're like a beautiful warm dawn  --  just your magic presence  --  VAN DYCK and MRS . FORBES stroll on together ANGELA stopping LEACHSsh ! VAN DYCK But surely if one has a talent it should be developed . ANGELA Shall we sit down ? LEACH makes a gesture towards the chairs by the pianoOh , not there  --  here . She bounces over to the stairs and sits behind the hydrangeas . LEACH takes his place beside her MRS . FORBES convinced by now she is a potential George SandBut I 'm afraid I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting beside herAh , but I 'm sure you 're wrong ! You must be wrong . Enter FORBES and GORDON . All of the men , except STERRETT , are in evening clothes p. 64 FORBES Well , as a straight business proposition I must say  --  He sees his wife with VAN DYCK , and stops shortHuh ! VAN DYCK gets up from the easy chair ! VAN DYCK Sit here , Mr. Forbes . FORBES No , thank you . I prefer a stiff chair ! SMITH Here you are , Mr. Forbes . Enter BILL PARKER Everybody ready for a nice musical evening ? STERRETT , still sulking , comes in silently through the French windows . DULCY enters at the same time , and immediately takes characteristic charge of the situation DULCINEA Well , this is going to be jolly , is n't it ? Let 's have a little light on the subject . She switches on the lightsLet me see  --  Yes , everybody 's here . MRS . FORBES , anxious to relieve the tension maintained by her husband , leaves VAN DYCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love a big house and lots of company . If only it were a winter night , we could gather around the fireplace and tell ghost stories . FORBES has made up his mind to sit and has headed for the stiff chair . DULCY seizes him Oh , no , Mr. Forbes  --  you must take the easy chair  --  that 's for you  --  yes . She pulls him across to it p. 65 FORBES cursing the conventions of chivalryBut I really would rather  --  that is  --  DULCINEA Now , not a word  --  I know you 're polite and want to leave it for me , but I insist on your having it . GORDON tries to head her off but his efforts are unavailing . DULCY forces MR . FORBES into the chair I would n't dream of anyone else 's having it but you . Now sit right in it  --  that 's right  --  way back ! It 's awfully comfortable  --  just the thing after eating . MRS . FORBES has seated herself ; VAN DYCK is entertaining herIt 'll rest you for to-morrow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DULCINEA Yes , did n't you hear us talking about it ? In the afternoon . We 're making up a party to go to the Sound and you 're in it . Enter HENRY with coffee , on a tea wagon . He pushes it across to DULCYWell , who 's for coffee ? Coffee  --  coffee ! BILL has wandered over to the piano and has seated himself . DULCY poursIt 's a lovely ride to the Sound . You 'll go , wo n't you , Mr. Van Dyck ? VAN DYCK with MRS . FORBESWhat 's that ? Oh , yes  --  yes , indeed . p. 66 DULCINEA whisperingYou and Mrs. Forbes can go together . FORBES turns around to locate his wife and daughterI 'll ride with Mr. Forbes . Here you are , Henry . HENRY serves SMITH to FORBESNow this was what I wanted to show you . These are our Number Three 's ; we are turning these out at an extremely low price , and the German formula ca n't touch them . Just examine these . FORBES puts on glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he offers one to FORBES , who refuses DULCINEA We 're going to have a lovely day for it to-morrow . Did you see that sunset ? Angela , you and Mr. Leach are to go along , too . And Mr. Sterrett  --  where is that Mr. Sterrett ? STERRETT behind herI 'm here . DULCINEA Oh ! There you are ! I 'd almost forgotten you . STERRETT submerged in gloomThat 's all right . DULCINEA It 's too bad you ca n't stay over , Mr. Sterrett . I 'm sure you 'd enjoy it . HENRY serves ANGELA and LEACH , who both accept . His offers to BILL and STERRETT are refusedYou know , the paper says rain for to-morrow , but it 's always wrong . I have the worst luck with the weather whenever I go any place . When I take my umbrella it never rains , and if I do n't take it  --  BILL has started on a solo of " Chop Sticks " as an anodyneCome away from the piano , Willie . Mr. Van Dyck is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyck ? p. 67 VAN DYCK Why  --  ah  --  a little later . BILL starts another one-finger solo SMITH If you 'll examine those you 'll see that they are the same grain and luster as the Hammond Number Six . DULCINEA Oh , do stop , Willie ! FORBES Mmm . A pauseAngela ! There is no answerAngela ! ! ANGELA coming toYes , father . FORBES Just let me see those pearls of yours for a minute , will you ? ANGELA Yes , father . ANGELA and LEACH rise . LEACH reaches as if to remove the pearls , but ANGELA hands him her coffee instead and removes the pearls herself . HENRY steps up to ANGELA to relieve her of the pearls . She gives them to him . BILL strikes a bass note three or four times in warning , rising as he does so . DULCY and GORDON rise , their eyes on HENRY . HENRY gives the pearls to FORBES ; DULCY gives a huge sigh of relief . ANGELA and LEACH resume their seat on the bench again . BILL sits again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Mr. Van Dyck  --  it 's your turn ! p. 68 VAN DYCK Oh , really , I  --  I do n't think that I should play . Mr. Forbes and your husband would much prefer to discuss jewelry , I 'm sure . DULCINEA Oh , no , they would n't ! Would you , Mr. Forbes ? He is studying the necklaceMr . Forbes ! FORBES looking upHuh ? DULCINEA Would n't you like to hear Mr. Van Dyck play the piano ? FORBES Oh , yes  --  yes . DULCINEA You see  --  and I know Mrs. Forbes wants you to play  --  do n't you , dear ? MRS . FORBES Oh , yes . DULCINEA And I do ! And Willie  --  Another solo of BILL 'S is obtrudingGet away from the piano , Willie  --  and Mr. Sterrett . Now , Mr. Van Dyck  --  VAN DYCK Well , if you insist . VAN DYCK seats himself and starts to play . The selection is the Chopin Prelude , Op. 28 , No. 4 DULCINEA sectedWhat was that little thing you played at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GORDON and FORBES are discussing jewelry in low tonesNo  --  that was n't it . It 's lovely , though . Carries me right away . GORDON and FORBES become audibleQuiet everybody  --  quiet ! After a look at her they lower their tones , but not enough to satisfy DULCYSsh ! She rattles some noisy bracelets . FORBES turns and looks at her . DULCY giggles at him Oh , Mr. Forbes ! I thought it was my husband . DULCY 'S wandering eyes light upon a box of candy , the wrapping still on it . She makes a weak attempt to turn her eyes away from it and then picks it up and tears off its paper noisily , whispering across to MRS . FORBESCandy that Mr. Leach brought ! Yes  --  was n't it nice of him ? She removes cover and ribbon , opens box and offers some to MRS . FORBES and STERRETT in hoarse whisperTake some ! They signal refusal . She reaches it towards FORBESWant some candy , Mr. Forbes ? FORBES looks around , but does not understand . DULCY creeps across to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is heavily sibilant , FORBES , unable to hear , leans toward her . She reaches the box further toward him . After seeing the candy he refuses p. 69 FORBES No , no , thank you . Returns to his chair . GORDON coughs and is hushed . DULCY takes a piece of candy from the box and tastes it ; does not like it , looks about to make sure no one is observing  --  replaces it . BILL rises , comes down and selects two pieces DULCINEA Ssh ! PARKER whisperingWhat ? DULCINEA Ssh ! The music suddenly stops . DULCY drops candy and applauds PARKER Ssh ! The music begins again DULCINEA in a whisper to MRS . FORBESI thought he had finished . VAN DYOK strikes the remaining chords . DULCY risesLovely ! ! Long drawn out MRS . FORBES It was adorable ! ANGELA I loved it . LEACH It was  --  beautiful . It made me think of Araby and the moon-soaked desert . He loses himself in the desert for a secondDid you see The Virgin of Stamboul ? PARKER promptlyNo. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . LEACH That 's too bad . You know , some of my new picture is being laid in the desert , and that would be wonderful music for it . DULCINEA getting an inspirationOh ! PARKER What 's the matter ? DULCINEA I have an idea . BILL moves toward the doorWhy not have Mr. Leach tell us the story of his new picture , while Mr. Van Dyck plays the music for it ? SMITH springing upBut  --  but , Dulcy  --  DULCINEA It 'll be just like a moving-picture theatre ! LEACH with fake modestyOh , but really  --  I do n't think that I should  --  of course , it would be interesting . ANGELA Oh , please tell it , Vincent ! She gives a look at STERRETT STERRETT Yes , do ! Turns away MRS . FORBES I 'd love to hear it , and so would my husband . She throws her husband a look p. 71 DULCINEA Well , now you ca n't refuse . LEACH with no thought of refusingSince you demand it . DULCINEA Oh , good ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the piano ! They all take seatsMr . Leach , you tell him what kind of music you want ! BILL stands motionless and noiselessBe quiet , Willie . Now , I 'll sit here . PARKER Mr. Leach . A pauseHow many reels is this picture ? LEACH There are eight ! BILL sinks into his chairIt 's an extra super-feature , not released on the regular program ! PARKER How long does each reel take ? LEACH Oh , about fifteen minutes . FORBES looks upTwo hours ? PARKER To tell it ? LEACH Oh , no , to show it . I can give you what we call an outline in half an hour  --  well , three-quarters at the most . PARKER That 's much better  --  three quarters . That 's fine ! DULCINEA Now keep quiet , Willie , or he wo n't tell it . What 's the name of the picture , Mr. Leach ? p. 72 SMITH striking matchWe can have a smoke , anyhow . FORBES Thanks . LEACH with a winning smileOf course , I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell us the name of it . GORDON lights his own , and , as FORBES is about to turn for his light , LEACH protests amiably LEACH I shall have to concentrate , and if there are any distractions  --  DULCINEA hastilyThere wo n't be any  --  tell us the name of it . PARKER Ask him what it 's called . DULCINEA Shut up , Willie ! LEACH waiting a moment until everyone is quietThe name of the picture  --  DULCINEA lifting an arm , and thus rattling her braceletsQuiet , everybody ! LEACH Is  --  Sin . This to the menSin . To the women DULCINEA doing her bitSin . VAN DYCK starts the Rachmaninoff Prelude . LEACH steps up and stops him p. 73 LEACH Not yet . And when I 'm ready , just a soft accompaniment . Starting with enthusiasmThis is really something quite new in films . I am going to show Sin  --  throughout the ages . DULCINEA with anticipationWell ! LEACH In the beginning the picture is symbolic . I open with a quotation from Hawthorne  --  For the men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cameraman ? DULCINEA Willie ! LEACH squelching himThe director is Frank Heming Stratton . PARKER Oh ! BILL prepares for as comfortable a nap as possible LEACH It begins  --  with the setting out  --  of Noah 's Ark . LEACH signals VAN DYCK , who starts " Sailing , Sailing . " LEACH considers the music for a second , decides it will do , and continuesWe see Noah , a man of advanced years . His wife , his sons , the animals  --  of each of its kind two . We see the Ark setting out upon its journey  --  we see the waters rise and rise and rise . For forty days it rains . VAN DYCK changes to " Rustle of Spring " Civilization is all but wiped out  --  it is kept alive  --  and SIN is kept alive  --  only in the Ark . At " Sin " VAN DYCK changes to " kiss Me Again " p. 74 DULCINEA in hoarse whisper to MRS . FORBES " Kiss me again . " LEACH Then comes a calm  --  VAN DYCK changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sent forth  --  it returns , unable to find a lighting place . Suiting action to the word , FORBES strikes a noisy match and lights his cigar , unmindful of LEACH 'S glareAnd then a second dove  --  and it returns  --  and then a third  --  and it does not return  --  for somewhere in the great beyond it had found LAND . A quick signal to VAN DYCKLAND ! VAN DYCK goes loudly into " My Country ' T is of Thee . " DULCY automatically rises , ever patriotic . LEACH is about to begin again , looks at her surprised . DULCY giggles her apology , then sits . LEACH continues as the curtain slowly fallsMany years pass  --  we are now at King Solomon 's Court  --  his wives are bathing in the fountain  --  The curtain remains down for a few seconds to indicate the passing of thirty minutes . As the curtain rises , LEACH , some what dishevelled , is still talking . BILL is asleep in his chair , STERRETT asleep in his chair . GORDON has fallen asleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect host but failed . FORBES is the one man wide-awake . He is chewing the stump of a cigar viciously , breathing heavily and seems to be wondering how many seconds he can stand it before he commits murder . VAN DYCK , at the piano , looks exhausted , and by this time is contributing only an occasional chord . MRS . FORBES , ANGELA and DULCY are still " eating it up " p. 75 LEACH talking as the curtain risesFrances rushes to the edge of the cliff , and , looking over , sees an inert , lifeless form . The " Weasel " is dead . LEACH pantomimes his excuses hurriedly and takes a drink from a glass of water on the piano . HENRY enters to clear away the coffee cups DULCINEA Not yet , Henry ! How many times  --  HENRY departs with a shrupYes , Mr. Leach , the Weasel is dead  --  LEACH picking up the storyAnd then  --  then the Zeppelin and Jack 's automobile go into the final stretch neck and neck . On  --  on they speed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat ! We see his face  --  tense  --  and putting into the car everything that he has , he forges  --  slowly  --  slowly ahead ! Then more and more ! The goal is nearer and nearer ! Back in New York , Charley is seen leaving the Chinese Restaurant ! On the corner he meets Fanny , who throws the money in his face . For emphasis he touches FORBES ' arm . FORBES jumpsThen flash back to Jack  --  nearer and nearer  --  HE WINS . BILL is rudely awakened and springs up PARKER What ? LEACH explainingHe wins ! ! BILL returns to his chair and nap with the manner of a man annoyed at being called too early . VAN DYCK strikes a chordGradually he stops . The Zeppelin makes a landing . Coralie gets out of the dirigible and rushes to Jack to forgive him . Just as he takes her in his arms , her father arrives with the afternoon paper , which makes everything clear and vindicates Albert . Then the father clasps Jack 's hand and apologizes to him for having thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end , just as Jack kisses Coralie there in Chicago , Marc Antony is shown kissing Cleopatra in Ancient Egypt and George Washington kissing Martha Washington at Mt . Vernon . And so , at the end of the Dream Trail , we fade into a long shot of Jack and Coralie , once more in their South Sea bungalow , with the faithful old Toota Heva waiting to greet them in the sunset  --  and fade out . VAN DYCK finishes with a loud chord . The women rise . LEACH rushes to them , his hands outstretched , anticipating their congratulations . The women take his hands , chattering . VAN DYCK gets up , raising his arms and exercising his fingers . BILL awakes and rises , but finds his foot asleep . He gradually wakes himself up by some shakes and half-exercises , and awakens GORDON , who also has to exercise and stretch his legs and arms . STERRETT likewise awakes . FORBES has risen and holds his back . HENRY enters , clears the cups and saucers , and goes again p. 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the most wonderful picture I ever saw ! The women echo thisI mean heard ! Eight marvelous reels ! PARKER What a picture ! My God , what a picture ! He slips away FORBES through his teethAnd now , Eleanor , they might enjoy hearing one of your scenarios . In fact , I 'm going upstairs and get one ! MRS . FORBES Charlie  --  you  --  you 're not really going to get one of mine ! FORBES So help me God ! He starts up ; DULCY stops him at the foot of the staircase DULCINEA Mr. Forbes , would n't you like to play a game of billiards ? SMITH Ah ! Now , that 's fine ! FORBES Why , yes , I 'm very , very fond of billiards ! DULCINEA There , you see , Gordon , darling ! FORBES I did n't know you had a billiard table . DULCINEA Why , yes , a wonderful one ! SMITH indicating the doorDownstairs. p. 77 VAN DYCK That sounds interesting . May I look on ? GORDON has gone to DULCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Forbes . FORBES Good God , why did n't you mention billiards earlier ! VAN DYCK , GORDON , and FORBES depart DULCINEA to MRS . FORBESI think it 's good for the men to get off by themselves once in a while  --  they seem to like it . Besides , I wanted to talk to you . Angela dear , why do n't you and Mr. Leach go out for a stroll in the moonlight ? It 's a wonderful night , in the moonlight . ANGELA Yes , let 's ! LEACH The moonlight ! I would adore it ! MRS . FORBES You 'd better put on a wrap , Angela . ANGELA Oh , mother , it is n't cold . ANGELA and LEACH stroll off , arm in arm STERRETT taking the pretty rough hintI guess I 'll watch the billiard game . He goes . The two women sit down . DULCINEA takes the box of candy from the piano and puts it on a stool between them . They eat and talk p. 78 DULCINEA Is n't everything going beautifully ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Forbes is beginning to like Vincent , too . MRS . FORBES Do you ? DULCINEA Do n't you ? Did n't you see his face  --  so tense and excited while Mr. Leach was telling his story ? Was n't it nice , with Mr. Van Dyck playing the piano ? MRS . FORBES He plays awfully well . DULCINEA Has he said anything to you ? MRS . FORBES Who ? DULCINEA Mr. Van Dyck , of course . Anybody can see he 's attracted to you  --  he 's an awfully nice man , and he 's one of the Van Dycks of Newport  --  if you ever want to go there . MRS . FORBES Oh , is he ? DULCINEA Yes , I could fix it for you . GORDON and FORBES return . They have removed their coats SMITH Dulcy , dear , where did you put those billiard balls ? DULCINEA The what ? VAN DYCK comes back FORBES The  --  billiard balls ! It 's  --  a little difficult to play billiards without them . p. 79 DULCINEA Oh , the billiard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pockets ? SMITH sadlyThere are no pockets on a billiard table . FORBES willing to let the whole world go hangWhat 's the difference  --  what 's the difference ? DULCINEA Maybe I did put them some place  --  now , wait  --  I wonder if I could have  --  no  --  I put the curtains there . A pause I 'll come right away and look for them . I think I know where they are . Gordie , you and Mr. Forbes come with me . VAN DYCK starts to improvise on the pianoThat 's right , Mr. Van Dyck  --  you keep Mrs. Forbes company . To FORBESI 'm awfully sorry about those balls . You know , sometimes I think I 'd lose my head if it was n't fastened on . She goes , carrying FORBES and her husband with her MRS . FORBES We can go along and watch them play , if you like . VAN DYCK still playingDo you want to ? MRS . FORBES Not particularly . p. 80 VAN DYCK Then let 's do n't . MRS . FORBES listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather talk to you . MRS . FORBES A clever man can do both . VAN DYCK But I 'm not clever . MRS . FORBES You 're at least modest . VAN DYCK playing all through this speechNo  --  I 'm not even that . The downright truth is  --  I 'm embarrassed by opportunities . Here I have a moment alone with you  --  you 're perfectly willing to be entertained . If I could play at all well  --  which I ca n't  --  I should dash off something brilliant  --  now . And if I could talk well , which I ca n't , I should simply scintillate  --  - for you . But , you see  --  I 'm just mediocre . A pause . He continues to playPerhaps I would n't be quite so annoyed with myself if it were n't for you . MRS . FORBES But you 're doing splendidly . You have a most respectful audience . VAN DYCK stopping playing abruptlyOh , please , not that ! You know you 're  --  charming . MRS . FORBES And just what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming woman ? She 's the one I never met until she 's married someone else . MRS . FORBES You 're incorrigible . Play something more . VAN DYCK Oh , no . He rises I do n't feel like playing . What do you say to a stroll ? MRS . FORBES I 'd like it . I 've not been out since dinner . VAN DYCK It 's pleasant here , is n't it ? MRS . FORBES Yes , is n't it ? VAN DYCK I have a little place like this in the East  --  in Abyssinia . The moonlight comes down through the trees  --  have you ever been in Africa ? MRS . FORBES No . They start out through the windows VAN DYCK You should go to Africa . I have some diamond interests  --  They stroll out . HENRY enters , takes a glance around the room , and arranges the cushions on the divan . As he is replacing the one on the end his eyes fall upon something in the easy chair . He picks up ANGELA 'S necklace , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket . HENRY , in a matter-of-fact way , puts it in his own pocket and goes up the stairs . ANGELA and LEACH enter through the windows . ANGELA is considerably excited p. 82 ANGELA It was cool , was n't it ? LEACH Was it ? ANGELA Were n't you ? LEACH No  --  I was  --  afire  --  afire with love for you , Angela . ANGELA Why , what are you saying ? LEACH Oh , those deep burning eyes ! The mystery of your hair ! Angela , you 're wonderful !

DULCINEA almost singing itA bridal party . p. 119 FORBES So they are married ! DULCINEA Yes . Willie phoned me just now . He said they had trouble getting in touch with the license clerk . I suppose all those people are like policemen  --  when you want one you never can find one . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight . FORBES By a Justice of the Peace ? DULCINEA No , indeed . By Dr. Carmichael  --  he 's one of the finest ministers in Westchester . Willie knows him awfully well , so I suppose he did it as a special favor . Was n't it nice of him ? FORBES Yes , I appreciate it . DULCINEA So now you have a genius in the family , Mr. Forbes . FORBES Is he returning the car ? DULCINEA Oh , of course  --  they 'll be here any minute now  --  the happy couple . FORBES You can give them  --  the bridal suite . DULCINEA But where will you sleep ? FORBES I shall be returning to town as soon as the car arrives . To GORDONMr . Smith , I hope we can have a little talk before I go .

She returns to FORBES and takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORBES disengaging himself No , thank you . I 'm afraid I must be excused . I 'm not very hungry this morning . He goes up into windows DULCINEA feeling the rebuffMr . Sterrett , you 'll eat some breakfast , wo n't you ? STERRETT always willingWhy , surely . MRS . FORBES stepping toward her husbandThere is n't  --  anything  --  the matter , is there , Charlie ? FORBES The matter ? Oh , no ! I 'm just too happy to eat . He stamps through the windows DULCINEA Gordon , darling , you must eat some breakfast . Come along . SMITH Dulcy , will you go ahead and leave me alone ? DULCINEA persistentMrs . Forbes , you 'll have some breakfast ? MRS . FORBES nodsAh ! VictoriousYou know , I 'm never myself until I 've had a cup of coffee in the morning . STERRETT opens the door for themOf course , we 're all depressed now , but maybe after breakfast I 'll think of something to cheer us up . All but GORDON depart ; BLAIR PATTERSON comes downstairs p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good morning , Mr. Patterson . You  --  slept well , I trust . PATTERSON Thank you  --  yes . EarnestlyI 'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . SMITH dejectedlyOh , that 's all rightly ready for breakfast ? PATTERSON Thank you . I 'll take Mr. Patterson home with me just as soon as he can get his things together . SMITH There 's no hurry  --  any more . Have you  --  told him ? PATTERSON No , he has n't seen me yet . I 'll not have any difficulty ; it 's happened before . SMITH He 's  --  a cousin , I believe you said ? PATTERSON A distant cousin  --  it 's really too bad . Brilliant chap  --  agreeable  --  obliging  --  SMITH He certainly is . PATTERSON Quite all right . Lives on Long Island with his mother and sister . Just this one hallucination . SMITH That 's all he has ? PATTERSON Oh , yes . Now and then he wanders off alone like this , but happily he never causes any real trouble . p. 122 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PATTERSON It 's a little hard on me  --  being compelled to round him up at intervals . I have to divide my activities as a lawyer with those of a truant officer . SMITH Yes , it must be hard on you . PATTERSON looking about and approaching GORDONAh  --  if I might ask a small favor ? SMITH Certainly . PATTERSON I hope none of your guests has learned about my cousin 's  --  weakness ? SMITH I do n't think so . With a look toward the windowsI hope not . PATTERSON If I may suggest it , it might be better to wait until I 've taken him home , in case you wish to explain to anyone . It will save embarrassment . VAN DYCK comes downstairs SMITH I wo n't say anything . PATTERSON Thank you . VAN DYCK noticing GORDON onlyGood morning . SMITH Good morning . He indicates PATTERSONHere 's a  --  friend of yours . Exit GORDON through windows p. 123 PATTERSON turningHello , Horace . VAN DYCK Blair ! Why , what in the world are you doing here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN DYCK You ca n't fool me . You 've come to make me leave  --  that 's what you 've done . PATTERSON Oh , no  --  that is  --  unless you really want to . VAN DYCK aggrievedIt 's very  --  embarrassing . PATTERSON annoyedWell , if it 's embarrassing for you , what do you think it is for me ? I 've a law practice to attend to . I 'm getting a little tired of  --  these  --  excursions . VAN DYCK Well , I wish you 'd leave me alone . At least half a dozen times during the past few years you 've interrupted me in business negotiations that were exceedingly interesting . PATTERSON suddenly suspiciousHave you been  --  putting through  --  something  --  here ? VAN DYCK Well , yes  --  I 've been representing my Van Dyck interests . We had all sorts of wonderful things planned . My share alone would have been eight and a half millions . Besides , we were going to play golf . p. 124 PATTERSON Horace , have n't I told you repeatedly that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me handle it . You come back to town with me and we 'll talk it over . VAN DYCK protestingBut I ca n't leave now . if I do  --  PATTERSON I 'm sorry , Horace , but you know our agreement . Unless you do as I say , I 'll never go through with that two hundred million dollar aeroplane company of ours . VAN DYCK appeased and smiling , Oh , all right . Enter DULCY . Coming face to face with VAN DYCK , she is startled and uncertain as to how to greet him DULCINEA Oh , good morning . TimeorouslyHow do you  --  feel this morning ? VAN DYCK Very melancholy . DULCY sidles away from him I 'm afraid I must go back to town . DULCINEA Ah  --  ! The height of sympathy VAN DYCK You do n't know how I wish I could stay . DULCINEA Ah ! Well , that 's too bad . Still , it 's all for the best . You  --  you must have some breakfast first . p. 125 VAN DYCK Oh , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't he ? GORDON comes back PATTERSON Oh , yes . VAN DYCK I hope we 're not the last . DULCINEA Oh , that 's all right . The last shall be first and  --  everything . VAN DYCK goes . To PATTERSONI had some soft boiled eggs prepared for him , and some soft milk tcast  --  all very soft , you know . Is that all right ? PATTERSON , with a nod , goes in for breakfast . DULCY is about to follow SMITH sharplyDulcy ! DULCINEA turning nervouslyYes  --  dear . SMITH very seriouslyDulcy , come here , please . DULCINEA prattling on to cover her nervousnessI  --  I was just seeing about Mr. Van Dyek 's breakfast  --  Mr.  --  Mr. Patterson 's  --  I mean . He 's  --  he 's all right , really . I mean , of course , he is n't  --  exactly all right , but he 's  --  he 's all right for  --  for what he is  --  and  --  I mean  --  everything could be much worse  --  could't it , darling ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you realize  --  exactly what has happened ? p. 126 DULCINEA Well , I  --  I do n't know  --  I think so . Oh , Gordie , I did n't mean to  --  SMITH simply and kindlyYou must listen quietly , dear , until I finish . DULCINEA momentarily subduedYes , darling . SMITH The time has come when  --  I must speak  --  frankly . A pauseDo you know what Mr. Forbes is going to say to me when he learns who Van Dyck really is ? DULCY shakes her head ; she can not speak at the momentHe is going to tell me that my factory and my services are of no use to him . Mr. Forbes thinks  --  that he has been made a fool of , and  --  he 's right . Our future success  --  depended entirely on him . DULCINEA But  --  but  --  we have n't really done anything to him . Just because we  --  we asked for more . SMITH It was n't  --  our asking for more . DULCINEA Oh , you mean the elopement ? She considersHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . DULCINEA It was me again . It was me as usual . Oh , dear  --  how will it all end ! She sinks onto the sofa p. 127 SMITH slowlyForbes will probably force me out of business . Then I 'll have to start in all over again without  --  He glances around the roomWithout  --  this . DULCINEA forcing herself to say itAnd without me ? SMITH dispassionatelyDulcy , I love you . I shall always love you . I do n't know whether it 's because you have the soul of a child , or in spite of the fact that you act like one . He turns away I do n't know what the future is going to do to us . You mean well , but you just do n't stop to think . DULCINEA I guess I do n't think  --  I just think I think . Rising and speaking bravelyI 'll let you go , darling  --  if you want me to . I 'm just  --  all wrong . I 'm  --  a false note . I always wondered how I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  it seems so absurd for a man like you ever to love  --  a false note . And now  --  we 're finding out  --  he ca n't . SMITH carried away for a secondDuley , we ca n't end everything like this ! You 're not a false note  --  you 're a melody  --  a whole tune . A pause . He reverts to his previous moodBut I do n't know what to do . p. 128 DULCINEA sadlyI do n't think I can reform . SMITH No  --  I suppose not . DULCINEA a bit hopefullyI could make out a kind of budget of things not to do  --  you know , like the one we did for the household expenses . SMITH I 'm afraid  --  that would n't do much good . DULCINEA realizing that it 's old stuff but hopefully trying it anyhowI could make another promise . One that would take in everything . SMITH Oh , I know you 'd try to keep it , but  --  DULCINEA with tears in her voiceOh , but I would keep this one ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise that I 'll never interfere with your business affairs again . SMITH But you practically promised that once , and  --  DULCINEA I mean in any way whatever ! Inviting people to parties , and everything ! I 'll  --  I 'll revolutionize myself . SMITH turning sharplyDulcy , I do n't want you to change yourself a bit . I love you just as you are . With desperate earnestnessI simply want you to let me handle my own affairs . Promise me that you wo n't even suggest helping me in business . p. 129 DULCINEA hystericallyAll right , I 'll promise ! And I 'll keep it ! I will ! SMITH embracing herI 'm sure you will ! DULCINEA I will , I will ! And furthermore , I 'll do everything in my power to repair the damage I 've done . SMITH thoroughly frightenedRepair it ? DULCINEA Yes  --  about Mr. Forbes . I 'll go to him and tell him how sorry I am , and see if there is n't something I can do  --  FORBES comes striding in through the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary that I get back to town immediately . Can I get a car anywhere in the village ? SMITH Oh , but , surely  --  you 're not going before we have our little talk ? FORBES I regret that I must . SMITH evidently conspiring to keep him thereBut  --  I 'm afraid you ca n't get in  --  this morning . There are no cars to be had out there  --  so , if you 'll just make yourself comfortable  --  DULCINEA spilling the beansOh , yes , he can get a car , darling  --  Starting offHe can get one right away . I 'll phone Kelly . Kelly always has a car . p. 130 SMITH following herBut , Dulcy  --  FORBES Thank you very much , Mrs. Smith . SMITH But , Dulcy  --  Dulcy  --  Turning back to FORBES hastilyI 'll be back . Dulcy ! He races out after her . FORBES takes a turn around the room , automatically reaching for his cigar case , which he opens and finds empty Enter BLAIR PATTERSON FORBES Why , Mr. Patterson  --  PATTERSON Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Forbes . PATTERSON Oh , of course . He shakes his hand FORBES puzzled and suspiciousI  --  ah  --  I did n't know you were a friend of Mr. Smith 's ?

FORBES I was just  --  wondering what had brought you , and  --  PATTERSON in a cornerYes . FORBES H 'm . LightlyMust be something pretty important  --  for him to send for you at  --  this hour ? PATTERSON Well , ah  --  just a little matter of business , which he thought  --  advisable  --  He finishes with a cough FORBES I see . What I was about to say was  --  of course , I do n't know just what Mr. Van Dyck is thinking of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client who was  --  thinking of going into it , why , I 'd look into it pretty thoroughly myself . Now I can give you a good deal of facts about  --  Enter STERRETT and VAN DYCK STERRETT as they enterWell , that 's certainly very interesting to me . VAN DYCK Yes , I  --  I hoped that it would be . STERRETT Well , Mr. Forbes , if you want me to handle your advertising after this you 'll have to bring it to a different office . p. 132 PATTERSON suddenly suspiciousWhat was that ? STERRETT I 've just fixed up a little deal with Mr. Van Dyck . I 'm to head his new advertising agency ! FORBES You do n't say so ? PATTERSON with a side glance at VAN DYCKWell ! FORBES That 's splendid ! Anyone who can join hands with Mr. Van Dyck is a very fortunate person . PATTERSON Ah  --  would you care to finish you packing , Mr. Van Dyck ? VAN DYCK All right , Blair . In a minute . PATTERSON going up to the staircaseWell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address registers strongly with FORBES FORBES Ah  --  now that we 've met , Mr. Van Dyck , I hope we can see something of each other in town . VAN DYCK I trust so . As a matter of fact , there are several things I would be interested in going over with you . FORBES eagerlyThat so ? What are they ? PATTERSON warninglyAh  --  do n't forget  --  Schuyler  --  your packing  --  p. 133 VAN DYCK airlyOh , that 's all right , Blair . FORBES You were saying , Mr. Van Dyck  --  VAN DYCK Well , it just occurred to me that we might have interests which  --  ah  --  FORBES Yes ? VAN DYCK Which we might pool to advantage . FORBES Indeed , yes . Something of that kind has been in my mind for a long time . Of course I hesitated to suggest it to you . PATTERSON Do n't you think that we 'd better be  --  STERRETT Now , there 's something I 'd like to ask you , Mr. Van Dyck  --  and I hope you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , what is your attitude  --  just at present  --  on the market ? Do you look for further declines , or  --  He pauses VAN DYCK importantlyNo , sir . FORBES Ah ! STERRETT That 's very interesting . VAN DYCK As a matter of fact , I look for a sharp rise throughout the list . FORBES Indeed ? p. 134 STERRETT What do you base that on , Mr. Van Dyck ? QuicklyIf I may ask ? PATTERSON I hardly think you have time to go into that now , Schuyler  --  VAN DYCK It 'll just take a second . PompouslyThe reason that I look for a rising market , Mr. Forbes  --  is  --  FORBES Yes ? VAN DYCK Is that a war with Spain is now inevitable ! FORBES A war with  --  Spain ? VAN DYCK Exactly . PATTERSON Schuyler ! STERRETT A war between  --  Spain and  --  this country ? VAN DYCK Oh , no ! That 's it , exactly . Spain and  --  Abyssinia ! FORBES What 's that ?

GORDON laughs nervouslyI might have believed it  --  if I had n't happened to meet Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Patterson , and I know that he represents the Van Dyck interests .
