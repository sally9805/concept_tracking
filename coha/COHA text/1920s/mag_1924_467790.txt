THE suggestion that world reaction has produced a youngest younger set of a markedly new sort is not to be taken lightly . If a post-war younger set which was , accused of taking itself very lightly could bring about some of the most solemn and apprehensive speculation our social life ever occasioned , a still newer youth may hold a portent which should be considered with a decent seriousness . Who is to say , offhand , that the new appearance may not mean something as momentous as the coming back of the Young Person ? The Young Person of tradition had a Cheek to which no one , on any account , must bring the Blush of Shame . The restraints imposed upon human society by the Young Person 's cheek were enormously significant . This cheek be ? came a kind of barometer , the reading of which regulated not only sociology but the arts ; so that when , in the course of time , it seemed to be discovered that the cheek had ceased to be a surface and had begun to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of demure ? ness , social sentiment was staggered . Apparently , the shattering of standards from this cause alone inflicted one of the sharpest pangs of the War . Of course , the Young Person had begun to fade long before the War . The image of that traditional cheek might be held with fanatical desperation , but its owner had ceased to be vivid . She was , it is to be noted , older than the Victorian . It has been the fashion to paint Victoria as her goddess . But she was born long before Jane Austen , Perhaps she reached the height of her influence in the middle of the nineteenth century , when she not only furnished Victorian VOL . CXLIX. ? No. 891. - 22literature with an inexhaustible theme but marked impressively a certain bound ? ary . Her wistfulness threatened like a barbed barrier . It was what Darwin must do to her that made him an ogre . It was a theory about her which divided authors into sheep and goats . A litera ? ture was made for her . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not permitted to read honest-to ? goodness novels . Sweet substitutes were provided . She nibbled these things , like chocolates , with an adorable resig ? nation . She was sharply separated from her brothers . Coming-Outs were in ? vented . When she was finished in some school she went forth into society . When she was married she went forth into life . She was to know nothing at all real until her husband chose to tell her . He was to decide what it was good for her to know . Knowing anything more was unwomanly . In fact , the system was beautifully devised to make her a hypo ? crite . And she was a hypocrite . There was a pictorial charm and other attractions in her hypocrisy . Her father , having encouraged her to be a winsome liar , liked the effect . Her husband liked it . Even her sons learned or pretended to like it . But all this time she was a human being , living in the midst of other human beings . She had the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be diagrammed quite so easily as the system managers assumed . She might look like the theory on the outside , but inside she was , as the phrase runs , " someting else again . " I quote from Montague Glass . As a man-made idea she was treniendously over-sexed ? the stressing of a male conception of con tract in general and docility in particular . The thing she was asked to be belonged as completely to a strict male idealization as did the harem . So much for the theory , the plan . As a fact , she was simply the female of the species , basically a human being ? incidentally female ? and her natural instincts , whatever might be done about their expression , could not be thwarted completely by any a'sthetic formula or counter sex prejudice . The pretense could not last forever . The conspiracy between maleness on the one hand , and older women repre ? senting social interests , on the other , began to crumble , and the Young Person , meanwhile , refused to stay young enough or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery that women were persons was followed by the discovery that even children were persons . A newer edu ? cation introduced notions of human development which made it hard to hold in place the arbitrary rituals and schedules of a venerable system . Stodgi ? ness took fright . To this state of mind the beginning of the present century was the beginning of the end . If youth lost its innocence and began eating of the tree of knowledge before it had received permission to have a digestion , the gate of the garden must soon close against it . If youth went to the bad , what hope was there for civilization ? As usual , when civilization crumbled the world found something just as good . Viewing with alarm continued to be popular . The changing of the Young Person was indicated as appalling proof that the future held no hope . Manners were decaying . Youth that no longer cringed was mischievously defacing the temple . Education actually began to truckle instead of to mold . The modern girls ' college became as different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different from the Victorian corset . Awful talk about evolution made it impossible to think of " finishing " a girl . Conservatism real ? ized with chagrin that the world wasfrightfully unfinished , and that the girl , like the rest of it , was simply on her way . Girls went into business at about the time their brothers did . It was not feasible to keep on being a Young Person in a rush hour . You could n't be wistfully withdrawn in daily sight of a dictating boss with a thick neck . A youth that mixed in affairs , that read news ? papers , that began to get acquainted with the world it was living in could no longer be segregated . The sophistry of a special knowledge for a special age required conditions which had been brushed away . The truth is that youth always knew what it was old enough to find out rather than what it was old enough to be told , and the changed situation consisted mostly in the coming of something that was a little closer to honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society that set about abolishing classes was bound to find that the young had been made a class , and that this classification was as untenable as any other . The young were young , just as the ignorant were ignorant or the poor were poor ; but the democratization of life , if it was a good theory , must mean that if poverty , for example , were not to be an imposed condition , neither was youth to be penalized for its youngness . The inherent penalties of being young , like the inherent penalties of being old , can not be done away with . What de ? mocracy asked was that penalties should not be invented , that it was a useless and hazardous hardship to keep on asking youth to deny knowing the things it knew , to avert its head , to withhold its hands , to perpetuate hypocrisies about its " place . " When woman stopped having a " place , " so did her daughter . The change spoiled an old picture that was supposed to be beautiful . The picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous when it was hideous . Girlhood in that old picture could be , and by many a reve ? lation often was , a maddening slavery . More frequently it merely dulled . A/-ways it tended to stultify . Emanci ? pation brought the usual bewilderments . The strong who had habitually wiggled through were not hurt by the change . The weak had to find their feet in freer going . The new picture showed much confusion . And then came the War , fear , hate , hysteria , and the flapper . Youth be ? haved like the rest of the world . It would have been comforting to have had youth ignore the delirium , to have had it wait , close to the gate like good children , until the excitement was over . Unfortunately , the excitement lasted a long time and the factor of example had its effect . Youth made a free trans ? lation of mature conduct . Generally , the translation was quite faithful to the original . The young girls ' clothes mimicked the old girls ' clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would have been asking a good deal to demand that youth keep its fences carefully mended . The spectacle of the flapper has been painful as a picture and as a symptom . We did not need the cartoonist to tell us that the flapper could be funny . Street giggles anticipated the print . Yet she was less funny than the prototypes . Painted nakedness can take on a genu ? inely comic cast only in the mature . In the young this funniness carries a dis ? turbing note . Perhaps the saddening effect of the typical flapper has depended upon the age of the spectator , upon the acuteness of any sense of implication ; or , let us say , upon the sense of humor . How much the flapper has represented the legitimate joy of youth , how much a devastating loss of restraint , how much pure neurasthenia has been open to all sorts of opinion , and there has been plenty of opinion . It is to be remarked that lightened domestic discipline for the young inevitably places a special tax upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dethitely under the dis ? cipline of circumstances . In the mat ? ter of manners , for example , the son isconstantly subject to the stress of an operative criticism . He can be knocked down . His queer hat can he knocked off . A trace of loudness or preciosity in his clothes is sure to elicit more than a guffaw . He is reminded that a mere mannerism may block his business prog ? ress . He is constantly in the presence of codes . Outside the home the discipline of the girl is much less closely codified . Fashion is , indeed , a kind of pressure , yet it is an excitement rather than a discipline . The sanction of fashion is fashion . The boy who starts in to sow his wild clothes is not only brought up with a round turn somewhere , but is roughly or otherwise reminded that man does not live by clothes alone. - The wherewithal for clothes puts a tax on ingenuity which both sexes must meet ; the disparity appears in the young man 's need to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who asked the city girl whether he might call on a certain evening . In a homelier era girls studied various arts of entertainment applicable to times when men called . They made fudge or played the piano . There was recog ? nition of a balanced interchange by which she presided over a home evening and he provided adventure at the county fair or town hall . We do not know precisely what was in this young man 's mind when he strode forth , whether his expectations were flagrantly sentimental or quite without dream elements of detail . We know only that he was misled . " Wien I got there , " lie said , " she had her hat on . " Before we measure the calamity to the young man who was , as this story went , forced to spend four weeks ' sav ? ings to meet the presumptions arising from the fact that she had her hat on , we should remind ourselves that this girl had no parlor or piano . She slept in a flat called home , b.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - city . Her notion of an evening was going some ? where , and in these great open spaces going somewhere means money . Thus entertainment became a responsibility belonging solely to him . Her contribu ? tion was her company . He contributed his company , but this , in common practice , is to be estimated as of lesser value since he must add the money to balance the bargain . Under these cir ? cumstances the morality of the young woman 's position is full of subtleties . I can not make it seem less than cruel to deduce that , if her company is worth more than his , her company must by these terms be sold to him . It is always fascinating to watch her shrug out of the dilemma , as if the dilemma were nothing of the kind ; and the niceties of the argument ( I mean the theoretical argument ? ment , for no one really does argue about it ) are still further complicated by the fact that the young man , discovering that she must be bought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Among young men to whom money considerations are no embarrassment , going somewhere received lively en ? couragement . Home and its arts went out of date . The domestic phonograph gave a certain impetus to impromptus in dancing , but the motor horn fur ? nished a more potent music . Doing anything without a car became equiva ? lent to doing nothing at all . Social life ceased to mean assembly . Chiefly it chugged . When we are through with all other analysis , the automobile will remain the most conspicuous of expla ? nations for the transformation of social forms . All human functions for the enterprising fell into the classification of things you might do while the car waited . So far as the young girl was concerned , the duenna had long since disappeared . The chaperone , after be ? coming a non-intrusive joke , was finally forgotten . The automobile took her place as the third party . For the sentimental the flapper era was , indeed , a fearful disenchantment . The one thing that era seemed particu ? larly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted on amere war that a great many springs went dry . There were signs of a wish to accentuate rebuke of all sentimentalism about feminine modesty . I fancy that as an era it was less deceitful than some of its lamented predecessors . Humanity , young and old , may have been finding various avenues of Freudian " escape . " We were reminded , for example , that sensuality came in with clothes . There was no difficulty , on these lines , in arguing for fewer concealments ? this era specialized in exposure . The spirit ? ual parallels are equally tenable . If inhibitions make for hypocrisy , and we hate hypocrisy , why have inhibitions ? If complexes make trouble , why generate complexes in the sensitive years by saying " Do n't " ? Nothing could be easier than such a plan of escape . There is something wrong with the plan . One can not linger over it long without real ? izing that it leaves out something . The thing it leaves out is the thing the hustling American business man most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital element of results , that total of the sum which the most ambitiously liberal among us has to estimate at last . There are two especially interesting implications to a " do n't " either in life or in art . One is the implication that the expert may counsel the novice . The other is the implication that control serves expression . Conservatism , wring ? ing its hands , asks frantically : if we may not be taught and must not take com ? mand of our instincts , what invention is to supply the place of these expedients ? Of course , there is no such crisis . The social disturbance started by the poison of the War had not the dignity of a revolution . It was not even a disease . It was only a paroxysm . It was , in the first place , the flowering of a social liberty with which American theory had let itself experiment . Moreover , the flowering was forced , as when you put hot water on the stem of a cut plant . The War fevered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as you will have noticed ) ventured to speak of the flapper in the past tense . Technically she " went out " some time ago The easily pleased who can get comfort out of the pendulum image are sure that the swing to safety has set in . Perhaps something less stul ? tifying than automatic reaction has really happened . Of itself , a lowered temperature is no proof of returning wisdom . Yet betting on American sanity is supposed to be betting on a sure thing , and it may be a patriotic duty always to be getting ready for the entry of an undebatable common sense , even of common sense about the young . Assuming that a change has set in , how will it be manifested in the young ? What is to be the new attitude toward the young , and what is to be the atti ? tude of the new young ? It would be absurd to suppose that any social stock ? taking could be likely to result in the reapplying of ancient formulas of au ? thority . Parenthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to do so would meet the case . The spirit of youth has escaped from the old con ? tainer . It must he bargained with . A change which the young did not " get " on its own account would not be one from which we ought to look for sure returns . The notion of a bargaining would have been shocking to ancient disciplinarians , yet something of the kind , however cloaked , has always been going on . To-day 's difference is created not only by changed theories of possible pressure but by a franker feeling about personal choice . The degree of rightness in the deci ? sions of the young may fall just so far below the decisions of the older , but , if you will pardon the platitude ( on the way along , we pull out a truism like a watch or a compass ) wisdom has no age and instincts antedate knowledge . We have to live before we know how . There seems to be no way of rearranging that . And this fact keeps on giving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the effect of a world of youngand old returning sullenly , sheepishly , whimsically , defiantly , to truisms . The fascination of the different , the sheer refreshment of getting away from old stuff , are explanation enough for many a fling . It is the yardstick or the com ? mandment ? the fact or force of which can not be denied -- that present a con ? stant temptation to run . These explain quite as fully the comfort of corning back home . Even a wise radicalism is apt to forget its daily dependence on the basic . Soon or late every excursionist into delirium must return to the real things ? to beauty , babies , character , and other fundamentals . I suspect that youth , like age , is capable of discovering that the north star is quite where it used to be . The flapper herself , it is indicated , found out that flapperism did n't pay . This is not to endow her with any special sagacity . I do not , mean that she really saw what had been happening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comedy of herself . I mean that in the end she felt the pres ? sure which is the definite regulator of hu ? man conduct ? the social pressure which has so many ways of making itself felt , in a school yard as well as in a jail yard , a ballroom , or a legislature . The young may never , on their own account , dis ? cover that theories of conduct were not arbitrarily invented , but they are quick to get the results of their own experi ? ments , not in logic but in response . The exhilaration of chucking tradition , of being ingeniously shameless ? which we have seen in artistic conduct as well as in social conduct ? may never he rebuked by the discovery that tradition is simply the accumulated results of previous experiments , and that a sense of these results is what we call culture ; but it can not escape the discovery that it really needs and has looked for response . When response fails , when our own class , applying the closest pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions are very important to the young girl . Efforts of charm or of mystery represent a significant asset not to be overlooked by self-interest . She may abandon mystery , as in the dressing of her body or her mind , and diminish the chance that some one will marry her out of curiosity ; but giving up charm is another matter . She may act on a wrong theory , yet the human stuff she is made of precludes the hood that she will ever consciously give up her lure . Ordinary feminine shrewd ? ness was bound to tell her after a while that the lure had faded , that she might be picturesque , that she might be a good diversion , but that she had begun to look like a poor investment . In the end she was sure to find that being regarded as a good investment was at I the very front of her interests . Not her interests alone have whis ? pered to the young girl . She does not escape having at least rudimentary ideals , a fine or frivolous sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals are born if they are to be born . And ideals finally draw her glance to the compass . The social compass tells her that , though outward signs be subject to revision , though the language of life be in a state of flow and formation , no one has budged the simple fundamentals . Allowing for eccentricity and high spirits and plain frailty , we still admire a gentleman , still uncover reverently before that feminine equivalent from whom the washlady has stolen the name . Unless theory or practice can modify our sentiment of admiration for a certain sort of man and a certain sort of woman , it is un ? likely that youth will ever lose a sense of these images . So long as this admira ? tion is acknowledged we are not des ? titute of a clear-shining incentive to young adventurers . The Young Person 's descendant , the exuberant freshman to whom the flap ? per has become a sophomore , enters a situation with all the old perils intact but in which there is less noise and an admonitory wreckage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and to hear she will know that some VOL CXLIX ? No 891. - 23 things have not paid . She will find fundamental things thrown into a cer ? tain relief by the subsidence of the clamor and the clearing away of the dust . She will raise a merry dust of her own with her car . It may be that she will like the radio better than reading . That will depend much upon her family 's state of development . She will not be a knitter ? certainly she is not by way of being a good knitter ? and she will never , like her remote ancestor , aspire to be pale . Neither will she be demure or devote . She comes into a nervous , hus ? tling , self-conscious world , a world of reforms and efficiency and dotted lines , that talks slogans in its sleep , and no one will expect her to sit by the ingle with her hands in her lap . She is likely to live where there is n't any ingle , and where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at home ; she may , indeed , be further prophecy of that day when each indi ? vidual 's home will be under his hat . It will give her a good laugh to recall the days when girls carried their hats in their hands and ate lip paste with their meals . She will have the newcomer 's advantage of not missing the things which in an earlier era she would have thought she needed . She will see through the cheap pose of being bored . It will not amuse her to be blase . She inherits a jazz called classical , a slightly lessened responsibility as to dreams , a complete map of sex , and a routine knowledge that the brontosaurus would be a living factor to-day if they had taken out its tonsils . She will not know for a long time that each era seems feverish to the survivors of the one before . She will take herself and the United States , if not outlying parts , for granted , and have a privilege profounder than her ancestors ' of making her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make them in an enormously illumi ? nated world . If she is differently foolish she will find herself under a spotlight . If she is humanly sensible she will be printed and pictured anyway to please those who insist that everybody must be either young or scandalous . She will have heard that wedding notices should be put in the amusement column . Cyni ? cisms about the sacred will be too commonplace either to shock or to amuse her . The noise of them will be old to her before she begins to think deeply , since she will have heard every ? thing . Not to be able really to " come out " because she has never been in , will mean that nothing can strike her suddenly . She will be no more subject to social surprise than a girl brought up on a farm would be open to astonish ? ment about orchards or cattle . Not being able to be wistful about weddings , she may come a shade nearer to belief in the theory that staying married is simply being a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rules committee . Her world will tell her that it has been disenchanted . Sour preserves will not interest gatherers of fresh fruit . And she will see spring as they may see it who do not remember too many autumns , see it with the penetrating , wonder-working glance of youth . In her igno ? rance she will make her share of blunders , and by the divinely precious good fortune of not knowing that certain great things ca n't be done , will go ahead and do them . We have been promised a period of romanticism . Who knows that the notion may not appeal to the flapper 's successor , and that she may not usher it in ? Certainly , it can ? not happen without her connivance . She may attain great concessions . Who knows that some one may not contrive , for example , to make gentle speech fashionable , and that she may not , after hearing the shrillest voices in the world , herself become low-voiced ? It would be a fearful radicalism , but at this juncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flapper 's successor may hate the noise as much as the rest of us do . Who will venture to predict that , though she may refuse to be a hypocrite and will know too much to be enslaved by any awe , she may not , indeed , find high satisfactions in the sheer art of being a young girl ? in re ? habilitating an art by whose vicis ? situdes all other arts are delayed in coming back ?
