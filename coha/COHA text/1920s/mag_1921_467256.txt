THE present vulgarity of the public taste , " " the barbarous taste of the public " ? these two phrases occur in two separate articles in a recent number of a critical review . In their appraisal of the public taste I wonder whether these writers made any distinction between evidences of popular curiosity and proofs of popular approval ! Curiosity is aroused by weeks of skillful advertising , and spends itself in a moment . Curiosity , like suspicion , anger , or amusement , is an emotion easily aroused in the popular breast by the skilled manipulator of crowds , who usually is indifferent to the fact that it is spent in a moment , provided it is spent his way . " Susie 's Double Bed , " played night after night in New York to crowded houses . Perhaps even you , gentle reader , helped surreptitiously to swell that crowd . Please analyze frankly your own motives for going . " I wonder , " said you , " why everyone keeps talking about that play ? " " I wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! " " Let 's break loose and be really wicked , " said you to a group of equally respectable pillars of suburban society ; " let 's have supper in some Italian back yard and then go to that ' Susie ' show everyone is talking about " ; and by " everyone " you unwittingly meant every billboard , and an army of pen-wielding mongers of stage gossip . So you went and ate small portions of food from soiled dishes and enjoyed it because it was a variation from your routine ; and then you went and saw a large portion of " Susie " and came away oddly disappointed . Pause a moment in the lobby as you go out and listen to the comments : " Not much of Vet . CXLII. ? No. 848. - 27a show ! " " Wornout plot , but several good laughs . " " Daring , was n't it ? Nobody would have stood for that ten years ago ! " " Well , now we 've seen that , what next ? " It is actually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that the play has met the approval of popular taste , but rather that popular curiosity has been satisfied . One would not believe for a moment that the crowds which thronged the Twenty-third Regiment Armory in New York City a few years ago to view the widely advertised exhibition of cubist and futurist paintings were a proof that experiments in these unconventional schools satisfied the popular taste . The exhibiting artists themselves would hasten to disclaim this . The public can not approve until it has examined , and the chief conclusions to he drawn from the fact that vast numbers did examine are these : that the show had been well advertised , that it was within easy reach of vast numbers , and that the price of admission was not too high . Let me admit here that I have no settled convictions as to popular taste . My quarrel is with those pronouncements of smug minds which we tend to accept without limiting their application or remeasuring their value . Repeat a statement often enough and people begin to believe you , even though what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a public , and if it be epigrammatically expressed at once it becomes currency . " Naturally there 's little good in the magazines ; their editors have to please the public , " says some one or other ! " I never read a best seller ? you know what popular judgment is worth ! " " The play has made a big hit it must be bad ? " It may be worth while to examine these common slurs upon the popular judgment before we pass them along so glibly . If we are to discuss popular taste in the light of theater-going , it is worth while asking what portion of the public determines the quality of our drama , as well as what kind it actually approves , and we must first of all focus attention on a small section of Manhattan Island . Here a little group of managers ? one might almost call it a clique ? limits the public 's opportunity to see plays . While undoubtedly these dictators are themselves guided by the popular preference so far as they can gauge IL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds within easy reach . New York City 's theater-going public is sui generic . Very largely it is a visiting public . Mr. and Mrs. Public-on-aholiday are prone to leave better judgment at home to keep house with the babies and the cook . Pew rents or collection plates are temporarily left out of the estimates . Week-enders in New York develop a weakness at the top end . The manager 's problem , especially if he be a man without instinctive taste , is to arouse the superficial curiosity of this passing throng . It is , in fact , the lively curiosity of even healthy-minded America that , plays this unimaginative manager 's game for him throughout . One hundred nights in New York " is a catchword that will fetch the gate receipts in Grand Rapids , where very possibly the New York manager has some interlocking claim upon the leading theater , and Mr. end Mrs. Grand-Hapidian say , " Let 's go and see why New York went ! " It is even whispered that in cases where the manager of limited vision has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-night pitch he has played to " papered " houses at a loss , for enough additional days to justify that magic phrase when on the road . This may at least be credited to his business acumen . Yet , whatever the manager 's caliber , one would assume that current plays on Broadway ought to represent his best effort to locate the fixed tastes of his audiences . This might be assumed if each play was a hazard ? a gamble on public preferences . If the manager correctly appraises popular taste he wins ; if incorrectly , he loses . But it is said on good authority that in not a single Broadway production nowadays is the manager taking any risk . His enterprise is underwritten before it starts . Payments for moving-picture rights , stock rights , and the like , contingent only upon a few days of actual Broadway presentation , are sufficient to protect him against any loss whatever . He is betting on a sure thing . He does not need to educate himself in public taste . He can thrive without such knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of this screed , nor would it then fairly represent the attitude of the writer . But in considering common disparagements of the popular taste in drama , it is well to point . out that other factors beside general public preference help to determine the character of the most loudly heralded plays . It is possible that the widespread " little theater " movement , the drama leagues and amateur players everywhere are not merely the passing fads of a few " intellectuals . " They may be proof of popular unrest over a financial control of the stage that is insufficiently responsive to the common desires . If all butter manufacture on a large scale came under the control of a few men and they marketed a rancid product , we might accuse the public of being weakly acquiescent , but not of preferring rancid butter . And it is a safe guess that little independent sweet-butter factories would spring up here and there over the land and struggle along , despite the difficulties of distribution . It is indeed an acquiescent public , but its conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste is sum to cite most triumphantly the " movies ' . of to-day in defense of his views . Bui THE ALLEGED DEPRAVITY OF POPULAR TASTE 2,11 all that has been said in defense of popular taste in connection with the spoken drama may be reiterated and emphasized in the moving-picture field . I can do no better than to quote from the printed word of an expert ? one who writes movies as well as of them . He says : The infancy of motion pictures has been left to the supervision of ( take it by and large ) the most dangerous element of our population , the element that represents primarily greed . Greed is part ignorance . The two are inextricably interwoven . . . . To them we have intrusted the early years of the motion picture . For this , our children , and our children 's children , must pay . With the appearance of the first motion pictures there was a rush to the new field closely comparable to the rush to some new gold district when a strike has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ground are the daring adventurers who take big risks for the possibility of easy profit ? the something-for-nothing men . The first writers for the motion-picture industry , taking it as a whole , were those who happened to he on the ground or in touch with the first studio makers , with nothing better to do . The office hangers-on , unable to make good in their own field , willing to take a chance at anything ? these were the first men to drift into writing for pictures . And , as with the writers , so with the other branches of the industry , so that by the time the moving-picture industry assumed substantial proportions and began to attract a greater number of high-caliber workers , the stamp of inefficiency , ignorance , and an astounding lack of intelligent idealism already marked the new " art . " The more competent of the incompetents ? keeping always to generalities and avoiding the specific exceptions that mitigate conditions here and there ? found themselves in controlling positions , and formed a harrier which the tides of betterment have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures turned out represented , in the aggregate , the low mental and moral and spiritual tone of those first drawn to the industry . In other words , this writer suggests , as I have suggested in the case of the theater , that its worst manifestations ? in fact , its general manifestations ? donot so much reflect the tastes of the public as the instincts of the group which control it as an industry ; that it has not become fully responsive to the wishes of the public , but only to the misguided efforts of unimaginative greed to interpret those wishes . The other day I sat in a crowded moving-picture house in a small Colorado city . A " comedy " was on the screen . It was a succession of slapstick situations , almost any one of them so grotesquely absurd as to justify laughter , but following one another in such perplexingly rapid succession as to benumb the risibili Lies of the audience ; and it was a patent fact that either an apathetic or a dazed audience , rather than a delighted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot was introduced an episode of unnecessary and even inconsistent vulgarity . I watched the reaction with interest , and I believe without prejudice . This was a ten-cent matinee audience , crowded with children . It was a " low-caste " audience , if a supercilious critic might be allowed to classify it , and beyond question it was either offended or embarrassed ? probably it could not have analyzed its own emotions and told you which . One can easily imagine the process of evolving that scenario . The producer examined it , interpreted the popular demand by means of his own wizened apperceptions , and said : " Give ' em more rough-house , " " Put that there young lady into full tights . " " Get more suggestion into the third reel . That 's what the public wants . " Heaven is most unkind to its common people , in that it provides them with such interpreters . Yet this producer is by no means stupid . If he injects enough of the startling , the shocking , the arousing , his film will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city or some crusading clergyman may give it a boost . True , it will die in a day , but in the meantime it " paid " and he has " turned over his capital . " As long as unadulterated greed exists unchecked such men will give the public curiosity ? not the public taste ? what it wants . The present-day trend in moving pictures is comforting to those who have faith in the popular judgment , for surely the producers have not determined to run contrary to a general demand and force upon the peoplz something better than they want ; yet everywhere producers , even the stupidest , are revising their editorial staffs , hunting hurriedly for better sources , and vying with one another to destroy that ugly god which they created in their own image and called Public Opinion ; groping for a true god which they have no native means of recogni zing . But let us get along to hooks . In the field of the theater a brilliant Belasco or an imaginative Hopkins might dispute my assertions and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is obviously in the hands of more men , more widely distributed . A hundred highly competitive publishing houses are striving to ascertain the popular taste and to Cater to it . Moreover , the public may send for the books it wants ( from among those it has heard about ) , while it must take whatever theaters it can get to . What sort of book does it mostly want , and who are the buyers of these books ? My friend Jones is a professional critic . He , too , has gauged the American public . Ile is fond of saying that it prefers to read " sentimental drivel , " or " nasty society stuff . " I think he has specifically in mind the highly moral fiction of the Rev. Henry B. Williams . I agree with . Jones in his estimate of these writings , but I want to be sure that lie is right in saying they determine the popular taste . Sixty million people in this country never see a book , and only about 4 per cent of our population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from among the books they have heard about . Yet they hear of very few , because , for a popular commodity , books are remarkably underadvertised . This must be so . Mr. Gillette makes one safety razor and his entire advertising appropriation pushes its sales . Mr. Henry Holt publishes one hundred books and whatever advertising appropriation he can afford must be divided among them . Each may get a hundredth part of his budget . Mr. Gillette will make the same razor next year . Mr. Holt will make a hundred new books , with brand-new names demanding entirely different advertising . Moreover , book-distributing methods are painfully inadequate . It is said that there are fewer retail bookstores in the United States to-day than there were fifty years ago . In a half million homes where reading is desired , what do you find ? The Bible , a " home doctor , " a history of the world , sold on subscription by some itinerant vender , and then what ? Ben liar , perhaps , and a worn volume of Scott or Dickens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of Mr. So-and-So 's salacious stuff is tossed from the presses next spring , it is seized upon by the merest fringe of our vast literate population . At the end of six months its sales are dead as a doornail ; yet David Copperfield is still selling in twenty or thirty different editions , and A Tale of Two Cities in forty or more . " Ah , " says critic Jones , " that is n't public taste ; that 's habit . Sets of Dickens are n't books ; they are furniture , library wall paper , certificates of culture . " Jones would he right if the chief sale of Dickens were by sets , but it is not . One of the many low-priced editions , the year before the war , sold , of David Copperfiekl , 4,700 copies ; of Nickolas Nickleby , 2,100 ; Pickwick Papers , 2,000 ; Tale of Two Cities , 2,000 ; Our Mutual Friend , 1,100 ; and other individual volumes of his works in almost negligible quantity . All this was despite the fact that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death twenty-one different editions of his works were on sale in America ; fortyfive years later there were as many as fifty of certain volumes . In that same year before the war a certain best seller went up to one hundred thousand copies in six months and then went down ? and out . It is easy to be misled by flash-in-thepan successes , when judging popular taste . Mr. So-and-So 's society scandals make a very loud noise and then die . Any publisher in the land , if offered a choice between the works of best-seller Soand-So and the works of Joseph Conrad , for instance , would choose the latter , because Conrad 's works are a better property in their second year than in their first . Let us substitute the phrase " quick seller " for " best seller " and keep our meanings clear . Two of America 's best sellers in the field of copyright fiction are Ben Hur , with close on two million sales , and David Harum , with more than a million . The publishers of Torn Sawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies each of these two books , to carry them through the coming year , and these stories were first published over forty years ago . It is a safe bet that five out of this year 's " six best sellers " will , two years from now , be as the grass that withered ; while in the same year Captain January and A Bird 's Christmas Carol and The Man Without a Country will approach or enter their second million ; and even next year Lorna Doone will outsell them all . What the public wants in the way of literature is a slightly different question from " What does the public like ? " I have said that it quite naturally wants to see what it has heard about . And there is always this dominant third question , " What is it able to get ? " I am not sure what it likes , but I am optimistic in my guessing . No , the vast general public , as far as it is buying books at all , is not buying quick sellers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announces a new series of cloth-boundbooks at a low price and of a handy size , and within a few months over a millioncopies arc sold . The editor of the series does not choose his titles from among those books whose sale in their day was due wholly to an aroused public curiosity . He finds the books whose continued sale , however slow , proved that they had met the approval of popular taste , and these are republished , and now sell all over again- in a fashion to put the sixmonths-old quick seller to shame . I have urged that one may not estimate by means of quick sellers the standards of popular literary taste . Yet when one hundred thousand people , out of our small total of book buyers , see fit to buy a new book within six months of its publication , that is a phenomenon that I must not dismiss over lightly . They tell me that those sentimental novels by the Rev. Henry B. Williams , for instance , which to Jones 's annoyance have sold so phenomenally , were advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to the notice of people who wanted to read , but never had a book thrust upon their attention before , as safety razors had been thrust upon their attention , or made so easy to buy . But perhaps that does not tell the whole story . Jones says , " Those books are without merit ; the public buys them ; therefore the public has no literary judgment , " I admit that I do n't like the stories , but , since so many human beings do , there may be certain merits in them that I fail to appreciate . Jones and I proceed from different premises . But it seems to me important to note that certain other books by the same author , although equally sentimental and distasteful to Jones , had the same selling force back of them and yet failed to win public approval . Some simple quality , overlooked by the critic , causes this difference . Perhaps its very simplicity is the reason he overlooks it . When David Harum appeared and gradually secured a sale that was a record-breaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only went to prove the poor quality of popular taste . Now we realize that there was in the book an artistic and spiritually truthful picture of a certain homely American type . That character sold the book and kept on selling it . I have known Jones himself to sit patiently through a great deal of bad vaudeville and feel well repaid when Madame Bernhardt came on . I have heard him extol Drink-water 's " Lincoln " and quite ignore the impossible negro dialect , or the maidservant ' with English manners out in Illinois in 1859 . Perhaps the public , too , does not place the seal of its approval on a whole book when it buys and buys , but only upon some one quality or some one character in the story that it is able to recognize as true in spirit . And it accepts , or ignores as nonessential , certain accompanying characteristics that to Jones may mean the book 's damnation . If so , I am sure it is not any subtle element , for the popular mind is not subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and as obvious as Millet 's " Angelus . " Moreover , it may not be cynical or inconoelastic . Virtue must be extolled , sin deplored . The popular taste prefers optimism to pessimism just as the " general public " still believes in God and the ten commandments . It is true that an indecent book if well advertised can can secure a large sale . But publishers will tell you that the limit of sale , though large , is definite and can soon be reached ; and no amount of skillful merchandizing could therefore be made to pay . A certain magazine has attained success by appealing to prurient curiosity . It has gradually built up and maintained a definite and profitable circulation . But that circulation is a small fraction of potential magazine readers . On the other hand , those household magazines which have run into circulations of a million and a half or two million , weekly or monthly , find it worldly-wise to be virtuous to the point of vapidity ; and they could , if it were not unprofitable todo so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a story that approached literary perfection , and then wrote it in French , no one could assert that popular lack of interest in it proved the public 's lack of good taste . The public in this instance would he limited to those with a reading knowledge of French . If my story presupposes a knowledge of applied psychology and makes use of many technical terms in that field of research , then I have again shut out a large portion of the public . My " price of admission " is too high . A publisher friend of mine calls these superficial qualities of literature entrance requirements . " As you add to their number or to their esotericism , you reduce the number of those who can get into your book . But that limited number has not necessarily a finer sense of what is the good and the true and the beautiful in literature . Many of them may have . But some may be as blind as bats in the sunlight . You have merely a cross section of the public , cut to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is any disparagement of the public 's good taste to say that it prefers the simple and the obvious . Add a frock coat and silk hat to the rudimentary costume of the " Discus Thrower " and , though the fine lines are still underneath , you have made the statue less perfect by reason of these embellishments ? and it will become still more grotesque with the passing of the silk hat . It is because of those qualities in the sculptor 's achievement which are unhidden by fads and ephemeral embellishments that it still lives . My friend Jones would protest against such a discus thrower , but his faultfinding would be because the frock coat was not a cutaway . In fact I begin to suspect that Jones enjoys faultfinding . Yet he himself does not face criticism cheerfully . He does not like me to tell him , for instance , that he gains more enjoyment from the contemplation of technique than of accomTHE ALLEGED DEPRAVITY OF POPULAR TASTE plishment . Nor does he like me to say that criticism is noncreative and a parasite among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oak . Far be it from me to wish the mistletoe abolished ? it has certain pleasing social functions . But I notice that it only pretends to have roots of its own ; and it often injures a delicate oak , while it never builds up a strong one . As for contemplating the beauty of the forest , it may see only the limbs from which it draws its sustenance . Critics can too easily lose touch with the public . They are not sure what it likes , but they know its tastes must be lower than their own . " But , Mr. Omniscience , " say you , " what does the public like ? " First , something it can understand ; second , something it recognizes as spiritually true ; third , something that is not destructive of its fundamental faith in the eventual outworking of all things for good ; finally , and more specifically , the things it really likes are the things it keeps on buying . For this last is not a vague generality . It means that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " Wang " arouse greater enthusiasm forty or thirty or twenty years after their creation than a current light opera six months old , then they are the better criteria of popular taste . It means that any novel which sells successfully ten years after publication is better evidence on which to judge standards of public approval than one which dies in six months . When Hardy 's novels appeared , the public disregarded the judgments of the critics and , having selected certain ones for favor , kept on buying them . Critics now say that these certain ones arc most worthy of survival . Critics tell us that Dickens must rest his reputation upon a certain three or four books . The publicsettled upon those books in the beginning , and keeps on buying them . Let me frankly admit , in conclusion , that whatever arguments I may have presented in the foregoing are largely negative . I would urge that those evidences of the popular taste which you find most depressing are not good evidence . On the stage and in moving pictures the evidence seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than it generally gets . In books the greatest percentage of the literate public gets nothing at all . Quick sellers indicate first of all good merchandising methods and some curiosityarousing quality . What ever else they indicate remains to be proved . " What do you think of the popular taste in books ? " I asked a bookseller of unusually wide experience . " A most interesting question just now , for this reason , " he replied . " Even before the Great War the old classics had begun to give way . Few read George Eliot now . Fewer each year are reading Scott . Before long we shall be unable to measure public taste by old standards . What are the new ? Live behind a book counter year in and year out , as I have done , and you may find cause for depression in the stuff that crosses that counter . But it is noting the character of the books that buyers still call for , two and three years after their glory has departed from the advertising spaces , that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not settle anything , it is true . But , as I said in the beginning , I have not sought to settle anything . On the contrary , I want to unsettle something ? namely , your mind , in case it is contentedly wearing certain hand-me-clown ideas about the " barbarous taste of the public " without first considering whether or not they fit , If they do , by all means wear them .
