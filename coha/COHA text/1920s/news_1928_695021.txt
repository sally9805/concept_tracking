txt The new President of the College of the City of New York , Dr. FREDERICK B. ROBINSON , who is to be formally installed ' today , is a son of this great city , not only by birth but by training . He was born here and received all of his education , from the lowest grade in the elementary public school to his baccalaureate degree in the public college , under the tuition of the city . One of his four predecessors was born in New York City , but none of them had the impress of the rigorous discipline of its higher training upon them  --  though two of them , President WEBSTER and President WEBB , underwent like discipline at West Potat . Dr. ROBINSON knows the city , and as a student , teacher and assistant in administration to a pastmaster in that high art , his immediate predecessor , Dr. MEZES , he has known intimately the life of the college from the last years of General WEBB 'S regime to his own . He , therefore , enters upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well acquainted with its machinery , which he has helped to perfect and extend . His alertness of mind equips him to meet the new conditions which are constantly arising in this vast community , and his interest in administration will protect him from the vexations which interrupting calls from every quarter or petty dissipating details give to persons who love " a lordlier leisure " or studious pursuits . There are new problems to be faced , but they are largely quantitative ( assuming always that the quality is to be maintained ) , and they are of the nature of those which he has already had a large part in successfully solving : the extension of like advantages of higher training by night as by day to those who can come only by night , and the maintenance of special courses for teachers and for others in city employ . Fifteen years of the city 's continuous teaching often transforms even a child of foreign birth into a new nature , fitted for leadership in this city . What she has done in training one of her own native-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion for special pride . Dr. ROBINSON enters upon his Presidency of the city 's own college with such good wishes as no stranger could have and with proud hopes for one whom the city doubly claims as her son .
