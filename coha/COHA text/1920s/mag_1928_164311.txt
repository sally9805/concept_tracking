President Edsel B. Ford of the Ford Motor Co. designed a taxicab , putting on wire wheels , a clock , four doors &; an Ustco taximeter ; called the whole , logically enough , a " Luxford . " Hackmen saw it in Manhattan , ordered 300 the first week , without knowing the price or the delivery date . The Taxi Weekly , house organ of the cab profession , describes the Luxford thus : <P> " Its lines are low and rakish . The lower part of the body is green with a belt of yellow and-red striping around the door and window molding . The rear seat in the passenger compartment is large enough to accommodate three fares . There is a single folding seat in a recess well forward where the right hand forward seat of a pleasure car would come . The extra room gives the fourth passenger plenty of space for his legs . . . the running board is not wide enough to accommodate a trunk , nor is there any trunk rack in the rear .
