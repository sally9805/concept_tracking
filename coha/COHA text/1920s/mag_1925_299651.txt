Further impetus was given , last week , to Governor General Leonard Wood 's plea for $1,000,000 for the leper colony on the Island of Culion , the Philippines . <P> The story was told of the retreat founded by Dr. Victor G. Heiser . In a commandeered Government vessel , he went from port to port , herded the wretches on board , took them to Culion . There they led normal lives , received the expensive treatment of ethyl ester . Their children were born " clean . " <P> But , in the 1916-21 period of Filipino political control , under the Jones Act , 300 infant children contracted the dread disease , and the colony went from bad to worse . <P> As soon as General Wood arrived-in 1921-he drew on emergency funds , increased the staff of physicians from 2 to 18 ; and within a year 1,000 patients were once more receiving treatment . When it was rumored that the General was about to return to the U. S. , a pathetic peition signed by more than 1,000 lepers begged him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oust him . Culion was made an issue , and the Filipino Legislature cut the Culion appropriations by one-third . <P> Under such circumstances , it is characteristic of the General not to go . He has called for a million dollars and , it seems certain , will get it .
