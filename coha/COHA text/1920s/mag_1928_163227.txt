Germany will soon have a new Chancellor ( Prime Minister ) . Name : Dr. Otto Braun . Party : Socialist . Present occupation : Prime Minister of Prussia . Characteristics : bald , preacher-like , thoughtful , sarcastic , stern . Famed ? Yes , because in 1925 German Socialists cast 7,785,678 ballots in an unsuccessful attempt to elect him president . <P> That Socialist Braun will be the next German Chancellor was the virtually unanimous forecast of correspondents last week , when 40,000,000 Germans trudged to the polls through a nationally pouring rain and elected to the Reichstag a potent phalanx of Socialist deputies , more than twice as numerous as the runner-up Nationalist cohorts . <P> The Centrist parties which for years have held the balance of power did not materially gain or lose in strength last week . Therefore , they will be compelled by the sweeping Socialist gains to admit to power , at last , the Socialist party which has always been largest in Republican Germany but has generally been held down by a coalition of smaller rivals . <P> The election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths of the various parties in the forthcoming Reichstag , will be as compared to the previous Reichstag : Socialists 152 , previously 131 ; Catholic Centrists ( the party of Chancellor Dr. Wilhelm Marx ) 62 , previously 68 ; Nationalists ( once the party of Hindenburg ) 72 , previously 110 ; Communists 54 , previously 45 ; People 's ( the party of Foreign Minister Dr. Gustav Stresemann ) 44 , previously 51 ; Democrats 25 , previously 32 , Economic Union 23 , previously 21 ; Bavarian Peoples party 16 , previously 19 ; Voelkische ( the reactionary monarchist Ludendorffers ) 12 , previously 13 ; Independents 5 , previously 3 . Peasants 23 , previously 0 . <P> The striking Nationalist losses are of peculiar significance . Last spring , the leaders of the party proceeded to tone down their traditional white-hot pro-monarchist anti-Locarno and anti-Dawes plan program in order to enter the mild centre coalition cabinet , then formed by Dr. Marx ( TIME , Feb. 7 , 1927 ) . By this compromise they apparently lost the confidence of almost half the Nationalist voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarchy might be restored in some modified form and that Germany might some day successfully buck against the Dawes Plan . <P> The Nationalist losses and Socialist gains make it absolutely unlikely in any event that the present cabinet of Dr. Marx can continue in office .
