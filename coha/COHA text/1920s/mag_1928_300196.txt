Dr. Frederick August Kolster , who has contributed as much to radio as any man now alive , has invented yet another radio device , a machine for shooting a radio beam at whatever point on earth he pleases . His previous inventions have been the invaluable radio compass , the radio fog signal system , the mobile radio beacon to protect ships in fog , the decremeter which measures wave lengths and dampens radio oscillations , the Kolster radio receiving set . He created the Bureau of Standard 's radio section and is its chief . He is chief research engineer of the Federal Telegraph Co. and its allied companies. * <P> News of Dr. Kolster 's latest invention developed last week as work went on to set up an experimental station near his Palo Alto , Cal. , home . <P> The transmitter consists of a parabolic reflector , at whose butt end is an enormous vacuum tube . The tube sets like the heating element of the common portable electric heaters . The heater 's reflector is basin-like . Dr. Kolster 's radio reflector is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it resembles a funnel . <P> Its shape , size and attachments ( so far undescribed ) all concentrate the short waves from the transmitting bulb in a straight , narrow beam , much like the beam from a search light . <P> By lay supposition , such a straight-going beam would be tangential to the earth 's curvature and so never reach distant earth points where radio stations may be . By scientific theory , two possibilities exist . The Kolster beam may be skillfully aimed at the Heaviside Layer+ and be reflected down to its receiving station , just as a pool player bounces a ball from cushion to pocket . The other possibility is that gravity will drag the beam to the proper curve of the earth . <P> Dr. Kolster 's beam differs from Guglielmo Marconi 's . In the Marconi system a number of wires at each side of the sending antennae keep the waves from spraying sideways , but not from up- &-down.; It is not properly a beam at all . It is a very narrow sheet of short waves that go around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in less degree , that the diffuse long waves do . <P> <P> - Kolster Radio Corp. , Federal-Brandes Inc. ( wireless communication equipment ) . International Telephone &; Telegraph Co. recently bought control of Federal Telegraph . Hence it profits from Dr. Kolster 's devices and knowledge . <P> +A theorical envelope of the earth 's atmosphere , estimated to be 350 miles out . That it exists is the best current explanation for radio static , fading and silent pockets . Radio waves spray out from sending stations . Supposedly some hug the earth on their way to receiving sets ; others reach the sets tardily by reflection from the Heaviside Layer . Probably the sprayed waves , going by the two paths , interfere with each other . One idea is that the Layer lies close to earth at the two Poles . The Byrd Antarctic expedition took along a Westinghouse ossilograph to find out .
