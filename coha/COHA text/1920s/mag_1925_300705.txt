At Budapest , Prince Galitzin , onetime member of the State Council of Russia , has just published his memoirs of the Russian revolution . He asserts that " the Tsar Nicholas and certain members of his immediate family are still alive " and are dwelling in " intense seclusion " at " a place which must naturally remain nameless . " <P> Hungarian reviewers noted that Prince Galitzin has seen fit to adduce no evidence whatever in support of his assertions . They evinced surprise that he should have troubled to repeat a rumor that has long fallen upon deaf ears .
