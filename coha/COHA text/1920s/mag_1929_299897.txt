" Aw , whaddya wan na do , sing ' Sonny Boy ? ' " That is Broadway 's latest wisecrack to victims who complain unduly , or to friends grown maudlin in their cups . In England , " Sonny Boy , " a super-saccharine ballad of child love introduced by Blackface Singer Al Jolson in his latest sound film , is still new and popular . More , it has become a Conservative campaign song . <P> Last week in London 's staid Albert Hall , the mournful tune poured from the throats of 1,000 solid supporters of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin . <P> The Conservatives sang words of their own , however . " Stanley Boy " the song is to them . As to how the words got changed , this story is told : One Waldron Smithers , Conservative M.P. , was asked by Prime Minister Baldwin to speak at a dance given for new Conservative voters . When Mr. Smithers arrived , Conservative couples were revolving on the floor to the strains of " Sonny Boy " Suddenly inspired , Mr. Smithers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection . Then-even as the French patriot , Rouget de Lisle , is supposed to have improvised the " Marseillaise " ; upon a cafe table top-Mr . Smithers is supposed to have improvised verses , of which the following is a sample : When there are grey skies We do n't mind the grey skies , You make them blue , Stanley Boy . Though foes may mistake thee We 'll not forsake thee , You 'll pull us through , Stanley Boy . <P> For the benefit of Conservatives too shy to sing " Stanley Boy , " too lethargic to attend party rallies , a new poster has appeared on British hoardings . It shows a lilliputian David Lloyd George and a bandy-legged Ramsay MacDonald violently speechifying near the easy chair of an apathetic young Conservative . <P> " Conservatives , " ran the legend , " Lloyd George wo n't beat us-Ramsay wo n't defeat us-but Apathy might ! VOTE ! "
