Best argument for a pool wishing to move a stock up is talk of " secret processes and patents . " Last February the International Combustion Engineering Corp. , world 's leading manufacturer of boilers , automatic stokers , ash handlers and power plant devices , opened a new plant at New Brunswick , N.
