One can imagine Horace Greeley 's snort or Charles Dana 's explosion had the printer 's devil come to their elbow suggesting that there was too much copy to fill their papers , that their editorials had best be cast out . They would have shouted : " Throw away the rest and save the editorials ! " They were journalists conducting great journals . Today , we have newspapers run by newspapermen . <P> When The Gazette of Billings , Mont. , ran short of space , last week , it dumped overboard its editorial page . It announced that because of " tight space " it would eliminate editorials.
