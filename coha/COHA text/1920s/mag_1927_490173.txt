TRUE to the tradition of New York Harbor , M. Poiret , arriving from the other shore , commented on world conditions . He said American dressed much-affronted womanhood , this news will alarm them . We believe that our ladies would much prefer to go on believing that Paris is the citadel of beautiful gowns it gives them an excuse to go abroad , and it offers them what their husbands , in the business world , speak of as " an opportunity for advancement . " The American woman is not interested in being better dressed than anyone in the world  --  she is interested in being better dressed than Mrs. Frilly Gould-Frilly , in Apartment 3-B , who perhaps has n't been to Paris lately . THE opera opens Monday . That reminds us that the assessed valuation of the Metropolitan property is ahead of all other theatrical estates . The opera pays on about five million dollars , whereas Roxy comes in a had second with about four million . We wonder if it makes Mr. Rothafel feel vexed to think that the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and departed tenors , is still more valuable , in a coarse monetary way , than his up-to-date cathedral on Fiftieth Street with its hot and cold running entertainment . NE night during the recent ON tourney of warriors in Madison Square Garden we happened to encounter a detachment of the fighting men in the Forty-second Street shuttle , bound for battle . They were in dress uniform , a dazzling mass of gold epaulets , decorations , shiny buttons , medals , stripes , and other valuable and worthwhile ornaments of the warring life . They wore white gloves . They were so immaculate , so weirdly beautiful , that little shop girls , tottering into the car , were momentarily blinded by the strange brilliance . The car rapidly filled , it was theatre time ; dull throngs continued to push through the jammed door , pressing up rudely against the dressy soldiers . And presently we were treated to the earthy spectacle of Beauty trammelled , Immaculacy violated , and Infantry annoyed . Crushed by the democracy they had so recently made the world safe for , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index finger . It was n't any use  --  before they got to Times Square they were all mussed up ; they had lost all their glitter , all their shoe shine , all their love of democracy , even all the adulation of the shop girls , who were now tittering , quite loudly . THE worst has come to the worst , and some keen-eyed advertising men have finally noticed that women smoke . We , who have always reverenced womanhood , were brokenhearted last year when cigarette ads appeared in which ladies were depicted as saying : " Blow some smoke my way ! " Many of our ideals fell at that time . Now one cigarette manufacturer has placed cards in Fifth Avenue busses depicting ladies as actually holding lighted cigarettes between their fingers . They arc puffing in no uncertain terms . The truth has also been revealed in newspaper columns by other cigarette makers . With all romance dead in our life , we now look forward with sadistic glee to a perfect avalanche of realistic advertising , beginning with a ginger ale ad which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great big beaker of strong white gin . SHORT PURI'rY NOTE : To report a chimney from which black soft-coal smoke is issuing , in violation of the law and in defilement of everything , call Worth 9400 ( Commissioner Harris ' office ) and ask for Mr. Lonergan . Just tell him the whole dirty story . Question II N Westchester County there is a thriving antique shop conducted , in her own home , by a woman whose husband is an executive in a downtown corporation . Since it was started ? as an outlet for the wife 's urge toward a business career the house has been the scene of a constant procession of old furniture . Frequently the family has eaten lunch on one dining-room table and dinner on another . The son and heir of the household has come to take the shifting scene as part of life . Indeed , only that which is static bewilders him ! " Why is it , mother , " he asked the other day , " we have never sold the telephone ? " Horseman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageant at Saratoga has just sent in his report . He says the high moment of the affair , historically , was during the portrayal of a session of Congress when someone rose and cried : " A horseman ! a horseman ! " The enthralled spectators looked all about the field expecting to see a horse and rider , but none was in sight . Nobody was more surprised than the participants in the pageant . " A horseman ! " repeated the crier , and waited bravely . He waited bravely , in fact , several minutes , repeating at intervals his cry , " A horseman ! " When it seemed to everyone that American history was going to suffer a serious revision , far out on the dim horizon a horseman actually came into view . Those of the audience with field glasses had had him in sight all the time . He had been riding wildly up and down behind a barbed wire fence , the gate of which some unsung hero had forgotten to open . ? MR . GEORGE H. HONIG , who drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven o'clock last Wednesday evening , smokes a corn-cob pipe . We make note of this as a unique fact ; to the best of our recollection and belief we have never before seen a taxi driver smoking a corn-cob pipe . As nearly as we can remember , Mr. Honig 's number is 21,836 , and his official picture is a good likeness . Opera Goers To our restless eye there seems to be nothing sensational in the list of boxholders at the opera this season . There is , of course , as there is every year , evidence of the gradual change among the occupants of the boxes  --  dismaying undoubtedly to some who , realizing that the parterre horseshoe is the last and final stand of the old order of Society as a unit , realize likewise the truth that the old order inevitably chanzeth . The name Gould is on the list of boxholders for the first time in several years with the leasing of the Clews box on even Mondays . Miss Huguette Clark , the late Senator 's daughter , will be seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of Hetty Green and widow of the first John Jacob Astor 's great grandson , will be in No. 18 , and Mr. and Mrs. Myron Taylor will be visible in Mr. Kahn 's box even Mondays . Mr. Taylor was recently mentioned as the possible new head of the United States Steel Corporation . Also to be seen again this year will be Mr. and Mrs. William T. Dewart ; he not long ago bought the Evening Sun from the Munsey Estate ; Mr. Walter T. Salmon , builder of the Forty-second Street skyscraper , and Mrs. Harry F. Sinclair . For those interested in the material side of things we will recall that the value of an opera box was recently fixed by the tax commissioner as $120 , - THE NEW YORKER 15 000 , although boxes have sold for as much as $200,000 , and $500 is not an unusual price to pay if one rents a box on the opening night . From the musical point of view little excitement is expected over the three new works which are to have their first showing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's twentieth . Publix Service ONE precept which has spread widely is that you must n't try to tip a Paramount usher , that it is like thumbing your nose at the flag . An acquaintance of ours , however , duly ashamed of himself , informs us that while the Paramount attendants are tip-proof , this can be circumvented . He arrived there the other night , found the usual long line in the lobby , and approached one of the attendants with a frank and disarming smile . " I 'll match you for a seat , " he said , quietly . " Certainly , sir , " the usher replied , either because he had been instructed always to accede to the whims of patrons or because he was naturally sporting . They flipped . Our friend won . He got the seat . The Head Woman IF you know your musical comedy 1- you know the Albertina Rasch girls . Miss Rasch 's name threatens , in fact , to become as familiar on theatre programs as that of George Spelvin . Give this little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will turn you out a nicely clicking ballet in no time at all . ( She rehearsed and put on one recently in two weeks . ) Miss Rasch got her start in this work only two years ago . Her first ballet attracted producers when they noted that her girls had a way of dashing out before an audience and waking it up even more snappily than the Tiller girls . They began to seek out the place whence came this new note in musical comedy . One of the first to seek was George White , who had seen her original ballet at the Hippodrome where its initial two weeks ' contract was extended to ten . Mr. White asked Miss Rasch to give him a similar act for his forthcoming " Scandals . " She did , and since then she has been turning out her ballets in wholesale fashion . At present she has ballets in several local shows and she took one to Paris for the Moulin Rouge revue not long ago . The Albertina Rasch factory , the producers found , is in Steinway Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . If a show employs one of her dancing choruses she is the head man of that show so far as her girls are concerned , permitting no producer , director or stage manager to offer a command or suggestion to the dancers . This holds good through all rehearsals and the premiere of the play . Nor does anyone feel emboldened to interfere , for she drills her ballets like a Prussian officer , and although vivacious and given to humor can employ a vocabulary that is breathlessly picturesque . Miss Rasch is an Austrian with large round eyes , and she got her start in the Imperial Opera in Vienna . She became ballerina of a show at the Hippodrome in 1912 , followed that with two years of American opera , and then toured South America and Europe giving concerts . When she returned to the Hippodrome three years ago she found it gone movie and three-a-day . It was then that she accepted an offer to put on a dance act , got twenty girls together , and stopped the show . She found difficulty getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of giving the pupils free instruction and binding them to work for her afterward . She tolerates no temperament and takes only the girls that work hard , preferably those who have had no previous training . Her greatest ambition is a native American ballet to be patterned on the rhythms of the jazz-andmachine age . She points to Helen Brown of the current " Follies " as her first discovery . Miss Brown was a ballet girl two years ago . Five-Nineteen FOR reasons best known to herself , one of our friends moved to Flushing last week . On the afternoon following this great event , she was in the Pennsylvania Station , trying to locate the 5:19 in the labyrinthine vaults of the Long Island Railroad . Unable to find the train mentioned on the bulletin board and confused by the strange 1. irroundings , she finally approached a guard and asked him about the train . " It 'll be made up , " he assured her . " Where ? " she asked . " Around here somewhere , " he said . Our friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then asked him again . " Why are you so worried about that 5:19 ? " he wanted to know . " Well , " she replied irritably , " because I 've just moved to Flushing and I 'm not sure of myself . " " Listen , " said the guard , " if you 'd spoken to me before moving to Flushing , you never would have done it . " The Boulevard C ECTIONS of IJ the new Park Avenue have been thrown together and it is now possible to appreciate the majestic and solemn width of this expanded highway . The pavement , we notice , has been completed at the lower end , and the islands in the centre are surrounded by a low , stout fence  --  apparently firm enough for taxis to carom off with more danger to the cab than to the grass . ( There is no grass yet . ) The fence is less than three feet high , and could he hurdled by a chow and scaled by a Pekinese . As we walked up the Avenue it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivetters have moved in , and there is a general tendency to smooth things over . We were struck by the paucity of workmen for this massive project  --  there seemed to be less than a dozen to the block , although it is possible there were more down below , hanging by their teeth above the railroad tracks . The new width gives space for four lanes of so-called moving traffic on either side of the grass strip , as against two in the old dreary days when the centre of the Avenue was open to the public . At Fifty-seventh Street the widening process terminates , and it looked to us as though this would create something of a bottle-neck when things get going , although the worst of the midtown traffic is dispersed before it reaches that point . OCTOBER . 2 9 , 1927 The doorman at Sherry 's is our authority for the statement that the construction work will be finished sometime during November . If he believes it , we will . He was busy watching red-hot rivets hurtling through the air in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accuracy and charm of the rivet-passer held him spellbound . It was the first time that we had ever seen a doorman impressed . ? THEY are running the elevators twenty-four hours a day in one of the more conservative clubs in town . Fired by a desire to know why this extra expense was incurred , one of the members investigated . He found ( and carried the probe no further ) that the all-night service was put on because four gentlemen fell downstairs one night recently and the house committee had thought it worthwhile to keep the lift going . Sucker Club BECAUSE most night-club guests arrive in cabs , the club proprietors have long courted the friendship of drivers . It is quite customary to give them drinks . The other night we learned how greatly this friendship had flowered . It seems that there now exists the Chauffeur Sucker Club , whose members are engaged in the not very charitable occupation of guiding slightly dumb out-of-town suckers to New York 's night-life resorts . The driver returns later and collects a percentage of the check . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us four printed membership cards that he had in his pocket . They were to the Crystal Club , the Oh-Kay ( formerly Dolly Kay ) Club , the Knight Club , and the Lyons Club . These cards had the percentages printed or written on them , ranging from thirty-three and one-third to forty per cent . We merely happened to see those four  --  his pockets were alive with cards . He said that membership in the club is open to all drivers , regardless of religion . The Sucker Club , as now formally organized , is quite new  --  not more than six months old . The first night clubs to try the system started with a ten per cent rakeoff , but the ratio has now reached as high as fifty per cent in some cases  --  half the sucker 's check . The system includes many of the Broadway and sick-street establishments . Our man confessed that he garnered most of his suckers from the big hotels , but now and then discovered them in the streets , helpless as lambs . His alibi for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steer no nice guys in , " and that it " did n't do nobody no harm , exactly . " Many of the night drivers , he told us , concentrate on this sucker trade , but it is precarious . Sometimes a driver makes fifty to a hundred dollars in a night out of one or two customers . Then a whole week passes without a good prospect . The more methodical of the sucker-hunters keep a list of all large conventions which are to take place in New York , because they provide customers in droves . THIS business of " belonging " to a night club has possibilities . No less an authority on law and gaiety than Mayor Walker has advanced the opinion , just in a friendly way , that anyone holding a membership card in a club could go to court and petition to share in the profits of the club as a member . Under corporation law a " member " of a profitable enterprise , it seems , is a part owner . It 's worth knowing , if you happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local football games we found our seat high in the centre of the stadium and directly in front of the broadcasting apparatus . It may interest those whose football is of the " drop in for cocktails and hear the Harvard-Penn game " variety to learn how this thing is done The announcer talked into a microphone which resembled a desk telephone with neither mouthpiece nor receiver . He brandished it as he jumped up and down in his excitement and he waved it gracefully whenever he turned to receive the congratulations of the young lady who sat in the box behind him . About him clustered three observers and assistants who poured a running fire of comment into both his ears and wrote him notes . One sported gargantuan field glasses ( only used twice ) ; another nursed a direct-line telephone connection with the broadcasting station and he apparently reported the encouragement of the world at large as the business proceeded . The four of them faced an ingenious board on which were posted the names and numbers of the back field players in the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work . Only a few times did they forget which teams were playing on the field in front of them and hardly more than half of their reports of yards to gain were in error . The working press , hard-eyed and sarcastic , wedged in next to them , made caustic remarks while telegraphing play-by-play accounts without the aid of observers , charts and bulletin boards . The graduates sitting around us appreciated these attacks unreservedly . The announcer 's masterpiece , to us , was the heroic theme he wove through his narrative . " There 's Jones ! He 's got a bad leg and he 's out there calling signals like a man . You 're getting this through station WWW . There 's nerve for you , Jones out calling signals with his sprained leg ! " Escape THE story comes to us of a young lady who migrated here from the West , signed up for a two-room apartment in the Gramercy district , and then , in a calm moment , realized that she could n't possibly afford the rent . Panic seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She recalled having given three references to the " Light the pnauve lights , Therese I went to think . " real-estate agent . Without delaying an instant she sent the following telegram to her uncle , to her former employer , and to the president of the bank back home : IF ASKED FOR REFERENCE PLEASE WIRE COLLECT NICE GIRL BUT LEFT TOWN U NPA'fING BILLS . A few days later she received a letter from her realtor returning her deposit and refusing her application because , the letter stated , " her references were unsatisfactory . " She now lives happily and cheaply in the moderate Minettas.
