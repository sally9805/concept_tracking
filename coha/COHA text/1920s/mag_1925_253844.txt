A year ago , occurred the abominable assassination of Socialist Deputy Giacomo Matteotti ( TIME , June 25 et seq. ) , which shook the kingdom to its foundations and struck such a blow at the prestige of Benito Mussolini that he is only now recovering from it . <P> The Opposition asked the Government for permission to use the Chamber of Deputies for a memorial meeting . Permission was refused . The Fascist Party decided to hold a counter demonstration , but it was believed that the Premier had dissuaded them . At any rate , the first anniversary of the murder passed off quietly . Large numbers of police were ready for trouble , but none occurred .
