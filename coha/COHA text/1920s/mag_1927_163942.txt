Twenty-eight years ago the city of Denver appointed a " public guardian and administrator , " to care legally for its waifs , strays ; and orphans . The appointee was a young man from Tennessee , Benjamin Barr Lindsey , who two years later became judge of Denver 's juvenile court , which office he occupied ever since . Denver was not a soft town . And there was that in it , a scurrilous newspaper ( the Post ) , which put a terrible premium upon the social transgressions which sensational news pages did much to promote . Judge Lindsey has been a very busy man for 26 years , dealing with recalcitrant , vicious , ignorant and also foolish , reckless and genuinely happy young people . Out of minor bench in a secondary U. S. city , Judge Lindsey has made national rostrum. * <P> For 26 years his writings on juvenile sociologv have been chiefly confined to specific discussion of cases arising in his social clinic , with strong but never revolutionary suggestions to society at large . But last week , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the country his creed . First popular U. S. sociologist of national reputation to do so , Judge Lindsey came out flat-footed for 1 ) trial or " companionate " marriage ; 2 ) birth control . <P> The cases cited in Judge Lindsey 's article read just like contemporary fiction-young people desirous of living together , and doing so , but unable to live out the economic and psychological implications of the present marriage code . " Fred " and " Inez , " minors , thinking they had obtained an annulment of their marriage , secretly and joyously began living together again . " Katherine " and " George " were unable to stay in love when married since they took for granted they must impose restrictions upon each other- " marital jealousy being , as we all know , a cardinal virtue in our present marriage code though jealousy is demonstrably one of the most hideous vices . . . . " Judge Lindsey urged a legal form that would permit such couples to live together as long as they mutually desired . He thought that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by asking for a divorce card at a clerk 's window would almost invariably make them want to stay together and enter upon the later , more carefully prepared step of having children . Procreative marriages would be made more difficult of dissolution than at present . Open and above-board birth control was , of course , essential to the scheme . The combined innovations would put an end to sexual and contraceptive " bootlegging " ; would free modern youth of its " sex obsession . "
