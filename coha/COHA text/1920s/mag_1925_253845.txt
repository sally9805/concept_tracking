A Monarchy motion in the Reichstag to substitute for the black-red-gold republican flag the old black-white-red colors of Imperial Germany was rejected . <P> Apparently , this is only an academic defeat ; for not only are many republicans in favor of the old flag ( chiefly to end interminable discussion of the flag question ) , but most Germans use it . It was considered certain that the old flag will sooner or later replace the republican emblem . <P> The German marine flag is the same as the Imperial German , with the republican colors in the top left-hand corner .
