With heartfelt sympathy and hearty guttural cheers the Reichstag welcomed back from , a sevenmonths ' illness , last week , the nation 's acknowledged leader , Dr. Gustav Stresemann , " The German Lloyd George . " <P> As he slowly mounted the rostrum and then stood mopping his bald head , amid the rattle of handclaps and the roar of " Hoch ! Hoch ! HOCH ! " Dr. Stresemann seemed paler than usual but otherwise utterly " the typical German , " plump , correct and full of earnest energy . He , the smart son of a rich brewer , is the great Foreign Minister who has held office while eight German cabinets have fallen , and his ailing kidneys are those which have been of vital interest to all Europe for half a year . <P> Last week , on the occasion of Dr. Stresemann 's resumption of active command at the Foreign Office , he was expected to make a general declaration of policy , and did so , keynoting on : <P> I. Limitation of Armaments . <P> II .

I do not doubt that history will see in it an important advance toward better international relations . " <P> Finally the traditional desire of Republican Germany for general Limitation of Armaments was voiced by Dr. Stresemann. who said with a wry smile : " That is not only my policy , but must be the policy of every German Government . It is the only possible policy for a nation which the Powers have disarmed . " <P> Reparations . The principle on which the U. S. has made debt settlements with France and Italy- " capacity to pay " - was urged by smart Gustav Stresemann as the principle which must guide the new Reparations Revision Commission ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) . <P> Said he : " One will be able to speak of a real solution of the Reparations problem only if it does not exceed Germany 's economic capacity-in other words , if it enables us to fulfil our obligations by our own power and without endangering the standard of life of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
