Sons-in-law are incessantly reported vexed about their mothers-in-law . But rarely are they reported trying to poison them . Even in Abyssinia , small country in the northeast of Africa , where it is easy to poison people because they take so much red pepper at dinner that they can taste nothing else , sons-in-law have rarely been reported trying to poison their mothers-in-law . But last fortnight , an Abyssinian actually was accused of wanting to poison his Abyssinian mother-in-law . Further , he was accused of having succeeded . <P> Further , he is Ras Taffari , Regent of Abyssinia . His mother-in-law is dead . His accuser is Armenian Dr. Alexander Garabedian , onetime favorite of Ras Taffari . <P> This tale Doctor Garabedian tells . Six years ago he came to Abyssinia to practice the quieter forms of medicine . He became a favorite of Ras Taffari . But Ras Taffari wanted to become Emperor . Two persons were in his way . One was the Empress , Zauditu , daughter of the late Emperor Menelik II . The other was his mother-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Therefore , claimed Doctor Garabedian , when the mother-in-law fell ill two years ago , Ras Taffari wanted him to treat her , after Ras Taffari 's own fashion . But " Doctor Garabedian , man of scruples , would not . Consequently , Ras Taffari called in a rival of Doctor Garabedian 's , a sinister Greek . Soon the mother-in-law died . <P> Later , said Doctor Garabedian , Ras Taffari came to him , said the Empress , only remaining obstacle to the throne , needed medical attention . Doctor Garabedian would not undertake the case . Thereafter , claimed Doctor Garabedian , life was a series of subtle plots against his life , falsified political charges , unjust sentences . Last fortnight , he escaped from Abyssinia and Ras Taffari 's evil eye , all the way to Geneva , Switzerland . Immediately he went to the International Labor Bureau , sued for $120,000 for persecution , broken health .
