Last week the famed British Liberal , David Lloyd George , encountered heavy going when he attempted to secure the endorsement of the Liberal Candidates ' Association for his new land nationalization scheme ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) . <P> At first Mr. George pleaded for this unemployment panacea in its original form : 1 ) " Resumption of ownership " by the Government of all arable land ; 2 ) the former landlords to be reimbursed by guaranteed sums equivalent to their present rent ; 3 ) unemployed city and country laborers to be drawn into the small farmer class as " cultivating tenants " of the Government . <P> Shortly it appeared that the Liberals were reluctant to follow leader George into a situation which might restore him to all his old prestige if the panacea " worked " ; and might brand the Liberal Party as a parcel of radicals if the measure failed either in Parliament or later . As always the wily George threatened and yielded adroitly . He swore that he would resign from the party and go " out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Alfred Mond , a bitter foe of land nationalization . At length he yielded , just soon enough to secure notable concessions as a reward for not carrying out his threat to split the party . <P> As finally adopted by the Liberal candidates , the measure will go to the Liberal convention early next year in such a form as to propose the nationalization of arable land only in the following circumstances : <P> 1 ) When the land is placed on the market ; 2 ) when a farm becomes vacant ; 3 ) when an estate is badly administered ; 4 ) when a farm is badly cultivated . <P> Later in the week Mr. George attempted to dispel the prevailing impression that he is seeking a return to power . " I have had a longer stretch of office than any living man . I have served the Crown and nation in some of the highest offices of State . There 's nothing an office can give me . <P> " If I now choose , in a more obscure and humble position , against many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public life , it is because I want to spend the rest of my days and what is left of my strength in serving the people from whom I sprang .
