Fishing is as old as is mankind , and written history does not go back to its beginnings . The most ancient records refer to fishing as an old established thing . The Old Testament speaks familiarly of fish-hooks , and compares a woman 's eyes to fish pools . Fishermen played an important part in the life of Egypt six thousand years and more ago . The paintings on Egyptian tombs show fishermen at work using drag-nets , hooks , and lines , and also bronze harpoons . The Red Sea , the Nile , and the artificial lakes gave employment to a host of dark-skinned fishermen , and supplied sea food for all the tribes of Egypt . For the trick of drying and curing fish ? something not evolved in Europe till the fourteenth century ? was known to these remarkable narrowheaded Africans some six thousand years ago ! The tribes along the upper Nile each had their " sacred " fish , and when tribal wars occurred it was quite " the thing " to catch and eat the fishes worshiped by a foeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their boats were not built for rough and windy waters , and it is thought that they seldom ventured far from land . They were , primarily , lake and river men ? " tenderfeet " compared to the rugged sea rovers of more recent times . One part of the story of the fishermen is flooded with the brightest light of history . That is where Christ found his first disciples among the fishermen of Galilee . This was not an accident , but a natural outgrowth of the character developed in the type . Living in the open all year round , where " the infinite sky is mirrored in the vast and changeful sea , " a man becomes patient , humble , simple , open-hearted . Their lives are a continual venture , a mortal risk , and grim hard labor , with little relief ? and the end is often tragic .  | When Christ brought the fishermen of Galilee the " miraculous draught " of fish , they were dragging from their boats a great sunken net , bringing the ends of it together as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day in the sky-blue waters of Galilee . There has been no change of method in these nineteen hundred years . All over the civilized world the same thing is true ; we have no important tool of the fisher 's craft ? with the one exception of the trawl-net ? which was not known in the days of Christ . The classic Greeks were splendid fishermen and , living on mountainous islands , where farm land is scarce , sea food had a prominent place on their bill of fare . Thunnies ( now called tunny ) were the staple of their diet ? big fish , weighing sometimes quite a thousand pounds . The Greeks and Romans caught them by a most unpleasant method . They would drive a school of thunnies into harbors or lagoons and there beat the fish to death with harpoons and clubs . The Italians , in Sardinia , still practice this brutal method on the unhappy thunnies of to-day . The Greeks and Romans caught a great variety of fish , including cod , mackerel , whiting , perch , and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans were never remarkable as fishermen , considering the tremendous coast-line they commanded . But with the decay of the empire ? where men had lived on captured wealth and food given free by the state ? the Italians began to look to the sea for a living . To-day , over twenty thousand fishing boats hail from Italian ports . And such boats ! What a blaze of warm and mellow colors , with their striped hulls and orange patched sails on a sky-blue ocean ! The deep-sea fishermen of medieval times were a rough breed , primitive and very superstitious . But they kept sailing farther and farther from land , and their tarry nets sounded all the ocean depths  | of Europe . They fished in advance of the traders and " skirmished ahead of the Church , " naming islands , rocks , and shoals hitherto uncharted . They discovered fishing grounds of enormous value , and their work began to be a factor of importance . Kings and parliaments made laws to regulate their actions , and so settle sharp disputes over fishing rights . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was before they turned to piracy and war as more varied and amusing than hooking codfish . These superb sailors who conquered half of Europe are another proof that deep-sea fishing is the cradle of sea power , the best training for the navies of the world . The viking boats were strong and yet of graceful , " speedy " lines . Doublebowed like canoes , they were broad of beam and had easy buoyant " run " at bow and stern . The hull was painted in horizontal stripes , and the one square sail was decorated , too , in gorgeous hues , with sea-serpents , stars and moons , etc . A viking fleet on the greenish-gray North Sea looked like a royal pageant . Norway and Sweden still have off their coasts some of the richest fishing regions in the world . Cod in enormous numbers , mackerel in legions , herring in large but spasmodic migrations make those lovely northen seas a fisherman 's paradise . Norway alone has caught more than thirty-five million mackerel in a single season , and every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood of Olaf and Leif Ericson , has not forgotten how to handle boats or capture fish , and now , a thousand years since the vikings " got religion , "  | it boasts a host of able fishermen , " tall like their ships , with the sea in their eyes and the brine on their lips . " And how about the women ? Many Scandinavian fishwives share the heavy work and peril of their husbands ' lives . Their yearly record is as good as that of the men , but more of them are lost at sea . They lack the " inherited power " which makes their blond brothers as much at home in small boats as in their mothers ' laps . The seas around the British Isles fairly swarmed with herring away back in 1295 , when Edward the First ( that most English of all English kings ) kindly gave the Dutch permission to catch fish off Yarmouth . As the herring trade grew to mammoth proportions , it became a bone of international contention , and England lived to rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lived to see her navy fighting for its life against a nation whose supremacy was built on herring ! But that very navy was manned mostly by her fishermen , who have been more than once the iron shield of England . A herring ? when it is pickled ? can be kept and sold to distant markets , and that was the secret of Dutch prosperity . She owed it to the genius of an Englishman ? William Belkinson by name ? who rediscovered the old Egyptian trick of curing and pickling fish . To this invention the British Government was indifferent , but the Dutch ? always shrewd business men ? grasped  | the possibilities of enormous profit and adopted Belkinson at once . By the end of the fifteenth century the Dutch were selling pickled herring to the rest of Europe at the rate of twenty million dollars ' worth a year ! This in addition to the fish consumed in Holland . Truly , Dutch prosperity was mostly made of fish , and Holland 's " toilers of the sea " were of vital value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sea than France or England could produce by all their manufactures ! However , the " lion 's share " of Holland 's herring trade has passed into the hands of the British , who now catch nearly two billion herrings a year . Belkinson 's herring cure , after many years , came home to the island of his birth . Henry the Eighth was still marrying and disposing of his wives when daring fishermen from Britain and the continent crossed the Atlantic to try the waters of the new-found world . And it was off Newfoundland , amid fogs , shoals , and icebergs , that they struck the best cod-fishing grounds they 'd ever known . The French and Portuguese began to swarm across the ocean , mostly in pinnacles of some fifty tons . Flush-decked boats they were , without the great high bulky sterns , but otherwise rigged much like the galleons and caravels of the great Spanish Armada . It must have taken " grit " to cross the unknown ocean in those clumsy , leaky boats . The voyage took several months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food or of drinking water , dying in their cramped quarters while their square-rigged boats rode out the long gales and mountainous seas . In 1607 , Henry Hudson sailed from London in the old ship Hopewell , with a crew of only ten . Aiming to find a northwest route to China , he happened on the famous Greenland whaling grounds . " Right " whales had been hunted for five hundred years by the hardy fishermen of Spain 's Basque provinces , but they were becoming scarce , and whale products , oil and bone , were in demand in Europe . Fancy , then , the delight of these Englishmen when the  | seas around their ship became alive with monsters larger than the Spanish whales , and in far greater numbers . The British tried to " corner " the Greenland whale trade , but a whale is n't easily concealed , and the Dutch were soon up there in force . They succeeded , in fact , in beating out all rivals , and Dutch ports soon overflowed with whale oil . By the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , a record to be beaten later by our Yankee whalers from New Bedford . The implements and methods of fishing , as we know , have hardly changed since the earliest times . The one great change has been the use of the trawler , which was an English innovation . The trawler tows a great , funnelshaped trawl-net so arranged as to be a perfect trap for fish . The upper edge is floated on a horizontal beam and the lower edge ? or " ground rope " ? sweeps the ocean bottom . The reliable speed of steam trawlers and the great size of the nets they can tow has resulted in hauls of enormous quantity and value . But the world will always remember British trawlers for the " fish " that they caught during the great war ? hostile mines and lurking submarines . There is nothing finer in the story of the fishermen than the way these poor , rough men , without uniforms , publicity , or fame , labored night and day at the risk of instant death to sweep the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " undersea blockade " was given by England 's " silent navy " ? her hardy , unprotected fishermen . The French are devoted fishermen . Nearly fifty years ago they were sending over four hundred ships a year to the codfish grounds off Iceland and Newfoundland . Off Newfoundland , France was one of the first corners , and still has a good-sized fleet , based on the French island St. Pierre . But the ships she sent were mostly time-worn barks , not quite fit for the long and stormy crossing , and grim tragedies of ships and men gone down mark the story of old France on our fishing grounds . Thousands of fishermen from Normandy and Brittany compete with their northern rivals on the herring grounds . They are splendid fishermen , but , here again , are handicapped by lack of first-rate boats . Their vessels are not fitted to accommodate large hauls of fish and bring them home in good condition for the market .  | Nets are the Chinaman 's favorite lure , and they are very intricate , including all the kinds we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method is to get a bird the cormorant ? to do his fishing for him. * Across the Yellow Sea lies that island empire whose whole population lives mainly on fish , rice , and fruit . Just imagine the amount of fish consumed by over forty million people who have no other flesh food ! The Japanese islands swarm with fishermen ; there are nearly eighty thousand just in Nagasaki ! And , on the average , two thousand die each year in the sudden storms that burst upon those island shores . Bonito and tai are the most important of their catches , but they bring home in their picturesque boats an enormous variety of oriental " flappers . " It is interesting to reflect that the great Japanese navy , now the third largest in the world , could not have sprung into effective being with such dramatic speed unless manned by deep-sea fishermen . For Japan was still a hermit nation without a foreign trade of any size , and the fishermen that thronged her coasts were the only deep-sea sailors that she had . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with uncanny skill . The Solomon Islands , in particular , have a most interesting variety of method . Net and hook and line are used in every conceivable way , but the native genius is most conspicuous with those good old stand-bys , the spear and bow and arrow ! From a pier-like structure built out into the water the natives hurl their spears at gliding shapes below them , and so keen are their eyes , so well tuned are their nerves , that a spear rarely fails to pierce a scaly victim . Shooting fish with bow and arrow is even more of a feat , one which seems impossible to a European . But these supple islanders do it . Bonito and makasi are the largest fish which are caught in any numbers by the natives . The bonito is about as large as a man , and puts up a lively fight before it will surrender . If hooked it has to be afterward speared , and it requires two men ,  | as a rule , to kill the great , thrashing , beautiful monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as large sharks often attack it , an upset canoe will sometimes involve a free-for-all fight , with the possible loss of a leg or an arm in the bargain . Whaling has always been the big-game hunting of the sea . When the Mayflower dropped anchor off Plymouth , New England waters were very rich in whales . The Indians hunted them in their frail canoes , and speared them with rude , stone-headed harpoons , a feat which has few equals for sheer daring . Many dark-skinned sportsmen lost their lives in these dare-devil ventures . To get close to a whale and drive a harpoon into it ( with some twelve hundred feet of line attached ) ; to take a long , fast ride , towed by the sea monster , paying out rope when he dives and pulling up on him when he swims upon the surface ; finally to wear him out and , when he is exhausted , pull in close and give the death thrust with another lance ? all this sounds like the biggest of outdoor sports . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many a man has been killed by a blow from the tail flukes of a whale , or drowned when his boat was capsized by the furious thrash of the monster . Some have died a more horrible death between the red jaws of the creature . Those that chase the " king of fishes " need to have an iron nerve ? or else the luck of Jonah ! Those kind and plucky Quakers , who fled ( from our Puritan Fathers ) to Nantucket Island , built up a race of whalemen destined to be famous . The history of these Nantucket men and their thrilling contests with the deep-sea monsters reads like a legend from the days of the early vikings . They sailed farther and farther from home , eventually going far into the Pacific on cruises often lasting for two years or more , while their reputation as keen and daring whalers spread to every European port . The British who never seemed to have much luck with whales ? liked to seize Nantucket men to serve on British whalers , often offering them high pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nantucket ! A sand bar in her harbor spelled her ruin , for the large new type of whaling vessel could n't clear it . Gradually her whalemen emigrated to New Bedford , and that port became the whaling Mecca of the  | I " odd . By the year 1845 a great fleet ? some seven hundred vessels ? hunted - hales beneath the Stars and Stripes . In this year sperm whales alone yielded us nearly five million gallons of oil . But 1854 was the apex of the whaling " boom , " when our catch was valued at 10,000,000 ? and a dollar meant something in those days ! From that time on , the industry has shrunk until to-day we have only forty ships at work . The whale has been driven from his familiar haunts and his only refuge now is in the polar regions , where a big fellow , weighing nearly eighty tons , can still enjoy some privacy and sea room . Since European sailors in the days of " Good Queen Bess " brought home record catches from the Grand Banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off the tip of Cape Cod ? have become the gold mine of the Yankee fishermen . From all the New England ports swarmed the fishing craft , and as early as the year 1732 one hundred and twenty ships fished the banks from the port of Marblehead alone . But great industries tend to centralize , and gradually Gloucester absorbed the fishermen of the coast from New London up to Halifax . To-day she ranks as the world 's greatest fishing port , a base for able fishermen of nearly every race . " Russ , German , English , half-breed , Finn , Yank , Dane , and Portugee , At Fultah Fisher 's boarding house they rested from the sea . " But it is still inheritance from the early Yankee type which gives character to the Gloucester fleets . The willingness to race their ships at every opportunity is an Anglo-Saxon trait , and one which makes our fishing fleet unequaled as a money maker . But the build of the ships has much to do with that , for it is a long way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , able , seaworthy schooners of to-day . E. K. Chatterton , the English nautical authority , says , " Off the banks of Newfoundland , cod-fishing , are to be seen the finest schooners in the world , which come out of Gloucester , U. S. A. For beauty of form , for speed , for sea-keeping qualities , they are little short of marvelous . " It thrills a man to see them racing out to the banks in a breeze , their easy hulls careened well down into the heaving flood of foam , their sails set like those of yachts in a race . to make every inch of canvas tell . And ,  | unlike the racing yachts , they can stay at sea no matter how wildly old Neptune runs amuck . In winter a Gloucester man will often " strip his poles " and ride out a howling gale that has driven every coastwise steamer into port . The banks fisherman is ready to take risks to save the lives of others friends or foes . Rough , profane , and often a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his credit . As an illustration , here is a true incident , told me by a Gloucester man of the schooner Dawn : In 1910 the seiner Eleanor was dismasted in a storm and driven on outlying rocks . She slipped half off , filled rapidly , and was being ground to pieces when the schoonerDawn came up and stood by to take off the Eleanor 's crew . The wind had abated , though the waves were running high , and the Eleanor 's skipper decided to dare the big seas , in the seine boat , rather than remain and risk going down with the ship . After a breathless struggle the trip was made in safety , though one man 's head was cut open in trying to board the Dawn . And then it was discovered that something had been forgotten ! Something , did I say ? No indeed , someone . The ship 's dog , " Mr. Christopher , " was still aboard the wreck ! " By the Lord ! " said Captain Joyce , " I 'm goin ' to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made the perilous crossing , and plucked " Mr. Christopher " from the deck of the dying ship . " Would you believe it , " he said , " that little cuss was settin ' on the cabin light with one ear up and t' other down , as calm as if the hull thing was a lark . He jest knew , that dog did , that we would n't leave him there ? If the old seine boat had capsized we 'd a got there to him , bottom up , paddling with our boots . " That 's the kind of heart that beats beneath the oilskin jackets ! The death rate among American fishermen is still sadly impressive . Fishing schooners , swarming on the shallow banks , are often driven together by a sudden gale , at night . Thrown by the steep , half-breaking waves , they collide with fearful force and go to pieces in seas where a dory can not live . Or a schooner is often struck , in a fog , by the mighty steel prow of a liner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the example of fishing from dories , and soon proved that fish bite better at a distance from a vessel . This  | practice is now universal ? off Newfoundland ? and has made our fisherman a very expert boatman . It has increased the dangers of the work , for the little dories are often lost in fog , and the dory men drift for days at the mercy of storms , starvation , and cold . Gloucester is always mourning some of her sons who have died this lingering death on the great , fog-bound Atlantic . Winslow Homer 's famous picture , " The Fog Warning , " shows vividly this aspect of the peril . He is the man who , above all others , pictures the rugged grandeur of the sea toiler . Winslow Homer reached the art-loving public ; it remained for Rudyard Kipling to bring the " down East " fisherman to the great mass of reading people . His " Captains Courageous " ranks as one of the best stories of the American fisherman . It is a plain picture of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , too , are enacted " out o ' Gloucester , " and romance runs like a golden thread through the weave of the fisherman 's life . James B. Connolly was the man to bring this home to the American public in a series of Gloucester stories . Mr. Connolly knows the fishing fleet as no other living writer knows it . He knows the men and women of the coast ? their viewpoint , their affections , and their foibles . There are certain traits that mark the fisherman , whatever age he lives in and whatever sea he sails ? traits developed by the lonely vastness of the sea and the hard uncertainty of his own reward . Unorganized and leaderless , with a grim indifference to labor unions too , they have a quiet , stubborn patience that smacks of the sullen power of the sea itself . Rough , poor , and generally illiterate , they have had a strong influence on history , as discoverers , as wealth producers , and as fighters . They are one of the silent forces not yet realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land .  |
