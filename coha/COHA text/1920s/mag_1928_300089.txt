Porto Rico . Last week a stalwart gentleman , who looks something like a beardless , bespectacled Abraham Lincoln and something like William Gibbs McAdoo , surveyed a great task . He is Henry M. Baker , Red Cross National Director of Disaster Relief , who sailed to Porto Rico immediately after the recent hurricane . Two immense , related problems faced him . One was the feeding , clothing and housing of countless jibaros ( peasants ) . The other , more vast , more complex , was the rehabilitation of agriculture , involving financing and credit in thousands of individual , differing cases . <P> The food problem is twice as great as that faced at any one time following last year 's Mississippi floods . Mr. Baker estimated that he must feed over 500,000 persons for the next month . At the end of that time he hopes that the crisis will have passed . This will require $30,000 a day and 1,000 to 1,500 tons of food per week . Agricultural credit facilities are now nonexistent , and must be created . Mr. Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 houses for employes . He promised the houses on condition that his investigation proves them necessary . The Red Cross will shortly provide 20,000,000 seedlings . Coffeemen want $60 per acre , paid over four years in diminishing amounts . The estimated coffee loss is over $25,000,000 . <P> <P> Mr. Baker stated that farm relief was the only means to accomplish the Red Cross task , for with credit established through an agricultural credit corporation , labor for thousands would be available . He cabled the national organization that over 60 nurses might be necessary to cope with the influenza , typhoid and malaria epidemics from which 20,000 are ill . Education was another phase of Porto Rican life which suffered . One thousand one and two room rural school buildings were totally destroyed . <P> Henry M. Baker is no tyro . He has looked on disaster 45 times . His look habitually signals the end of chaos . He supervised relief after the Northern Ohio Tornado of 1924 , the Midwest Tornado of 1925 , the Florida Hurricane of 1926 . During the Mississippi Valley floods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyance to 149 Red Cross camps . His organization provided food and shelter for 607,000 . He was educated abroad , and took post-graduate work in Social Economy at the University of Missouri and the St. Louis School of Social Economy . <P> Florida . From Florida came the following " absolutely conservative figures " of George W. Carr , general chairman of relief work . " Homes seriously damaged-11,389 ; homes completely destroyed-3,584 ; business houses seriously damaged-1,447 ; business houses completely destroyed-552 ; number families homeless-4,800 ; number people homeless-16,082 ; medical department estimates deaths in excess of 2,000 ; estimates of damage to perpendicular improvements-$33,875,000 . . . . Total figures above do not include damage to sea walls , docks , bridges , highways , floating equipment , crops , farming machinery , house furnishings , personal property and the like . The most conservative estimate of the damage to Palm Beach is $50,000,000 plus economic and labor losses to clean up the debris . "
