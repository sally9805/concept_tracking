: ' Longest " <P> The Manhattan banking firms of Speyer &; Co. and J. &; W. Seligman &; Co. now control the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Co. ( the Frisco ) . In the past two months , they have quietly been buying up a substantial interest in the Rock Island &; Pacific Railway Co. ( the Rock Island ) , an interest which the directors of the Frisco announced last week had been acquired by them with a view to merging the two systems . The new system will have the longest trackage in the world-13,585 miles , 5,546 in the Frisco and 8,039 in the Rock Island-overrunning by more than 1,000 miles the 12,447 miles of the Southern Pacific System . The combined assets will total $875,000,000 . The merger also will put the two banking houses on a peerage as really great railroad bankers with J. P. Morgan &; Co. and Kuhn , Loeb &; Co . But the Interstate Commerce Commission must approve such a merger. * The Frisco has two principal lines , which cross at right angles . One starts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas , Oklahoma and Texas . Another line extends southeasterly from Kansas City to Birmingham , Ala. , where by arrangement with the Southern Railway it makes connection with the 147 miles of the Muscle Shoals , Birmingham &; Pensacola , of which the Frisco recently got control . This branch gives it tappage to the present Florida flood of shipments . The main line of the Rock Island runs from Chicago to Denver and Colorado Springs , with another line going from Chicago to Santa Rosa , N. M. , where it joins the El Paso &; Southwestern ( a branch of the Southern Pacific ) . Other lines stretch from St. Louis to Kansas City , St. Paul and Minneapolis . Altogether it covers 14 Midland states . At St. Louis , Kansas City , Memphis and elsewhere it makes contact with the Frisco . Thus the southern termini of the merged lines will be Pensacola , Fla. , on the east , and Fort Worth , Tex. , on the west ; in the north Chicago , St. Paul and Minneapolis ; in the west Denver ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger brings out some intricacies of railroad financing . The Rock Island and the Southern Pacific have long worked together ; have run through trains from Chicago to the Pacific Coast . These two roads had the same bankers until the late Edward Henry Harriman ( died 1909 ) bought the Southern Pacific with the desire of merging it with the Union Pacific . He took his business to Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , where it had remained until this new development . The Frisco used to be one of the Gould roads , until the intricate financial strength of that family became unloosed and scattered . <P> Coc '
