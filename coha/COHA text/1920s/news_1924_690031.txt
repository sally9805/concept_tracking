txt Pope Pius paid another remarkable tribute to America today in an impromptu address delivered at the second of the series of ceremonies incident to the elevation of Archbishops Hayes and Mundelein to the Cardinalate . The occasion was the bestowal of the Cardinal 's violet cape , edged with ermine , known as the mozzetta , and the scarlet biretta , a four-cornered cap of the same order as the black biretta worn by ordinary priests . This ceremony precedes the culminating events of tomorrow , when the Holy Father will 11 place the great red hats on the Cardinals ' heads in a service of remarkable splendor at the Basilica of St. Peter 's . In his address today the Pontiff Pic ' tured the growing might of America and its seemingly boundless future . " What will America be fifty years from now , what will America be a century from now ? " he exclaimed " What will that America become whose condition a hundred years ago could be summed up by a few statistics and data , and which  --  it seems but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , decided the fate of the world by her intervention in the war , and which even today still saves millions of wretched human beings from want and starves- , lion ? Sees Rich Harvests Sown . " Yes , what will America be in a century from now if her life continues to pulsate with as powerful a beat as at present ? What will be the state of that great , of that wonderful country , whose men have two inestimable treasures greater than any material treasure  --  intelligence and the will to do ? What will be the state of that giant country , where everything is gigantic , where everything is counted in millions , where men , finding earth too small , build their houses into the skies that they may have a wider field of vision ? " The Holy Father spoke entirely extempore . He began so softly as to be almost inaudible , but gradually warmed to his subject until his voice rang loud and clear . As he spoke he gesticulated with his right hand , and his kindly eyes beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . at other times he spoke with an impetuosity and fire which left his listeners in no doubt as to his sincerity . His simple , unaffected style and the great , fatherly love manifest in his every word and in his every gesture left no heart in the room unmoved . Then , turning to the two new Cardinals . he said : " Blessed are you who have borne your share in these great developments . You have sown , you still sow , and you will continue to sow ; and you will continue to reap large harvests , as your successors will also reap rich harvests through your efforts . " Just as Christ plowed the furrow and the apostles sowed the seed and we reap the harvest , so you have plowed the furrow in America , which is already richly productive , and into that furrow you continue to pour your apostolic labor . Over that furrow , and over your apostolic labor we have laid the holy purple symbol of souls , such as yours which are prepared for all renunciations , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene of Splendor and Beauty . It was in the Consistorial Hall , in his state apartment , that the Pope , surrounded by all his court , with his own hands placed the scarlet biretta upon the heads of Cardinals Hayes and Mundelein and draped the violet cape over their shoulders . This ceremony is the most important after the secret consistory of last Monday , being the first function at the Vatican in which to welcome them with the honors pertaining to their new dignity . It ranks second only to tomorrow 's Public consistory in St. Peter 's , when the Supreme Pontiff will Confer upon them the full insignia of Princes and Senators of the Church . Today 's ceremony was different in character from last Monday 's secret consistory , seeming , by comparison , almost informal . Today there was no music , no procession of white-haired Cardinals , no carrying of lighted tapers , no stringent rules of ceremonial . The consistorial hall , in which be-stowal of the biretta took place , is a large , oblong room , lighted by four large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with red damask and adorned with large oil Paintings , while its ceiling is heavily decorated with gold . At one end of the room , on a raised dais covered with velvet , is the Pope 's massive gilt throne . with red and gold back and seat , and with scarlet drapings . The throne stands beneath a high canopy of red velvet , decorated with gold and surmounted by the papal arms in gold . Behind the throne bang priceless tapestries . The Pope entered the chamber walking , surrounded by his court , the ecclesiastics in violet . laymen in Elizabethan costumes , the Noble Guard in blue with shining helmets . As at the secret consistory , the Pope was dressed in white , except that today he wore a short scarlet cape edged with ermine . On his entry all dropped to their knees , while the Holy Father imparted the apostolic benediction , and then the court grouped itself around him in a picturesque array , with the master of ceremonies and the master of the pontifical chamber standing on the dais at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately thereafter . introduced by the Cardinal Secretary of State . Emotion was visible in their countenances , though calm and collected they performed the various ceremonies with precision . They paused to kneel three times , and then between two masters of ceremonies , who had hprried forward to meet them , advanced to the Pope 's throne , where they again fell on their knees and reverently touched with their lips the cross embroidered in gold on the tip of his slipper . The scene at this point was one of great beauty . In this large hall , of exquisite proportions and beautified with every device that art and genius can devise , were gathered men in full evening dress and women in black robes aid black mantillas : ecclesiastics in robes of Various colors , gathered around a venerable , white-haired and white-robed figure sitting on a golden throne . under rich hangings of scarlet velvet . Over the whole scene a diffused light was radiated from myriads of electric bulbs , reflected from red damask tapestries and priceless paintings .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
