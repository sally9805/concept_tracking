VISITING one of our banking friends at his noisy downtown office , we found him suffering a slight deafness and a neurasthenia , after a solid year of listening to rivetting and pile driving in the neighborhood of Broad and Wall . The district is certainly changed . Four large financial buildings have gone up within a radius of two blocks , skies have dwindled , and the clamor is still incessant . Nor is there any prospect of relief , since plans are heard of for a companion building to the Bankers Trust at 10 Wall , a building at Wall and Broadway , and a fifty-six story affair to be bounded by William , Wall , and Exchange Place . Not to mention the Nassau Street subway . Much of the noise , our friend said , came from the attempts to dislodge the old dynamite-proof vaults which always remained , tomblike , after the banks had been razed , and which virtually had to be filed away , inch by inch . This somewhat distressing picture of a financial district so prosperous that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came to us just in the nick of time for we 'd been trying to think of something to give Mr. J. P. Morgan for Christmas ( something he has n't got ) and it occurred to us that a pair of earmuffs would be just the thing . THESE are murderous days in the drama . Just try to find a suitable play at which to entertain Miss Pinkney , your maiden aunt from Newton Center . We made a casual count of theatrical offerings the other night and found twelve successes based on murderous intent ? " Broadway , " " Mary Dugan , " " Escape , " " Interference , " " Nightstick , " " The Letter , " " The Racket , " " Coquette , " " Dracula , " " Porgy , " " The Spider , " and even that nice old Greek thing , " Electra . " There must be some reason why the public wants murder more than anything else . Our theory is that audiences arc made up quite largely of persons who work eight dull hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to kill their employer . When night comes , a killing is the only thing that relieves them . THE buzz of a mosquito , the cry of a baby , the long whistle of a locomotive  --  these are cosmic sounds , suggesting the continuance of life and the inevitableness of everything . In the same way , the notes of a bugle strangely suggest that wars will go on . On the same day that Russia made the surprising proposal for nations to disarm by getting rid of their instruments of war , we happened to be in a suburb where " The Big Parade " was showing . We dropped in to refresh our memory of the picture . What most drew our thoughts was the audience : they quickened appreciably at every martial sound , their pulse was keyed to patriotism . The irony , the inanity , the hideousness  --  these were nothing . And when Jim Left his shellhole in a wild rage to " get the guy that got his buddy , " there were cheers and clapping of hands . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call may still nullify , in two minutes , anything that might be accomplished in countless hours of negotiations at Geneva . WITH the explorers leaving no V V ice-floe unturned , it becomes increasingly difficult for us stay-athomes to maintain the Santa Claus legend in children 's articles . In the presence of our highly literate nephew the other day , we made some furtive references to the North Pole and St. Nicholas . " It 's very funny , " he said , deprecatingly , " that David Putnam has been up there and yet there 's no mention of Santa Claus in his book ! " Six-Day Wonders BICYCLE racers do not become millionaires . A man who for years has had an oily finger in the clockwork that makes the six-day bicycle riders go round advises that Iron Man McNamara does not average DECEMBER 1 0 , 19 27 more than fifteen thousand dollars a year . If he wins this week 's race he will make about four thousand dollars . The cyclists are paid by the day , the lowest rate being fifty dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three hundred for the better men , and rarely more than five hundred for the topnotchers . McNamara , who has won thirteen grinds , is the only rider now paid five hundred a day . The highest-paid racer was Alfred Gullet , who at his best demanded and received a thousand dollars a day . There is of course the prize money , thirty-five hundred dollars , of which the winning team gets a thousand , the second team eight hundred , and so on . The special sprint prizes donated by spectators range from twenty-five dollars to two hundred . The riders must pay for their trainers , helpers , tires and repairs , and this sometimes is as much as three hundred dollars a week . As we get it , the sport is now only nominally a competition , the management having coldly decided to consider it a spectacle and taken upon itself the autocratic power of selecting the teams . A man used to choose his own partner , but the riders are now arbitrarily paired by Mr. John Chapman , the promoter . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two racers in this week 's field , were teamed , apparently because it was thought that their high probability of winning would be desirable from the standpoint of the crowds . Mr. Chapman is not only the czar of selection , but the despot of disbarment . There is no appeal from any decision he makes . The sport was once controlled by the National Cycling Association , a more or less disinterested organization , which seems to have been absorbed by the Cycle Racing Association , Chap-man 's body . This organization pretty much dominates six-day racing throughout the country ( there are tracks in Chicago and Detroit ) and appears to be dedicated to keeping it a fairly rare spectacle . It recently denied an independent promoter a franchise for a track in Philadelphia . Whatever it now is , the race has a tradition of competition , not to say struggle . The first race in this city , in 1891 , was won by Plugger Bill Martin riding alone . In those days a man rode until he fell exhausted , and went on when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one we shall call , for no good reason , Mr. Rollo Holmes , and he had an unforgettable experience at the six-day race . He is one of those presentable young men who , reasonably witty and amiable , enjoy a social calendar usually without a blank line . His income , however , is just about sufficient for lodging and nice clothes . Rollo was one of a gay party that dropped into the Garden on a night when special prizes for sprints were being offered right and left . He saw the riders tearing around the track for money rewards in the name of Miss Somebody of the " Follies , " of a big sand and gravel man from Long Island , of half a dozen persons he could not identify . It was all quite thrilling . Rollo thoroughly enjoyed it until there roared out of the loudspeakers the amazing news of another prize . " Announcing , " roared the announcer , as the thousands hung on the words , " a special prize of two hundred dollars for a one-mile sprint donated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Roll000 Hoonoltnesi " repeated the announcer . Mr. Rollo Holmes , who had n't had two hundred dollars since his last quarterly allowance , went pale and clutched the railing . The riders were a blur of steel after his special prize , but he did n't see them . He was in a daze , in fact , until he left the place without , somehow or other , the two hundred dollars being demanded of him . He did n't recover his poise until the next day when he learned the money had been put up in his name by his host , who likes a practical joke and can easily afford the amount for a chuckle . Memories LIVING for the old days almost entirely , a householder who owned a comfortable home in Yorkville decided to redecorate . After a day 's thought , a week 's pilgrimage , and a month 's labor , he provided the interior of his house with a fine mahogany trim . When friends observed a strange light in his eyes , they questioned him and found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmed his home with memorial lumber . Henry Savage AN old associate who attended the funeral of Henry W. Savage in Boston last week remarked that he would probably have preferred it simpler than it was . He revealed to us that the distinguished producer , the week before he died , had written out a list of those who ought " to be invited to his funeral , " and had given it to an assistant , jokingly remarking that he thought they would all be glad to come . The names he had set clown were mostly those of stage electricians , carpenters , scene shifters , former servants and employees on his Florida farm . And they all were at the services in Boston , joining with scores of old family friends in paying their respects . Savage was personally known by few of the present generation in New York . He divided nearly all of his time when in town between his home in Central Park West and his office in the Harris Theatre Building in Forty-second Street , and his circle consisted of but a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , a unique and a lovable man . In his Harvard days he was known as a gay undergraduate ( he was a con-temporary o f Roosevelt and Robert Bacon ) and afterward , while a real es-tate man in Boston , he was active socially . When , however , he became a theatrical pro-ducer , his temperament changed and he began leading a nearly cloistered life . He went into the theatre accidental-ly , or at least suddenly . One afternoon in 1894 the manager of a German opera company playing at the Castle Square Theatre in Boston slipped off to Europe , leaving his company strand-ed . The troupers sought out Mr. Savage , whose only connection with the theatre was that he had built it . He said that he would like to hear them rehearse and , having listened , agreed to produce the company 's rep-ertoire . The venture was successful and afterwards he produced opera in English . That succeeded too . In 1900 he came to New York and soon he was one of the leading theatrical figures in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other musical shows his day began at 7 A.M. and lasted until after the ordinary din-ner time . He always slept little and for years he arose at five o'clock and rode in the Park for an hour or two . His only other interests , aside from his family , were his yacht and his farm in Florida , upon which he raised grape-fruit that he often sent to friends . A descendant of New England farmers , he was pleased when his son chose farming rather ? than the theatre , and he used proudly to display in his office eggs , apples , and such , which the younger Savage had sent him . A slow worker , he liked to smoke his pipe over problems . His desk and his office were cluttcry . He gave long audiences to employees but always seated distinguished visitors and others likely to be boresome in a fantastically carved Japanese chair , known as the guest chair , which was so uncomfortable that no one could remain in it long . He often lost his pipe and he mislaid practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors by losing their manuscripts . His friends were amused when , last year , while returning by train from Hot Springs , he lost his shoes . The porter lent him a pair , in which he arrived home , and the Pullman Company , being unable to explain how even the most absent-minded of men could lose a pair of shoes in one of its cars , sent him a cheque to cover the loss . He exhibited it for days before cashing it . He was never good at keeping appointments and he never took up with the modern idea of discussing business matters at lunch . The former shortcoming he partially overcame by keeping the ship 's clock on his desk always ten minutes fast . This allowed him that much time to get to a meeting . On the meal question he did not compromise , SIX-DAY BIKE . RACE however , and almost invariably at the noon hour he slipped out alone for a bowl of milk and graham crackers , usually eating at an Automat . ? WHEN a gentleman arose from behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in a crowded subway train , the object of his gallant gesture was beaten to the seat by a red-faced woman bearing several bundles . Said the victor , as she settled herself , " Well , it 's what you get for living in New York . " Model Oh ! 1V1 R. GASTON PLANTSFF , Eastern manager of the Ford Motor Company , requested the pleasure of our company at the First Formal Showing of the New Ford Auto-mobile in the Em-pi re Room of the Waldorf-Astoria , and do n't think we were n't there bright and early . Sur-rounded with flowers and lulled with the " Song of the Volga Boatmen " played by a string quartet , the van-guard of a waiting world learned that the New Ford has an electric windshield wiper , a nickel radiator , and a gasoline gauge  --  and oh , the difference to us . It was DECEMBER 10 , 19 Z7 easily the biggest thing since Lindbergh . There were the cars , each with a red ribbon diagonally across its hood , like a committeeman 's shirt-front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh 's and Ah 's and MY 's . Ladies climbed without further ado into the driver 's seat , clutched the hand throttle reminiscently , leaned against the horn button by mistake , and vouchsafed the information that it was all terribly confusing . " I know positively , " said the lady next to us , addressing her husband , " that Minnie will be thrown completely off . You know how she used to go into neutral , pressing it halfway down ? Well , this is n't that way at all ! " THE little cars looked so ineffably beautiful ( they looked to us like La Salles that had n't quite hatched ) that the first reaction the skeptics had was that there was probably a catch in the whole thing somewhere . The room was instantly full of fender-testersmen who seized the fenders in a firm grip and tried to wrench them to pieces to see if they were made of cardboard . We saw one unbeliever  --  he was a strapping man  --  grasp the roadster by its little nose and give it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . By ten o'clock there was very little gloss left on any of the models , they had been so climbed on , prodded , poked , felt of , pinched , twisted , and mauled . The room soon became so overcrowded that we cast about for an open space , and finally found one in a corner . There was one other man there  --  Clarence Chamberlin . Nobody had glanced up from the automatic windshield wiper long enough to notice him . The new car , it must be said , is a completely changed vehicle in every way . An old Model T man ourself , we had a strange longing to find something on the car that even faintly resembled the parts we once knew so well . But we failed . The steering wheel is thin , and the color of milk chocolate . The choke is under the instrument board . The wheels are steel-spoked . The gas tank is filled through a pipe in the cowl . Nothing is where it used to be ! Our guess is that Mr. Ford will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they threw their audience into ecstasies which these hardened eyes had seldom seen in so mechanical a setting . " Bet it 'll take you there and get you back ! " a cheerful voice remarked , as we took a parting glimpse . " lArhere ? " we inquired , timidly . And he did n't know . False TWO twenty-gallon kegs of real old Bourbon whiskey provided the excuse for the president of a. large drug company to invite in sonic of his friends last week . Everything seemed right ; samples of the whiskey had been drawn from the spigots , analyzed by his own chemists , and pronounced Bourbon . He had paid a bootlegger fourteen hundred dollars for the remarkable find . But after the first few drinks , the first twenty-gallon keg suddenly went dry , and the owner tearfully discovered that a bulkhead had been built in the bottom of the keg . Except for about two quarts of Bourbon right next to the spigot , the keg contained a whitish liquid laughingly analyzed by chemists as water . The other keg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , the bilked citizen re-vealed the details . The boot-legger had come to his office , casually mentioned the names of mutual friends in a western city where the man had connections , and had agreed to deliver the Bourbon and await payment until it had been an-alyzed . The citizen did n't see how he could go wrong . But wrong he went . " I wonder , boys , if that Matisse will stand more than this hurried inspection . " THE NEW YORKER Pride of Profession AR ED-C HEEK ED youngster in a white jacket behind a soda fountain was given pause the other day when a gentleman ordered " Soda , double-decker , all black . " The clerk , a tyro , we gathered , surreptitiously sought the counsel of an older colleague . " That , " explained the veteran , " means a chocolate soda with a double shot of chocolate cream . " As the youngster set about preparing this , the older clerk turned to us with the air of a gifted surgeon who had just made a difficult anatomical point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he observed , " to learn the soda game . " Salesmanship WHILE the days preceding a man 's marriage are commonly discounted by his business associates , his services being regarded as temporarily fantastic and of no real value to the company , we are able to cite a notable exception in the case of a young gentleman , an insurance salesman , who spent at least one profitable day prior to his recent wedding sending out the following letter to his friends : " Dear B : As you have prob-ably heard , I am to be married on December 6 . Several of my friends have expressed their desire to conduct in my behalf a testimonial drive for life-insurance applications . I prefer , however , to address my friends and policyholders direct , believing that this is an opportunity to do something for me and at the same time benefit themselves . The amount of each application is not important , but I have reason to hope that the total number of applications will be significant . Your cooperation is earnestly solicited . For your convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can provide you with from five to ten thousand dollars with this company without a medical examination . If you prefer any other company , I shall be glad to accommodate you . Believe me , with kindest regards . . . . " The letter diverted several persons from buying a mantel clock or a salad plate and did help the bridegroom along in his business . Holding His Age IT was in April that our distin-1 guished citizen Mr. Chauncey Depew celebrated his ninety - third birthday , b u t only last Thursday were we told of something interesting that happened on that occasion . One of the earliest of the many well - wishers to call on him that day remarked on his eternal middle-age . " And they say you 're ninety - three , Mr. Depew ! Why you do n't look a day over seventy-five ? " The next enthusiast exclaimed , " Not ninety-three surely , Mr. Depew ! You know you do n't look a minute over sixty . " The recipient of these reassurances turned to greet a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-three , " declared this caller . " Why , you seem hardly more than fifty-five . " When he had gone Mr. Depew turned to an associate . " That last fellow , " he said , " was trying to flatter me . " Sugar Hill THE Vanderbilt Avenue taxi entrance to Grand Central is called Sugar Hill by the Red Caps who toil , heavily laden , up and down its rich slopes , because travellers arriving there are reputed to give somewhat larger tips than elsewhere in the terminal . This and other facts about luggage-toting were told us by a mildly surprised lady who recently engaged in conversation a porter who had been particularly gallant with her suitcase . In the course of the chat it turned up that he was a college graduate , a summer student at Columbia , and was working for an M.A. At the present time , rustling hat boxes and golf bags on the Hill , are five graduate medical students ( one of them an honor student at Harvard ) , several lawyers , singers , teachers of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hill itself is a coveted stamping ground be- ? ? cause the porters are paid no salary ; they must subsist on tips . Three years ago , when there were fewer porters on duty , hustlers in the terminal averaged as much as forty-two dollars a week , but this figure has been reduced somewhat . There are now five hundred porters , and five dollars a day is considered par . February and March are the lean months called Lent in the vernacular . The Red Caps are assigned to Sugar Hill on the basis of seniority . The aspiring M.A. explained that success comes largely to the porter who can spot two-bit customers . Englishmen are " dime people . " Bridegrooms , travelling salesmen , and some types of ladies are regarded as unlikely . The astute Red Cap selects , in their stead , Italians , Southern gentlemen , other negrocs , and drunks .

Now he simply sets a red lantern in the middle of the roadway , thus diverting the traffic .
