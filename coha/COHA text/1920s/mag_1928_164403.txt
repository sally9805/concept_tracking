To the tragedy of the 54 , Secretary of the Navy Wilbur last week composed a final chapter . It was a chapter more rueful than happy , but it brought balm to Rear Admiral Frank H. Brumby who , as commander of the Control Force and officer in charge of the rescue effort , was recommended for demotion by the Navy 's court of inquiry ( TIME , March 5 ) . <P> Secretary Wilbur had asked the Court to reconsider its verdict of " unfit " on Admiral Brumby . Given an opportunity to explain himself , Admiral Brumby redescribed his conduct and Secretary Wilbur found it entirely " commendable .

He admitted that submarines have to look out for surface vessels , insisting only that the latter should be careful . So there , apparently , rested the controversy between the Navy and the Treasury Department , in whose rum-chasing service the Paulding was functioning at the crash . And there , unless Congress or the President reopens the subject , ended the S-4 disaster-except as a legend in the Navy , a leaden memory in line of duty . <P> Last week the patched-up S-4 was floated again and towed from the drydock for internal repairs . Soon she will be in running order once more . She will be remanned . She will go to sea . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .
