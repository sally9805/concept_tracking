In view of a statement at Lausanne by Lord Curzon ( British Foreign Minister ) that he would call upon the League of Nations to take economic action against Turkey if war were threatened , it does not seem probable that Turkey would be willing to risk a clash . On the other hand , Turkey has some justification for thinking that Britain is merely playing a clever game ; for , while sticking fast to Mosul , she is using the League as a side door through which she can at any time make a graceful exit . Again the Turks may rely upon the strained relations existing between the Allies and the French determination to have peace at any price in the Near East . Thus they have good cause to believe that any threat emanating from the League would be unbacked . But it is much more likely that Turkey herself is as anxious for peace as anyone else , and that , relying upon a more conciliatory spirit from Britain , she will issue fresh peace proposals .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
