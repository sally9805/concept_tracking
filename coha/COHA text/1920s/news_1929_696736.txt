Bee ' rNfrittle espTcl ; i. tthe Richmond Hill High School . Mr. Berry announced that he had discovered a provision of the city charter which would permit the $5,000,000 to be paid out of the surplus in the street improvement fund instead of being assessed against the taxpayers of the entire borough of Queens . The assessment on the borough was ordered by the Board of Estimate and a taxpayer 's action to prevent this is pending . Walker Opens Queens Campaign . Mr. Berry spoke with Mayor Walker and Aldermanic President , his associates on the Democratic city ticket , and the meeting marked the opening of their campaign in Queens . Mayor Walker , who was received with enthusiasm , endorsed Edward W. Cox , Democratic candidate for Borough President , and the entire Democratic county ticket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any part of the cost of the construction of new subways by local assessment . The question of who should pay the $5,000,000 has been a matter of great interest in Queens and the Board of Estimate 's action in assessing it upon the borough has been criticized there . Mr. Berry started his speech by quoting a speech of an opponent , from THE NEW YORK TIMES . In this speech the city administration was charged with " stealing of upward of $5,000,000 from the small home owners of Queens County . " " Perhaps the meanest act any one can do is to go to some unfortunate persons who have suffered a loss of some money or other treasured possession and whisper to them that , ' if they had only not done so and so or if somebody else had done this or that , their loss would not have occurred , " Mr. Berry said . " Such tactics give no assistance , and I offer you instead the following constructive plan , which will relieve the taxpayers of Queens Borough of the burden which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jamaica sewers was over $16,500,000 ? exactly $15,672,304.28 and $1,037,766.46 interest charged on payments to contractors as work progressed . " The Board of Assessors stated that it had determined that about $5,000,000 , or $4.926,918.10 , was uncollectable by assessment on the property benefited . " This deficiency the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , acting under Section 247 of the charter , placed upon the Borough of Queens as a whole , to be collected with the taxes in five equal instalments . A taxpayer 's suit to prevent this is pending . have spent much time trying to find some method by which this money could be provided without resorting to the tax on the property owners of Queens and have made a close study of the charter , and also had our chief accountant keep me informed as to the condition of the street improvement fund , from which the costs of the Jamaica-Hollis sewer construction:were paid . Says Board Can Authorize Payment . " I find that under a section of the charter , added some years ago for this very purpose , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid from any existing surplus , if such there be , in the street improvement fund . " I state to you tonight that there is a large surplus in that fund , due to conservative management in the past four years . and the Board of Estimate and Apportionment may . by a proper resolution , authorize the Controller to pay this $5,000,000 from this fund and at the same time cancel and annul the resolution which is in litigation , and thus relieve the property owners in Queens of the tax burden which seemed inevitable . " Mr. Berry said he would introduce such a resolution at the meeting of the Board of Estimate 's Committee of the Whole next Monday for action at the regular meeting of the board next Thursday . The street improvement fund is a revolving fund maintained by the city to finance public improvements paid for by assessments , the assessments . when paid , being turned bees into the fund . The surplus is said to have been built up mostly by the difference between the rate of interest at which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent rate charged those upon whom assessments have been levied and have been late in their payments . In the earlier part of his speech . Mr. Berry defended the payments to contractors on the Jamaica sewer . and asserted that the Controller had no power to refuse to pay for a contract , legally awarded . He said he had been advised to make the payments by the investigators appointed by the Governor to investigate the Queens sewer graft charges : Supreme Court Justice Townsend Scudder . Emory N. Buckner and Clarence J. Shearn . He read a letter to that effect from Mr. Shearn . Mr. Berry said that Mayor Walker appointed a committee to determine what should be done to prevent a recurrence of the Queens sewer frauds , composed of representatives of the Bar Associations of the five city counties , the New York County Law- ! years ' Association and the Mayor 's Survey Committee . This committee , Mr. Berry added . recommended that : a bill be introduced in the Legislature providing that an public improvements costing $10,000 and more . be paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final estimated cost by 10 per cent the contract should not be awarded unless again authorized by the Board of Estimate . General Berry said that the bill was passed and such contracts were now subject to this provision . ? Walker Discusses Transit . In discussing the transit problem the Mayor said that he believed the routes in Queens and the question of whether the new lines should be elevated or underground should not be decided until after the people of Queens had an opportunity to express their wishes at public hearings . " If I am to continue as Mayor for the next four years . " Mr. Walker said . " the new and additional transit lines to be built in Queens will be built in the same way as in Manhattan , the Bronx and Brooklyn , by tha entire city and not by local assessment : That is common fairness .

Brunner , also an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Borough President , helped to signalize the recent harmony agreement among the Democratic factions . Mayor Walker emphasized the importance of the Triborough bridge and the midtown vehicular tunnel to Queens . He said that ground for the construction of the triboroue-h bridge would be broken in a week . He denied that either the bridge or the tunnel would be for high-priced limousines alone . " Nothing like it . " he said . " The triborough bridge and the Thirty-eighth Street tube will be constructed in the hope of developing the business growth of the Borough of Queens , in the hope that it will be more convenient and more agreeable for business to be transacted in this borough , for a greater number of factory sites and for the growth of every activity that has helped to make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the business has grown , as it is bound to if the necessary conveniences are brought to it . if it is not held back by the municipality itself , then to follow that with every possible effort to make it not only agreeable but very desirable for the people who work in this borough to live in comfort close to the work that they have to do in the daytime . Sees Higher Property Values . " If it is instrumental in developing the growth of business , making business bigger and better in this borough .. the result will be an enhancement in the value of the property of this borough , and as the property is enhanced in value so will the entiee city , all five boroughs , profit by it , end those perhaps who will never use the tube nor yet ever cross the Triborough bridge , if they be citizens and property holders of this city , every one of them will find not only a marked improvement in the city 's scope but will find some direct benefit and profit to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor invited the most rigid scrutiny of the record of his administration and promised to return and give further details of what it had done and what it ' proposed to do . " I salute the unanimous Democracy that . obtains in this county , " he said . " While some of us are of a racial . extraction that does not altogether like harmony , may we not hope that the Democrats of Queens will now take a rest for a while and leave the field of battle to our opponents ? Let them have the field to themselves for a little while . If they do n't know how ' to put up a real fight then we will come back and take it up . " Mr. in his speech promised an extensive public construction for Queens . During the last four years . he said , the cost of public improvements in Queens approximated $65. - 000,000 , exclusive of the expenditures for subway construction . He ineluded in these improvements forty new elementary schools , ten additions and seven new high schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 acres of park land and several new bridges . " This vnet program I readily realize . " continued Judge , " is but a slight portion of the ultimate needs of this borough . Set aside anywhere else from the city of New York , it would be a tremendous undertaking . It is probably more than some of the largest cities in this country undertake to spend in such a short period . This . because of the phenomenal growth that has overtaken this county . The members of the present administration have a thorough realization of this great growth . We pledge you that we shall not for a moment lose sight of your needs . " Just as nuickly as we can determine after public hearings what your desires are for rapid transit , the shovels will work and the dirt will fly and you will get subways as quickly as it is physically possible to build them " We shall soon break ground for the new tri-borough bridge .
