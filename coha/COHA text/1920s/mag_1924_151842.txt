Larger , lighter . It is conceivable that another change may be made in the weight and size of the golf ball . <P> A few years ago when the U. S. G. A. and the St. Andrews Club of Scotland standardized the so-called 1.62-1.62 ' ball , there was a good deal of agitation among amateurs as to just how important this standardization was . Questions of whether . a score of 119 played with a " maverick " ball beat a 125 played with a standard ball were raised and discussed-ofttimes heatedly . <P> Now the U. S. G. A. officials seem to be looking with favor on a 1.68-1.55 ball . That is , instead of the former diameter of 1.62 inches it will be 1.68 inches and instead of the former weight of 1.62 ounces it will be 1.55 . Thus the new ball is lighter and bigger and has less specific gravity-a specific gravity of 1.08 , to be exact . This amount is a trifle above the specific gravity of the old " floater " type of ball . <P> A tryout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week at the Morris County Golf Club , near Convent , N. J. Jess W. Sweetser , National Amateur Champion in 1923 , knocked out a 71 with the large , light ball-a new course record .
