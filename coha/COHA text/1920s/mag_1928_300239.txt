Bewildered patriots wondered whom to believe , last week , when Hungary 's two foremost Counts and statesmen made public and opposite answers to a vital question : " Is or is not the Archduke Otto of Habsburg now King of Hungary , since he has come of age ? " ( TIME , Nov. 26 . ) <P> " Otto is King ! " proclaimed Count Albert Apponyi , venerable and honored representative of Hungary before the League of Nations . As President of the Legitimist Party the Count issued this further statement : <P> " By immemorial right of the Habsburg Dynasty the eldest living male descendant of our late King Karl became King of Hungary when he Archduke Otto achieved the age of majority 16 . " <P> Exactly the opposite view was taken by Count Stephen Bethlen , dictator and Prime Minister of Hungary , who has repeatedly accredited Count Apponyi to the League . <P> Sternly warning the Legitimists to cease their activities , Count Bethlen declared : ' ' Let me say , once for all , that no plans for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are made they will be placed before the country in a proper manner . <P> " Although every citizen is free to hold his own views as to the identity of the future King , my Government will take legal steps under the Constitution to punish those responsible for agitation , if the movement in behalf of Otto or any other candidate continues . <P> " I am very reluctant to create martyrs . But I shall do it if this evil propaganda persists . It engenders international suspicion of Hungary . " <P> Since Count Bethlen himself recently intimated that a royal election might be expected soon , his remarks of last week probably meant that the Allied Powers have quietly but firmly informed the Prime Minister that he must deflate his original trial balloon . On Nov. 10 , 1921 the Hungarian Government was obliged to assure the Allied Conference of Ambassadors in Paris that no Habsburg would be placed on the Hungarian Throne . The nation , now a " Kingless Kingdom , " is technically free to elect anyone not a Habsburg to be King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legitimists , who hold that no election is necessary , charge that Count Bethlen is only biding his dictatorial time , waiting for a chance to have himself elected King . Meanwhile the Archduke Otto continues to rusticate in Spain .
