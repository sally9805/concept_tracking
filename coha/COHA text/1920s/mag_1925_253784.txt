So Big . The cinemedition of Novelist Edna Ferbeer 's recent opus suggests four things : that no amount of grease paint will make Colleen Moore look very much older than , say , 30 ; that Ben Lyon and Phyllis Haver are both of the genus stuffed shirt and may as well resign themselves to that fate ; that Wallace Beery can play a stolid soil-tiller to the last grunt ; that Director Charles Brabin bent carefully over his knitting of deft acting into homely , racy atmosphere , until the final quarter of this film ; then Director Brabin dropped the needles and cried : " Paste up the rest ! " <P> The story goes : Selina Peake , sprite of poverty , married Pervus De Jong , Illinois potato man . No amount of grubbing could deaden Selina . After years of it , she could still stick radishes behind her ear and dance for Dirk , her boy , only " so big . " Dirk grew up and trailed off into a dull love-jam involving a nice girl and a naughtyish one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her potatoes on Prairie Avenue , Chicago . <P> <P> The Wife of the Centaur . A centaur was half a man , half a beast . Author Cyril Hume knew that when he named his book . The producers forgot it when they cast sleek John Gilbert for exuberant Jeffrey Dwyer , taut poet , who loved one girl ( Aileen Pringle ) and married another ( Eleanor Boardman ) . The producers also overlooked the fact that the one girl , who had later to cope with an idiot husband , furnished well over a third of the tale 's power . Cheers for this film , if any , should be dedicated to Miss Boardman , the one able performer . <P> <P> East of Suez . Pola Negri has a new coif , and no becoming one at that . Much less inflaming than usual , she writhes her way through W. Somerset Maugham 's play about a Eurasienne , who was shanghaied , in the city of that name , by a yellow gentleman with enormous talons and discomfiting eyes . Before that she had planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterwards she married her rescuer ( Rockcliffe Fellows ) . There are sentiment , sobs , horror , passiont close-ups-far east of Suez ; too far . <P> <P> The Narrow Street . Quiet , light comedy . Matt Moore , as a muddler , is unmuddled by Dorothy Devore , waif . Conventional but commendable.
