Carnegie Cup . Gleefully tugging against the elastic water of Lake Cayuga last week , Yale 's crew beat Cornell in the Carnegie Cup race-the first Cornell defeat of the season . Throughout the race it rained . Princeton , also competing , finished last . Where other crews use a long stroke , Princeton crews use a short , choppy stroke which Coach Chuck Logg learned at the University of Washington . Last week , Coach Chuck said he would not yet chuck his system . <P> Penn . v. Navy . Pennsylvania , which had won no prior races , beat the Navy last week at Annapolis by two feet . Harvard rowed too . <P> Again Columbia . Richard Glendon Jr . is the only eastern coach who can boast that he has lost no races . Last week his Columbia crews defeated M. I. T. For once , the dirty Harlem River was clear of debris . Columbia 's freshman coach is Hugh Glendon , brother of Richard . Hugh , too , has lost no races .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
