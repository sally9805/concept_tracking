Great among steel companies is United States Steel . Great among steel companies is also Bethlehem Steel . Last week these two companies went to war . Bethlehem Steel alleged that U. S. Steel is violating certain of its patents , has been violating these patents for six years . It asks that U. S. Steel be enjoined from further patent-violation , that it pay damages to Bethlehem Steel . <P> The disputed patents , of which Bethlehem claims to be sole licensee , cover the construction of what is known as the Gray beam . In 1904 , one Henry Gray took out patents on this beam , which is rolled from one piece of steel instead of being made from several pieces riveted together . In 1926 , U. S. Steel began the construction of a plant in Homestead , Pa. , for the making of beams similar to the Gray beams . Thereupon Eugene Gifford Grace , Bethlehem president , announced that the Gray patents were still in force and that the making of Gray beams by a Bethlehem competitor constituted a patent infringement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now called upon to settle . <P> The Gray patents are valued at $250,000,000 . If the Bethlehem company wins its suit , U. S. Steel , besides being prevented from making further Gray beams , may have to pay damages equal to three times the value of such beams as it has made in violation of the patents . No estimate of these damages has been forthcoming . <P> Eugene Gifford Grace , President of Bethlehem , has been somewhat overshadowed in popular estimation by Charles M. Schwab , head of Bethlehem directors . <P> Employed in a subordinate capacity at Bethlehem Steel when Mr. Schwab assumed the management of that company in 1904 , Mr. Grace was chosen by Mr. Schwab as one of the " Company of Fifteen " - a- select group of those Bethlehem employees whom Mr. Schwab considered most able . By 1915 Mr. Grace had acquired something over a million dollars in salary and bonuses . Belonging emphatically to the class of those who have dressed well and succeeded , Mr. Grace has frequently lamented Mr. Schwab 's informality in attire . When Mr. Schwab made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel Institute ( October 28 , 1927 ) the following dialogue took place : <P> Grace : The presidency of the Institute has done you a lot of good . <P> Schwab : What do you mean ? <P> Grace : For the first time in my life I have seen you in a decent suit of clothes .
