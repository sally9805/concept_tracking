 | AS A fortunate and aspiring grandmother , I am hopeful that the doors of the law schools of Harvard and Columbia may be open to all grandchildren , girls and boys alike , when mine are ready to enter , and later on perhaps even the portals of the Supreme Court of the United States . Meanwhile , I write as a lawyer admitted in 1894 from Northwestern University to practise before the Supreme Court of Illinois . My bachelor 's thesis , a dozen years earlier at Cornell University , had dealt with " The Law and the Child . " After that there had followed two winters under the Faculty of Law at Zurich , in Switzerland . But a degree had never seemed important . Suddenly , however , admission to active practise became an urgent necessity , for in 1893 , as Chief Factory Inspector of the State of Illinois , I was faced by the baffling fact that prosecutions , started as a part of the official routine for enforcing obedience to the Illinois eight-hour law , applying to women and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more self-enforcing than a federal amendment . These personal items are mentioned because , being related to the legal profession through my father ( who was in By Florence Kelley Congress nearly thirty years continuously , beginning when I was not yet two years old ) and by an uncle and a son ; and having tried child labor cases in the old-time Chicago " justice shops , " I have acquired an attitude of sustained inquiry about methods . of improving the law . This experience may , perhaps , be taken as symbolic also of the organizations which have , since its earliest draft was made public , steadily opposed a proposed blanket equality amendment to the Constitution . They are not newcomers in the field of activity in behalf of women . Many aspects of equality they desire , and have long been , and are now working for . But wisdom born of experience teaches all alike the lesson of caution . Slow and wearisome though the process may be , it is better to keep what has been won , and go steadily on getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamble upon the chance of hoped-for quick winnings , and then lose . In this case the losses might be grievous indeed . Let us consider some gains which are too precious to be hazarded ? among them , equa ' guardianship , widows ' pensions , and the maternity and infancy law . Widows ' pensions are the growth of somewhat more than a quarter-century , having appeared at about the same time as juvenile courts and spread as these have done . A recent practical example illustrates their value . A young husband was a skilled electrician and a careful father who had insured his life when he married . His wife was an excellent housekeeper and by nature a judicious mother . But she had no money-earning skill , having been the youngest of a large family and kept at home to care for her aged mother by its older members , now all married , with other claims upon them , except an older sister . When quick pneumonia carried off the father , leaving twins two months old , the insurance lasted three months . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been large , because she had shared with her two beloved dependents her forty dollars a week which , in New York City , had required very careful spending . Not until the insurance was gone and the savings were melting away , did any one suggest that New York City , under the widows ' pensions law , pays out over three million dollars a year to keep children in the care of their widowed mothers . The good health of ( Continued on page 162 ) 19  | the young widow and her twins , her visible competence and devotion to her babies and her tiny flat , made the granting of the statutory allowance through the Bureau of Child Welfare relatively quick and easy . This is the experience of one widowed mother typical among tens of thousands . Widows ' pensions are a discrimination established in almost all the states , in favor of women . This is the form of aid to widowed mothers which the state can most fitly supply . Without it the mother of the twins must have attempted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and they must have been weaned , though breast feeding is A of the alphabet of baby saving ; and second , because the earnings of an unskilled wage-earning woman afford no margin for paying a substitute in the home . This example occurring in New York City is cited , because it is within my own acquaintance and the details are known ; and also because New York is the city where the financial outlay is greatest to meet the need of the vast , polyglot , congested population . All good citizens who regard the home as the foundation of this Republic are logically committed to widows ' pensions . Before they were established , the alternative to overwork and , too often , broken health for the mother accompanied by insufficient care for the children , was the surrender of the children to strangers , even though their mother was loving and skilful and their home a model . A quarter-century of vigorous organized effort underlies the almost nation-wide spread of this eminently modern , humane , and enlightened provision for the care of those who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mother and her little ones deprived by death of their breadwinner . Under the proposed amendment would the community pay widowers ' pensions ? Or would widowed mothers be deprived of theirs ? If not , what becomes of equal rights ? But if widows ' pensions were abolished , provision would then have to be made by law ( under . some other name , perhaps ) for at least one hundred thousand children . And while the new and less desirable statutes were being sought in the various states , unmeasured harm for the children would be inevitable . I monly attributed to the will of God . So wideThe Sheppard-Towner Law Until Jeannette Rankin , in August , 1918 , introduced in Congress her bill for the Hygiene and Welfare of Maternity and Infancy , the re It mass of grieving mothers accepted with hat resignation they could command the : oaths of their little ones , which they com- - dread , intensive , and enlightening was the campaign for this bill that , in the brief space of five years since Miss Rankin forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , under the above title , been accepted by forty states , and death-rates of infants have fallen beyond the hopes of her followers and of the Children 's Bureau , which has been administering the law since it took effect in March , 1922 . The Sheppard-Towner law applies explicitly to mothers and babies . In some places the maternal death-rate , which had been slowly rising throughout several years , is stationary . In others it has begun to fall slightly . There is , however , no possible assurance that this beneficent measure could survive the passage of the proposed equal rights amendment . Talk of its being safe from annulment because it applies solely to children is folly while mothers are expressly included in it . Moreover , the two federal child labor laws have found no charmed life by reason of applying to children ! Let us expose this safeguard  | of the home to no risks . It discriminates indisputably in favor of women . About half a century ago , Miss Susan B. Anthony , the early and constant advocate of the suffrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York State , whose Chinese husband had , before his death , secretly made a will bequeathing their unborn child to his brother , to be taken to China . When the uncle appeared , the horror-stricken mother found , through Miss Anthony 's exertions , exceedingly influential friends to help her in asserting her claim to the guardianship of her child . Born on American soil , it was an American citizen . Experience proved , however , that the mother had a merely human claim . The legal right was the uncle 's , and he carried his new-born nephew off to China . The mother 's plight was doubly hopeless , because her marriage to a Chinese alien made her also an alien . The Guardianship Problem Miss Anthony 's active struggle , first with the courts and later with the legislature in New York State many years before women had votes , began ( so far as I have ever been able to learn ) the universal movement for the equal guardianship of parents over their children . A second appalling , secret willing-away of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in Colorado many years later . The father becoming ill of quick tuberculosis , the family went to Colorado for his benefit , and the expectant mother , who was by trade a dressmaker , supported both until his death . Immediately following the birth of the child its paternal grandfather , whom the mother had never seen , appeared and successfully claimed his grandchild under its father 's will , taking it to his home in a distant state . The guardianship problem is not yet satisfactorily solved in all the states . In a few the statutes are not even yet modernized . So vast , however , is the progress in the direction of justice and mercy , in this extremely important field , since Miss Anthony first aroused public sentiment , that there is every encouragement for continuing to apply her method . Before we had votes , progress halted or was slow wherever there was no unique spectacular evil result crying aloud for the equal guardianship of the mother . Since the enfranchisement of women no sin of omission can burden the consciences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every state where it is still needed . The speediest method possible is recourse to the legislatures . To await a federal amendment would be cruel folly . A good illustration of this cheerful fact is Virginia , whose legislature passed , in 1922 , seventeen of twenty-eight bills introduced chiefly for improving the lot of children . It is confidently expected by the cooperating organizations of men and women who achieved this beneficent success , that the remaining eleven measures will be adopted during the present year . This procedure commends itself to men and women of experience in the field of legislation for several reasons , of which two are especially obvious . The first is that modifications in state laws can be made with relative ease when needed as social conditions change . But an amendment can hardly be repealed . It can be changed only by the long , slow process of judicial interpretation . The other is that statutes can be obtained without the delays which attend every federal amendment , even one on a subject so popular , for instance , as child labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision of the United States Supreme Court in the child labor cases , and no joint resolution for a federal amendment has yet been referred to the states for ratification . Living with Miss Jane Addams , at Hull House , seven of its early years , inspecting during four of them , with my assistant and deputies , the labor of women , girls and children in the Chicago stockyards and sweatshops of @#  | thirty years ago , seeing the interminable hours worked in the rural fruit and vegetable canneries , and the night work in glassworks in the smaller manufacturing cities , I must have been dull , indeed , of mind and heart , if I had failed to appreciate the cruel suffering among those quickly increasing tens of thousands of workers . It was in 1893 that Illinois took her first long step forward by establishing for them the eight-hour day in manufacture . Short-lived that Illinois benefaction was , before the law was held unconstitutional ? erroneously as the Supreme Court of the United States later showed in its famous Oregon decision . Yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example set , of which the whole country was recently reminded afresh by Judge Florence Allen 's opinion when the Ohio Supreme Court upheld Ohio 's law limiting to 5o hours a week the wage-earning labor of women . Nowhere in 1893 was there an effective industrial code such as every modern civilized land is compelled to establish , in order to keep down the incessant changing among its women workers , for efficiency if for no nobler reason . Night work during part of the year , for all engaged in manufacture , was the rule in seasonal occupations . Heart-breaking stories were brought to Hull House by terrified mothers , of the experiences of young women in their families on the way home in the cold dark of the winter mornings after working to the point of exhaustion in hot rooms at speeded machines all night . Food and warmth they must have before starting upon the long , dark walk or longer horse-car ride to their homes . At 6 A.M. throughout a winter that lasted from November to midApril on the shore of Lake Michigan , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they emerged from the night shift were to be found only in the omni-present saloons , with all that that implied thirty years ago . Clearly no sentimental folly animated the Settlements throughout the industrial states when one after another enlisted in behalf of the eight-hour day and night-work laws for women and girls . Hard Work and Delayed Results The struggle for every gain in statutes and judicial decisions for women and girls in industry has been hard fought and costly in money , time , and effort . It was in the light of twentieth-century decisions of the United States Supreme Court that New York 's court of last resort reversed in 1914 , its own adverse decision of 1907 , thus permanently establishing a night-work law for women in the greatest of all the industrial states . In New Jersey , after many years of persistent effort , women obtained , in 1923 , a night-work law so amended at the last moment as to take effect at New Year 's , 1925 . The delay was explained by legislators as intended to enable mill owners to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlarged day shifts . Rhode Island is due for successful action in 1924 . In New York , organized working men help pass whatever bills women in industry endorse . There , since 1886 , men and women wage-earners have pursued increasingly the policy of cooperation in promoting labor laws . They have , for instance , procured statutes concerning fire , cleanliness , lighting , ventilation , and one day 's rest in seven , which apply alike to men , women , and children . They have obtained measures exclusively for men , safeguarding those ( commonly known as sand-hogs ) who work in tunnels under rivers and harbors , and bills applying to men in the train service of railroads , and on scaffolds in the building trades . Florida last year prohibited the leasing of men prisoners to labor in lumber camps . @#  | Miners in many states have the statutory eight-hour day , having changed their state constitutions to get it . Women obviously do not work in mines and tunnels or on scaffolds . They form no part of train crews under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most insistent demands have been for seats , for more adequate wages , and short , firmly-regulated working hours . This cooperative effort to meet the essential needs of the different groups in industry we consider admirable statesmanship . Whenever union men feel no need of laws , well and good . No one wishes to interfere with them any more than professional women are interfered with today by labor legislation . On this subject we are immovable . If there were no other reasons for opposing the proposed amendment , we should concentrate all our efforts upon this . Even before we had votes , women in general chose to get their shorter day by law , and men by negotiation backed , when necessary , by strikes . Both are legal . Under the proposed amendment , women could change their hours and other working conditions by law only when men were ready and willing to make the same changes for themselves . This would be a new subjection of wage-earning women to wage-earning men , and to that subjection we are opposed on principle and in practise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience there is no record of a quick , sure remedy for an injustice involving fundamental social relations . It becomes daily clearer that much injustice to women is attributable to the general absence from the courts of competent , thoroughly-trained women judges . This situation is obviously not remediable by amending the federal constitution . It requires systematic effort in a different field of activity . The trouble lies oftener in judicial misinterpretation of laws , federal and state , than in the measures themselves . And this is curable by the voters wherever the judiciary is elective . We can not eat our cake and have it , too . We can not subject ourselves , by a constitutional amendment , to compulsory equality with men forevermore , yet keep our most needed special laws , for lack of which , throughout the long terrible past , women and children have suffered and died . In this kaleidoscopic world , we are confronted by the perpetual necessity of making choices . The ballot is our most recently acquired instrument of choice and change . With it statutes can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group in the community , as each need is clearly recognized . Let Us Make Haste Slowly If , moreover , the proposed amendment were desirable , its enactment in the near future would be premature . The Eighteenth Amendment is not yet four years old . The uses of the ballot , which it conferred upon women , have not begun to be tested . The first President is yet to be elected , in choosing whom women will vote in all the states . In many states the election laws were not harmonized with the Suffrage Amendment quickly enough for women to vote in the state elections of 1920 . The legislature of Alabama is quadrennial . The new voters have had but one opportunity to share in electing it . Women voters in Alabama State affairs are new voters indeed . We demand ample opportunity for trying out the possibilities of the ballot in the hands of all the citizens of the whole voting constituency of men and women , before limits are placed upon the freest conceivable use of it . We stand firmly upon the inalienable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recommendation in his first address to Congress , of a federal minimum wage law for women in the District of Columbia modeled upon the Massachusetts statute with which he had long been familiar , gives substantial support to this position .
