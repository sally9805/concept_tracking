THIS PARTICULAR week must take preference over all others of the year for the number of proud boasts issued by the Prohibition authorities . No liquor , say the brave watchdogs of our morals , will be allowed to land ; Christmas will be dry . Unfortunately , however , these early December weeks are also acknowledged to be unequaled as weeks for landing liquor ; unfortunately , everybodys knows that Christmas will he just as wet as usual . Thus once more the brave Prohibition authorities assume , to some degree , the aspect of men making fools of themselves . MR . J. STANLEY JOYCE and a new bride have sailed for Europe , if the papers ( and a publicity sheet got out by the Cunard Line ) can he believed . The world acclaims Mr. Joyce as a Chicagoan , a millionaire , and a lumberman , but in our opinion these three magnificent qualities pale beside his real achievement . He is the husband of Miss Peggy Joyce whose name she has kept . No other husband of hers has ever won this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who consider hazing childish , youths from Columbia have appeared on busses with their faces blacked , and in front of the library standing on their heads . The phe nornenon indicates that they have begun " rushing " for the fraternities on One Hundred and Sixteenth Street . Not being a serious thinker , we enjoy the harmless antics , which prove to us what we have always known  --  that college boys are not grown up . WE HAVE known for some time that credit is not being given where credit is due in this country , and we have determined to put a stop to it . We refer to Tunney 's arrest for hexing on the vaudeville stage without a boxing license . The credit for this brave arrest which put the champion 's mme in the headlines should go to whoever manages his or the theatre 's pt THE MUCH-yodeled-about Ses-quicentennial Exposition in the City of Brotherly Love has come to an official close with the announcement that it lost , in all , five million dollars . We wish no particular exposition hard leek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five million , this was a good one to do it . It was conceived and executed first and last with noisy cheapness . The plan seemed to be to make publicity do for quality . From the wreckage may be plucked the cheerful thought that even in 1926 man can not live by bread alone  --  that publicity , Shriners , Mother 's Day , visiting Mayors , and more publicity sometimes fall short of being an infallible formula for success . OFFICIALLY there is no soft coal being burned in New York ; in other words it is against the law . We wish to echo the words of Dr. Louis Harris , the Health Commis-sinner , who announces that complaints against buildings , if telephoned to Worth 9400 , will receive instant action . If you are too modest to complain directly , write us and we will forward your righteous indignation to Dr. Harris . A good building to begin on , by the way , would be one that is now belching smoke on Forty-fifth Street at Sixth Avenue . New Phones NEARLY always attempts made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resulted in the presentation of misinformation , but we will essay to report another change for the purpose of dispelling the apparent mystery which has surrounded the appearance of European-style telephone instruments in some of the better offices and homes . One source of these instruments is a company headed by a Ger ( (  - -  -  , r ) 14 " - ? . ) ; 1 man nobleman named Frenz , who has his office in the Postal Telegraph Building , but who for some reason is secretive and does not allow his name to appear either on the directory of the building or in the telephone book . Other manufacturers are not so reticent . One , Mr. L. J. Loeffler , can be located in the telephone Red Book ; another , Le Continental Telephone Company , advertises from South Orange ; there arc undoubtedly more . At any rate they all sell these telephones ( nickel-plated $25 to $30 , bronze , $30 to $35 , gold-plated $35 to $100 , platinum not offered yet ) , which , until quite lately , were seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talk that at least one firm is a subsidiary of the telephone company , and contradicting talk to the effect that the latter does n't approve of the instruments ; although , disavowing responsibility for their satisfactory operation , it will install them upon demand . ( It seems that the American-style phone is on a three-wire system , while the European phones require eight wires . ) ALL this , however , is not so impor- tant as the report that the Telephone Company itself is perfecting a convenient European-style instrument which it will substitute for all the present telephones in New York  --  the present unwieldy contrivances to be shipped to the provinces . When the new device comes into service it will be the custom to wire houses especially for their use , with base-plugs at convenient places .

Joseph Urban THE NEWSPAPER report that Joseph Urban was sailing for Europe recently proved to be greatly exaggerated . His destination was Palm Beach , not Europe . Among others who were amused at the sailing rumor was the affable Mr. Urban who would welcome a six-day enforced rest as much as any one we know . We caught Mr. Urban at 7:15 o'clock one evening , for a six-o'clock appointment at his studio in the old Metropolitan movie building at 126th Street and Second Avenue . His secretary affably explained that Mr. Urban would be on time as he was on his way from the dress rehearsal of " Turandot " at the Metropolitan and was only one hour behind his daily schedule . Mr. Urban claims a liking for that kind of life . Of late he has been trying to wean the public away front the idea of Urban the designer of gorgeous stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of architect . The old love holds him by a few ties , and every season he reminds New York what he can do by an opera set or the worthwhile part of Mr. Ziegfeld 's glorification process ; but it will be as an architect undoubtedly that this country will hand the bays and laurels to the gentleman from Vienna . New Yorkers will have first visual " 1 believe that was about as good music as I ever heard  --  in an opera . " earnest of his work in the new Ziegfeld Theatre , which by its mere two stories , already dominates Sixth Avenue near Fifty-fourth Street , and which boasts an auditorium shaped like an egg , with the largest oil painting in the world for the ceiling . DEVOTEES of Palm Beach are already familiar with the Urban note in architecture . He has just completed a new kind of movie theatre and a country club or two in that resort . Just now he is rushing gangs of workmen to complete a home for E. F. Hutton , said to have cost $2,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eve . The home is unlike anything in this coon-try : a circular patio connects any number of separate dwellings , these units to be occupied by various branches of the Hutton family . A lagoon , we understand , will run from the great dining-room out to the sea . Hints of the decorative motifs , with everything carved or painted , leads one to expect a home that can hardly be described by the vocabulary of a democracy . IF YOU are not one of those who know every first-nighter , we will identify Mr. Urban for you as an urbane gentleman who might well play the innkeeper in any operetta . He has that distinction that goes with foreign men , and only a few of the gestures . He has no hobbies that any one can find our about . Once in a while he likes to go to a prize fight . He tried baseball and could n't make head or tail of it . He has one great amhi- " W ell , of course , it was n't anything like this in Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he wo n't talk about that . In the meantime he hopes to work toward an American architecture that will not be too enslaved by the classic , and that will not he influenced by the bond houses . All of this gets him up at seven o'clock . After a simple breakfast he goes to the Urban studio at Yonkers , where some fifty men guard the secret bin that holds the Urban sky paint . Then he drops down to 126th Street for architecture , opera rehearsals and so nn . He ends his day at two A.M. Abundance H OVV DO the very great keep track of everything  --  their offices , their residences ( southern and northern ) , their clubs ? One often wonders . ' Well , the answer is , they do n't  --  not always . To prove it , this anecdote , involving none other than Mr. George F. Baker , Sr. : ALONG Island golf club , an ex- elusive Long Island golf club , is concerned . Mr. Baker was not a member , but last summer , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Friday . His son , George F. Baker , Jr. , was a member and , of course , the octogenarian banker is one of the most privileged characters in the country . Finally , however , some of the officials decided that something would have to be done about it , and one unfortunate committee member was delegated to take action . So on Friday , as Mr. Baker set out , the committeeman followed , teeth set , to do his duty . At the sixth tee he had so far gathered his courage as to bring the conversation to golf . At the eighth he daringly led it to golf clubs . Through this opening he sent the timid query : " And you 're a member of the Stream , I suppose , Mr. Baker ? " He waited nervously for the answer . Mr. Baker was concentrating on the ball . " Oh , undoubtedly , " he responded genially , and drove off . Anti there , so we hear , the matter rested . Gracious AS CHRISTMAS approaches , care of the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion that few New Yorkers have ever heard of the oldest , the strangest , and the most interesting dole in America  --  the bread dole at St. Luke 's Church , on Hudson Street . Here , every Saturday morning , there assembles in the parish house at 487 Hudson Street , a little company of poor children , gathered for the distribution of loaves . The number varies , we are told , but generally there are about six . They sit on the wooden bench , waiting patiently for the entrance of the woman parish visitor who each week gives out the bread . Every child gets from four to six white loaves , according to the size of his family . The rest of the bread is taken by the parish visitor and is personally distributed among poor families of the neighborhood . This " dole " has existed for a hundred and thirty-four years . ( There are many in England and very few in this country . ) It was established in 1792 by John Leake , a wealthy New York philanthropist , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asylum , now near Yonkers . When Leake died he left a fund of a thousand pounds " put out at interest , to be laid out in the annual income in sixpenny wheaten loaves of bread and distributed to such poor as shall appear most deserving . " At first the dole was made at Trinity Church , then at St. John 's Chapel ( now demolished ) in Varick Street , and now , for about ten years , at St. Luke 's . A quaint superstition has grown up about this bread . It is believed to be blessed and never to become stale , no matter how long it is kept . Solution SPECULATION in these columns lately as to the origin of the statue of a soldier which stands in the middle of the Bronx river near 211th Street has brought a letter from Mr. George H. Hill , who avows that the figure is not of a civil war man at all but of a soldier of the Revolution . During the fighting around New York , he says , a newly appointed commander-in-chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messenger to the admiral of the British fleet instructing him to proceed up the Bronx river and attack New York from the north . Americans intercepted the messenger and , after reading the orders , set up a wooden effigy in the river , a lonely sentinel ever on guard in the northern waterway . The wooden figure was later replaced by the present one ; and there it stands today . Author MONSIEUR EDOUARD BOLTRDET , on a world tour of the cities where " La Prisonniere " is being played , is now in New York after seeing the drama well received in Paris and Vienna , while royalties roll in from several other continental cities . The playwright ( French a n d famous , though not yet forty ) , looks little like a Frenchman  --  or like a playwright , for that matter . Rather , he suggests the banker he was from 1909 to the moment his first play was bought , or the memher of the Forty-eighth Battalion of Foot Chasseurs which he was during the no-longerlate Great War . He arrived on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing " the city ever since . He has been a constant theatre-goer , but also has been seen as far south as the aquarium . Bourdet suggests a large white whale himself , a big man , over six feet tall , with a prominent nose , and tending toward baldness . Only a slight accent proclaims that he is not English . He has been rehearsing Miss Men-ken is a slight change at the end of the play , but all in all he is much pleased with the American presentation and admits that he is beginning to be a little homesick for his little house on the road to Toulon , in central France , where he has written most of his plays and where he lives a greater part of the time . Toy Department EXCEPEXCEPT for realism , didacticism , T and hygiene , toys are much the same as when we were personally concerned with them , long years ago . Realism has certainly hit them . Stuffed dogs now are replicas of kennel breeds . Ocean liners today have three stacks and twin screws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc electrically driven and where you can buy your child an automobile for three hundred dollars if you want to ) . Electric railway lines , equipped in our day only with curious rococo tunnels and unimpressive stations , now have complete block signal systems and bells that ring at grade crossings . Next year , it is promised , even the grade crossings will be eliminated . WE RAN across hygiene in Lord &; Taylor 's , where stuffed ani-mals made in Great Britain were plain-ly labelled " sanitary . " And the didac-tical tendencies came to light when a saleslady in Macy 's asked us if our lit-tle boy at home ( we have n't got one ) would n't like the electrical questionnaire , which answered questionssuch as , " Who was the hero of San Juan Hill ? " You just plug in , like a switchboard , opposite the question , and the other terminal will buzz when you make contact with the right aniwer . It had the ugly sting of education . WE REPORT unhesitatingly that the toy departments are a place to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pert faces of the dolls and cats peering at you as you pass , the patience of the choo-choo salesman explaining the third rail to mamma , the comity of nations so deftly intimated by the bright rows of tin American doughboys ( made in Germany ) and tin continental rebels ( made in England ) , even the worn and perspiring Santa and his interminable line of kids , many of whom get a real honest thrill out of his handshake ! The forces of construction and destruction are still pretty evenly balanced  --  pop guns , swords , water pistols , and buzz saws pitted against Erector and Meccano . If you want to escape realism , however , and see toys that will make you laugh , go to the Branch Library at 1,000 St. Nicholas Avenue ( 160th Street ) and inspect Jay Chambers ' collection of wooden toys , a comical group of grotesque little animals and figures . Mr. Chambers , a child of fifty , discovers them in obscure shops in the unspeakable outskirts of the town  --  gay clowning toys , absurd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some are crude , but all are merry toys that truly belong in the make-believe world that children , we insist , still inhabit in spite of what their parents buy them for Christmas . Scion THE RECENT newspaper advertisements of the Saturday Evening Post announcing writings by Cornelius Vanderbilt , Jr. , are but the first intimation , we are told , of the appearance of a series of articles which , as things go nowadays , should be mildly sensational . While the articles are in the main generalizations upon the usual plight of the heir to wealth ( " It is Hard to be a Rich Man 's Son " is one title ) this scion of a famous family is said to express some bold personal opinions  --  to avow , for instance , that he is the first of all the Vanderbilts since the original Comino " MOTHS W INTO A MEMBER Of PIE UNION LEAGUE CLUB ANGRAVED BY NONE OTHER THAN JOHN HELD JR dare who ever even tried to make any money before forty , and that he is proud of his recent effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is interesting that Mr. Vanderbilt has declared he is determined to continue his journalistic career . At present he is living in a two-room apartment on Fifth Avenue , but a short distance from his parents ' and his grandmother 's mansions and he is earning his living by his writings . The Fifth Avenue address , it is understood , he regards as essential for the out-of-town newspapers to which he conti S. It is interesting also to recall that one of the Vanderbilts who ( after the age of forty , apparently ) did succeed in making money is his father . Cornelius Vanderbilt , Sr. , is said to have received to date eleven million dollars from the railroad inventions which he perfected , and which are used on both hemispheres today . Discretion ACOURIER reports an untoward incident in the art and social life of our neighboring city , Philadelphia , which recently planned to honor John Carroll , an erstwhile academy student , who had gone into the wicked world . An exhibition of Mr. Carroll 's paintings was arranged . Subsequently he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THIS was a canvas showing a nude lady . Mr. Carroll wired the committee that his show was to be all or none . After much fluttering , a compromise was effected along lines suggested by the committee . It seems that the exhibit was to open with a tea , and one of the guests was to be a Philadelphia bishop . The compromise proposed and later followed was that the nude he hidden until the tea was over and the bishop departed . Accordingly , as soon as the black hat had been taken from the hall rack , lovers of art rushed to the closet and brought forth Mr. Car-roll 's naughty idyl . The Grind COMINCOMING IN Like a lion last Sun-G in company with the blizzard , the forty-first six-day bike race got away to a fine start amid the usual howls of joy from the gallery and is now within a day or so of going out like a lion . There is nothing mild about a six-day race . A good many of the old , familiar , and fan-loved faces are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby Walthour , to the ladies ' dismay , is absent . The romanticists to the contrary notwithstanding , ladies in evening dress do not yet strike the note at this function  --  the howling gallery under the roof owns the six-day race ; but it is a fact that Harlem is losing some fashionable parties these days and that some of those who like a little shimming in the evening drop in to see the race . AS REGARDS the spectacle now in progress it can truthfully be said that the score boards are not a bit better than they were last year , and that is saying a good deal . No one but a confirmed fan can make head or tail oi ; them ; they are not kept up to date , and are altogether the worst score boards imaginable . It is rather sloppy not to give us better ones . The hot dogs are good and the No Smoking sign has been done away with and perhaps it is not fair to complain .
