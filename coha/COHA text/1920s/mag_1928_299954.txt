Tonic to voters who have gone often to the polls , sedative to voters who have never gone before , is a book , published last week , by Frank Richardson Kent , eminently readable political pundit of the Baltimore Sun. * <P> Mr. Kent 's daily column , " The Great Game of Politics , " is a sort of scorecard by which to tell the players . Political Behavior is a rulebook telling , for the benefit of a people whose political illusions are many , the rules by which the Great Game is played on a national scale . <P> Mr. Kent has been so enthusiastic , or so hurried , that he has by no means compiled the fully-detailed lexicon that he might have made , considering his powers and experience . He is repetitious . But he is trenchant , illuminating , entertaining . Items from the actual , continual , successful life and credo of the experienced national officeholder : <P> Politics is a concrete profession , practiced for livelihood by men who , for the most part , train themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is virtually no such thing as a " political genius , " in the sense of a crafty wight who calculates moves of extreme subtlety and adroitness far ahead . <P> The Art of Seeming to Say Something Without Doing So must be practiced , no matter how it bores or shames you . Candid candidates lose . It is folly to discuss live issues unless forced to do so . <P> Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill " ) Thompson of Chicago is a supreme example of the importance of not being earnest , of " giving a good show . " ( In this connection , Mr. Kent makes the astonishing statement that President Coolidge has " a profound distaste " for fishing . ) <P> " Corruption is not a party liability " - if you can ignore your accusers long enough , or play martyr . <P> " You ca n't win on a shoe-string . " The decisive vote is the " floating " vote which can be polled only by distributing , or allowing to be distributed , money for the precinct organizers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is paid to venal " runners " or " workers " on Election Day to fetch their relatives to vote . Estimating that there are 150,000 precincts in the U. S. , each averaging 400 voters of whom perhaps two-thirds vote , Mr. Kent reckons that that party wins which has the money to employ ten " runners " per precinct at $5 or $10 for the day . Each " runner " fetches about ten votes , or 100 per precinct . The cost between 7 and 15 million dollars for all 150,000 precincts , is recorded locally as " current expenses " or is never recorded at all . <P> " When they stop writing about you you 're licked . " U. S. pundits , star-reporters , reporters , news-rewriters seldom realize this fact . <P> Politicians hand out humbug to the voters-but so does lawyer to jury , doctor to patient , actor to audience , salesman to customer , parson to parish . The politician 's condition is that , though human and with himself to care for , he is also the public 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " It is a tribute to public life , " says Mr. Kent , than whom no pundit is more alert and merciless in exposing public villains , " that governmental graft is bigger news than any other kind .
