txt The bill I Which Senator Borah introduced last week for returning to German nationals private property belonging to them which the United States seized during the World War brought a development today indicating on its face that this Government , on account of possibly producing an embarrassing situation in the relations between the United States and its late allies and associates , might abandon its traditional policy of returning such seized private property to its former enemy owners . This development came from statements at the White House that are divergent from the understanding of the position which the State Department has consistently assumed . What was said at the White House created the impression that President Coolidge was inclined to the opinion that the return of seized German private property to Ha owners might cause other nations which are creditors ? of Germany to demand that they have a voice in its distribution . This suggested that the United States might be contemplating the retention of seized enemy property in order to give no warrant to the victorious European Allies not only to demand that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dawes reparation payment pool , but to object that the claims of the United States against Germany be met out of German funds which the Allies intend to apply to the liquidation of their own claim against the German Government . No Mature Conclusion Reached . While the viewpoint of the White House appears , from what was said today , to be along this line and to indicate that consideration was being given to abandoning the traditional policy of returning seized private property to former enemy owners , it is fair to say that the White House spokesman clearly indicated that President Coolidge had not read Senator Borah 's bill and had come to no mature conclusion with respect to the disposition that should be made of the seized property . What was represented as a tentative opinion of the President was qualified by the explanation that it was more in the line of theoretical discussion than proposal . At the same time enough was said to create the impression that the President foresaw difficulties involving the European Allies if seized German property was returned to its owners by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations felt that they had first claims upon It in the interest of their reparation demands . Judged by what was said at the White House the President strongly desires to preserve the traditional American policy of returning property to private nationals of enemy Governments seized in time of war , aside from other reasons , on the ground that it is an advantageous policy for the United States , because American nationals have property all over the world that might easily fall into enemy hands in war time . This policy is embodied in the new treaty of commerce and amity between the United States and Germany , in a provision that Germany shall reimburse its own nationals for the property the United States holds as security for the payment of funds due either to the United States or to citizens of this country . But the President sees as a fundamental difficulty in returning this seized property that there are other creditors of Germany besides ourselves . It was pointed out at the White House that other former belligerents had appropriated the property seized from Germans or their Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded of Germany or in settlement of other obligations . It was recalled by other authorities also that in the negotiations just prior to the Paris agreement by which the United States participated in the Dawes annuities there was strong dissatisfaction in Europe over America 's failure to apply first on our claims the Germanowned property we held , as other nations had done . In view of this situation , the President forrsees that if we should turn back the seized property , then fall back upon ment out of ether German resources for any reason , the other powers having claims on the German payments might object that we were cutting in on them . As long as the United States holds the security , this question will at least lie dormant , In the view of observers here , since if no other payments were forthcoming for any reason the Government could have recourse to the application of the security held by it . It has always been expected here that this Government would hold former enemy property until it had been clearly established that all debts due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured of satisfaction . At the same time there was every intention manifested of returning it whenever practicable . The objection foreseen at the White House , it was stated , are not regarded by the President as insuperable , although certain matters are to be well considered . The expectation at the White House , in the absence of more definite knowledge of the proposed legislation . however , is that Senator Borah had grasped this phase of the situation and had probably taken it into consideration . The policy of the State Department heretofore made known to other Governments in correspondence and at various international post-war conferences in which this Government has participated is that it is not the purpose of the United States to hold seized enemy property Permanently , but the qualifying explanation was made that under the Versailles Treaty a Government having seized German property could either hold it or dispose of It as it saw fit . Great Britain and other European Powers have appropriated seized German property but the United States , while still holding such property , has left the ultimate disposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been that Congress may make any disposition of the German property that it chooses . The State Department has let it be known . however , that if the seized property was not returned to Germany the value of it would be applied to the payment of claims of this Government against Germany for the cost of maintaining American troops in the occupied Rhinelands and to the liquidation of the claims of American citizens against Germany for damages suffered in the war . But the State Department has also laid down the principle that whether the property was returned to Germany or not it had no bearing on the right of the United States to obtain payment from Germany for cost of military occupation of the Rhinelands and for damages suffered by American citizens at the hands of Germany in the war , although the United States was willing that deductions of the value of seized property be made from the amounts due the United States by Germany on ? account of occupation and damages .               @ @ @ @ @ @
