While his father , mother , and sister Doris had been absent in New York for a week-end visit and Havens , the chauffeur , was ill at the hospital , the boy had taken the big six-cylinder car from the garage without anybody 's permission and carried a crowd of his friends to Torrington to a football game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . At the foot of the long hill leading into the village the mighty leviathan so unceremoniously borrowed had come to a halt , refusing to move another inch , and Stephen now sat helplessly in it , awaiting the aid his comrades had promised to send back from the town . What an ignominious climax to what had promised to be a royal holiday ! Steve scowled with chagrin and disappointment . The catastrophe served him right . Unquestionably he should not have taken the car without asking . He had never run it all by himself before , although many times he had driven it when either his father or Havens had been at his elbow . It had gone all right then . What reason had he to suppose a mishap would befall him when they were not by ? It was infernally hard luck ! Goodness only knew what was the matter with the thing . Probably something was smashed , something that might require days or even weeks to repair , and would cost a lot of money . Here was a pretty dilemma ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to use the automobile Saturday to take Doris back to Northampton for the opening of college and had planned to make quite a holiday of the trip . Now it would all have to be given up and everybody would blame him for the disappointment . A wretched hole he was in ! The boys had not given him much sympathy , either . They had been ready enough to egg him on into wrong-doing and had made of the adventure the jolliest lark imaginable ; but the moment fun had been transformed into calamity they had deserted him with incredible speed , climbing out of the spacious tonneau and trooping jauntily off on foot to see the town . It was easy enough for them to wash their hands of the affair and leave him to the solitude of the roadside ; the automobile was not theirs and when they got home they would not be confronted by irate parents . How persuasively , reflected Stephen , they had urged him on . " Oh , be a sport , Steve ! " Jack Curtis had coaxed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the car ? Anyhow , you have run it before , have n't you ? I do n't believe your father will mind . " " Take a chance , Stevie , " his chum , Bud Taylor , pleaded . " What 's the good of being such a boob ? Do you think if my father had a car and it was standing idle in the garage when a bunch of kids needed it to go to a school game I would hesitate ? You bet I would n't ! " " It is n't likely your Dad would balk at your using the car if he knew the circumstances , " piped another boy . " We have got that match to play off , and now that the electric cars are held up by the strike how are we to get to Torrington ? Do n't be a ninny , Steve . " Thus they had ridiculed , cajoled , and wheedled Steve until his conscience had been overpowered and , yielding to their arguments , he had set forth for the adjoining village with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The fourteen miles had slipped past with such smoothness and rapidity that Stephen , proudly enthroned at the wheel , had almost forgotten that any shadow rested on the hilarity of the day . He had been dubbed a good fellow , a true sport , a benefactor to the school -- every complimentary pseudonym imaginable -- and had glowed with pleasure beneath the avalanche of flattery . As the big car with its rollicking occupants had spun along the highway , many a passer-by had caught the merry mood of the cheering group and waved a smiling salutation in response to their shouts . In the meanwhile , exhilarated by the novelty of the escapade , Steve had increased the speed until the red car fairly shot over the level macadam , its blurred outlines lost in the scarlet of the autumn foliage . Then suddenly when the last half-mile was reached and Torrington village , the goal of the pilgrimage , was in sight , quite without warning the panting monster had stopped and all attempts to urge it farther were of no avail . There it stood , its motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves of heat . Immediately a hush had descended upon the boisterous company . There was a momentary pause , followed by a clamor of advice . When , however , it became evident that there was no prospect of restoring the disabled machine to action , one after another of the frightened schoolboys had dropped out over the sides of the car and after loitering an instant or two with a sort of shamefaced indecision , at the suggestion of Bud Taylor they had all set out for the town . " Tough luck , old chap ! " Bud had called over his shoulder . " Mighty tough luck ! Wish we had time to wait and see what 's queered the thing ; but the game is called at two-thirty , you know , and we have only about time to make it . We 'll try and hunt up a garage and send somebody back to help you . So long ! " And away they had trooped without so much as a backward glance , leaving Stephen alone on the country road , worried , mortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless conduct , he fumed indignantly . They were not all on the eleven . Five of the team had come over in Tim Barclay 's Ford , so that several of the fellows Steve had brought were merely to be spectators of the game . At least Bud Taylor , his especial crony , was not playing . He might have remained behind . How selfish people were , and what a fleeting thing was popularity ! Why , half an hour ago he had been the idol of the crowd ! Then Bud had shouted : " Come ahead , kids , let 's hoof it to Torrington ! " and in the twinkling of an eye the tide had turned , the mob had shifted its allegiance and gone tagging off at the heels of a new leader . They did not mean to have their pleasure spoiled , not they ! Scornfully Stephen watched them mount the hill , their crimson sweaters making a zigzag line of color in the sunshine ; even their laughter , care-free as if nothing had happened , floated back to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt for him and his refractory automobile . Well might they proceed light-heartedly to the village , spend their money on sodas and ice-cream cones , and shout themselves hoarse at the game . No thought of future punishment marred their enjoyment and the program was precisely the one he had outlined for himself before Fate had intervened and raised a prohibitory hand . The fun he had missed was , however , of scant consequence now . All he asked was to get the car safely back to his father 's garage before the family returned from New York on the afternoon train . Now that his excitement had cooled into sober second thought , he marveled that he had been led into committing such a monstrous offense . He must have been mad . Often he had begged to do the very thing he had done and his father had always refused to let him , insisting that an expensive touring car was no toy for a boy of his age . Perhaps there had been some truth in the assertion , too , he now admitted . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why he had not run the car exactly as his elders were wont to do . Of course he had had a pretty big crowd aboard and the heavy load might have strained the machinery ; and possibly -- just possibly -- he had speeded a bit . He certainly had made phenomenally good time for he did not want the fellows to think he was afraid to let out the engine . Well , whatever the matter was , the harm was done now and he was in a most unenviable plight . No doubt it would cost a small fortune to get the automobile into shape again , more money than he had in the world ; certainly far more than he had in his pocket at the present moment . What was he to do ? Even suppose the boys did remember to send back help ( they probably wouldn't -- but suppose they did ) how was he to pay a machinist ? As he pictured himself being towed to a garage and the car being left there , he felt an uncomfortable sensation in his throat . He certainly was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repairs to his father but that would be the only course left him . Fortunately Mr. Tolman , who was a railroad official , was well known in the locality and therefore there would be no trouble about obtaining credit ; but to ask his father to pay the bills for this escapade was anything but a manly and honorable way out and Steve wished with all his heart he had never been persuaded into the wretched affair . If there were only some escape possible , some alternative from being obliged to confess his wrong-doing ! But to hope to conceal or make good the disaster was futile . And even if he could cover up what had happened , how contemptible it would be ! He detested doing anything underhanded . Only sneaks and cowards resorted to subterfuge and although he had been called many names in his life these two had not been among them . No , he should make a clean breast of what he had done and bear the consequences , and once out of his miserable plight he would take care never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned his lesson . So absorbed was he in framing these worthy resolutions that he did not notice a tiny moving speck that appeared above the crest of the hill and now came whirling toward him . In fact the dusty truck and its yet more dusty driver were beside him before he heeded either one . Then the newcomer came to a stop and he heard a pleasant voice : " What 's the matter , sonny ? " Stephen glanced up , trying bravely to return his questioner 's smile . The man who addressed him was white-haired , ruddy , and muscular , and he wore brown denim overalls stained with oil and grease ; but although he was middle-aged there was a boyish friendliness in his face and in the frank blue eyes that peered out from under his shaggy brows . " What 's the trouble with your machine ? " he repeated . " I do n't know , " returned Stephen . " If I did , you bet I would n't be sitting here . " The workman laughed . " Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he , climbing off the seat on which he was perched . " I wish you would . " " It is a pretty fine car , is n't it ? " observed the man , as he approached it . " Is it yours ? " " My father 's . " " He lets you use it , eh ? " Stephen did not answer . " Some fathers ai n't that generous , " went on the man as he began to examine the silent monster . " If I had an outfit like this , I ai n't so sure I 'd trust it to a chap of your size . Still , if you have your license , I suppose you must know how to run it . " Illustration : " You 've got your engine nicely warmed up , youngster , " he observed casually . Page 9 . A shiver passed through Stephen 's body . A license ! What if the stranger should ask to see it ? There was a heavy fine , he now remembered , for driving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although what the penalty was he could not at the instant recall ; he had entirely forgotten there were any such legal details . Fearfully he eyed the mechanic . The man , however , did not pursue the subject but instead appeared engrossed in carefully inspecting the automobile inside and out . As he poked about , now here , now there , Stephen watched him with constantly increasing nervousness ; and after the investigation had proceeded for some little time and no satisfactory result had been reached , the boy 's heart sank . Something very serious must be the matter if the trouble were so hard to locate , he reasoned . In imagination he heard his father 's indignant reprimands and saw the Northampton trip shrivel into nothingness . The workman in the meantime remained silent , offering no comment to relieve his anxiety . What he was thinking under the shabby visor cap pulled so low over his brows it was impossible to fathom . His hand was now unscrewing the top of the gasoline tank . " You 've got your engine nicely warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe ' t was just as well you did come to a stop . You must have covered the ground at a pretty good clip . " There certainly was something very disconcerting about the stranger 's conversation and again Stephen looked at him with suspicion . " Oh , I do n't know , " he mumbled , trying to assume an off-hand air . " Perhaps we did come along fairly fast . " " You were n't alone then . " " N -- o , " was the uncomfortable reply . " The fellows who sent you back from the village were with me . " For the first time the workman evinced surprise . " Nobody sent me , " he retorted . " I just thought as I was going by that you looked as if you were up against it , and as I happen to know something about engines I pulled up to give you a helping hand . The fix you are in is n't serious , though . " He smiled broadly as if something amused him . " What is the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a voice that trembled with eagerness and anxiety and defied all efforts to remain under his control . " Why , son , nothing is wrong with your car . You 've got no gasoline , that 's all . " " Gasoline ! " repeated the lad blankly . " Sure ! You could n't have had much aboard when you started , I guess . It managed to bring you as far as this , however , and here you came to a stop . The up-grade of the hill tipped the little gas you did have back in the tank so it would not run out , you see . Fill her up again and she 'll sprint along as nicely as ever . " The relief that came with the information almost bowled Steve over . For a moment he could not speak ; then when he had caught his breath he exclaimed excitedly : " How can I get some gasoline ? " His rescuer laughed at the fevered question . " Why , I happen to have a can of it here on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you have part of it if you are so minded . " " Oh , I do n't want to take yours , " objected the boy . " Nonsense ! Why not ? I am going right past a garage on my way back and can get plenty more . We 'll tip enough of mine into your tank to carry you home . It wo n't take a minute . " The suggestion was like water to the thirsty . " All right ! " cried Stephen . " If you will let me pay for it I shall be mightily obliged to you . I 'm mightily obliged anyway . " " Pshaw ! I 've done nothing , " protested the person in the oily jumper . " What are we in the world for if not to do one another a good turn when we can ? " As he spoke he extricated from his conglomerate load of lumber , tools , and boxes a battered can , the contents of which he began to transfer into Stephen 's empty tank . " There ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top on . " That is n't all she 'll hold , but it will at least get you home . You are going right back , are n't you ? " The boy glanced quickly at the speaker . " Yes . " " That 's right . I would if I were in your place , " urged the man . Furtively Stephen scrutinized the countenance opposite but although the words had contained a mingled caution and rebuke there was not the slightest trace of interest in the face of the speaker , who was imperturbably wiping off the moist nickel cap with a handful of waste from his pocket . " Yes , " he repeated half-absently , " I take it that amount of gas will just about carry you back to Coventry ; it wo n't allow for any detours , to be sure , but if you follow the straight road it ought to fetch you up there all right . " Stephen started and again an interrogation rose to his lips . Who was this mysterious mechanic and why should he assume with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He longed to ask but a fear of lengthening the interview prevented him from doing so . If he began to ask questions might not the stranger assume the same privilege and wheel upon him with some embarrassing inquiry ? No , the sooner he was clear of this wizard in the brown overalls the better . But for the sake of his peace of mind he should like to know whether the man really knew who he was or whether his comments were simply matters of chance . There certainly was something very uncanny and uncomfortable about it all , something that led him to feel that the person in the jumper was fully acquainted with his escapade , disapproved of it , and meant to prevent him from prolonging it . Yet as he took a peep into the kindly blue eyes which he did not trust himself to meet directly he wondered if this assumption were not created by a guilty conscience rather than by fact . Certainly there was nothing accusatory in the other 's bearing . His face was frankness itself . In books criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man knew nothing about him at all . It was absurd to think he did . Nevertheless the boy was eager to be gone from the presence of those searching blue eyes and therefore he climbed into his car , murmuring hurriedly : " You 've been corking to help me out ! " The workman held up a protesting hand . " Do n't think of it again , " he answered . " I was glad to do it . Good luck to you ! " With nervous hands Stephen started the engine and , backing the automobile about , headed it homeward . Now that danger was past his desire to reach Coventry before his father should arrive drove every other thought from his mind , and soon the mysterious hero of the brown jumper was forgotten . Although he made wonderfully good time back over the road it seemed hours before he turned in at his own gate and brought the throbbing motor to rest in the garage . A sigh of thankfulness welled up within him . The great red leviathan that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as peacefully as if it had never stirred from the spot it occupied . If only it had remained there , how glad the boy would have been . He ventured to look toward the windows fronting the avenue . No one was in sight , it was true ; but to flatter himself that he had been unobserved was ridiculous for he saw by the clock that his father , mother , and Doris must already have reached home . Doubtless they were in the house now and fully acquainted with what he had done . If they had not missed the car from the garage they would at least have seen it whirl into the driveway with him at the wheel . Any moment his father might appear at his shoulder . To delay was useless . He had had his fun and now in manly fashion he must face the music and pay for it . How he dreaded the coming storm ! Once , twice he braced himself , then moved reluctantly toward the house , climbed the steps , and let himself in at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet him under the circumstances . An ominous silence pervaded the great dim hall but after the glare of the white ribbon of road on which his eyes had been so intently fixed he found the darkness cool and tranquilizing . At first he could scarcely see ; then as he gradually became accustomed to the faint light he espied on the silver card tray a telegram addressed to himself and with a quiver of apprehension tore it open . Telegrams were not such a common occurrence in his life that he had ceased to regard them with misgiving . The message on which his gaze rested , however , contained no ill tidings . On the contrary it merely announced that the family had been detained in New York longer than they had expected and would not return until noon to-morrow . He would have almost another day , therefore , before he would be forced to make confession to his father ! The respite was a welcome one and with it his tenseness relaxed . He even gained courage on the strength of his steadier nerves to creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he knew must have seen him shoot into the driveway and who , having been years in the home , would not hesitate to lecture him roundly for his conduct . But Mary was not there and neither was Julia , the waitress . In the absence of the head of the house the two had evidently ascended to the third story there to forget in sleep the cares of daily life . Stephen smiled at the discovery . It was a coincidence . Unquestionably Fate was with him . It helped his self-respect to feel that at least the servants were in ignorance of what he had done . Nobody knew -- nobody at all ! With an interval of rest and a dash of cold water upon his face gradually the act he had committed began to sink back into normal perspective and loom less gigantic in his memory . After all was it such a dreadful thing , he asked himself . Of course he should not have done it and he fully intended to confess his fault and accept the blame . But was the folly so terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was somewhat troubled over the probable consequences , and every time he awoke in the night a dread of the morrow came upon him . In the morning he rushed off to school , found the team had won the game , and came home feeling even more justified than before . Why , if he had not taken the car , the school might have forfeited that victory ! All the afternoon as he sat quietly at his books he tried to keep this consideration uppermost in his mind . Then at dinner time there was a stir in the hall and he knew the moment he feared had arrived . The family were back again ! Slowly he stole down over the heavily carpeted stairs . Yes , there they were , just coming in at the door , laughing and chatting gaily with Julia , who had let them in . The next instant his mother had espied him on the landing and had called a greeting . There was a smile on her face that reproached him for having yielded to the temptation to deceive her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have had , Steve ! " she called . " We wished a dozen times that you were with us . But some vacation you shall have a holiday in New York with your father to pay for what you have missed this time . You shall not be cheated out of all the fun , dear boy ! " " Everything been all right here , son ? " inquired his father from the foot of the stairs . " Yes , Dad . " " Havens has not showed up yet , I suppose . " The boy flushed . " No , sir . " " It seems to take him an interminable time to have his tonsils out . If he does not appear pretty soon I shall have to get another man to run the car . We ca n't be left high and dry like this , " fretted the elder man irritably . " Suppose I knew nothing about it , where would we be ? I wished to-day you were old enough to have a license and could have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more instruction you could manage that automobile all right . Not that I should let you go racing over the country with a lot of boys . But you might be very useful in taking your mother and sister about and helping when we were in a fix like this . I think you would enjoy doing it , too . " " I -- I'm -- sure I should , " replied the lad , avoiding his father 's eye and studying the toe of his shoe intently . It passed through his mind as he stood there that now was the moment for confession . He had only to say , " I had the car out yesterday , " and the dreaded ordeal would be over . But somehow he could not utter the words . Instead he descended from the landing and followed the others into the library where the conversation immediately shifted to other topics . In the jumble of narrative his chance to speak was swallowed up nor during the next few days did any suitable opportunity occur for him to make his belated confession . When Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at his office or occupied with important affairs , and by and by so many events had intervened that to go back into the past seemed to Stephen idle sentimentality . At length he had lulled his conscience into deciding that in view of the conditions it was quite unnecessary to acquaint his father and mother with his wrong-doing at all . He was safely out of the entanglement and was it not just as well to accept his escape with gratitude and let sleeping dogs lie ? All the punishments in the world could not change anything now . What would be the use of telling ? CHAPTER II A MEETING WITH AN OLD FRIEND The day of the excursion to Northampton was one of those clear mornings when a light frost turned the maples to vermilion and in a single night transformed the ripening summer foliage to the splendor of autumn . The Tolman family were in the highest spirits ; it was not often that Mr. Tolman could be persuaded to leave his business and steal away for a week-end and when he did it was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of rejoining her college friends , was also in the happiest frame of mind and tripped up and down stairs , collecting her forgotten possessions and jamming them into her already bulging suitcase . As for Steve , the prickings of conscience that had at first tormented him and made him shrink from being left alone with his father had quite vanished . He had argued himself into a state of mental tranquility where further punishment for his misdemeanor seemed superfluous . After his hairbreadth escape from disaster there was no danger , he argued , of his repeating the experiment , and was not this the very lesson all punishments sought to instill ? If he had achieved this result without bothering his father about the details , why so much the better . Did not the old adage say that " experience is the best teacher " ? Certainly in this case the maxim held true . Having thus excused his under-handedness and stifled the protests of his better nature he felt , or tried to feel , entirely at peace with the world ; and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it as jauntily as if he had nothing to conceal . Already the car was at the door with the luggage aboard and its engine humming invitingly . As the boy listened to the sound he could not but rejoice that the purring monster could tell no tales . How disconcerting it would be should the scarlet devil suddenly shout aloud : " Well , Steve , do n't you hope we do not get stalled to-day the way we did going to Torrington ? " Mercifully there was no danger of that . The engine might puff and purr and snort but at least it could not talk , and his secret was quite safe . This reflection lighted his face with courage and when the family came out to join him no one would have suspected that the slender boy waiting on the doorstep harbored a thought of anything but anticipation in the prospect of the coming holiday . " Is everything in , Steve ? " asked his father , approaching with Doris 's remaining grip . " I think so , Dad , " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled in almost a dozen suitcases . " " Nonsense , Stevie , " pouted Doris . " There were only four . " " Five , Miss Sophomore ! " contradicted her brother . " Five ! That one Dad is bringing makes the fifth , and I would be willing to bet that it is yours . " " That 's where you are wrong , Smartie , " the girl laughed good-humoredly , making a mischievous grimace at him from beneath the brim of her saucy little toque of blue velvet . " I am not guilty of the extra suitcase . It 's mother 's . " " Your mother 's ! " ejaculated Mr. Tolman incredulously . " Mercy on us ! I never knew your mother to be starting out on a short trip with such an array of gowns . " Then turning toward his wife , he added in bantering fashion : " Are n't you getting a little frivolous , my dear ? If it were Doris now --  " " But it is n't this time ! " interrupted the young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both laughed . " No , Henry , I am the one to blame , " Mrs. Tolman admitted . " You see , if I am to keep pace with my big son and daughter I must look my best ; so I have not only brought the extra suitcase but I am going to be tremendously fussy as to where it is put . " " I do believe Mater 's brought all her jewels with her ! " Steve declared wickedly . " Well , she shall have her sunbursts , tiaras , and things where she can keep her eye on them every moment . Suppose I put them down here at your feet , Mother . " Without further ado , he started to lift the basket suitcase into the car . " Do n't tip it up , son . Do n't tip it up ! " cautioned his mother . " Your mother is afraid of knocking some of the pearls or emeralds out of their setting , " chuckled Mr. Tolman . " Go easy , Steve ! " A general laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight . An instant later wraps and rugs were bundled in , everybody was cosily tucked up , and Mr. Tolman placed his hands on the wheel . " Now we 're off , Dad ! " cried Stephen , as he sprang in beside his father . Mr. Tolman needed no second bidding . There was a whir , a leap forward , and the automobile glided down the long avenue and out into the highway . Steve , studying the road map , was too much interested in tracing out the route they were to follow to notice that after the car had spun along smoothly for several miles its speed lessened , and it was not until it came to a complete standstill that he aroused himself from his preoccupation sufficiently to see that his father was bending forward over the starter . " What 's wrong , Henry ? " inquired his wife from the back seat . " I ca n't imagine , " was the impatient reply . " Had I not left the tank with gasoline in it , I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case , for I always keep enough in it to carry us to the garage . Otherwise we should be stalled at our own doorstep and not able to get anywhere . " Climbing out , he began to unscrew the metal top of the tank while Stephen watched him in consternation . The boy did not need to hear the result of the investigation for already the wretched truth flashed upon him . The tank was empty ; of course it was ! He knew that without being told . Had not the workman who had replenished it Wednesday said quite plainly that there was only enough gas in it to get him home to Coventry ? He should have remembered to stop at the garage and take on an extra supply on the way back as his father always did . How stupid he had been ! In his haste to get home he had forgotten every other consideration and the present dilemma was the result of his thoughtlessness . Yet how could he have stopped at the Coventry garage even had he thought of it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if he had gone there or had even driven through the center of the town somebody would have been sure to see him and mention the incident . Why , it was to avoid this very danger that he had returned by the less frequented way . The man in the brown jeans had certainly calculated to a nicety when he measured out that gasoline . He had not meant him to do any more riding that day ; that was apparent . What business was it of his , anyway , and why was he so solicitous as to where he went ? There was something puzzling about that man . Steve had thought so at the time . Not that it mattered now . All that did matter was that here they were stalled at the side of the road in almost the same spot where he had been stalled the other day ; and they were there because he had neglected to procure gasoline . The lad felt the hot blood throb in his cheeks . Again the chance for confession confronted him and again his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole predicament ; but he did not . Instead he sat as if stunned , the heart inside him pounding violently . He saw that his father was not only deeply annoyed but baffled to solve the incident . " The gas is all out ; that 's the trouble ! " he announced . " What are we going to do , Dad ? " inquired Doris anxiously . " Oh , we can get more all right , daughter , " returned her father reassuringly . " Do n't worry , my dear . But what I ca n't understand is how we come to be in such a plight . " " Does n't gasoline evaporate , Henry ? " suggested Mrs. Tolman . " To some extent , yes ; but there could be no such shrinkage as this unless there was a leak in the tank . I never dreamed the supply was so low . Well , it is my own fault . I should have made sure everything was right before we started . " Steve shifted his position uncomfortably . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did not rightfully belong to him . " Now let me think what we had better do , " went on Mr. Tolman . " Unfortunately there is n't a house in sight from which we can telephone for help ; and we are fully five miles from Torrington . Our only hope is that some one bound for the town may overtake us and allow Steve to ride to the village for aid . " " Could n't I walk it , Dad ? " asked the boy , with an impulse to make good the mischief he had done . " Oh , no ; I would n't do that unless the worst befalls , " his father replied kindly . " We should gain nothing . It is a long tramp and would simply be a waste of time . Let us wait like Mr. Micawber , and see if something does not turn up . " Wretchedly Stephen settled back into his seat . He would rather have walked to Torrington , done almost anything rather than remain there in the quiet autumn stillness and listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ! " It is a shame for us to be tied up here ! " he heard Doris complain . " I know it , daughter , and I am as sorry as you are , " responded her father patiently . " In fact , probably , I am more sorry , since it is through my own carelessness that we are stranded . " Again the impulse to blurt out the truth and take the blame that belonged to him took possession of Stephen ; but with resolution he forced it back . Nervously he fingered the road map . If he had only spoken at the beginning ! It was harder now . He should have made a clean breast of the whole affair when his father got home from New York . Then was the time to have done it . But since he had let that opportunity pass it was awkward , almost absurd , to make confession now . He would much better keep still . In the meanwhile a gradual depression fell upon the occupants of the car . Mrs. Tolman did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tolman began to pace back and forth at the side of the road and anxiously scan the stretch of macadam that narrowed away between the avenue of trees bordering the highway . Presently he uttered an exclamation of relief . " Here comes a truck ! " he cried . " We will tip the driver and persuade him to let you ride on to Torrington with him , Steve . This is great luck ! " Stepping into the pathway of the approaching car he held up his hand and the passer-by came to a stop beside him . Stephen looked up expectantly ; then a thrill of foreboding seized him and he quickly turned his head aside . It needed no second glance to assure him that the man whom his father was addressing was none other than the workman in the brown jeans who had rescued him from his former plight . He bent lower over the road map , trying to conceal his face and decide what to do . In another moment the teamster would probably recognize him , recall the incident of their former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate the entire story . The possibility was appalling , but terrible as it was it did not equal the disquietude he experienced when he heard his father ejaculate with sudden surprise : " Why , if it is n't O'Malley ! I did not recognize you , Jake . You are just in time to extricate us from a most inconvenient situation . We are headed for Northampton and find ourselves without gasoline . If you can take my son along to Torrington with you so he can hunt up a garage and ride back with some one on a service car I shall be very grateful to you . " " I 'd be glad to go myself , sir . " " No , no ! I shall not allow you to do that , " protested Mr. Tolman . " You are on your way to work and I could not think of detaining you . All I ask is that you take my boy along to the village . " " I 'd really be pleased to go , sir , " reiterated O'Malley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I sha n't hear to it , Jake , " Mr. Tolman repeated . " Nevertheless I appreciate your offer . Take the boy along and that is all I 'll ask . Come , Steve , jump aboard ! O'Malley , son , is one of our railroad people , whose services we value highly . He is going to be good enough to let you ride over to Torrington with him . " Although the introduction compelled Stephen to give the waiting employee a nod of greeting , he did not meet his eye or evince any sign of recognition , and he sensed that the light that had flashed into the man 's face at sight of him died out as quickly as it had come . The boy had an uncomfortable realization as he climbed to the seat of the truck and took his place beside its driver that O'Malley must be rating him as a snob . No one but a cad would accept a stranger 's kindness and then cut him dead the next time he encountered him . It was better to endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance with the mechanic and thereby arouse his father 's suspicion and curiosity . Hence , without further parley , he settled himself and in silence the truck started off . For some minutes he waited , expecting that when they were well out of earshot of the family the man at the wheel would turn and with a laugh make some reference to the adventure of the past week . It certainly must have amused him to find the great red car again stalled in the same spot , and what would be more natural than that he should comment on the coincidence and perhaps make a joke of the circumstance ? But to the boy 's chagrin the teamster did no such thing . Instead he kept his eyes fixed on the road and gave no evidence that he had ever before seen the lad at his elbow . Stephen was aghast . It was not possible the workman had forgotten the happening . He began to feel very uncomfortable . As the landscape slipped past and the car sped on , the distance to Torrington lessened . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel breaking his silence . If it had merely been a silence perhaps Steve would not have minded so much ; but there was an implied rebuke in the stillness that nettled and stung and left him with a consciousness of being ignored by a superior being . " I say ! " he burst out , when he could endure the ignominy of his position no longer , " do n't you remember me , Mr. O'Malley ? " The man who guided the car did not turn his head but he nodded . " I remember you all right , " replied he politely . " I just thought you did not remember me . " " Oh , I remembered you right away , " declared Steve eagerly . " Did you ? " There was a subtle irony in the tone that the lad was not clever enough to detect . " Of course . " " Is that so ! " came dryly from O'Malley . " Yes , indeed ! I remembered you right away , " Steve stumbled on . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck here Wednesday . " " I am . " " I knew you the first minute I saw you , " repeated Stephen . " I did not notice any sign that you did , " was the terse response . " Oh -- well -- you see , I could n't very well speak back there , " explained Steve with confusion . " They would all have wanted to know where I -- I mean I would have to -- it would just have made a lot of talk , " concluded he lamely . For the first time the elder man , moving his eyes from the ribbon of gleaming highway , confronted him . " So your father did not know you had the car out the other day ? " said he . " N -- o . " The workman showed no surprise . " I guessed as much , " he remarked . " But of course you have told him since . " " Not yet , " Steve stammered . " I was going to -- honest I was ; but things kept interrupting until it got to be so late that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I sha n't do it again , so what is the use of jawing about it ? " He stopped , awaiting a response from the railroad employee ; but none came . " Anyhow , " he argued with rising irritability , " what good does it do to discuss things that are over and done with ? You ca n't undo them . " The man at the wheel vouchsafed no answer . " It is because I forgot to stop for more gas when I went home the other day that we are in this fix now , " Steve finally blurted out , finding relief in brutal confession . Still the only reply to his monologue was the chugging of the engine . At last his voice rose to a higher pitch and there was anger in it . " I 'm talking to you , " he shouted in exasperation . " I am listening . " " Well , why do n't you say something ? " " What is there to say ? " " Why -- eh -- you could tell me what you think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen 's face turned scarlet . " I did intend to tell my father , " repeated he , instantly on the defensive . " Straight goods , I did . " The man shrugged his shoulders . " It was only that it did n't seem to come right . You know how things go sometimes . " He saw the workman 's lip curl . " You think I ought to have told . " " Have I said so ? " " No , but I know you do think so . " " I was n't aware I 'd expressed any opinion . " " No -- but -- well -- hang it all -- you think I am a coward for not making a clean breast of the whole thing ! " cried Stephen , now thoroughly enraged . " What do you think yourself ? " O'Malley suddenly inquired with disconcerting directness . " Oh , I know I 've been rotten , " admitted the boy . " Still , even now --  " He paused . " You mean that even now it is n't too late ? " put in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N -- o ; that was n't exactly what I was going to say , " began the lad , resuming his argumentative tone . " What I mean is that --  " A swift frown replaced the elder man 's smile . " Here we are at the garage , " he broke in . " They will do whatever you want them to . " He seemed in a hurry and as Stephen could find no excuse for lingering he climbed reluctantly out of the truck and stood balancing himself on the curb that edged the sidewalk . " I 'm much obliged to you for bringing me over , " he observed awkwardly . " That 's all right . " The man in the brown jeans started his engine . " Say , Mr. O'Malley ! " called Stephen desperately . " Well ? " " You -- you -- wo n't tell my father about my taking the car , will you ? " he pleaded wretchedly . " I tell him ? " Never had he heard so much scorn compressed into three words . " You need have no worries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneer curling his lips . " I confess my own wrong-doing but I do not tattle the sins of other people . Your father will never be the wiser about you so far as I am concerned . Whatever you want him to know you will have to tell him yourself . " Baffled , mortified , and stinging with humiliation as if he had been whipped , Stephen watched him disappear round the bend of the road . O'Malley despised him , that he knew ; and he did not at all relish being despised . CHAPTER III A SECOND CALAMITY While hunting up the garage and negotiating for gasoline Steve thrust resolutely from his mind his encounter with O'Malley and the galling sense of inferiority it carried with it ; but once on the highroad again the smart returned and the sting lingering behind the man 's scorn was not to be allayed . It required every excuse his wounded dignity could muster to bolster up his pride and make out for himself the plausible case that had previously comforted him and lulled his conscience to rest . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any confession , he decided ; for having denied in his father 's presence O'Malley 's acquaintance it would be ridiculous to acknowledge that he had known the truck driver all along . Of course he could not do that . Whatever he might have said or done at the time , it was entirely too late to go back on his conduct now . One event had followed on the heels of another until to slip out a single stone of the structure he had built up would topple over the whole house . If he had spoken in the beginning that would have been quite simple . All he could do now was to let bygones be bygones and in the pleasure of to-day forget the mistakes of yesterday . Consoled by this reflection he managed to recapture such a degree of his self-esteem that by the time he rejoined the family he was once more holding his head in the air and smiling with his wonted lightness of heart . " We shall get you to Northampton now , daughter , without more delay , I hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . " We may be a bit behind schedule ; nevertheless a late arrival by motor will be pleasanter than to have made the trip by train . " " I should say so ! " was the fervent ejaculation . " Come , come ! " interrupted Mr. Tolman . " I shall not sit back and allow you two people to cry down the railroads . They are not perfect , I will admit , and unquestionably trains do not always go at the hours we wish they did ; a touring car is , perhaps , a more comfortable and luxurious method of travel , especially in summer . But just as it is an improvement over the train , so the train was a mighty advance over the stagecoach of olden days . " " Oh , I do n't know , Dad , " Stephen mused . " I am not so sure that I should not have liked stagecoaches better . Think what jolly sport it must have been to drive all over the country ! " " In fine weather , yes -- that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now ; but you must remember that in the old coaching days road-building had not reached its present perfection . Traveling by stage over a rough highway in a conveyance that had few springs was not so comfortable an undertaking as it is sometimes pictured . Furthermore you must not forget that it was also perilous , for not only was there danger from accident on these poorly constructed , unlighted thoroughfares but there was in addition the menace from highwaymen in the less populated districts . It took a great while to make a journey of any length , too , and to sleep in a coach where one was cramped , jolted , and either none too warm or miserably hot was not an unalloyed delight , as I am sure you will agree . " " I had not thought of any of those things , " owned Stephen . " It just seemed on the face of it as if it must have been fun to ride on top of the coach and see the sights as one does from the Fifth Avenue or London buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a few hours ' adventure like that is quite a different affair from making a stagecoach journey . I grant that to ride on a clear morning through the streets of a great city , or bowl along the velvet roads of a picturesque countryside as one frequently does in England is very delightful . To read Dickens ' descriptions of journeys up to London is to long to don a greatcoat , wind a muffler about one 's neck , and amid the cracking of whips and tooting of horns dash off behind the horses for the fairy city his pen portrays . Who would not have liked , for example , to set out with Mr. Pickwick for the Christmas holidays at Dingley Dell ? Why , you can not even read about it without seeing in your mind 's eye the envious throng that crowded the inn yard and watched while the stableboys loosed the heads of the leaders and the steeds galloped away ! And those marvelous country taverns he depicts , with their roaring fires , their steaming roasts , their big platters of fowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ever writer more tantalizing ? " " You will have us all hungry in two minutes , Dad , if you keep on , " exclaimed Stephen . " And Dickens has us hungry , too , " declared Mr. Tolman . " Nevertheless we must not forget that he paints but one side of the picture . He fails to emphasize what such a trip meant when the weather was cold and stormy , and those outside the coach as well as those inside it were often drenched with rain or snow , and well-nigh frozen to death . Moreover , while it is true that many of the inns along the turnpike were clean and furnished excellent fare , there were others that could boast nothing better than chilly rooms , damp beds , and only a very limited hospitality . " " I believe you are a realist , Henry , " said his wife playfully . Her husband laughed . " Nor must we lose sight of the time consumed by making a trip by coach , " he went on . " Business in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , of course ; yet even when issues of importance were at stake , or crises of life and death were to be met , there was no hurrying things beyond a certain point . Physical impossibility prohibited it . Horses driven at their liveliest pace could cover only a comparatively small number of miles an hour ; and at the points where the relays were changed , or the horses fed and rested ; the mails deposited or taken aboard ; and passengers left or picked up , there were unavoidable delays . In fact , the strongest argument against the stagecoach , and the one that influenced public opinion the most , was this so-called fast-mail service ; for in order to make connections with other mail coaches along the route and not forfeit the money paid for doing so , horses were often driven at such a merciless rate of speed that the poor creatures became total wrecks within a very short time . Many a horse fell in its tracks in the inn yards , having been lashed along to make the necessary ten miles an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses were maimed for life . It is tragic to consider that in England before the advent of the railroad about thirty thousand horses were annually either killed outright or injured so badly that they were of little use afterward . " " Great Scott , Dad ! " ejaculated Stephen . " And England was no more guilty in this respect than was America , for in the early days of our own country when people were demanding quicker transportation and swifter mail service thousands of noble beasts offered up their last breath in making the required rate of speed . " " I suppose nobody thought about the horses , " murmured the boy . " I am sure I did n't . " " If the public thought at all it was too selfish to care , I am afraid , until threatened by the possibility of the total extermination of these creatures , " was his father 's reply . " This danger , blended with a humane impulse which rose from the gentler-minded portion of the populace , was the decisive factor in urging men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , the world was waking up commercially and it was becoming imperative to find better ways for transporting the ever increasing supplies of merchandise . The quick moving of troops from one point to another was also an issue . Although the canals of England enabled the government to carry quite a large body of men , the method was a slow one . In 1806 , for instance , it took exactly a week to shift troops from Liverpool to London , a distance of thirty-four miles . " " Why , they could have marched it in less time than that , could n't they ? " questioned Doris derisively . " Yes , the journey might easily have been made on foot in two days , " nodded her father . " But in war time a long march which exhausts the soldiers is frequently an unwise policy , for the men are in no condition when they arrive to go into immediate action , as reenforcements often must . " " I see , " answered Doris . " When the Liverpool and Manchester Railroad was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , " continued Mr. Tolman . " Of course the quick transportation of troops was then , as now , of very vital importance . We have had plenty of illustrations of that in our recent war against Germany . Frequently the fate of a battle has hung on large reenforcements being speedily dispatched to a weak point in the line . Moreover , by means of the railroads , vast quantities of food , ammunition and supplies of all sorts can constantly be sent forward to the men in action . During the late war our American engineers laid miles and miles of track under fire , thereby keeping open the route to the front so that there was no danger of the fighters being cut off and left unequipped . It was a service for which they , as well as our nation , won the highest praise . And not only was there a constant flow of supplies but it was by means of these railroads that hospital trains were enabled to carry to dressing stations far behind the lines thousands of wounded men whose lives might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly wounded could be made more comfortable in this way , too , " Mrs. Tolman suggested . " Yes , indeed , " was the reply . " Not only were the men better cared for in the roomier hospitals behind the lines , but as there was more space there the peril from contagion , always a menace when large numbers of sick are packed closely together , was greatly lessened ; for there is nothing army doctors dread so much as an epidemic of disease when there is not enough room to isolate the patients . " " When did England adopt railroads in place of stagecoaches , Dad ? " asked Doris presently . At the question her father laughed . " See here ! " he protested good-humoredly , " what do you think I am ? Just because I happen to be a superintendent do you think me a volume of railroad history , young woman ? The topic , I confess , is a fascinating one ; but I am off for a vacation to-day . " " Oh , tell us , Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What is the use of spoiling a fine morning like this talking business ? " objected her father . " But it is not business to us , " interrupted Mrs. Tolman . " It is simple a story -- a sort of fairy tale . " " It is not unlike a fairy tale , that 's a fact , " reflected her husband gravely . " Imagine yourself back , then , in 1700 , before steam power was in use in England . Now you must not suppose that steam had never been heard of , for an ancient Alexandrian record dated 120 B. C. describes a steam turbine , steam fountain , and steam boiler ; nevertheless , Hero , the historian who tells us of them , leaves us in doubt as to whether these wonders were actually worked out , or if they were , whether they were anything but miniature models . Still the fact that they are mentioned goes to prove that there were persons in the world who at a very early date vaguely realized the possibilities of steam as a force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject remained an alluring one which led many a scientist into experiments without number . In various parts of the world men played with the idea and wrote about it ; but no one actually produced any practical steam contrivance until 1650 , when the second Marquis of Worcester constructed a steam fountain that could force the water from the moat around his castle as high as the top of one of the towers . The feat was looked upon as a marvel and afterward a larger fountain , similar in principle , was constructed at Vauxhall and from that time on the future of steam as a motive power was assured . " " Did the Marquis of Worcester go on with his experiments and make other things ? " demanded Stephen . " Apparently not , " replied his father . " He did , nevertheless , furnish a basis for others to work on . Scientists were encouraged to investigate with redoubled zeal this strange vapor which , when controlled and directed , could carry water to the top of a castle tower . When in 1698 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carrying a water supply , every vestige of doubt that this mighty power could be applied to practical uses vanished . " " Did the steam engine come soon afterward ? " queried Doris , who had become interested in the story . " No , not immediately , " answered Mr. Tolman , pausing to shift the gear of the car . " Before the steam engine , as we know it , saw the light , there had to be more experimenting and improving of the steam fountain . It was not until 1705 that Thomas Newcomen and his partner , John Calley , invented and patented the first real steam engine . Of course it was not in the least like the engines we use now . Still , it was a steam device with moving parts which would pump water , a tremendous advance over the mechanisms of the past where all the power had been secured by the alternate filling and emptying of a vacuum , or vacant receptacle , attached to the pump . Now , with Newcomen 's engine a complete revolution took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our modern exquisitely constructed machinery , speedily crowded out the primitive steam fountain idea . The new device was very imperfect , there can be no question about that ; but just as the steam fountain furnished the inspiration for the engine with moving parts , so this forward step became the working hypothesis for the engines that followed . " " What engines did follow ? " Doris persisted , " and who did invent our steam engine ? " " Silly ! And you in college , " jeered Steve disdainfully . " I am not taking a course in steam engines there , " laughed his sister teasingly . " Anyway , girls are not expected to know who invented all the machines in the world , are they , Dad ? " Mr. Tolman waited a moment , then said soothingly : " No , dear . Girls are not usually so much interested in scientific subjects as boys are -- although why they should not be I never could quite understand . Nevertheless , I think it might be as well for even a girl to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the steam engine . " It was James Watt , " Stephen asserted triumphantly . " It certainly was , " his father agreed . " And since your brother has his information at his tongue 's end , suppose we get him to tell us more about this remarkable person . " Stephen flushed . " I 'm afraid , " began he lamely , " that I do n't know much more . You see , I studied about him quite a long time ago and I do n't remember the details . I should have to look it up . I do recall the name , though --  " His father looked amused . " I do n't know which of you children is the more blameworthy , " remarked he in a bantering tone . " Doris , who never heard of Watt ; or Stephen , who has forgotten all about him . " Both the boy and the girl chuckled good-humoredly . " At least I knew his name , Dad -- give me credit for that , " piped Steve . " That was something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " Well , since neither of us can furnish the story , I do n't see but that you will have to do it , Dad , " Doris said mischievously . " It would be a terrible humiliation if I should discover that I could not do it , would n't it ? " replied Mr. Tolman with a smile . " In point of fact , there actually is not a great deal more that it is essential for one to know . It was by perfecting the engines of the Newcomen type and adding to them first one and then another valuable device that Watt finally built up the forerunner of our present-day engine . The progression was a gradual one . Now he would better one part , then some other . He surrounded the cylinder , for example , with a jacket , or chamber , which contained steam at the same pressure as that within the boiler , thereby keeping it as hot as the steam that entered it -- a very important improvement over the old idea ; then he worked out a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cylinder instead of at one end , as was the case with former engines . The latter innovation resulted in the push and pull of the piston rod . So it went . " " How did Watt come to know so much about engines ? " asked Stephen . " Oh , Watt was an engineer by trade -- or rather he was a maker of mathematical instruments for the University of Glasgow , where he came into touch with a Newcomen engine . He also made surveys of rivers , harbors , and canals . So you see it was quite a consistent thing that a man with such a bent of mind should take up the pastime of experimenting with a toy like the steam engine in his leisure hours . " " Did he go so far as to patent it , Henry ? " Mrs. Tolman questioned . " Yes , he did . Many of our scientists either had not the wit to do this , alas , or else they were too impractical to appreciate the value of their ideas . In consequence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filched from them . But Watt was a Scotchman and canny enough to realize to some extent what his invention was worth . He therefore obtained a patent on it which was good for twenty-five years ; and when , in 1800 , this right expired he retired from business with both fame and fortune . " " It is nice to hear of one inventor who got something out of his toil , " Mrs. Tolman observed . " Indeed it is . Think of the many men who have slaved day and night , forfeited health , friends , and money to give to the world an idea , and never lived to receive either gratitude or financial reward , dying unknown or entirely forgotten . There is something tragic about the injustice of it . But Watt , I am glad to say , lived long enough to witness the service he had done mankind and enjoy an honored place among the great of the world . " " Is the kind of engine Watt invented now in use ? " Doris inquired . " Yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , " her father returned . " Mechanics and engineers went on improving Watt 's engine just as he had improved those that had preceded it . It is interesting , too , to notice that after thousands of years scientists have again worked around to the steam turbine described so long ago in the Alexandrian records . This engine , although it does away with many of the moving parts introduced by Newcomen , preserves the essential principles of that early engine combined with Watt 's later improvements . To-day we have a number of different kinds of engines , their variety differing with the purpose to which they are applied . Their cost , weight , and the space they require have been reduced and their power increased , and in addition we have made it possible to run them not only by means of coal or wood but by gasoline , oil , or electricity . We have small , light-weight engines for navigation use ; mighty engines to propel our great warships and ocean liners ; stationary engines for mills and power plants ; to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviest trains over the highest of mountains . The principle of all these engines is , however , the same and for the brain behind them we must thank James Watt . " " Was it Watt who invented the locomotive , too ? " ventured Doris . Her father shook his head . " The perfecting of the locomotive , my dear , is , as Kipling says , another story . " " Tell it to us . " " Not now , daughter , " protested Mr. Tolman . " I am far too hungry ; and more than that I am eager to enjoy this beautiful country and forget railroads and locomotives . " " Did you say you were hungry , Henry ? " asked Mrs. Tolman . " I am -- starved ! " her husband said apologetically . " Is n't it absurd to be hungry so early in the day ? " " It is nearly noon , Dad ! " said Steve , glancing down at the clock in the front of the car . " Noon ! Why , I thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! While you have been talking we have come many a mile , and the time has slipped past , " his wife said . " If all goes well --  " The shot from a bursting tire rent the air . " Which evidently it does not , " interrupted Mr. Tolman grimly , bringing the car to a stop . " How aggravating ! We were almost into Palmer , where I had planned for us to lunch . Now it may be some little time before we can get anything to eat . " " Motorist 's luck ! Motorist 's luck , my dear ! " cried Mrs. Tolman gaily . " An automobilist must resign himself to taking cheerfully what comes . " " That is all very well , " grumbled her husband , as he clambered out of the car . " Nevertheless you must admit that this mishap on the heels of the other one is annoying . " Stephen also got out and the two bent to examine the punctured tire . " I should not mind so much if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How are you , Steve ? Fainting away ? " The boy laughed . " Well , I could eat something if I had it , " he confessed . " I wish I had n't mentioned food , " went on Mr. Tolman humorously . " It was an unfortunate suggestion . " " I 'm hungry , too , " piped Doris . " There , you see the epidemic you have started , Henry , " called Mrs. Tolman accusingly . " Here is Doris vowing she is in the last throes of starvation . " Nobody noticed that in the meanwhile the mother had reached down and lifted into her lap the small suitcase hidden in the bottom of the car . She opened the cover and began to remove its contents . At length , when a remark her husband made to her went unheeded , he sensed her preoccupation and came around to the side of the car where she was sitting . Immediately he gave a cry of surprise . " My word ! " he exclaimed . " Steve , come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There sat Mrs. Tolman , unpacking with quiet enjoyment sandwiches , eggs , cake , cookies , and olives . A shout of pleasure rose from the famished travelers . " So it was not your jewels , after all , Mater ! " cried Stephen . " No , and after the way you have slandered me and my little suitcase , none of you deserve a thing to eat , " his mother replied . " However , I am going to be magnanimous if only to shame you . Now climb in and we will have our lunch . You can fix the tire afterward . " The men were only too willing to obey . As with brightened faces they took their seats in the car , Stephen smiled with affection at his mother . " Well , Mater , Watt was not the only person who lived to see himself appreciated ; and I do n't believe people were any more grateful to him for his steam engine than we are to you right now for this luncheon . You are the best mother I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIRST RAILROAD The new tire went on with unexpected ease and early afternoon saw the Tolmans once more bowling along the highway toward Northampton . The valley of the Connecticut was decked with harvest products as for an autumnal pageant . Stacks of corn dotted the fields and pyramids of golden pumpkins and scarlet apples made gay the verandas of the old homesteads or brightened the doorways of the great red barns flanking them . " All that is needed to transform the scene into a giant Hallowe'en festival is to have a witch whisk by on a broomstick , or a ghost bob up from behind a tombstone , " declared Mrs. Tolman . " Just think ! If we had come by train we would have missed all this beauty . " " I see plainly that you do not appreciate the railroads , my dear , " returned her husband mischievously . " This is the second time to-day that you have slandered them . You sound like the early American traveler who asserted that it was ridiculous to build railroads which did very uncomfortably in two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten . " " Why , I should have thought people who had never heard of motor-cars would have welcomed the quicker transportation the railroads offered , " was Mrs. Tolman 's reply . " One would have thought so , " answered Mr. Tolman . " Still , when we recall how primitive the first railroads were , the prejudice against them is not to be wondered at . " " How did they differ from those we have now , Dad ? " Doris asked . " In almost every way , " answered her father , with a smile . " You see at the time Stephenson invented his steam locomotive nothing was known of this novel method of travel . As I told you , persons were accustomed to make journeys either by coach or canal . Then the steam engine was invented and immediately the notion that this power might be applied to transportation took possession of the minds of people in different parts of England . As a result , first one and then another made a crude locomotive and tried it out without scruple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses but terrified the passers-by . Many an amusing story is told of the adventures of these amateur locomotives . A machinist named Murdock , who was one of James Watt 's assistants , built a sort of grasshopper engine with very long piston rods and with legs at the back to help push it along ; with this odd contrivance he ventured out into the road one night just at twilight . Unfortunately , however , his restless toy started off before he was ready to have it , and turning down an unfrequented lane encountered a timid clergyman who was taking a peaceful stroll and frightened the old gentleman almost out of his wits . The poor man had never seen a locomotive before and when the steaming object with its glowing furnace and its host of moving arms and legs came puffing toward him through the dusk he was overwhelmed with terror and screamed loudly for help . " A laugh arose from the listeners . " And that is but one of the many droll experiences of the first locomotive makers , " continued Mr. Tolman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also built a small steam locomotive which he took out on the road for a trial trip . It chanced that during the experimental journey he and his fireman came to a tollgate and puffing up to the keeper with the baby steam engine , they asked what the fee would be for it to pass . Now the gate keeper , like the minister , had had no acquaintance with locomotives , and on seeing the panting red object looming like a specter out of the darkness and hearing a man 's voice intermingled with its gasps and snorts , he shouted with chattering teeth : " There is nothing to pay , my dear Mr. Devil ! Just d-r-i-v-e along as **27;4187;TOOLONG . " His hearers applauded the story . " Who did finally invent the railroad ? " inquired Doris after the merriment had subsided . " George Stephenson , an Englishman , " replied her father . " For some time he had been experimenting with steam locomotives at the Newcastle coal mines where some agency stronger than mules or horses was needed to carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of transporting people when he began to work out the suggestion . All he thought of was a coal train which would run on short lengths of track from mine to mine . But the notion assumed unexpected proportions until the Darlington road , the most ambitious of his projects , reached the astonishing distance of thirty-seven miles . When the rails for it were laid the engineer intended it should be used merely for coal transportation , as its predecessors had been ; but some of the miners who lived along the route and were daily obliged to go back and forth to work begged that some sort of a conveyance be made that could also run along the track and enable them to ride to work instead of walking . So a little log house not unlike a log cabin , with a table in the middle and some chairs around it , was mounted on a cart that fitted the rails , and a horse was harnessed to the unique vehicle . " " And it was this log cabin on wheels that gave Stephenson his inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " nodded her father . " When the engineer saw the crude object the first question that came to him was why could not a steam locomotive propel cars filled with people as well as cars filled with coal . Accordingly he set to work and had several coach bodies mounted on trucks , installing a lever brake at the front of each one beside the coachman 's box . In front of the grotesque procession he placed a steam locomotive and when he had fastened the coaches together he had the first passenger train ever seen . " " It must have been a funny looking thing ! " Steve exclaimed , smiling with amusement at the picture the words suggested . " It certainly was , " agreed his father . " If you really wish to know how funny , some time look up the prints of this great-great-grandfather of our present-day Pullman and you will be well repaid for your trouble ; the contrast is laughable . " " But was this absurd venture a success ? " queried Mrs. Tolman incredulously . " Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , Stephenson , like Watt , was one of the few world benefactors whose gift to humanity was instantly hailed with appreciation . The railroad was , to be sure , a wretched little affair when viewed from our modern standpoint , for there were no gates at the crossings , no signals , springless cars , and every imaginable discomfort . Fortunately , however , our ancestors had not grown up amid the luxuries of this era , and being of rugged stock that was well accustomed to hardships of every variety they pronounced the invention a marvel , which in truth it was . " You 've said it ! " chuckled Steve in the slang of the day . " In the meantime , " went on Mr. Tolman , " conditions all over England were becoming more and more congested , and from every direction a clamor arose for a remedy . You see the invention of steam spinning machinery had greatly increased the output of the Manchester cotton mills until there was no such thing as getting such a vast bulk of merchandise to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to be transported to Liverpool not only overflowed the warehouses but were even stacked in the open streets where they were at the mercy of robbers and storms . The canals had all the business they could handle , and as is always the result in such cases their owners became arrogant under their prosperity and raised their prices , making not the slightest attempt to help the public out of its dilemma . Undoubtedly something had to be done and in desperation a committee from Parliament sent for Stephenson that they might discuss with him the feasibility of building a railroad from Manchester to Liverpool . The committee had no great faith in the enterprise . Most of its members did not believe that a railroad of any sort was practical or that it could ever attain speed enough to be of service . However , it was a possibility , and as they did not know which way to turn to quiet the exasperated populace they felt they might as well investigate this remedy . It could do no harm . " Mr. Tolman paused as he stooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephenson came before the board , and one question after another was hurled at him . When , however , he was asked , half in ridicule , whether or not his locomotive could make thirty miles an hour and he answered in the affirmative , a shout of derision arose from the Parliament members . Nobody believed such a miracle possible . Nevertheless , in spite of their sceptical attitude , it was finally decided to build the Liverpool-Manchester road and about a year before its opening a date was set for a contest of locomotives to compete for the five-hundred-pound prize offered by the directors of the road . " " I suppose ever so many engines entered the lists , " ventured Steve with interest . " There were four , " returned his father . " And Stephenson drove one of them ? " " Yes . " " Oh , I hope it got the prize ! " put in Doris eagerly . Her father smiled at her earnestness . " It did , " was his reply . " Stephenson 's engine was called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive he had used at the mines , for this one had not only a steam blast but a multi-tubular boiler , a tremendous advance in engine building . " " I suppose that the winner of the prize not only got the money the road offered but his engine was the one chosen as a pattern for those to be used on the new railroad , " ventured Stephen . " Precisely . So you see a great deal depended on the showing each locomotive made . Unluckily in the excitement a tinder box had been forgotten , and when it came time to start , the spark to light the fires had to be obtained from a reading glass borrowed from one of the spectators . This , of course , caused some delay . But once the fires were blazing and steam up , the engines puffed away to the delight of those looking on . " " I am glad Stephenson was the winner , " put in Doris . " Yes , " agreed her father . " He had worked hard and deserved success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have stolen the fruit of his toil and brain . Yet notwithstanding this , his path to fame was not entirely smooth . Few persons win out without surmounting obstacles and Stephenson certainly had his share . Not only was he forced to fight continual opposition , but the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool road , which one might naturally have supposed would be a day of great triumph , was , in spite of its success , attended by a series of catastrophes . It was on September 15 , 1830 , that the ceremonies took place , and long before the hour set for the gaily decorated trains to pass the route was lined with excited spectators . The cities of Liverpool and Manchester also were thronged with those eager to see the engines start or reach their destination . There were , however , mingled with the crowd many persons who were opposed to the new venture . " " Opposed to it ? " Steve repeated with surprise . " Yes . It seems odd , does n't it ? " " But why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought that was the very thing they were all demanding . " " You must not forget the condition of affairs at the time , " said his father . " Remember the advent of steam machinery had deprived many of the cotton spinners of their jobs and in consequence they felt bitterly toward all steam inventions . Then in addition there were the stagecoach drivers who foresaw that if the railroads supplanted coaches they would no longer be needed . Moreover innkeepers were afraid that a termination of stage travel would lessen their trade . " " Each man had his own axe to grind , eh ? " smiled Steve . " I 'm afraid so , " his father answered . " Human nature is very selfish , and then as now men who worked for the general welfare regardless of their own petty preferences were rare . To the side of the enemies of the infant invention flocked every one with a grievance . The gentry argued that the installation of locomotives would frighten the game out of the country and ruin the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not only kill the birds but in time kill the patrons of the railroads as well . Still others protested that the sparks from the funnels might set fire to the fields of grain or to the forests . A swarm of added opponents dwelt on the fact that the passengers would be made ill by the lurching of the trains ; that the rapid inrush of air would prevent their breathing ; and that every sort of people would be herded together without regard to class ,  - -  the latter a very terrible calamity in a land where democracy was unknown . Even such intelligent men as the poet Wordsworth and the famous writer Ruskin came out hotly against the innovation , seeing in it nothing but evil . " " Did n't the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railroad convince the kickers they were wrong ? " asked Steve . " Unfortunately not , " was Mr. Tolman 's reply . " You see several unlucky incidents marred the complete success of the occasion . As the trains trimmed with bunting and flowers started out the scene seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music ; on another the directors of the road ; and on still another rode the Duke of Wellington , who at that time was Prime Minister of England and had come down from London with various other dignitaries to honor the enterprise . Church bells rang , cannon boomed , and horns and whistles raised a din of rejoicing . But everywhere among the throng moved a large group of unemployed laborers who had returned from the Napoleonic wars in a discontented frame of mind and resented the use of steam machinery . They were on edge for trouble and if there were none they were ready to make it . So strong was the resentment of this element against the government that it seemed tempting Providence for the Prime Minister to venture into the manufacturing district of Manchester . At first it was decided that he would better omit the trip altogether ; but on second thought it seemed wiser for him not to add fuel to the flames by disappointing the mill workers . The audience was in too ugly a mood to be angered . Therefore Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the open cars . " " I hope nothing happened to him , Dad ! " gasped Doris breathlessly . " Nothing beyond a good many minor insults and indignities , " responded her father . " He was , however , in constant peril , and to those who bore the responsibility of the function he was a source of unceasing anxiety . But in spite of the jeers of the mob , their crowding and pushing about his car , he kept a smiling face like the true gentleman he was . Some of the rougher element even went so far as to hurl missiles at him . You can imagine how worried his friends were for his safety and how the directors who had invited him fidgeted . And as if this worry were not enough , by and by a fine rain began to fall and those persons riding in the open coaches , as well as the decorations and the spectators , got well drenched . Then there were delays on the turnouts while one train passed another ; and as a climax to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Liverpool , got in the path of an approaching engine , became confused and was run over ; and although Stephenson himself carried him by train to Liverpool he died that evening . " " I should call the fete to introduce the steam engine into England a most disastrous and forlorn one , " remarked Mrs. Tolman . " Well , in reality it was not such a failure as it sounds , " replied her husband , " for only those most closely connected with it sensed the misfortunes that attended it . The greater part of the people along the route were good-humored and pleased ; they marveled at the trains as they passed , cheered the Duke and the authorities with him , listened with delight to the band , and made a jest of the rain . A holiday crowd , you know , is usually quite patient . Hence the delays that fretted the guests and the officials of the road did not annoy the multitudes so vitally . " " Poor Stephenson really got some satisfaction out of the day then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said her husband . " Although I fancy the death of Mr. Hickson must have overshadowed his rejoicings . Notwithstanding this , however , the railroad proved itself a practical venture , which was the main thing . Such slight obstacles as the terror of the horses and the fact that the tunnels into Liverpool were so low that the engines had to be detached and the trains hauled into the yards by mules could be remedied . " A flicker of humor danced in Mr. Tolman 's eyes . " And did England begin to build railroads right away ? " Steve inquired . " Yes , and not only England but France also . Frenchmen who crossed the Channel took home glowing accounts of the novel invention and immediately the French Government realized that that country must also have railroads . But just as the conservative element in England had been sceptical and blocked Stephenson 's progress -- or tried to -- so a corresponding faction in France did all it could to cry down the enterprise . Even those who upheld the introduction of the roads advocated them for only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they labeled as an absurdity . Iron was too expensive , they argued ; furthermore the mountains of the country rendered extensive railroading impossible . France did not need railroads anyway . Nevertheless the little group of seers who favored the invention persisted and there was no stopping the march of which they were the heralds . Railroads had come to stay and they stayed . " " It was a fortunate thing they did , was n't it ? " murmured Doris . " A very fortunate thing , " returned Mr. Tolman heartily . " Every great invention is usually suggested by a great need and so it was with this one . By 1836 the craze for railroad building swept both hemispheres . In England the construction of lines to most out-of-the-way and undesirable places were proposed , and the wildest schemes for propelling trains suggested ; some visionaries even tried sails as a medium of locomotion instead of steam . Rich and poor rushed to invest their savings in railroads and alas , in many cases the misguided enthusiasts lost every shilling of their money in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined , and thousands of workmen were thrown out of employment . In consequence a reaction followed and it was years before wary investors could again be induced to finance a railroad . In the interim both engines and coaches underwent improvement , especially the third-class carriage which in the early days was nothing more than an open freight car and exposed its unhappy patrons to snow , rain , and freezing weather . " " Great Scott ! " cried Steve . " I should say there was room for improvement if that was the case . " " There was indeed , " echoed his father . " In fact , it was a long time before travel by train became a pleasure . Most of the engines used pitch pine or soft coal as a fuel and as there were no guards on the smokestacks to prevent it , the smoke , soot , and cinders used to blow back from the funnels and shower the passengers . On the first railroad trip from New York to Albany those sitting outside the coaches were compelled to put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine it ! " burst out Doris , with a rippling laugh . " Nor were the umbrellas of any service for long , " continued Mr. Tolman , " for the sparks soon burned their coverings until nothing but the steel ribs remained . " " I do n't wonder the trip was not a pleasure , " smiled Mrs. Tolman . " Yet , in spite of its discomfort , it was a novelty and you must not forget that , as I said before , the public of that period was a simple and less exacting one than is the public of to-day . We make a frightful fuss if we are jolted , chilled , crowded , delayed , or made uncomfortable ; but our forefathers were a hale and hearty lot -- less overworked perhaps , less nervous certainly , less indulged . They had never known anything better than cold houses , draughty and crowded stagecoaches , and stony highways -- plenty of obstacles , you see , and few luxuries . Therefore with naive delight they welcomed one new invention after another , overlooking its defects and considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , who are a thousand per cent better off than they , do more grumbling over the tiny flaws in the mechanism of our lives than they did over the mammoth ones . " " Oh , come , Dad ! " protested Stephen . " Are n't you putting it rather strong ? " " Not a whit too strong , Steve , " Mrs. Tolman interrupted . " I believe we are a fussy , pampered , ungrateful generation . It is rather pathetic , too , to think it is we who now reap the benefits of all those perfected ideas which our ancestors enjoyed only in their most primitive beginnings . It seems hardly fair that Stephenson , for example , should never have seen a modern Pullman . " He was spared something , was n't he , Dad ? " chuckled Steve mischievously . But Mr. Tolman did not heed the remark . " He had the vision , " returned he softly , " the joy of seeing the marvel for the first time , imperfect as it was . Perhaps that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember it is no mean privilege to stand upon the peak in Darien which Keats pictures . " CHAPTER V STEVE LEARNS A SAD LESSON No more disasters attended the journey and the travelers spun swiftly on to Northampton , arriving at the old New England town late in the afternoon . What a scene of activity the college campus presented ! Bevies of girls , hatless and in gay-colored sweaters , drifted hither and thither , their laughter floating through the twilight with musical clearness . Occasionally some newcomer would join a group and a shout of welcome would hail her advent . Although Steve turned away from these gushing greetings with masculine scorn nevertheless he was far more interested in the novel picture than he would have been willing to admit . More than once he caught his eyes following a slender figure in white , across whose hair the sunset slanted , turning its blowing masses to a glory of gold . With what ease and freedom the girl moved ! And when , as she passed , some one unceremoniously tossed her a ball and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won . Steve speculated as to whether she would prove to be as pretty at close range as she was at a distance and decided not . Distance always brings a glamor with it . However , pretty or not , there was no disputing that she was a great favorite for every circle of students opened its magic ring at her approach and greeted her with a noisy clamor of affection . That she held herself with quiet reserve and was less demonstrative than those about her did not appear to lessen in the least their regard for her , and as Stephen watched he registered the wager that she was a person of more common sense than most girls . Until recently it had been his habit to condemn the entire sex ; but of late he had discovered that exceptions might be made to his rule . There were girls in the world worth noticing , even some worth talking to ; and he felt certain that this attractive creature in white was one of them . However , it was an absurdity to be thinking about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime , when he could do so in casual fashion , to find out from Doris who she was . He had a curiosity to know what this person who looked as if she could row a boat , swim , and play tennis well , was called . Doris was always raving about her roommate , Jane Harden . She had said so much about her that he fairly detested the sound of her name . Now if only Jane Harden were a girl like this one , there would be some reason and excuse for being enthusiastic over her . To have this guest brought home to spend the Christmas holidays would be a pleasure to look forward to . How well she would skate and how gracefully ; and how pretty she would be , especially if she had her hat off as she had now ! It was Doris who interrupted his reverie with the words : " I hate to have you dear people go but I suppose you will have to . But do just wait long enough for me to see if I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family and will scold me to death if I let you get away . " " I am afraid we ca n't stay but a moment or two , dear , " objected Mrs. Tolman . " It is growing late , you know , and we must get to the hotel before it is too dark . " " But I wo n't delay you a second , Mother -- truly , I wo n't . I do want you to meet Jane . I 'll ask the girls if they have seen her anywhere . " " If you get out into that mob they 'll fall all over you and you 'll never get back , " growled Steve , who was beginning to feel hungry and was none too graciously inclined toward the prospective stranger . " Oh , yes , I will , " laughed Doris as she darted away . In spite of this sanguine prediction , however , she did not return as promptly as she had promised , and Mr. Tolman began to fidget uneasily . " We really ought to be starting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child ? " " I knew she 'd stop to admire everybody 's new hat and talk over the whole summer , " grumbled Steve scornfully . " You are thinking of your dinner , son , " his mother put in playfully . " You bet I am ! I 'm hungry as a bear . " A pause followed in which visions of a big beefsteak with crisply fried potatoes blotted out every other picture from Steve 's mind . " Perhaps we ought not to have waited , " he heard his mother murmur . " But I had not the heart to disappoint Doris . She is so fond of Jane and has talked so much about her ! I had no idea it would take her so long to --  " " Here she comes ! " Mr. Tolman broke in . Stephen glanced up . Yes , there was Doris hurrying across the grass and beside her , walking with the same free and buoyant swing , was the girl of the golden hair ,  - -  Jane Harden . With the same reserve and yet without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hurried introductions extended her hand with a grave smile of welcome ; but both smile and gesture carried with them a sincerity very appealing . When she greeted Steve he flushed at being addressed as Mr. Tolman and mentally rose six inches in his boots . Yes , she was decidedly pretty , far prettier than she had been in the distance even . In all his life he had never seen a more attractive girl . " I hope , Jane , that you are coming home with Doris for a visit sometime when your own family can spare you , " he heard his mother say . " We all should like to have you . " " And I should like to come , " was the simple and direct answer . " Do plan on it then . Come any time that you can arrange to . We should very much enjoy having you , should n't we , Stephen ? " Stephen , so suddenly appealed to , turned very red and answered " Yes " in a tone that seemed to come gruffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of hasty farewells the car started and shot out into the village street and the campus with its rainbow-hued occupants was lost to sight . " A charming girl , is n't she ? " Mrs. Tolman said to her husband . " So natural and unaffected ! Doris says that she is quite the idol of the college and bids fair to be class president . I wish Doris would bring her home for the holidays . " Inwardly Steve echoed the sentiment but outwardly he preserved silence . He was too human a boy to dwell long on thoughts of any girl and soon Jane Harden was quite forgotten in the satisfaction of a steaming dinner and a comfortable bed , and the fairy journey of the next day when amid a splendor of crimson and gold the glories of Jacob 's Ladder and the Mohawk Trail stretched before his eyes . Within the week the big red car headed for Coventry and without a mishap rolled into the familiar main street of the town which never had seemed dearer than after the interval of absence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalks and hands were waved in greeting . Presently his mother called from the tonneau : " Is n't that the Taylors ' car , Henry , coming toward us ? If it is do stop , for I want to speak to them . " Mr. Tolman nodded and slowed down the engine , at the same time putting out his hand to bring the on-coming car to a standstill . Yes , there were the Taylors , and on the front seat beside the chauffeur sat " But , " the friend who had been most influential in coaxing Stephen into the dilemma of the past fortnight . It was Bud , Steve could not forget , who had been the first to drop out of the car when trouble had befallen and who had led the other boys off on foot with him to Torrington . The memory of his chum 's treacherous conduct still rankled in Steve 's mind . He had not spoken to him since . But now here the two boys were face to face and unless they were to betray to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a semblance of cordiality . The question was which of them should be the first to make the advance . Twice Bud cleared his throat and appeared to be on the verge of uttering a greeting when he encountered Stephen 's scowl and lost courage to call the customary : " Ah , there , Stevie ! " And Stephen , feeling that right was on his side and being too proud to open the conversation , could not bring himself to say : " Hi , Bud ! " as he always did . As a result the schoolmates simply glared at each other . Fortunately their elders were too much occupied with friendly gossip to notice them and it was not until the talk shifted abruptly into a channel that appalled both boys that their glance met with the sympathy of common danger . It was Bud 's mother from whose lips the terrifying words innocently fell . " Havens ill and you in New York Wednesday ! " she exclaimed incredulously . " But I certainly thought I saw your car turning into the gate that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " asserted Mrs. Tolman tranquilly . " The car has not been out of the garage until now . It must have been somebody else you saw . " " But it was your car -- I am certain of it , " persisted Mrs. Taylor . " Nonsense , Mary ! " laughed her husband . " If the car has been in the garage for a week how could it have been . You probably dreamed it . You want a big red car so much yourself that you see them in your sleep . " " No , I do n't , " protested Mrs. Taylor smiling good-humoredly at her husband 's banter . " Well , it may have been the Woodworths ' , " Mrs. Tolman said with soothing inspiration . " They have a car like ours and Mrs. Woodworth came to call while I was away . I 'll ask the maid when I get home . " " Y-e-s , it may have been the Woodworths ' , " admitted Mrs. Taylor reluctantly . It was plain , however , that she was unconvinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was your car and Steve driving it , " she added carelessly . " Steve ! " Mr. Tolman ejaculated . " Oh , Steve never drives the car , " put in Mrs. Tolman quickly . " He is not old enough to have a license yet , you know . That proves absolutely that you were mistaken . But Stephen has run the car now and then when Havens or his father were with him and he does very well at it . Some day he will be driving it alone , wo n't you , son ? " Bending forward she patted the boy 's shoulder affectionately . For an instant it seemed to Stephen as if every one in both cars must have heard the pound , pound , pound of his heart , as if everybody from Coventry to Torrington must have heard it . Helplessly he stared at Bud and Bud stared back . No words were needed to assure the two that once again they were linked together by misdoing as they often had been in the past . Bud looked anxiously toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in his homely , freckled face there was a winsome manliness . Whatever the scrapes he got into through sheer love of fun it was characteristic of him that he was always courageous enough to confess to them . This was the first inkling he had had that Stephen had not acquainted his father with the escapade of the previous week and such a course was so at variance with his own frank nature that he was aghast . Even now he waited , expecting his pal would offer the true explanation of the mystery under discussion . He was ready to bear his share of the blame ,  - -  bear more than belonged to him if he could lighten Steve 's sentence of punishment . But the silence remained unbroken and the words he expected to hear did not come . A wave of surprise swept over his face , surprise followed by a growing scorn . It came to him in a flash that Stephen Tolman , the boy he had looked up to as a sort of idol , was a coward , a coward ! He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in the thick of the football skirmishes , never shrinking from the roughness of the game ; he was a fearless hockey player , a dauntless fighter . Coward was the last name one would have thought of applying to him . And yet here he sat cowering before the just result of his conduct . Bud was disappointed , ashamed ; he turned away his head but not before the wretched lad who confronted him had caught in his glance the same contemptuous expression he had seen in O'Malley 's face . Again Stephen was despised and knew it . Nevertheless it would not do to betray his secret now . He must not show that he was disconcerted . At every cost he must brazen out the affair . He had gone too far to do otherwise . He wondered as he sat there if any one suspected him ; if his father , whose eye was as keen as that of an eagle , had put together any of the threads of evidence . He might be cherishing suspicions this very moment . It seemed impossible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it over ! Anything would be better than this suspense and uncertainty . Mr. Tolman , however , maintained unwonted stillness and save for a restless twitching of his fingers on the wheel of the car did not move . If , thought Steve miserably , he could summon the nerve to look up , he would know in a second from his father 's face whether he was annoyed or angry . At last the situation became unbearable and come what might he raised his eyes . To his amazement his father was sitting there quite serenely and so was everybody else , and the pause that seemed to him to stretch into hours had glided off as harmlessly and as naturally as other pauses . Apparently nobody was thinking about him , at least nobody but Bud . With a sigh of relief his tense muscles relaxed . He could trust Bud not to betray him . Once again he was safe ! CHAPTER VI MR . TOLMAN 'S SECOND YARN For a day or two it seemed to Stephen that he would never cease to be haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big red touring car , or forget the good resolutions he made in consequence ; but within an incredibly short time both considerations were thrust into the background by the rush of life 's busy current . School and athletics kept him occupied so that he had little leisure for thought , and when he was in the house his father and mother smiled on him as affectionately as before , which did much to restore to him his normal poise . Long ago the boys had dropped the motor-car episode from their memories and even Bud Taylor did not refer to it when he and Steve came together to organize the hockey team for the approaching matches . In the meantime the Thanksgiving holidays were drawing near and Mr. Tolman suggested that he and Stephen should run over to New York for a short visit . With the prospect of so much pleasure was it strange the boy ceased to dwell on the unhappiness of the past or the possibility of disaster in the future ? The coming journey to New York was , to be sure , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on business excursions ; nevertheless such an outing was a treat to which he looked forward as a sort of Arabian Nights adventure when for a short time he stayed at a large hotel , ate whatever food pleased his fancy , and went sight-seeing and to innumerable " shows " with his father . He was wont to return to Coventry after the holiday with a throng of happy memories and many a tale of marvels with which to entertain the boys . Therefore when he and his father boarded the express Thanksgiving week the lad was in the highest spirits . " Motor-cars are all very well , " observed Mr. Tolman , as the porter stowed their luggage away , " but on a cold night like this a Pullman car on a well-laid track is not to be despised . Eh , son ? " " I do n't believe that I should want to travel to New York in a touring-car at this time of year , " agreed Stephen , smiling . " It is getting too late in the season to use an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have delayed putting the car up because I have been hoping we might have a little more warm weather ; but I guess the warm days have gone and the winter has come to stay now . " " But there is no snow yet , Dad . " " No . Still it is too chilly to drive with any comfort . The Taylors shipped their car off last week and when I get home I shall do the same . " Stephen looked disappointed . " I do n't mind the cold when I 'm wrapped up , " he ventured . " You are not at the wheel , son , " was his father 's quick retort . " The man who is has his fingers nipped roundly , I can assure you . It is a pity we have become so soft and shrink so from discomfort . Think what our forbears endured when they went on journeys ! " " Neither the English stagecoaches nor Stephenson 's railroad could have been very comfortable , to judge from your descriptions of them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blame on the English , " his father replied . " Our own modes of travel in the early days were quite as bad as were those on the other side of the water . " " I wish you would tell me about the first American railroads , " said the boy . " I was wondering about them the other night . " Mr. Tolman settled back in his seat thoughtfully . " America , " he answered presently , " went through a pioneer period of railroading not unlike England 's . Many strange steam inventions were tried in different parts of the country , and many fantastic scientific notions put before the public . Even previous to Watt 's steam engine Oliver Evans had astonished the quiet old city of Philadelphia by driving through its peaceful streets in a queer steam vehicle , half carriage and half boat , which he had mounted on wheels . Evans was an ingenious fellow , a born inventor if ever there was one , who worked out quite a few steam devices , some of which Watt later improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York got interested in the steam idea and urged the commissioners of his state to build a railroad between Lake Erie and Albany , suggesting that a steam engine not unlike the one that propelled the Hudson River ferryboats could be used as power for the trains . He was enthusiastic over the scheme but the New York officials had no faith in the proposition , insisting that a steam locomotive could never be produced that would grip the rails with sufficient tension to keep cars on the track or draw a heavy load . " " They 'd better have given the plan a showdown , " interrupted Steve grimly . " No doubt that is true , " admitted his father . " However , it is very easy for us , with our knowledge of science , to look back and laugh at their mistakes . The world was very new in those days and probably had we lived at that time and been equally ignorant of railroads and engines we should have been just as cautious and unbelieving . The railroad was still a young invention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather mad , uncertain enterprise . " " When was the first American railroad built ? " inquired the lad . " If by a railroad you mean something which moved along rails like a tram-car , the first such road was built at Quincy , Mass. , in 1826 ; but it was not a steam railroad . It was merely a train of cars drawn by horses along a track that spanned a series of stone ties . Nor was it very extensive in length . In fact , it was only three miles long and probably would not have been built at all if the question had not arisen as to how the heavy blocks of granite necessary for the construction of Bunker Hill monument were to be carried from the quarries to the Neponset River , the point from which they were to be shipped to Charlestown . Bryant , the builder of the road , had heard of Stephenson 's successful use of tracks at the Newcastle coal mines and saw no reason why a road of similar pattern could not be laid from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be worked out , he argued , it would be a great saving of time and labor . Accordingly the railroad was built at a cost of more than ten thousand dollars a mile and it unquestionably performed the service required of it even if it did necessitate the expenditure of a good deal of money . Since the grade sloped toward the river the heavily loaded cars moved down the tracks very easily and as they were empty on their return the ascent was made with equal ease . All the year round this quaint railroad was in constant use , a snowplow being attached to the front car in winter to clear the deep snow from the tracks . " " I suppose that was the first railroad snowplow , too , " observed Stephen . " I suppose it was , " his father agreed . " For some time afterward this old road with its granite ties was the model from which American engineers took their inspiration , it being many years before railroad builders realized that wooden ties were more flexible and made a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more railroads like the Quincy road built in America ? " questioned Steve . " Yes , a railroad very much like it was built in the Pennsylvania mining country to transport coal from the mines at Summit down to the Lehigh Valley for shipment . An amusing story is told of this railroad , too . It extended down the mountainside in a series of sharp inclines between which lay long stretches of level ground . Now you know when you coast downhill your speed will give you sufficient impetus to carry you quite a way on a flat road before you come to a stop . So it was with this railroad . But the force the cars gained on the hillside could not carry them entirely across these long levels , and therefore platform cars were built on which a number of mules could be transported and later harnessed to the cars to pull them across the flat stretches . At the end of each level the mules would be taken aboard again and carried down to the next one , where they were once more harnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chagrin of the railroad people the mules soon grew to enjoy riding so much that they had no mind to get out and walk when the level places were reached and it became almost impossible to make them . All of which proves the theory I advanced before -- that too much luxury is not good for any of us and will even spoil a perfectly good mule . " Steve chuckled in response . " I 'm afraid with railroads like these America did not make much progress , " he said . " No very rapid strides , " owned his father . " Nevertheless men were constantly hammering away at the railroad idea . In out-of-the-way corners of the country were many persons who had faith that somehow , they knew not how , the railroad would in time become a practical agency of locomotion . When the Rainhill contest of engines took place in England before the opening of the Liverpool-Manchester road , and Stephenson carried off the prize , Horatio Allen , one of the engineers of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company , was sent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new railroad they hoped to put into operation . Unluckily none of the engines were for sale but he was able to purchase at Stourbridge a steam locomotive and this he shipped to New York . It reached there in 1829 -- a ridiculous little engine weighing only seven tons . Before its arrival a track of hemlock rails fastened to hemlock ties had been laid and as the Lackawanna River lay directly in the path of the proposed road a wooden trestle about a hundred feet high had been built across the river . This trestle was of very frail construction and calculated to sustain only a four-ton engine and therefore when the seven-ton locomotive from Stourbridge arrived and was found to weigh nearly double that specification there was great consternation . " " Did they tear the trestle down and build another ? " asked Steve with much interest . Mr. Tolman did not heed the question . " Now in addition to the disconcerting size of the engine , " he continued , " the wooden rails which had been laid during the previous season had warped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So altogether the prospect of trying out the enterprise , on which a good deal of money had already been spent , was not alone disheartening but perilous . " " The inspectors or somebody else would have put an end to such a crazy scheme jolly quick if it had been in our day , would n't they ? " grinned the boy . " Yes , nobody could get very far with anything so unsafe now , " his father responded . " But all this happened before the era of inspectors , construction laws , or the Safety First slogan . Hence no one interfered with Horatio Allen . If he chose to break his neck and the necks of many others as well he was free to do so . Therefore , nothing daunted , he got up steam in his baby engine , which was the more absurd for having painted at its front a fierce red lion , and off he started -- along his hemlock railroad . The frail bridge swayed and bent as the locomotive rumbled over it but by sheer miracle it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged to the bottom of the river . " Steve drew a long breath of relief . " Did they go on using the railroad after that ? " he asked . His father shook his head . " No , " he replied . " Although every one agreed that the demonstration was a success the wooden rails were not durable enough to last long and the company was not rich enough to replace them with metal ones . Therefore , in spite of Allen 's pleas and his wonderful exhibition of courage , the road fell into disuse , the engine was taken apart , and the enterprise abandoned . " " What a pity ! " " Yes , it was , for had New York persevered in this undertaking the railroad might have made its advent in the United States much sooner than it did . As it was , once again , like a meteor , the experiment flashed into sight and disappeared with success well within reach . " " And who was the next promoter ? " " Peter Cooper was the next experimenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his adventure with railroading was entertaining , too . He lived in Baltimore and being of a commercial trend of mind he decided that if a railroad could be built through the Potomac Valley and across the Alleghany Mountains it might win back for his state the trade that was rapidly being snatched away by the Erie and Pennsylvania Canal . With this idea in mind Cooper built thirteen miles of track and after experimenting with a sort of tram-car and finding it a failure he had a car made that should be propelled by sails . " " Sails ! " gasped Steve . His father smiled at his astonishment . " Yes , sails ! " he repeated . " Into this strangely equipped vehicle he invited some of the editors of the Baltimore papers , and little sensing what was before them the party set forth on its excursion . " " Did the car go ? " " Oh , it went all right ! " chuckled Mr. Tolman . " The trouble was not with its going . The difficulty was that as it flew along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she did not move out of the way of the approaching car she and the railroad pioneers came into collision . With a crash the car toppled over and the editors , together with the enraged Peter Cooper , were thrown out into the mud . Of course the affair caused the public no end of laughter but to Cooper and his guests it proved convincingly that sails were not a desirable substitute for steam power . " " I suppose Cooper then went to work to build some other kind of a railroad , " mused Steve . " That is exactly what he did , " was the rejoinder . " He did not , however , do this deliberately but rather fell into a dilemma that left him no other choice . You see a group of men coaxed him to buy some land through which it was expected the new Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was to pass . These prospectors figured that as the road was already started and a portion of the wooden track laid the railroad was a sure thing , and by selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn quite a fortune for themselves . In all good faith Cooper had joined the company and then , after discovering that the railroad men had apparently abandoned their plan to build , in dastardly fashion , one after another of the promoters wriggled out of the enterprise and left poor Peter Cooper with a large part of his money tied up in a worthless , partially constructed railroad . " " What a rotten trick ! " cried Steve . " Yes ; and yet perhaps Cooper deserved a little chastisement , " smiled Mr. Tolman . " Instead of making money out of other people as he had intended --  " " He got stung himself ! " burst out the boy . " Practically so , yes , " was the reply . " Well , at any rate , there he was and if he was ever to get back any of his fortune he must demonstrate that he had profound faith in the partly constructed railroad . Accordingly he bought a small engine weighing about a ton --  " " One ton ! " " So small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He now had his wooden rails and his pygmy engine but was confronted by still another perplexity . The railroad must pass a very abrupt curve , it was unavoidable that it should do so -- a curve so dangerous that everybody who saw it predicted that to round it without the engine jumping the track and derailing the cars behind would be impossible . Poor Peter Cooper faced a very discouraging problem . There was no gainsaying that the curve was a bad one ; moreover , his locomotive was not so perfect a product as he might have wished . It had been built under his direction and consisted of the wee engine he had bought in New York connected with an iron boiler about the size of an ordinary tin wash boiler ; and as no iron piping was made in America at this time Cooper had taken some old steel musket barrels as a substitute for tubing . With this crude affair he was determined to convince the public that a steam railroad was a workable proposition . " " He had a nerve ! " " It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " returned Mr. Tolman . " In the first place few persons had fortunes large enough to back big undertakings ; and in addition America was still such a young country that it had not begun to produce the materials needed by inventors for furthering any very extensive projects . In fact the world of progress was , as Kipling says , ' very new and all . ' Hence human ingenuity had to make what was at hand answer the required purpose , and as a result Peter Cooper 's Tom Thumb engine , with its small iron boiler and its gun-barrel tubing , was set upon the wooden track , and an open car ( a sort of box on wheels with seats in it ) was fastened to it . Into this primitive conveyance the guests invited for the occasion clambered . Ahead lay the forbidding curve . Stephenson , the English engineer , had already stated mathematically the extreme figure at which a curve could be taken and the locomotive still remain on the track , and Peter Cooper was well aware that the curve he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never do for him to betray that he had any misgivings . Therefore , together with his guests , he set out on his eventful trip which was either to demolish them all , or convince the dignitaries of the railroad company that not only was a steam railroad practical but that the Baltimore and Ohio Road was a property valuable enough to be backed by capital . " Steve leaned forward , listening eagerly to the story . " Slowly the little engine started , and nearer and nearer came the terrible curve . The train was now running at fifteen miles an hour , a speed almost unbelievable to the simple souls of that time . Round the curve it went in safety , increasing its velocity to eighteen miles an hour . The railroad officials who were Cooper 's guests were frantic with enthusiasm . One man produced paper and pencil and begged those present to write their names , just to prove that it was possible to write even when flying along at such a meteoric rate of speed . Another man jotted down a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were things that could be done , in spite of the fact that one was dashing through space with this unearthly rapidity . " " So the railroad men were converted , were they ? " " They were more than converted ; they were exultant , " said his father . " Of course it was some time after this before the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad became a reality . Capital had to be raised and the project stably launched . " " Oh , then this was not the first railroad in the country , after all , " observed the boy in a disappointed tone . " No . South Carolina boasts the first regular passenger locomotive propelled by steam , " returned Mr. Tolman . " This road ran from Charleston to Hamburg and although a charter was obtained for it in 1827 it took all the first year to lay six miles of track . In fact it was not until 1830 that the railroad began to be operated to any extent . When it was , a locomotive , every part of which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains . This was the first steam locomotive of American make in history . It was dubbed ' The Best Friend ' and , like the engines that had preceded it , had a series of interesting adventures . Since it was the only locomotive in the possession of the road and was in use all day any repairs on the hard-worked object had to be made at night . " " Humph ! " ejaculated Stephen . " Nevertheless ' The Best Friend ' might have gone on its way prosperously had it not been for the ignorance of those who ran it . The engineer , to be sure , understood more or less about a steam locomotive although he was none too wise ; but the fireman , unfortunately , understood next to nothing , and one day , on being left alone in the cab and seeing the steam escaping from the safety valve , he conceived the notion that a leak was causing unnecessary waste . Therefore he securely screwed up the space through which the steam had been issuing , and to make prevention more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on the escape valve . " " And presto ! " exclaimed Steve , rubbing his hands . " Exactly so ! Presto , indeed ! Figuratively speaking , he blew sky-high and ' The Best Friend ' with him , " replied Mr. Tolman . " It was an unfortunate happening , too , for people were still ill-informed about the uses of steam and very nervous about its mysterious power and this accident only served to make them more so . For some time afterward many persons refused to patronize the railroad in spite of all the authorities could do to soothe them . In time , however , the public calmed down , although in order to reassure them it was found necessary to put a car heaped with bales of cotton between them and the engine , not only to conceal the monster from their view but also to convince them that it was some distance away . Whether they also had a vague notion that in case they went skyward the cotton might soften their fall when they came down , I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't it ? " Steve commented with amusement . " It certainly had , especially in our own country , " was the reply . " In England Stephenson and other experimenters like him had materials at hand which to some extent served their purpose ; moreover , thanks to Watt and other inventors , there were definite scientific ideas to work from . But in America the successful railroad which might serve as a model was unknown . Therefore for some time English engines continued to be shipped across the sea , and even then it was a long time before our American engineers understood much about their mechanism . Only by means of repeated experiments , first in one part of the country and then in another , did our American railroads , so marvelous in their construction , come into being . " Mr. Tolman paused a moment , yawned , and then rose and beckoned to the porter . " We still have much to perfect in our modern railroad , however , " he said with a touch of humor . " The sleeping car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are speedily to have proved to you . Here , porter ! We 'd like these berths made up . I guess we 'd better turn in now , son . You have had enough railroading for one day and are tired . You must get a rest and be in the pink of condition to-morrow for , remember , you are going to wake up in New York . " " If it will make to-morrow come any quicker I am quite ready to go to bed , " retorted Stephen , with a sleepy smile . CHAPTER VII A HOLIDAY JOURNEY The next morning , when Steve woke to the swaying of the train and a drowsy sense of confusion and smoke , he could not for an instant think where he was ; but it did not take long for him to open his eyes , recollect the happenings of the previous day , smile with satisfaction , and hurriedly wriggle into his clothes . Already he could hear his father stirring in the berth below and presently the elder man called : " We shall be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps packed up . How did you sleep ? " " Sound as a top ! " " That is fine ! I was afraid you might not rest very well . As I observed last night , a sleeping car is not all that it might be . The day will come when it will have to be improved . However , since it gets us to New York safely and economizes hours of day travel , it is a blessing for which we should be grateful . " As he spoke he moved into the aisle and helped the boy down from his perch ; they then sought out a distant seat where they dropped down and watched the rapidly passing landscape . " I have been thinking , as I was dressing , of the story you told me last night about our American railroads , " said the lad . " It surprised me a good deal to hear that the South took the lead over the North in the introduction of the steam locomotive . " Mr. Tolman smiled into the eager face . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroading for a short time the South did not remain long in the ascendency , " he answered , " for the third steam locomotive put into actual passenger service was built at Albany . This city , because of its geographical position , was a great stagecoach center , having lines that radiated from it into the interior in almost every direction . And not only was it an important coaching rendezvous but as it was also a leading commercial tributary of New York the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad had built a short track between Albany and Schenectady and supplied it with cars propelled by horse power . Now in 1831 the company decided to transform this road into a steam railroad and to this end ordered a steam locomotive called the ' DeWitt Clinton ' to be constructed at West Point with the aim of demonstrating to the northern States the advantages of steam transportation . You can imagine the excitement this announcement caused . Think , if you had never seen a steam engine , how eager you would be to behold the wonder . These olden time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route was only sixteen miles long the innovation was such a novel and tremendous one that all along the way crowds of spectators assembled to watch the passing of the magic train . At the starting point near the Hudson there was a dense throng of curious onlookers who gathered to see for the first time in all their lives the steam locomotive and its brigade of coaches , for in those days people never spoke of a train of cars ; a group of railroad carriages was always known as a brigade , and the term coach was , and in many cases still is applied to the cars . This train that created so much interest was practically like Stephenson 's English trains , being made up of a small locomotive , a tender , and two carriages constructed by fastening stagecoach bodies on top of railroad trucks . Stout iron chains held these vehicles together -- a primitive , and as it subsequently proved , a very impractical method of coupling . " " It must have been a funny enough train ! " Steve exclaimed . " I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his father returned , " for since the audience of that period had nothing with which to compare it , it probably seemed quite the ordinary thing . Was it not like the railroad trains used in England ? How was America to know anything different ? Yes , I am sure the ' DeWitt Clinton ' was considered a very grand affair indeed , even though it was only a small engine without a cab , and had barely enough platform for the engineer to stand upon while he drove the engine and fed the pitch-pine logs into the furnace . " " How many people did the train hold ? " inquired Steve , with growing curiosity . " Each coach carried six persons inside and two outside , " was Mr. Tolman 's reply , " and on this first eventful trip not quite enough adventurous souls could be found to fill the seats . Perhaps could the unwary passengers who did go have foreseen the discomforts ahead of them there would have been fewer yet . But often ignorance is bliss . It certainly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones took their places , the envied of many a beholder . " " What happened ? " asked the boy eagerly . " Was the trip a success ? " " That depends on what you mean by success , " laughed his father . " If you are asking whether the passengers arrived safely at Schenectady I can assure you that they did ; but if you wish to know whether the journey was a comfortable one , and likely to convert the stranger to steam travel , that is quite another matter . The description of the excursion which history has handed down to us is very naive . In the first place the pitch-pine fuel sent a smudge of smoke and cinders back over all the passengers and if it did not entirely choke them it at least encrusted them thickly with dirt , particularly the ones who sat outside . The umbrellas they opened to protect themselves were soon demolished , their coverings being blown away or burned up by the sparks . In fact , it was only by continual alertness that the clothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those inside the coaches fared little better , for as the coaches were without springs and the track was none too skilfully laid , the jolting of the cars all but sent the heads of the passengers through the roof of the coaches . Added to this the train proceeded in a series of jerks that wrenched the chains and banged one coach into another with such violence that those outside were in danger of being hurled down upon the track , and those inside were tossed hither and thither from seat to seat . You will easily comprehend that the outing was not one of unalloyed pleasure . " The boy laughed heartily . " Of course , " went on Mr. Tolman , " there was no help for anybody until the first stopping place was reached ; but when the engine slowed down and the grimy , almost unrecognizable pilgrims had a chance to catch their breath , something had to be done by way of a remedy . The remedy fortunately was near at hand and consisted of nothing very difficult . Some of the more enterprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-by fence and after stretching the coupling chains taut , they bound them to the wooden boards . In this way the coaches were kept apart and the silk hats of the dignitaries who had been invited to participate in the opening of the road rescued from total annihilation . " " I 'll bet everybody was glad to disembark at Schenectady , " declared Stephen . " I 'll wager they were ! They must have been exhausted from being jounced and jostled about . Nevertheless the novelty of the adventure probably brought its own compensations , and they were doubtless diverted from their woes by the sight of the cheering and envious spectators , the terrified horses , and the open-mouthed children that greeted them wherever they went . " " But the promoters could hardly expect the public to be very keen for a steam railroad after such an exhibition , " reflected Steve . " Fortunately our forefathers were not as critical as you , " said his father , " and in consequence the coach line from Albany to Schenectady was speedily supplanted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior of the State . As a result hundreds of broken-down coach horses were turned out to pasture , a merciful thing . Gradually a series of short steam railway lines were constructed from one end of the State to the other , until in 1851 these were joined together to make a continuous route to Lake Erie . Perhaps we have only scant appreciation of the revolution that came with this advance in transportation . It meant the beginning of travel and commerce between the eastern States and those in the interior of the country ; it also meant the speedy shipment of eastern products to the West , where they were greatly needed , and the reception of western commodities in the East . But more than all this , it signified a bond of fellowship between the scattered inhabitants of the same vast country who up to this time had been almost total strangers to one another , and was a mighty stride in the direction of national loyalty and sympathy . Therefore it was entirely seemly that Millard Fillmore , then President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be honored guests at the celebration that attended the opening of the railroad . " " Did the road reach no farther than Lake Erie ? " asked Stephen . " Not at first , " replied his father . " From that point commerce was carried on by means of ships on the Great Lakes . But in time western railroad companies began to build short stretches of track which later on they joined together as the other railroad builders had done . " " Did the line go all the way across the country ? " " Oh , no , indeed . Our trans-continental railroads were a mighty project in themselves and their story is a romance which I will tell you some other time . Before such stupendous enterprises could be realities , our young , young country had a vast deal of growing to do , and its infant railroads and engineering methods had to be greatly improved . So long as we still built roads where the rails were liable to come up through the floor and injure the passengers , and where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshets , our steam locomotion could not expect any universal degree of popularity . " " I do n't suppose , though , that the cows continued to tip the cars over and turn the passengers out into the dirt as they did in the days of Peter Cooper , " mused Steve thoughtfully . " They may not have derailed the trains , " his father replied quite seriously , " but they often did delay them . Nor could the passengers be blamed for finding fault with the unheated cars , or the fact that sometimes , when it snowed hard , the engineer ran his engine under cover and refused to go on , leaving those on the train the choice of staying where they were until the storm abated or going on foot to their destination . " " Not really ! " " Yes , indeed . Such things happened quite frequently . Then there are stories of terrible gales when the snow piled up on the track until the engine had to be dug out , for snow plows did not keep the tracks clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommon thing for the mud from the spring washouts to submerge the rails , in which case the engines had to be pulled out of the mire by oxen . In fact , at certain seasons of the year some trains carried oxen for this very purpose . For you must remember that the engines of that date were not powerful enough to make progress through mud , snow , or against fierce head winds . Often a strong gale would delay them for hours or bring them to a standstill altogether . " " Well , I guess it is no wonder we were not equipped to build a trans-continental road under such conditions , " said the lad , with a quiet smile . " Oh , these defects were only a minor part of our railroad tribulations , " responded his father . " For example , when Pennsylvania started her first railroad the year after the line between New York and Schenectady was laid , there was a fresh chapter of obstacles . Strangely enough , the locomotive , ' Old Ironsides , ' was built by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated as the founder of the Baldwin Locomotive Works . In 1832 , however , the Baldwin locomotive was quite a different product from the present-day magnificently constructed steam engine . This initial attempt at locomotive building was a queer little engine with wheels so light that unless there was plenty of ballast aboard it was impossible to keep it on the track ; and besides that , the poor wee thing could not get up steam enough to start itself and in consequence Mr. Baldwin and some of his machinists were obliged to give it a violent push whenever it set out and then leap aboard when it was under way in order to weigh it down and keep it on the track . " " Imagine having to hold an engine down ! " ejaculated Steve , with amusement . " The story simply goes to prove how much in the making locomotives really were , " Mr. Tolman said . " And not only did this toy engine have to be started by a friendly push , but it was too feeble to generate steam fast enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore every now and then the power would give out and Mr. Baldwin and his men would be forced to get out and run along beside the train , pushing it as they went that it might keep up its momentum until a supply of steam could again be acquired . Can you ask for anything more primitive than that ? " " It certainly makes one realize the progress locomotive builders have made , " the boy replied , with gravity . " It certainly does , " agreed his father . " Think how Baldwin and his men must have struggled first with one difficulty and then with another ; think how they must have experimented and worked to perfect the tiny engine with which they began ! It was the conquering of this multitude of defects that gave to the world the intricate , exquisitely made machine which at this very minute is pulling you and me into New York . " There was an interval of silence during which Stephen glanced out at the flying panorama framed by the window . " Where was New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . " Did n't Massachusetts do anything except build the old granite road at Quincy ? " " Railroads , for various reasons , were not popular in Massachusetts , " returned his father . " As usual New England was conservative and was therefore slow in waking up to the importance of steam transportation . Boston was on the coast , you see , and had its ships as well as the canal boats that connected the city with the manufacturing districts of the Merrimac . Therefore , although the question of building railroads was agitated in 1819 nothing was done about the matter . As was natural the canal company opposed the venture , and there was little enthusiasm elsewhere concerning a project that demanded a great outlay of money with only scant guarantee that any of it would ever come back to the capitalists who advanced it . Moreover , the public in general was sceptical about railroads or else totally uninterested in them . And even had a railroad been built at this time it would not have been a steam road for it was proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Quincy had been . " " Oh ! " interjected Steve scornfully . " They might at least have tried steam . " " People had little faith in it , " explained Mr. Tolman . " Those who had the faith lacked the money to back the enterprise , and those who had the money lacked the faith . If a company could have gone ahead and built a steam railroad that was an unquestioned success many persons would undoubtedly have been convinced of its value and been willing to put capital into it ; but as matters stood , there was so much antagonism against the undertaking that nobody cared to launch the venture . There were many business men who honestly regarded a steam railroad as a menace to property and so strong was this feeling that in 1824 the town of Dorchester , a village situated a short distance from Boston , actually took legal measures to prevent any railroad from passing through its territory . " " They need n't have been so fussed , " said Stephen , with a grin . " Railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , the Quincy road was not the only railroad in Massachusetts , " his father asserted quickly , " for in spite of opposition a railroad to Lowell , modeled to some extent after the old granite road , had been built . This railroad was constructed on stone ties , as the one at Quincy had been ; for although such construction was much more costly it was thought at the time to be far more durable . Several years afterward , when experience had demonstrated that wood possessed more give , and that a hard , unyielding roadbed only creates jar , the granite ties that had cost so much were taken up and replaced by wooden ones . " " What a shame ! " " Thus do we live and learn , " said his father whimsically . " Our blunders are often very expensive . The only redeeming thing about them is that we pass our experience on to others and save them from tumbling into the same pit . Thus it was with the early railroad builders . When the Boston and Providence Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden roadbed was laid . In the meantime a short steam railroad line had been built from Boston to Newton , a distance of seven miles , and gradually the road to this suburb was lengthened until it extended first to Natick and afterward to Worcester , a span of forty-four miles . Over this road , during fine weather , three trains ran daily ; in winter there were but two . I presume nothing simpler or less pretentious could have been found than this early railroad whose trains were started at the ringing of a bell hung on a near-by tree . Although it took three hours to make a trip now made in one , the journey was considered very speedy , and unquestionably it was if travelers had to cover the distance by stagecoach . When we consider that in 1834 it took freight the best part of a week to get to Boston by wagons a three-hour trip becomes a miracle . " " I suppose there was not so much freight in those days anyway , " Steve speculated . " Fortunately not . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore there were not so many trunks to be carried ; I am not sure , too , but the frugal Americans of that day had fewer clothes to take with them when they did go . Then , as each town or district was of necessity more or less isolated , people knew fewer persons outside of their own communities , did a less extensive business , and had less incentive to go a-visiting . Therefore , although the Boston and Worcester Railroad could boast only two baggage cars ( or burthen cars , as they were called ) , the supply was sufficient , which was fortunate , especially since the freight house in Boston was only large enough to shelter these two . " " And out of all this grew the Boston and Albany Railroad ? " questioned the boy . " Yes , although it was not until 1841 , about eight years later , that the line was extended to New York State . By that time tracks had been laid through the Berkshire hills , opening up the western part of Massachusetts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials to the New York capital , where they were welcomed and entertained by the Albany dignitaries , is picturesque reading indeed . One of the party who set out from Boston on that memorable day carried with him some spermaceti candles which on the delegates ' arrival were burned with great ceremony at the evening dinner . " " I suppose it seemed a wonderful thing to reach Albany in fifteen hours , " remarked Steve . " It was like a fairy tale , " his father answered . " To estimate the marvel to the full you must think how long it would have taken to drive the distance , or make the journey by water . Therefore the Boston officials burned their spermaceti candles in triumph ; and the next day , when the Albany hosts returned to Boston with their guests , they symbolized the onrush of the world 's progress by bringing with them a barrel of flour which had been cut , threshed , and ground only two days before , and put into a wooden barrel made from a tree which was cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being ground . This does not seem to us anything very astounding but it was a feat to stop the breath in those days . " " And what did they do with the flour ? " " Oh , that evening when they reached Boston the flour was made into some sort of bread which was served at the dinner the Boston men gave to their visitors . " " I wonder what they would have said if somebody had told them then that sometime people would be going from Boston to New York in five hours ? " the lad observed . " I presume they would not have believed it , " was the reply . " Nor would they have been able to credit tales of the great numbers of persons who would constantly be traveling between these two great cities . At that time so few people made the trip that it was very easy to keep track of them ; and that they might be identified in case of accident the company retained a list of those who went on the trains . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully tabulated , together with their place of residence ; but later , when traffic began to increase and employees began to have more to do , those whose duty it was to make out these lists became hurried and careless and in the old railroad annals we read such entries as these : " ' Woman in green bonnet ; boy ; stranger ; man with side whiskers , ' etc . " A peal of laughter broke from Stephen . " Railroad officials would have some job to list passengers now , would n't they ? " he said . " We should all just have to wear identification tags as the men did during the War . " His father acquiesced whimsically . " I have sometimes feared we might have to come to that , anyway , " he replied . " With the sky populated with aeroplanes and the streets filled with automobiles man stands little chance in these days of preserving either his supremacy or his identity . When we get on Fifth Avenue to-day you see if you do not agree with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big station . CHAPTER VIII NEW YORK AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE It took no very long interval to prove that there was some foundation for Mr. Tolman 's last assertion , for within a short time the travelers were standing on Fifth Avenue amid the rush of traffic , and feeling of as little importance as dwarfs in a giant 's country . The roar of the mighty city , its bustle and confusion , were both exhilarating and terrifying . They had left their luggage at the hotel and now , while Steve 's father went to meet a business appointment , the boy was to take a ride up the Avenue on one of the busses , a diversion of which he never tired . To sit on top and look down on the throng in the streets was always novel and entertaining to one who passed his days in a quiet New England town . Therefore he stopped one of the moving vehicles and in great good humor bade his father good-by ; and feeling very self-sufficient to be touring New York by himself , clambered eagerly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the coach for the chill of early morning still lingered in the air ; but before they reached Riverside Drive a man with a bright , ruddy countenance and iron-grey hair hailed the bus and climbed up beside the boy . As he took his place he glanced at him kindly and instantly Steve felt a sense of friendliness toward the stranger ; and after they had ridden a short distance in silence the man spoke . " What a beautiful river the Hudson is ! " he remarked . " Although I am an old New Yorker I never cease to delight in its charm and its fascinating history . It was on this body of water , you know , that the first steamboat was tried out . " " I did n't know it , " Stephen confessed , with an honest blush . " You will be learning about it some day , I fancy , " said the other , with a smile . " An interesting story it is , too . All the beginnings of our great industries and inventions read like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about the beginnings of some of our railroads , " observed Steve shyly , " and certainly his stories were as good as fairy tales . " " Is your father especially interested in railroads ? " inquired the New Yorker . " Yes , sir . He is in the railroad business . " " Ah , then that accounts for his filling your ears with locomotives instead of steamboats , " declared the man , with a twinkle in his eyes . " Now if I were to spin a yarn for you , it would be of steamboats because that happens to be the thing I am interested in ; I believe their history to be one of the most alluring tales to which a boy could listen . Sometime you get a person who knows the drama from start to finish to relate to you the whole marvelous adventure of early steamboating , and you see if it does not beat the railroad story all out . " He laughed a merry laugh in which Stephen joined . " I wish you would tell it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned with an expression of pleasure on his red-cheeked face . " I should like nothing better , my boy , " he said quickly , " but you see it is a long story and I am getting out at the next corner . Sometime , however , we may meet again . Who knows ? And if we do you shall hold me to my promise to talk steamboats to you until you cry for mercy . " Bending down he took up a leather bag which he had placed between his feet . " I am leaving you here , sonny , " he said . " I take it you are in New York for a holiday . " " Yes , sir , I am , " returned Steve with surprise . " My father and I are staying here just for a few days . " " I hope you will have a jolly good time during your visit , " the man said , rising . Stephen murmured his thanks and watched the erect figure descend from the coach and disappear into a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well out of sight and the omnibus on its way that his eye was caught by the red bill book lying on the floor at his feet . None of the few scattered passengers had noticed it and stooping , he picked it up and quietly slipped it into his pocket . What should he do with it ? Of course he could hand it over to the driver of the bus and tell him he had found it . But the man might not be honest and instead of turning it in to the company might keep it . There was little doubt in Steve 's mind that the pocketbook belonged to the stranger who had just vacated the place and it was likely his address was inside it . If so , what a pleasure it would be to return the lost article to its rightful owner himself . By so doing he would not only be sure the pocketbook reached its destination but he might see the steamboat man again . He longed to open the bill book and investigate its contents . What was in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue coach was no place to be looking through pocketbooks , there was no question about that . Let alone the fact that persons might be watching him , there was danger that in the fresh morning breeze something might take wing , sail down to the Hudson , and never be seen again . Therefore he decided to curb his impatience and wait until he reached a more favorable spot to examine his suddenly acquired treasure . Accordingly he tucked the long red wallet farther down into the breast pocket of his ulster , and feeling assured that nothing could be done about it at present , gave himself up to the pleasure and excitement of the drive . It was not until he had rejoined his father at the hotel and the two were sitting at lunch in the great dining room that the thought of it again flashed into his mind . " Gee , Dad ! " he suddenly exclaimed , looking up from his plateful of fried chicken with fork suspended in mid-air . " I meant to tell you I found a pocketbook in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . I think the man who had been sitting beside me must have dropped it when he stooped over to get his bag . At any rate it was lying there after he got out . " " What did you do with it ? " Mr. Tolman inquired with no great warmth of interest . " Gave it to the conductor , I suppose . " The boy shook his head . " No , I did n't , " was the answer . " I was afraid he might not turn it in , and as I liked the man who lost it I wanted to be sure he got it , so I brought it back with me . " " And where is it now ? " demanded Mr. Tolman , now all attention . " I hope you were not so careless as to leave it upstairs in our room . " " No . I did n't leave it in the room , " returned the lad . " It is out in my coat pocket . I meant to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many things happened that I forgot about it until this very minute . " " You do n't mean that you left it in your ulster pocket and let them hang it out there on the rack ? " " Yes . " " You checked your coat and left it there ? " " Why -- yes , " came the faltering reply . Mr. Tolman was on his feet . " Wait here until I come back , " he said in a sharp tone . " Where are you going ? " " Give me your check quickly , " went on his father , without heeding the question . " Hurry ! " Steve fumbled in his jacket pocket . " Be quick , son , be quick ! " commanded Mr. Tolman impatiently . " Do n't you know it is never safe to leave anything of value in your coat when you are staying at a large city hotel ? Somebody may have taken the pocketbook already . " Scarlet with consternation the lad produced the check . " If nothing has happened to that pocketbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely . " Stay here ! I will be right back . " With beating heart the boy watched him thread his way between the tables and disappear from the dining room into the lobby . Suppose the bill book should be gone ! What if there had been valuable papers in it , money -- a great deal of money -- and now through his carelessness it had all disappeared ? How stupid he had been not to remember about it and give it to his father the instant they had met ! In fact , he would much better have taken a chance and handed it to the bus conductor than to have done the foolish thing he had . He had meant so well and blundered so grievously ! How often his father had cautioned him to be careful of money when he was traveling ! Tensely he sat in his chair and waited with miserable anxiety , his eyes fixed on the dining-room door . Then presently , to his great relief , he saw his father returning . " Did you --  " he began . " You will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose brow was wrinkled into a frown of annoyance . " The maid who checked the coats is not there , and the one who is insists that the ulster is not mine , and in spite of the check will not allow me to search the pockets of it . " Stephen jumped up . " I suppose she is right , too , " went on Mr. Tolman breathlessly , " but the delay is very unfortunate . " They made their way into the corridor , where by this time an office clerk and another man had joined the maid who was in charge of the coat rack . Stephen presented his check and without comment the woman handed him his coat . With trembling hand he dived into the deep pocket and from it drew forth the red bill book which he gave to his father . " There it is , Dad , safe and sound ! " he gasped . Instantly the clerk was in their path . " I beg pardon , sir , " said he with deference , " but does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eh -- what did you say ? " he inquired . " I asked , sir , if that pocketbook was your property ? " repeated the clerk . Mr. Tolman faced his inquisitor . " What business is that of yours ? " he demanded curtly . " I am sorry , sir , to appear rude , " the hotel employee replied , " but we have been asked to be on the lookout for a young lad who rode this morning on one of the Fifth Avenue busses where a valuable pocketbook was lost . Your son tallies so well with the description that --  " " It was I , " put in Stephen eagerly , without regard for consequences . " Who wants me ? " With a smile of eagerness he turned , expecting to encounter the genial face of his acquaintance of the morning . Then he would smile , hold out the pocketbook , and they would laugh together as he explained the adventure , and perhaps afterward have luncheon in company . Instead no familiar form greeted him . On the contrary the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . Mr. Tolman sensed the situation in a second . " You mean somebody thinks my son took the pocketbook ? " asked he indignantly , as he confronted the clerk and his companion . " It is not my affair , sir , and I am sorry it should happen in our hotel , " apologized the clerk . " Perhaps if you will just explain the whole matter to this gentleman --  " he broke off , saying in an undertone to the man at his elbow . " This is your boy , Donovan . " The tall man came nearer . " You are a detective ? " asked Mr. Tolman bluntly . " Well , something of the sort , sir , " admitted the man called Donovan . " It is occasionally my business to hunt people up . " " And you have been sent to hunt my son up ? " Donovan nodded . Stephen turned white and his father put a reassuring hand on his shoulder . " My son and I , " he replied , addressing the detective quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so gladly . The boy did find the pocketbook but he was ignorant of its value because he has not even looked inside it . In fact , that he had the article in his possession did not come into his mind until a few moments ago . If he had known the thing was valuable , do you suppose he would have left it in his ulster pocket and checked the coat in a public place like this ? " The detective made no reply . " We both shall be very glad , " went on Mr. Tolman firmly , " to go with you to headquarters and straighten the matter out . " " There may be no need of that , sir , " Donovan responded with a pleasant smile . " If we can just talk the affair over in a satisfactory way --  " " Suppose you come upstairs to our room , " suggested Mr. Tolman . " That will give us more quiet and privacy . Will that be agreeable to you ? " " Perfectly . " As the three walked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy knew he had done nothing wrong ; but would he be able to convince the detective of the truth of his story ? He was thoroughly frightened and wondered whether his father was also alarmed . If , however , Mr. Tolman was worried he at least did not show it . Instead he courteously led the way from the elevator down the dim corridor and unlocked the door of Number 379 . " Come in , Mr. Donovan , " he said cordially . " Here is a chair and a cigar . Now , son , tell us the story of this troublesome pocketbook from beginning to end . " In a trembling voice Stephen began his tale . He spoke slowly , uncertainly , for he was well scared . Gradually , however , he forgot his agitation and his voice became more positive . He recounted the details of the omnibus ride with great care , adding ingenuously when he came to the termination of the narrative : " And I hoped the man 's name would be inside the pocketbook because I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had lost . " " And was n't it ? " put in Mr. Donovan quickly . " I do n't know , " was the innocent retort . " Do n't you remember I told you that I had n't looked inside yet ? " The detective laughed with satisfaction . " That was a shabby trick of mine , youngster , " said he . " It was mean to try to trap you . " " Trap me ? " repeated Steve vaguely . " There , there , sonny ! " went on Donovan kindly . " Do n't you worry a minute more about this mix-up . Mr. Ackerman , the gentleman who lost the bill book , did not think for a second that you had taken it . He simply was so sure that he had lost it on the bus that he wanted to locate you and find out whether you knew anything about it or not . His name was not inside the pocketbook , you see , and therefore any one who found it would have no way of tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big wad of Liberty Bonds which , as your father knows , could quickly be converted into cash . In consequence Mr. Ackerman decided that the sooner the pocketbook was found the better . The omnibus people denied any knowledge of it and you were the only remaining clue . " Mr. Tolman sank back in his chair and a relaxation of his muscles betrayed for the first time that he had been much more disturbed than he had appeared to be . " Well , " he said , lighting a fresh cigar , " the bill book is not only located but we can hand it back intact to its owner . If you can inform us where the gentleman lives , my boy and I will call a taxi and go to his house or office with his property . " A flush of embarrassment suffused the face of the officer . " Maybe you would like to come with us , Donovan , " added Mr. Tolman , who instantly interpreted the man 's confusion . " I hate to be dogging your footsteps , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with obvious sincerity . " Still , I --  " " You have your orders , no doubt . " " Well , yes , sir , " admitted the plain-clothes man with reluctance . " I have . " " You were to keep your eye on us until the pocketbook reached its owner . " " That 's about it , sir . Not that I personally have the least suspicion that a gentleman like you would --  " " That is all right , my man . I perfectly understand your position , " Mr. Tolman cut in . " After all , you have your duty to do and business is business . We 'll just telephone Mr. Ackerman that we are coming so that we shall be sure of catching him , and then we will go right up there . " " Very well , sir . " Stephen 's father started toward the telephone and then , as if struck by a sudden thought , paused and turned . " Steve , " he said , " I believe you are the person to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found his purse and that you and your father would like to come up to his house , if it will be convenient , and return it . " " All right , Dad . " " You will find his number on this slip of paper , sonny , " the detective added , handing the lad a card . " He is not at his office . He went home to lunch in the hope that he had left the pocketbook there . " After some delay Stephen succeeded in getting the number written on the card . A servant answered the summons . " May I speak to Mr. Ackerman , please ? " inquired the lad . " He is at luncheon ? No , it would not do the least good for me to tell you my name for he would not know who it was . Just tell him that the boy who sat beside him this morning on the Fifth Avenue bus --  " there was a little chuckle . " Oh , he will be here directly , will he ? I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice which Steve at once recognized to be that of the steamboat man came over the wire : " Well , sonny ? " " I found your bill book , Mr. Ackerman , and my father and I would like to bring it up to you . " " Well , well ! that is fine news ! " cried the man at the other end of the line . " How did you know who it belonged to ? " " Oh , I -- we -- found out -- my father and I , " stammered the lad . " May we come up to your house with it now ? " " You would much better let me come to you ; then only one person will be inconvenienced , " the New Yorker returned pleasantly . " Where are you staying ? " " At the Manhattan . " " You must not think of taking the trouble of coming way up here . Let me join you and your father at your hotel . " " Very well , Mr. Ackerman . If you 'd rather --  " " I certainly should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not think of bringing two people so far out of their way . " " There are three of us ! " squeaked Stephen . " Three ? " " Yes , sir . We have another person -- a friend -- with us , " explained the boy , with quiet enjoyment . How easy it was to laugh now ! " All the more reason why I should come to you , then , " asserted Mr. Ackerman . " I will be at the Manhattan within half an hour . Perhaps if you and your father and your friend have the afternoon free you would like to go to some sort of a show with me after we conclude our business . Since you are here on a holiday you ca n't be very busy . " Stephen 's eyes sparkled with merriment . " I do n't know whether our friend can go or not , " he replied politely , " but I think perhaps Dad and I could ; and if we can we should like to very much . " " That will be excellent . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to get my pocketbook back again but I shall be glad to see you once more . I told you this morning that I had a feeling we should meet some time . Whom shall I ask for at the hotel ? " " Stephen Tolman . " With a click the boy hung up the receiver . " Mr. Ackerman is coming right down , " said he , addressing his father and the detective with a mischievous smile . " He has invited the three of us to go to the matinee with him . " " The three of us ! " echoed the plain-clothes man . " Yes , " returned the lad . " I told him we had a friend with us and so he said to bring him along . " " Good heavens ! " Donovan ejaculated . Mr. Tolman laughed heartily . " Not all the thieves you arrest take you to a theater party afterward , do they , Officer ? " he asked . " I said from the first you were gentlemen , " Mr. Donovan asserted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired Steve , quite seriously . " Bless you , no , sonny ! " replied the man . " I am from headquarters , you know , and my work is chasing up crooks -- not going to matinees . " Nevertheless there was an intonation of gentleness in his voice , as he added , " I am obliged to you just the same , for in spite of my calling I am a human being and I appreciate being treated like one . " CHAPTER IX AN ASTOUNDING CALAMITY Mr. Ackerman was as good as his word , for within half an hour he presented himself at the hotel where he found Mr. Tolman , Mr. Donovan and Steve awaiting him in their pleasant upstairs room . As he joined them his eye traveled inquiringly from one to another of the group and lingered with curiosity on the face of the detective . The next instant he was holding out his hand to Stephen . " Well , my boy , I am glad to see you again , " said he , a ring of heartiness in his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , Mr. Ackerman , " Steve replied , returning the hand-clasp with fervor . " This is my father , sir ; and this " for a second he hesitated , then continued , " is our friend , Mr. Donovan . " With cordiality the New Yorker acknowledged the introductions . " Mr. Donovan , " explained Mr. Tolman , scanning Mr. Ackerman 's countenance with a keen , half-quizzical expression , " is from headquarters . " The steamboat magnate started and shot a quick glance at those present . It was plain he was disconcerted and uncertain as to how to proceed . Mr. Donovan , however , came to his rescue , stepping tactfully into the breach : " I was not needed for anything but to supply your address , sir ; but I was able to do that , so between us all we have contrived to return your pocketbook to you as good as before it left your possession . " As he spoke Mr. Tolman drew forth the missing bill book and held it toward its owner . " That looks pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the article from Mr. Tolman 's outstretched hand and regarded it reflectively . " I do n't know when I have ever done anything so careless and stupid . You see I had got part way to the bank before I remembered that I had left my glasses , on which I am absolutely dependent , at home . Therefore , there being no taxi in sight , I hailed a passing bus and climbed up beside this youngster . How the bill book happened to slip out of my pocket I can not explain . It seemed to me it would be safer to have the securities upon my person than in a bag that might be snatched from me ; but apparently my logic was at fault . I was , however , so certain of my wisdom that I never thought to question it until I had reached the sidewalk and the bus had gone . " Your boy , Mr. Tolman , confided while we rode along this morning that he was visiting in New York for a few days ; but of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted his help in tracing the missing pocketbook I had no way of locating him beyond assuming that he must be staying at one of the hotels . Therefore when the omnibus company could furnish no clue , I got into touch with an agency whose business it is to hunt people up . If the pocketbook had been dropped on the bus I felt sure your boy , who was almost the only other person on top of the coach , would know about it ; if , on the other hand , it had been dropped in the street , my problem would be a different one . In either case the sooner I knew my course of action the better . I hope you will believe , Mr. Tolman , that when I called in the aid of detectives I had no suspicions against your son 's honesty . " Mr. Tolman waved the final remark aside good-humoredly . " We have not taken the affair as a personal matter at all , " he declared . " We fully appreciate your difficulty in finding Stephen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . New York is a rather large city anyway , and for two people who do not even know one another 's names to get together is like hunting a needle in a haystack . Our only recourse to discovering the owner of the pocketbook would be through the advertising columns of the papers and that is the method we should have followed had not Donovan appeared and saved us the trouble . " He exchanged a smile with the detective . " The advertising column was my one hope , " Mr. Ackerman replied . " I felt sure that any honest person who picked up the purse would advertise it . It was not the honest people I was worrying about . It was the thought that I had dropped the bill book in the street where any Tom-Dick-and-Harry could run away with it that concerned me . Moreover , even if your boy had found it on the bus , he might have turned it in to an employee of the coach line who was not honest enough to give it in turn to his superiors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that I do I can not tell you how grateful I am both to Stephen and to this officer here for the service they have rendered me . " Then , turning toward Mr. Tolman , he added in an undertone , " I hope neither you nor your son have suffered any annoyance through this unfortunate incident . " " Not in the least , " was the prompt response . " I confess we were a trifle disconcerted at first ; but Mr. Donovan has performed his duty with such courtesy that we entertain toward him nothing but gratitude . " " I am glad of that , " Mr. Ackerman replied , " for I should deeply regret placing either you or your boy , even for a moment , in an uncomfortable position , or one where it might appear that I --  " But Mr. Tolman cut him short . " You took the quickest , most sensible course , Ackerman , " said he . " Too much was at stake for you to risk delay . When a pocketbook filled with negotiable securities disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor I cherish the least ill-will about the affair ; do we , son ? " " No , indeed . " Then smiling ingenuously up into the face of the New York man , he said : " Do n't you want to look in your pocketbook and see if everything is all right , sir ? " The steamboat financier laughed . " You are a prudent young man , " declared he . " No , I am quite willing to risk that the property you have so kindly guarded is intact . " " It ought to be , " the boy said . " I have n't even opened the pocketbook . " " A better proof still that everything is safe within it , " chuckled Mr. Ackerman . " No , sonny , I am not worrying . I should not worry even if you had ransacked the bill book from one end to the other . I 'd take a chance on the honesty of a boy like you . " Mr. Tolman , however , who had been listening , now came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion is a good , businesslike one , Ackerman , " he declared . " As a mere matter of form -- not as a slam against our morals -- I am sure that both he and I would prefer that you examined your property while we are all here together and assure yourself that it is all right . " " Pooh ! Pooh ! Nonsense ! " objected the financier . " It is a wise notion , Mr. Ackerman , " rejoined Mr. Donovan . " Business is business . None of us questions the honor of Mr. Tolman or his son . They know that . Nevertheless I am sure we should all feel better satisfied if you went through the formality of an investigation . " " Very well , just as you say . But I want it understood that I do it at their and your request . I am perfectly satisfied to leave things as they are . " Taking the now familiar red pocketbook from his coat he opened it unconcernedly ; then the three persons watching him saw a look of consternation banish the smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " inquired the plain-clothes man quickly . Without a word the other held the bill book toward him . It was empty . Bonds , securities , money were gone ! A gasp of incredulity came from Stephen . " I did n't open it -- truly I did n't ! " exclaimed he , in a terror-stricken voice . But Mr. Ackerman did not heed the remark . " I am afraid this looks pretty black for us , Ackerman , " said Mr. Tolman slowly . " We have nothing to give you but the boy 's word . " Mr. Donovan , however , who had been studying the group with a hawklike scrutiny now sprang to his feet and caught up his hat . " I do n't see how they dared put it over ! " he exclaimed excitedly . " But they almost got away with it . Even I was fooled . " " You do n't mean to insinuate , " Mr. Tolman burst out , " that you think we --  " " Good heavens , no ! " replied the detective with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting hot under the collar , Mr. Tolman . Nobody is slamming you . I have been pretty stupid about this affair , I 'm afraid ; but give me credit for recognizing honest people when I see them . No , somebody has tricked you -- tricked you all . But the game is n't up yet . If you gentlemen will just wait here --  " The sentence was cut short by the banging of the door . The detective was gone . His departure was followed by an awkward silence . Mr. Ackerman 's face clouded into a frown of disappointment and anxiety ; Mr. Tolman paced the floor and puffed viciously at a cigar ; and Steve , his heart cold within him , looked from one to the other , chagrin , mortification and terror in his eyes . " I did n't open the pocketbook , Mr. Ackerman , " he reiterated for the twentieth time . " I truly did n't . " But the steamboat magnate was too deeply absorbed in his own thoughts and speculations to notice the high-pitched voice with its intonation of distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . " This is a most unfortunate happening , Ackerman , " he burst out . " I am more concerned about it than I can express . My boy and I are utter strangers to you and we have no way of proving our honesty . All I can say is that we are as much amazed at the turn affairs have taken as yourself , and we regret it with quite as much poignancy -- perhaps more since it reflects directly upon us . If there is anything we can do --  " He stopped , awaiting a reply from the other man , but none came . " Good heavens , Ackerman , " he cried . " You do n't mean to say you do not believe my son and me -- that you suspect us of double-dealing ! " " I do n't know what to believe , Tolman , " owned Mr. Ackerman with candor . " I want very much to credit your story ; in my heart , I do credit it . But head and heart seem to be at variance in this matter . Frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketbook have gone . Were the things taken out before the bill book fell into your son 's hands or afterward ? And if afterward , who took them ? Who had the chance ? Donovan seems to think he has a clue , but I confess I have none . " " Had n't you looked over the bonds and stuff since you took them home ? " " No , " Mr. Ackerman admitted . " I got them from the broker yesterday and as it was too late to put them into the safe-deposit vault , I took them home with me instead of putting them in our office safe as I should have done . I thought it would be easier for me to stop at the bank with them this morning on my way to business . It was foolish planning but I aimed to save time . " " So the pocketbook was at your house over night ? " Mr. Ackerman nodded . " Yes , " confessed he . " Nevertheless it did not go out of my possession . I had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You are sure no one took the things out while you were asleep last night ? " " Why -- I -- I do n't see how they could , " faltered Mr. Ackerman . " My servants are honest -- at least , they always have been . I have had them for years . Moreover , none of them knew I had valuable papers about me . How could they ? " was the reply . Once more silence fell upon the room . " Come , Tolman , " ejaculated the steamboat man presently , " you are a level-headed person . What is your theory ? " " If I did not know my son and myself as well as I do , " Mr. Tolman answered with deliberation , " my theory would be precisely what I fancy yours is . I should reason that during the interval between the finding of the purse and its return the contents had been extracted . " He saw the New Yorker color . " That , I admit , is my logical theory , " Mr. Ackerman owned with a blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brain tells me one thing and my heart another ; and in spite of the fact that the arguments of my brain seem correct I find myself believing my heart and in consequence cherishing a groundless faith in you and your boy , " concluded he , with a faint smile . " That is certainly generous of you , Ackerman ! " Mr. Tolman returned , much moved by the other 's confidence . " Stephen and I are in a very compromising situation with nothing but your belief between us and a great deal of unpleasantness . We appreciate your attitude of mind more than we can express . The only other explanation I can offer , and in the face of the difficulties it would involve it hardly seems a possible one , is that while the coat was hanging in the lobby --  " There was a sound outside and a sharp knock at the door , and an instant later Mr. Donovan entered , his face wreathed in smiles . Following him was the woman who had checked the coats , a much frightened bell boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Indeed , sir , " she wailed , approaching Steve , " I never meant to keep the pocketbook and make trouble for you . I have a boy of my own at home , a lad about your age . What is to become of him now ? Oh , dear ; oh , dear ! " She burst into passionate weeping . " Now see here , my good woman , stop all this crying and talk quietly , " cut in the policeman in a curt but not unkind tone . " If you will tell us the truth , perhaps we can help you . In any case we must know exactly what happened . " " She must understand that anything she says can be used against her , " cautioned the detective , who in spite of his eagerness to solve the mystery was determined the culprit should have fair play . " Indeed , I do n't care , sir , " protested the maid , wiping her eyes on her ridiculously small apron . " I ca n't be any worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lock-up . I 'll tell the gentlemen the truth , I swear I will . " With a courtesy he habitually displayed toward all womanhood Mr. Tolman drew forward a chair and she sank gratefully into it . " I spied the bill book in the young gentleman 's pocket the minute he took off his coat , " began she in a low tone . " It was bright colored and as it was sticking part way out I could n't help seeing it . Of course , I expected he would take it with him into the dining room but when he did n't I came to the conclusion that there could n't be anything of value in it . But by and by I had more coats to hang up and one of them , a big , heavy , fur-lined one , brushed against the young gentleman 's ulster and knocked the pocketbook out on to the floor so that it lay open under the coat rack . It was then that I saw it was stuffed full of papers and things . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutely on : " It seemed to me it was no sort of a plan to put the wallet back into the lad 's pocket , for when I was n't looking somebody might take it . So I decided I much better keep it safe for him , and maybe , " she owned with a blush , " get a good-sized tip for doing it . I have a big pocket in my underskirt where I carry my own money and I slipped it right in there , meaning to hand it to the young man when he came out from lunch . " The corners of her mouth twitched and her tears began to fall again , but she wiped them away with her apron and proceeded steadily : " But nothing turned out as I planned , for no sooner was the bill book in my pocket than I was called away to help about the wraps at a lady 's luncheon upstairs . There were so many people about the hall that I had no chance to restore the bill book to the lad 's pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was stealing . There was no help but to take it with me , trusting they would not keep me long upstairs and that I would get back to my regular place before the young gentleman came out of the dining room . It was when I got out of the elevator in the upper hall that I spied Dick , one of the bell boys I knew , and I called to him ; and after explaining that I could n't get away to go downstairs I asked him to take the wallet and put it in 47 's pocket . He 's a good-natured little chap and always ready to do an errand , and more than that he 's an honest boy . So I felt quite safe and went to work , supposing the young man had his pocketbook long ago . " All eyes were turned upon the unlucky bell boy who hung his head and colored uncomfortably . " So it was the boy who took the contents of the pocketbook ! " was Mr. Ackerman 's comment . " Speak up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talking to you . " The lad looked up with a frightened start . He might have been sixteen years of age but he did not look it for he was pale and underfed ; nor was there anything in his bearing to indicate the poise and maturity of one who was master of the occasion . On the contrary , he was simply a boy who was frankly distressed and frightened , and as unfeignedly helpless in the present emergency as if he had been six years old and been caught stealing jam from the pantry shelf . It did not take more than a glance to convince the onlookers that he was no hardened criminal . If he had done wrong it had been the result either of impulse or mischief , and the dire result of his deed was a thing he had been too unsophisticated to foresee . The plight in which he now found himself plainly amazed and overwhelmed him and he looked pleadingly at his captors . " Well , my boy , what have you to say for yourself ? " repeated Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing ? " " No , sir . " " You did take the things out of the pocketbook then . " " Yes , sir . " " But you are not a boy accustomed to taking what does not belong to you . " The culprit shot a glance of gratitude toward the speaker but made no reply . " How did you happen to do it this time ? " persisted Mr. Ackerman kindly . " Come , tell me all about it . " Perhaps it was the ring of sympathy in the elder man 's voice that won the boy 's heart . Whatever the charm , it conquered ; and he met the eyes that scanned his countenance with a timid smile . " I wanted to see what was in the pocketbook , " said he with naive honesty , " and so I took the things out to look at them . I was n't goin ' to keep ' em . I dodged into one of the little alcoves in the hall and had just pulled the papers out when I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff into my pocket , waiting for a time when I could look it over and put it back . But I got held up just like Mrs. Nolan did , " he pointed toward the woman in the chair . " Some man was sick and the clerk sent me to get a bottle of medicine the minute I got downstairs , and all I had the chance to do was to stick the empty wallet in 47 's pocket and beat it for the drug store . I thought there would be letters or something among the papers that would give the name of the man they belonged to , and I 'd take ' em to the clerk at the desk an ' say I found ' em . But no sooner had I got the medicine up to room Number 792 than the policeman nabbed me with the papers an ' things on me . That 's all there is to it , sir . " " Have you the things now ? " the officer put in quickly . " Sure ! Did n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ' em over to the clerk , " the boy reiterated , pulling a wad of crumpled Liberty Bonds and documents out of his pocket , and tumbling them upon the table . There was no doubting the lad 's story . Truth spoke in every line of his face and in the frankness with which he met the scrutiny of those who listened to him . If one had questioned his uprightness the facts bore out his statements , for once out of the hotel on an errand he might easily have taken to his heels and never returned ; or he might have disposed of his booty during his absence . But he had done neither . He had gone to the drug store and come back with every intention of making restitution for the result of his curiosity . That was perfectly evident . " I 'm sorry , sir , " he declared , when no one spoke . " I know I should n't have looked in the pocketbook or touched the papers ; but I meant no harm -- honest I did n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman interrupted . " Dick was ever a lad to be trusted . The hotel people will tell you that . He 's been here several years and there 's never been a thing against him . I blame myself for getting him into this trouble , for without meaning to I put temptation in his way . I know that what he 's told you is the living truth , and I pray you 'll try and believe him and let him go . If harm was to come to the lad through me I 'd never forgive myself . Let the boy go free and put the blame on me , if you must arrest somebody . I 'm older and it does n't so much matter ; but it 's terrible to start a child of his age in as a criminal . The name will follow him through life . He 'll never get rid of it and have a fair chance . Punish me but let the little chap go , I beg of you , " pleaded the woman , with streaming eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple eloquence of the request had touched him deeply . " With your permission , officer , I am going to withdraw my charge , " he said , with a tremor in his voice . " You are to let both these persons go scot free . You , my good woman , meant well but acted foolishly . As for the boy , Donovan , I will assume the responsibility for him . " " You are willing to stand behind him , Mr. Ackerman ? " " I am . " The detective turned toward the boy who had risen and was fumbling awkwardly with the brass buttons adorning his uniform . " You hear , Dick Martin , what the gentleman says , " began he impressively . " He believes you are a good boy , and as you have handed back the valuables in your possession he is going to take a chance on you and let you go . " A wave of crimson swept over the face of the boy and for the first time the tension in the youthful countenance relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " expects you are going to behave yourself in future and never do such a thing again . " " I am going to see your father , Dick , " broke in Mr. Ackerman 's kindly voice , " and talk with him and --  " " I have n't any father , " declared the lad . " Your mother then . " " I 've no mother either . " " Who do you live with ? " " Mr. Aronson . " " Is he a relative ? " " Oh , no , sir ! I have n't any relatives . There 's nobody belongin ' to me . Mr. Aronson is the tailor downstairs where I sleep . When I ai n't working here I do errands for him and he lets me have a cot in a room with four other boys -- newsboys , bell hops and the like . We pay two dollars between us for the room and sometimes when I carry a lot of boxes round for Mr. Aronson he gives me my breakfast . " " Nobody else is responsible for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis . " No , sir , I mean . " " I 'll attend to all this , Donovan , " murmured Mr. Ackerman in an undertone to the detective . " The lad shall not remain there . I do n't know yet just what I 'll do with him but I will plan something . " Then addressing the lad , he continued , " In the meantime , Dick , you are to consider me your relative . Later I shall hunt you up and we will get better acquainted . Be a good boy , for I expect some day you are going to make me very proud of you . " " What ! " In sheer astonishment the boy regarded his benefactor . There was something very appealing in the little sharp-featured face which had now lost much of its pallor and softened into friendliness . " Why should n't you make me proud of you ? " inquired Mr. Ackerman softly . " You can , you know , if you do what is right . " " I 'm goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestness . " I 'm goin ' to try to with all my might . " " That is all any one can ask of you , sonny , " replied the steamboat magnate . " Come , shake hands . Remember , I believe in you , and shall trust you to live up to your word . The officer is going to let you go and none of us is going to mention what has happened . I will fix up everything for you and Mrs. Nolan so you can both go back to your work without interference . Now bid Mr. Tolman and his son good-by and run along . Before I leave the hotel I will look you up and you can give me Mr. Aronson 's address . " Master Richard Martin needed no second bidding . Eager to be gone he awkwardly put out his hand , first to Mr. Tolman and then to Steve ; and afterward , with a shy smile to the detective and the policeman and a boyish duck of his head , he shot into the hall and they heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was more self-controlled . She curtsied elaborately to each of the men and called down upon their heads every blessing that the sky could rain , and it was only after her breath had become quite exhausted that she consented to retire from the room and in company with the policeman and the detective proceeded downstairs in the elevator . " Well , Tolman , " began the New Yorker when they were at last alone , " you see my heart was my best pilot . I put faith in it and it led me aright . Unfortunately it is now too late for the matinee but may I not renew my invitation and ask you and your son to dine with me this evening and conclude our eventful day by going to the theater afterward ? " Mr. Tolman hesitated . " Do n't refuse , " pleaded the steamboat man . " Our acquaintance has , I confess , had an unfortunate beginning ; but a bad beginning makes for a good ending , they say , and I feel sure the old adage will prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us try it out . " " You are very kind , " murmured Mr. Tolman vaguely , " but I --  " " Help me to persuade your father to be generous , Stephen , " interposed Mr. Ackerman . " We must not let a miserable affair like this break up what might , perhaps , have been a delightful friendship . " " I do n't need any further persuading , Ackerman , " Mr. Tolman spoke quickly . " I accept your invitation with great pleasure . " " That 's right ! " cried Mr. Ackerman , with evident gratification . " Suppose you come to my house at seven o'clock if that will be convenient for you . We will have a pleasant evening together and forget lost pocketbooks , detectives and policemen . " Taking out a small card , he hurriedly scrawled an address upon it . " I keep a sort of bachelor 's hall out on Riverside Drive , " explained he , with a shade of wistfulness . " My butler looks out for me and sees that I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent housekeepers and make me very comfortable . " He slipped into his overcoat . " At seven , then , " he repeated . " Do n't fail me for I should be much disappointed . Good-by ! " and with a wave of his hand he departed , leaving Stephen and his father to themselves . CHAPTER X AN EVENING OF ADVENTURE That evening Steve and his father took a taxi-cab and drove to the number Mr. Ackerman had given them . It proved to be an imposing apartment house of cream brick overlooking the Hudson ; and the view from the fifth floor , where their host lived , was such a fascinating one that the boy could hardly be persuaded to leave the bay window that fronted the shifting panorama before him . " So you like my moving picture , do you , Steve ? " inquired the New Yorker merrily . " It is great ! If I lived here I should n't do a bit of studying , " was the lad 's answer . " You think the influence of the place bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stephen chuckled . Both Mr. Tolman and Mr. Ackerman laughed . " I will own , " the latter confessed , " that at first those front windows demoralized me not a little . They had the same lure for me as they have for you . But by and by I gained the strength of mind to turn my back and let the Hudson River traffic look out for itself . " " You might try that remedy , son , " suggested Steve 's father . " No , no , Tolman ! Let the boy alone . If he is enjoying the ferries and steamboats so much the better . " " But there seem to be plenty of steamboats here in the room to enjoy , " was Mr. Tolman 's quick retort . " Steamboats ? " repeated Steve vaguely , turning and looking about him . Sure enough , there were steamboats galore ! Wherever he looked he saw them . Not only were the walls covered with pictures of every imaginable type of steamer , but wherever there was space enough there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were side-wheelers , awkwardly constructed boats with sprawling paddles , screw propellers , and twin-screw craft ; ferryboats , tugs , steam yachts , and ocean liners . Every known variety of sea-going contrivance was represented . The large room was like a museum of ships and the boy gave an involuntary exclamation of delight . " Jove ! " It was a laconic tribute to the marvels about him but it was uttered with so much vehemence that there was no mistaking its sincerity . Evidently , terse as it was , its ring of fervor satisfied Mr. Ackerman for he smiled to himself . " I never saw so many boats in all my life ! " burst out Steve . " I told you I was in the steamboat business , " put in Mr. Ackerman mischievously . " I should think you were ! " was the lad 's comment . " This is a wonderful collection , Ackerman , " Mr. Tolman asserted , as he rose and began to walk about the room . " How did you ever get it together ? Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been years doing it , " Mr. Ackerman said . " It has been my hobby . I have chosen to sink my money in these toys instead of in an abandoned farm or antique furniture . It is just a matter of taste , you see . " " You must have done some scouring of the country to make your collection so complete . I do n't see how you ever succeeded in finding these old pictures and models . It is a genuine history lesson . " " I do not deserve all the credit , by any means , " the capitalist protested with modesty . " My grandfather , who was one of the owners of the first of the Hudson River steamers , began collecting pictures and drawings ; and at his death they came to my father who added to them . Afterward , when the collection descended to me , I tried to fill in the gaps in order to make the sequence complete . Of course in many cases I have not been able to find what I wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I desired were to be had . Either there were no copies of them in existence , or if there were no money could tempt their owners to part with them . Still I have a well enough graded lot to show the progression . " " I should think you had ! " said Mr. Tolman heartily . " You have arranged them beautifully , too , from the old whalers and early American coasting ships to the clippers . Then come the first steam packets , I see , and then the development of the steamboat through its successive steps up to our present-day floating palace . It tells its own story , does n't it ? " " In certain fashion , yes , " Mr. Ackerman agreed . " But the real romance of it will never be fully told , I suppose . What an era of progress through which to have lived ! " " And shared in , as your family evidently did , " interposed Mr. Tolman quickly . His host nodded . " Yes , " he answered , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather had their humble part in the story . " " And well you may be . They were makers of history . " Both men were silent an instant , each occupied with his own thoughts . Mr. Tolman moved reflectively toward the mantelpiece before which Steve was standing , gazing intently at a significant quartette of tiny models under glass . First came a ship of graceful outline , having a miniature figurehead of an angel at its prow and every sail set . Beside this was an ungainly side-wheeler with scarce a line of beauty to commend it . Next in order came an exquisite , up-to-date ocean liner ; and the last in the group was a modern battleship with guns , wireless , and every detail cunningly reproduced . Stephen stood speechless before them . " What are you thinking of , son ? " his father asked . " Why , I --  " the boy hesitated . " Come , tell us ! I 'd like to know , too , " echoed Mr. Ackerman . " Why , to be honest I was wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel , " replied the lad with confusion . The steamboat man smiled kindly . " You think there are handsomer boats in the room than these , do you ? " " Certainly there are better looking steamships than this one , " Steve returned , pointing with a shrug of his shoulders at the clumsy side-wheeler . " But that rather ugly craft is the most important one of the lot , my boy , " Mr. Tolman declared . " I suppose that is true , " Mr. Ackerman agreed . " The fate of all the others hung on that ship . " " Why ? " was the boy 's prompt question . " Oh , it is much too long a yarn to tell you now , " laughed his host . " Were we to begin that tale we should not get to the theater to-night , say nothing of having any dinner . " " I 'd like to hear the story , " persisted Stephen . " You will be reading it from a book some day . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a spontaneous compliment , Ackerman , I do n't know what is , " laughed Mr. Tolman . The steamboat man did not reply but he could not quite disguise his pleasure , although he said a bit gruffly : " We shall have to leave the story and go to the show to-night . I 've bought the tickets and there is no escape , " added he humorously . " But perhaps before you leave New York there will be some other chance for me to spin my yarn for you , and put your father 's railroad romances entirely in the shade . " The butler announced dinner and they passed into the dining room . If , however , Stephen thought that he was now to leave ships behind him he was mistaken , for the dining room proved to be quite as much of a museum as the library had been . Against the dull blue paper hung pictures of racing yachts , early American fighting ships , and nautical encounters on the high seas . The house was a veritable wonderland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come , come , son , " objected Mr. Tolman at last , " you will not be ready in time to go to any show unless you turn your attention to your dinner . " " That 's right , " Mr. Ackerman said . " Fall to and eat your roast beef . We are none too early as it is . " Accordingly Stephen fixed his eyes on his plate with resolution and tried his best to think no more of his alluring surroundings . With the coming of the ice-cream he had almost forgotten there were such things as ships , and when he rose from the table he found himself quite as eager to set forth to the theater as any other healthy-minded lad of his age would have been . The " show " Mr. Ackerman had selected had been chosen with much care and was one any boy would have delighted to see . The great stage had , for the time being , been transformed to a western prairie and across it came a group of canvas-covered wagons , or prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the first settlers of the West . Women and children were huddled beneath the arched canopy of coarse cloth and inside this shelter they passed the weary days and nights of travel . Through sun and storm the wagons rumbled on ; jogging across the rough , uncharted country and jolting over rocks , sagebrush , and sand . There were streams to ford , mountains to climb on the long trip westward , but undaunted by obstacles the heroic little band of settlers who had with such determination left kin and comfort behind them passed on to that new land toward which their faces were set . It was such a company as this that Stephen now saw pictured before him . Perched on the front seat of the wagon driving the horses was the father of the family , rugged , alert , and of the woodsman type characteristic of the New England pioneer . The cavalcade halted . A fire was built and the travelers cooked their supper . Across the valley one could see the fading sunset deepen into twilight . From a little stream near-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and children clambered into the " ship of the desert " and prepared for a night 's rest . In the meantime the men lingered about the dying fire and one of them , a gun in his hand , paced back and forth as if on guard . Then suddenly he turned excitedly to his comrades with his finger on his lips . He had heard a sound , the sound they all dreaded ,  - -  the cry of an Indian . Presently over the crest of the hill came stealing a stealthy band of savages . On they came , crouching against the rocks and moving forward with the lithe , gliding motion of serpents . The men sank down behind the brush , weapons in hand , and waited . On came the bloodthirsty Indians . Then , just when the destruction of the travelers seemed certain , onto the stage galloped a company of cowboys . Immediately there was a flashing of rifles and a din of battle . First it seemed as if the heroic rescuers would surely be slaughtered . But they fought bravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amid the confusion the owners of the prairie schooners leaped to the seats of their wagons , lashed forward their tired horses , and disappeared in safety with the terrified women and children . It was not until the curtain fell upon this thrilling adventure that Stephen sank back into his chair and drew a long breath . " Some show , eh , son ? " said Mr. Tolman , as they put on their overcoats to leave the theater after the three long acts were over . The boy looked up , his eyes wide with excitement . " I should say ! " he managed to gasp . " Did you like it , sonny ? " Mr. Ackerman inquired . " You bet I did ! " " Think you would have preferred to cross the continent by wagon rather than by train ? " Steve hesitated . " I guess a train would have been good enough for me , " he replied . " Was it really as bad as that before the railroads were built ? " " Quite as bad , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it was even worse , for the unfortunate settlers did not always contrive to escape . It took courage to be a pioneer and travel the country in those days . Undoubtedly there was much romance in the adventure but hand in hand with it went no little peril and discomfort . We owe a great deal to the men who settled the West ; and , I sometimes think , even more to the dauntless women . " Stephen did not reply . Very quietly he walked down the aisle between his father and Mr. Ackerman , and when he gave his hand to the latter and said good-night he was still thoughtful . It was evident that the scenes he had witnessed had made a profound impression on him and that he was still immersed in the atmosphere of prairie schooners , lurking Indians , and desert hold-ups . Even when he reached the hotel he was too tense and broad awake to go to bed . " I wish you 'd tell me , Dad , how the first railroad across the country was built , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track was ever laid through such a wilderness . Did n't the Indians attack the workmen ? I should think they would have . " His father placed a hand kindly on his shoulder . " To-morrow we 'll talk trans-continental railroads , son , if by that time you still wish to , " said he . " But to-night we 'll go to bed and think no more about them . I am tired and am sure you must be . " " I 'm not ! " was the prompt retort . " I rather fancy you will discover you are after you have undressed , " smiled his father . " At any rate we 'll have to call off railroading for to-night , for if you are not sleepy , I am . " " But you wo n't have time to tell me anything to-morrow , " grumbled Steve , rising unwillingly from his chair . " You will be busy and forget all about it and --  " " I have nothing to do until eleven o'clock , " interrupted Mr. Tolman , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time I shall be free . And as for forgetting it -- well , you might possibly remind me if the promise passes out of my mind . " In spite of himself the boy grinned . " You can bank on my reminding you all right ! " he said , yawning . " Very well . Then it is a bargain . You do the reminding and I will do the story-telling . Are you satisfied and ready to go to bed and to sleep now ? " " I guess so , yes . " " Good-night then . " " Good-night , Dad . I -- I 've had a bully day . " CHAPTER XI THE CROSSING OF THE COUNTRY In spite of the many excitements crowded into his first day in New York Stephen found that when his head actually touched the pillow sleep was not long in coming and he awoke the next morning refreshed by a heavy and dreamless slumber . He was even dressed and ready for breakfast before his father and a-tiptoe to attack whatever program the day might present . Fortunately Mr. Tolman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt when a boy , and with generous appreciation for the lad 's impatience he scrambled up and made himself ready for a breakfast that was earlier , perhaps , than he would have preferred . " Well , son , " said he , as they took their places in the large dining room , " what is the prospect for to-day ? Are you feeling fit for more adventures ? " " I 'm primed for whatever comes , " smiled the boy . " That 's the proper spirit ! Indians , bandits and cowboys did not haunt your pillow then . " " I did n't stay awake to see . " " You are a model traveler ! Now we must plan something pleasant for you to do to-day . I am not sure that we can keep up the pace yesterday set us , for it was a pretty thrilling one . Robberies and arrests do not come every day , to say nothing of flotillas of ships and Wild West shows . However , we will do the best we can not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must dictate a few letters and glance over the morning paper . This wo n't take me long and while I am doing it I would suggest that you go into the writing room and send a letter to your mother . I will join you there in half an hour and we will do whatever you like before I go to my meeting . How is that ? " " Righto ! " Accordingly , after breakfast was finished , Steve wandered off by himself in search of paper and ink , and so sumptuous did he find the writing appointments that he not only dashed off a letter to his mother recounting some of the happenings of the previous day , but on discovering a rack of post cards he mailed to Jack Curtis , Tim Barclay , Bud Taylor and some of the other boys patronizing messages informing them that New York was " great " and he was sorry they were not there . In fact , it seemed at the moment that all those unfortunate persons who could not visit this magic city were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these egoistic missives the remainder of the time passed , and before he realized the half-hour was gone , he saw his father standing in the doorway . " I am going up to the room now to hunt up some cigars , Steve , " announced the elder man . " Do you want to come along or stay here ? " " I 'll come with you , Dad , " was the quick reply . The elevator shot them to the ninth floor in no time and soon they were in their room looking down on the turmoil in the street below . " Some city , is n't it ? " commented Mr. Tolman , turning away from the busy scene to rummage through his suit case . " It 's a corker ! " " I thought you would like to go out to the Zoo this morning while I am busy . What do you say ? " " That would be bully . " " It is a simple trip which you can easily make alone . If you like , you can start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said last night that if I would hurry to bed , to-day you would tell me about the Western railroads , " objected Stephen . He saw his father 's eyes twinkle . " You have a remarkable memory , " replied he . " I recall now that I did say something of the sort . But surely you do not mean that you would prefer to remain here and talk railroads than to go to the Zoo . " " I can go to the Zoo after you have gone out , " maintained Steve , standing his ground valiantly . " You are a merciless young beggar , " grinned his father . " I plainly see that like Shylock you are determined to have your pound of flesh . Well , sit down . We will talk while I smoke . " As the boy settled contentedly into one of the comfortable chintz-covered chairs , Mr. Tolman blew a series of delicate rings of smoke toward the ceiling and wrinkled his brow thoughtfully . " You got a pretty good idea at the theater last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began he slowly . " You know enough of geography too , I hope , to imagine to some extent what it must have meant to hew a path across such an immense country as ours ; lay a roadbed with its wooden ties ; and transport all this material as well as the heavy rails necessary for the project . We all think we can picture to ourselves the enormity of the undertaking ; but actually we have almost no conception of the difficulties such a mammoth work represented . " He paused , half closing his eyes amid the cloud of smoke . " To begin with , the promoters of the enterprise received scant encouragement to attack the problem , for few persons of that day had much faith in the undertaking . In place of help , ridicule cropped up from many sources . It was absurd , the public said , to expect such a wild-cat scheme to succeed . Why , over six hundred miles of the area to be covered did not contain a tree and in consequence there would be nothing from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food to come from if they were plunged into a wilderness beyond the reach of civilization ? The thing could n't be done . It was impossible . Of course it was a wonderful idea . But it never could be carried out . Where were the men to be found who would be willing to take their lives in their hands and set forth to work where Indians or wild beasts were liable to devour them at any moment ? Moreover , to build a railroad of such length would take a lifetime and where was the money coming from ? For you must remember that the men of that period had no such vast fortunes as many of them have now , and it was no easy task to finance a scheme where the outlay was so tremendous and the probability of success so shadowy . Even as late as 1856 the whole notion was considered visionary by the greater part of the populace . " " But the fun of doing it , Dad ! " ejaculated Stephen , with sparkling eyes . " The fun of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , there was fun in the adventure , there is no denying that ; and fortunately for the dreamers who saw the vision , men were found who felt precisely as you do . Youth always puts romance above danger , and had there not been these romance lovers it would have gone hard with the trans-continental railroads . We might never have had them . As it was , even the men who ventured to cast in their lot with the promoters had the caution to demand their pay in advance . They had no mind to be deluded into working for a precarious wage . At length enough toilers from the east and from the west were found who were willing to take a chance with their physical safety , and the enterprise was begun . " Stephen straightened up in his chair . " Had the only obstacle confronting them been the reach of uncharted country ahead that would have been discouraging enough . Fancy pushing your way through eight hundred miles of territory that had never been touched by civilization ! And while you are imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track left behind was your only link with home ; and your only hope of getting food , materials , and sometimes water . Ah , you would have had excitement enough to satisfy you had you been one of that company of workmen ! On improvised trucks they put up bunks and here they took turns in sleeping while some of their party stood guard to warn them of night raids from Indians and wild beasts . Even in the daytime outposts had to be stationed ; and more than once , in spite of every precaution , savages descended on the little groups of builders , overpowered them , and slaughtered many of the number or carried away their provisions and left them to starve . Sometimes marauders tore up the tracks , thereby breaking the connection with the camps in the rear from which aid could be summoned ; and in early railroad literature we find many a tale of heroic engineers who ran their locomotives back through almost certain destruction in order to procure help for their comrades . Supply trains were held up and swept clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered , so no money reached the employees ; every sort of calamity befell the men . Hundreds of the ten thousand Chinese imported to work at a microscopic wage died of sickness or exposure to the extreme heat or cold . " " Gee ! " gasped Stephen , " I 'd no idea it was so bad as all that ! " " Most persons have but a faint conception of the price paid for our railways -- paid not alone in money but in human life , " answered Mr. Tolman . " The route of the western railroads , you see , did not lie solely through flat , thickly wooded country . Our great land , you must remember , is made up of a variety of natural formations , and in crossing from the Atlantic coast to that of the Pacific we get them one after another . In contrast to the forests of mighty trees , with their tangled undergrowth , there were stretches of prairie where no hills broke the level ground ; another region contained miles and miles of alkali desert , dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steel rails that they became too hot to touch . Here men died of sunstroke and of fever ; and some died for want of water . Then directly in the railroad 's path arose the towering peaks of the Sierras and Rockies whose snowy crests must be crossed , and whose cold , storms and gales must be endured . Battling with these hardships the workmen were forced to drill holes in the rocky summits and bolt their rough huts down to the earth to prevent them from being blown away . " " I do n't see how the thing could have been done ! " Steve exclaimed , with growing wonder . " And you must not forget to add to the chapter of tribulations the rivers that barred the way ; the ravines that must either be filled in or bridged ; the rocks that had to be blasted out ; and the mountains that must be climbed or tunneled . " " I do n't see how they ever turned the trick ! " the boy repeated . " It is the same old tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over again , since time began , men have given their lives that the world might move forward and you and I enjoy the benefits of civilization . Remember it and be grateful to the past and to that vast army of toilers who offered up their all that you might , without effort , profit by the things it took their blood to procure . There is scarcely a comfort you have about you that has not cost myriad men labor , weariness , and perhaps life itself . Therefore value highly your heritage and treat the fruits of all hard work with respect ; and whenever you can fit your own small stone into the structure , or advance any good thing that shall smooth the path of those who are to follow you , do it as your sacred duty to those who have so unselfishly builded for you . " There was a moment of silence and the rumble of the busy street rose to their ears . " I never shall build anything that will help the men of the future , " observed Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is building all the time , " replied his father . " He is building a strong body that shall mean a better race ; a clean mind that shall mean a purer race ; a loyalty to country that will result in finer citizenship ; and a life of service to his fellows that will bring in time a broader Christianity . Will not the world be the better for all these things ? It lies with us to carry forward the good and lessen the evil of the universe , or tear down the splendid ideals for which our fathers struggled and retard the upward march of the universe . If everybody put his shoulder to the wheel and helped the forward spin of our old world , how quickly it would become a better place ! " As he concluded his remarks Mr. Tolman took out his watch . " Well , well ! " said he . " I had no idea it was so late . I must hurry or I shall not finish my story . " " As I told you the men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other from opposite ends of the country . As soon as short lengths of track were finished they were joined together . Near the great Salt Lake of Utah a tie of polished laurel wood banded with silver marked the successful crossing of Utah 's territory . Five years later Nevada contributed some large silver spikes to join her length of track to the rest . California sent spikes of solid gold , symbolic both of her cooperation and her mineral wealth ; Arizona one of gold , one of silver , and one of iron . Many other States offered significant tributes of similar nature . And when at last the great day came when all the short lines were connected in one whole , what a celebration there was from sea to sea ! Wires had been laid so that the hammer that drove the last spike sent the news to cities all over the land . Bells rang , whistles blew , fire alarms sounded . The cost of the Union Pacific was about thirty-nine million dollars and that of the Central Pacific about one hundred and forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different set of problems from those of the Northern , but many of the difficulties encountered were the same . Bands of robbers and Indians beset the workmen and either cut the ties and spread the rails , or tore the track up altogether for long distances . Forest fires often overtook the men before they could escape , although trains sometimes contrived to get through the burning areas by drenching their roofs and were able to bring succor to those in peril . Then there were washouts and snowstorms quite as severe as any experienced in the northern country . " " I 'm afraid I should have given the whole thing up ! " interrupted Steve . " Many another was of your mind , " returned Mr. Tolman . " The frightful heat encountered when crossing the deserts was , as I have said , the greatest handicap . Frequently the work was at a standstill for months because all the metal -- rails and tools -- became too hot to handle . The difficulty of getting water to the men in order to keep them alive in this arid waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly on all the railroads , northern as well as southern , and the suffering experienced when such cars were for various reasons stalled was tremendous . The sand storms along the Southern Pacific route were yet another menace . So you see an eagerness for adventure had to be balanced by a corresponding measure of bravery . Those early days of railroad building were not all romance and picturesqueness . " Stephen nodded as his father rose and took up his hat and coat . " I 'd like to hear Mr. Ackerman tell of the early steamboating , " remarked the lad . " I 'll bet the story could n't match the one you have just told . " " Perhaps not , " his father replied . " Nevertheless the steamships had their full share of exciting history and you must not be positive in your opinion until you have heard both tales . Now come along , son , if you are going with me , for I must be off . " Obediently Stephen slipped into his ulster and tagged at his father 's heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! And how had it happened that it had been his luck to be born now rather than in the pioneer days when there were not only no railroads but no great hotels like this one , and no elevators ? " I suppose , " observed Mr. Tolman , as they went along , " we can hardly estimate what the coming of these railroads meant to the country . All the isolated sections were now blended into one vast territory which brought the dwellers of each into a common brotherhood . It was no small matter to make a unit of a great republic like ours . The seafarer and the woodsman ; easterner , westerner , northerner , and southerner exchanged visits and became more intelligently sympathetic . Rural districts were opened up and made possible for habitation . The products of the seacoast and the interior were interchanged . Crops could now be transported ; material for clothing distributed ; and coal , steel , and iron -- on which our industries were dependent -- carried wherever they were needed . Commerce took a leap forward and with it national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our inventions or industries and forced to send to England for machinery . We could make our own engines , manufacture our own rails , coal our own boilers . Distance was diminished until it was no longer a barrier . Letters that it previously took days and even weeks to get came in hours , and the cost and time for freight transportation was revolutionized . In 1804 , for example , it took four days to get a letter from New York to Boston ; and even as late as 1817 it cost a hundred dollars to move a ton of freight from Buffalo to New York and took twenty days to do it . In every direction the railroads made for national advancement and a more solid United States . No soldiers , no statesmen of our land deserve greater honor as useful citizens than do these men who braved every danger to build across the country our trans-continental railways . " CHAPTER XII NEW PROBLEMS " I have been thinking , Dad , " said Steve that evening , while they sat at dinner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was some yarn . " His father laughed over the top of his coffee cup . " It was , was n't it ? " replied he . " And the half was not told then . I was in too much of a hurry to give you an idea of all the trials the poor railroad builders encountered . Did it occur to you , for example , that after the roads to the Pacific coast were laid their managers were confronted by another great difficulty ,  - -  the difference in time between the east and the west ? " " I never thought of that , " was Steve 's answer . " Of course the time must have differed a lot . " " Indeed it did ! Every little branch road followed the time peculiar to its own section of the country , and the task of unifying this so that a basis for a common time-table could be adopted was tremendous . A convention of scientists from every section of the country was called to see what could be done about the fifty-three different times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ejaculated Stephen , with a grin . " Why , that was almost as many as Heinz pickles . " " In this case the results of the fifty-three varieties were far more menacing , I am afraid , than those of the fifty-seven , " said his father , with a smile , " for travel under such a regime was positively unsafe . " " I can see that it would be . What did they do ? " " Well , after every sort of suggestion had been presented it was decided to divide the country up into four immense parts , separated from one another by imaginary lines running north and south . " " Degrees of longitude ? " " Precisely ! " returned Mr. Tolman , gratified that the boy had caught the point so intelligently . " The time of each of these sections jumped fifteen degrees , or one hour , and the railroads lying in each district were obliged to conform to the standard time of their locality . Until this movement went into effect there had been , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Boston to Washington . " " I do n't see why everybody did n't get smashed up ! " " I do n't either ; and I fancy the passengers and the railroad people did n't , " declared Mr. Tolman . " But with the new state of things the snarl was successfully untangled and the roads began to be operated on a more scientific basis . Then followed gradual improvements in cars which as time went on were made more comfortable and convenient . The invention of the steam engine and the development of our steel products were the two great factors that made our American railroads possible . With the trans-continental roads to carry materials and the opening up of our coal , iron and copper mines we were at last in a position to make our railroads successful . Then science began to evolve wonderful labor-saving machinery which did away with the slow , primitive methods our pioneer engineers had been obliged to employ . The steam shovel was invented , the traveling crane , the gigantic derrick , the pile driver . The early railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to do by hand the work that machinery could have performed in much less time . When one thinks back it is pathetic to consider the number of lives that were sacrificed which under present-day conditions might have been saved . Yet every great movement goes forward over the dead bodies of unnamed heroes . To an extent this is unavoidable and one of the enigmas of life . If every generation were as wise at the beginning as it is at the end there would be no progress . Nevertheless , when you reflect that ten thousand Chinese and Chilean laborers died while building one of the South American railroads it does make us wonder why we should be the ones to reap the benefits of so much that others sowed , does n't it ? " mused the boy 's father . " Do you mean to say that ten thousand persons were killed while that railroad was being built ? " questioned Stephen , aghast . " They were not all killed , " was the reply . " Many of them died of exposure to cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epidemics swept away hundreds of lives . This particular railroad was one of the mightiest engineering feats the world had seen for in its path lay the Andes Mountains , and there was no escape from either crossing or tunneling them . The great tunnel that pierces them at a height of 15,645 feet above sea level is one of the marvels of science . In various parts of the world there are other such monuments to man 's conquest of the opposing forces of nature . Honeycombing the Alps are spiral tunnels that curve round and round like corkscrews inside the mountains , rising slowly to the peaks and making it possible to reach the heights that must be traversed . Among these marvels is the Simplon Tunnel , famous the world over . The road that crosses the Semmering Pass from Trieste to Vienna is another example of what man can do if he must . By means of a series of covered galleries it makes its way through the mountains that stretch like a wall between Italy and Austria . In the early days this territory with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too difficult to cross . The railroad over the Brenner Pass between Innsbruck and Botzen penetrates the mountains of the Tyrol by means of twenty-three tunnels . " " I learned about the St. Gothard tunnel in school , " Steve interrupted eagerly . " Yes , that is yet another of the celebrated ones , " his father rejoined . " In fact , there are now so many of these miracles of skilful railroading that we have almost ceased to wonder at them . Railroads thread their way up Mt . Washington , Mt . Rigi , and many another dizzy altitude ; to say nothing of the cable-cars and funicular roads that take our breath away when they whirl us to the top of some mountain , either in Europe or in our own land . Man has left scarce a corner of our planet inaccessible , until now , not content with scaling the highest peaks by train , he has progressed still another stage and is flying over them . Thus do the marvels of one age become the commonplace happenings of the next . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their generation , that nothing could surpass them . In the same spirit we regard our aeroplanes and submarines with triumphant pride . But probably the time will come when those who follow us will look back on what we have done and laugh at our attempts just as you laughed when I told you of the first railroad . " Stephen was thoughtful for a moment . " It 's a great game -- living -- is n't it , Dad ? " " It is a great game if you make yourself one of the team and pull on the side of the world 's betterment , " nodded his father . " Think what such a thing as the railroad has meant to millions and millions of people . Not only has it opened up a country which might have been shut away from civilization for centuries ; but it has brought men all over the world closer together and made it possible for those of one land to visit those of another and come into sympathy with them . Japan , China , and India , to say nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days of ships and railroads . " " I suppose we should not have known much about those places , should we , " reflected the boy . " Certainly not so much as we do now , " was his father 's answer . " Of course , travelers did go to those countries now and then ; but to get far into their interior in a palanquin carried by coolies , for example , was a pretty slow business . " " And uncomfortable , too , " Stephen decided . " I guess the natives were mighty glad to see the railroads coming . " To the lad 's surprise his father shook his head . " I am afraid they were n't , " observed he ruefully . " You recall how even the more civilized and better educated English and French opposed the first railroads ? Well , the ignorant orientals , who were a hundred times more superstitious , objected very vehemently . The Chinese in particular feared that the innovation would put to flight the spirits which they believed inhabited the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if these gods were disturbed , disaster to the nation must inevitably follow . It was almost impossible to convince even the more intelligent leaders that the railroad would be a benefit instead of a menace for before the ancient beliefs argument was helpless . " " Well , the railroads were built just the same , were n't they ? " " Yes . Fortunately some of the more enlightened were led to see the wisdom of the enterprise , and they converted the others to their views or else overrode their protests . They were like a lot of children who did not know what was best for them and as such they had to be treated . Nevertheless , you may be quite certain that the pioneer days of railroad building in the East were not pleasant ones . Materials had to be carried for great distances both by water and by land . In 1864 , when the first locomotive was taken to Ceylon , it had to be transported on a raft of bamboo and drawn from the landing place to the track by elephants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's funny to think of , is n't it ? " " More funny to think of than to do , I guess , " asserted his father . " Still it is the battle against obstacles that makes life interesting , and in spite of all the hardships I doubt if those first railroad men would have missed the adventure of it all . Out of their resolution , fearlessness and vision came a wonderful fulfillment , and it must have been some satisfaction to know that they had done their share in bringing it about . " " I suppose that is what Mr. Ackerman meant when he spoke of the history of steamboating , " said the boy slowly . " Yes . He and his family had a hand in that great game and I do not wonder he is proud of it . And speaking of Mr. Ackerman reminds me that he called up this afternoon to ask if you would like to take a motor-ride with him to-morrow morning while I am busy . " " You bet I would ! " was the fervent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the engagement for you . He is coming for you at ten o'clock . And he will have quite a surprise for you , too . " " What is it ? " the boy asked eagerly . " It is not my secret to tell , " was the provoking answer . " You will know it in good time . " " To-morrow ? " " I think so , yes . " " Ca n't you tell me anything about it ? " " Nothing but that you were indirectly responsible for it . " " I ! " gasped Stephen . Mr. Tolman laughed . " That will give you something to wonder and to dream about , " he responded , rising from the table . " Let us see how much of a Sherlock Holmes you are . " Steve 's mind immediately began to speculate rapidly on his father 's enigmatic remark . All the way up in the elevator he pondered over the conundrum ; and all the evening he turned it over in his mind . At last , tired with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping that dreams might furnish him with a solution of the riddle . But although he slept hard no dreams came and morning found him no nearer the answer than he had been before . He must wait patiently for Mr. Ackerman to solve the puzzle . CHAPTER XIII DICK MAKES HIS SECOND APPEARANCE When Mr. Ackerman 's car rolled up to the hotel later in the morning the puzzle no longer lacked a solution for in the automobile beside the steamboat magnate sat Dick Martin , the lad of the pocketbook adventure . At first glance Steve scarcely recognized the boy , such a transformation had taken place in his appearance . He wore a new suit of blue serge , a smartly cut reefer , shiny shoes , a fresh cap , and immaculate linen . Soap and water , as well as a proper style of haircut had added their part to the miracle until now , with face glowing and eyes alight with pleasure , Dick was as attractive a boy as one would care to see . " I have brought Dick along with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three were in the car and speeding up Fifth Avenue . " He and I have been shopping and now he is coming home to stay with me until we hear from one of the schools to which I have written . If they can find a place for him he will start at once . Then he is going to study hard and see what sort of a man he can make of himself . I expect to be very proud of him some day . " The lad flushed . " I am going to do my best , " said he , in a low tone . " That is all any one can do , sonny , " declared Mr. Ackerman kindly . " You 'll win out . Do n't you worry ! I 'm not . " He smiled and Dick smiled back timidly . " Have you been up to Mr. Ackerman 's house yet and seen the boats ? " Stephen asked , to break the pause that fell between them . " His collection , you mean ? Sure ! I'm -- staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in the financier . " Then I suppose he 's told you all about them , " went on Stephen , a hint of envy in his tone . " I have n't yet , " laughed their host , " for there has n't been time . Dick only left the hotel yesterday and we have had a great deal to do since . We had to go to his lodgings and say good-by to the people there who have been kind to him and tell them why he was not coming back . And then there were errands and many other things to see to . So he has not been at home much yet , " concluded Mr. Ackerman , with a kindly emphasis on the final sentence . Dick beamed but it was evident that the magnitude of his good fortune had left him too overwhelmed for words . Perhaps neither of the boys minded that there was little conversation during the drive for there was plenty to see and to Dick Martin , at least , an automobile ride was such an uncommon experience that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back again , looking down on the river as they went , and exclaiming when some unusual craft passed them . Evidently Mr. Ackerman was quite content to let matters take their natural course ; but he was not unmindful of his guests and when at last he saw a shadow of fatigue circle Dick 's eyes and give place to the glow of excitement that had lighted them he said : " Now suppose we go back to the house for a while . We have an hour or more before Stephen has to rejoin his father and you two chaps can poke about the suite . What do you say ? " Steve was all enthusiasm . He had been quietly hoping there would be a chance for him to have another peep at the wonderful steamboats . " I 'd like nothing better ! " was his instant reply . " I did not see half I wanted to when I was there before , and we go home to-morrow , you know . If I do n't see your ships and things to-day I never shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Ackerman said quickly . " You and Dick and I are going to be great friends . We are not going to say good-by and never see one another any more . Sometime you will be coming to New York again , I hope . However , if he wants to have a second glimpse of our boats now we 'll let him , wo n't we , Dick ? " Again the boy smiled a timid smile into his benefactor 's face . Illustration : " I wish you 'd tell me about this queer little old-fashioned boat . " Page 181 . It did not take long to reach the house and soon the three were in the wonderful room with its panorama of ships moving past the windows and its flotilla of still more ships decorating the walls . " Now you boys go ahead and entertain yourselves as you please , " Mr. Ackerman said . " I am going to sit here and read the paper ; but if there is anything you want to ask me you are welcome to do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model of the quaint side-wheeler that had held his attention at the time of his first visit ; then he stole a furtive glance at the man in the big chair . " Did you really mean , Mr. Ackerman , " he faltered , " that we could ask you questions ? " " Certainly . " " Then I wish you 'd tell me about this queer little old-fashioned boat , and how you happened to put it between this up-to-date ocean liner and this battleship . " The elder man looked up . " That boat that interests you is a model of Fulton 's steamboat -- or at least as near a model as I could get , " explained he . " I put it there to show the progress we have made in shipbuilding since that day . " Steve laughed . " I see the progress all right , " replied he , " but I am afraid I do not know much about Fulton and his side-wheeler . " Mr. Ackerman let the paper slip into his lap . " I assumed every boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered he , half teasingly and yet with real surprise . " I suppose I ought to have learned about him , " retorted Stephen , with ingratiating honesty , " and maybe I did once . But if I did I seem to have forgotten about it . You see there are such a lot of those old chaps who did things that I get them all mixed up . " Apparently the sincerity of the confession pleased the capitalist for he laughed . " I know ! " returned he sympathetically . " Every year more and more things roll up to remember , do n't they ? Had we lived long ago , before so many battles and discoveries had taken place , and so many books been written , life would have been much simpler . Now the learning of all the ages comes piling down on our heads . But at least you can congratulate yourself that you are not so badly off as the boys will be a hundred years hence ; they , poor things , will have to learn all about what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly in history and in science as it is doing now , I pity them . Not only will they have to go back to Fulton but to him they will probably have to add a score of other inventors . " Both boys joined in the steamboat man 's hearty laugh . " Well , who was Fulton , anyway , Mr. Ackerman ? " Stephen persisted . " If you want me to tell you that Robert Fulton was the first American to make a successful steamboat I can give you that information in a second , " was the reply . " But if you wish to hear how he did it that is a much longer story . " " I like stories , " piped Dick from the corner of the couch where he was sitting . " So do I , " echoed Steve . " Then I see there is no help for me ! " Mr. Ackerman answered , taking off his spectacles and putting them into the case . With an anticipatory smile Stephen seated himself on the great leather divan beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " began Mr. Ackerman , " you must remember that paddle wheels had long been used , for both the Egyptians and the Romans had built galleys with oars that moved by a windlass turned by the hands of slaves or by oxen . Later there were smaller boats whose paddle wheels were driven by horses . So you see paddle wheels were nothing new ; the world was just waiting for something that would turn them around . After the Marquis of Worcester had made his steam fountain he suggested that perhaps this power might be used to propel a boat but unfortunately he died before any experiments with the idea could be made . Various scientists , however , in Spain , France , England and Scotland caught up the plan but after struggling unsuccessfully with it for a time abandoned it as impractical . In 1802 Lord Dundas , a proprietor in one of the English canals , made an encouraging start by using a tow-boat with a paddle wheel at its stern . But alas , this contrivance kicked up such a fuss in the narrow stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to pieces and therefore it was given up and for ten years afterward there was no more steamboating in England . " The boys on the couch chuckled . " In the meantime in America thoughtful men were mulling over the problem of steam navigation . Watt 's engine had opened to the minds of inventors endless possibilities ; and the success of the early railroads made many persons feel that a new era of science , whose wonders had only begun to unfold , was at hand . In Connecticut there lived a watchmaker by the name of John Fitch , who , although he knew little of the use of steam , knew much about machinery . Through the aid of a company that furnished him with the necessary money he built a steamboat which was tried out in 1787 and made three miles an hour . Of course it was not a boat like any of ours for it was propelled by twelve oars , or paddles , operated by a very primitive steam engine . Nevertheless , it was the forerunner of later and better devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credited with being the inventor of the steamboat . Perhaps , had he been able to go on with his schemes , he might have given the world something really significant in this direction ; but as it was he simply pointed the way . His money gave out , the company would do nothing further for him , and after building a second boat that could go eight miles an hour instead of three he became discouraged and intemperate and let his genius go to ruin , dying later in poverty -- a sad end to a life that might well have been a brilliant one . After Fitch came other experimenters , among them Oliver Evans of Philadelphia who seems to have been a man of no end of inventive vision . " " Was n't he the one who tried sails on a railroad train ? " inquired Steve , noting with pleasure the familiar name . " He was that very person , " nodded Mr. Ackerman . " He evidently had plenty of ideas ; the only trouble was that they did not work very well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he wanted to see what he could do with it aboard a boat . Either he was very impractical or else hard luck pursued his undertakings . At any rate , he had a boat built in Kentucky , an engine installed on it , and then he had the craft floated to New Orleans from which point he planned to make a trip up the Mississippi . But alas , before his boat was fully ready , there was a drop in the river and the vessel was left high and dry on the shore . " " Jove ! " exclaimed Dick involuntarily . " Pretty tough , was n't it ? " remarked Mr. Ackerman . " What did he do then ? " demanded Stephen . " Did he resurrect the boat ? " " No , it did not seem to be any use ; instead he had the engine and boiler taken out and put into a saw mill where once again hard luck pursued him , for the mill was burned not long after . That was the end of Oliver Evans 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Fitch and those following him were working at the steamboat idea here in America , Robert Fulton , also a native of this country , was turning the notion over in his mind . Strangely enough , he had not intended to be an inventor for he was in France , studying to be a painter . During a visit to England he had already met several men who were interested in the steam engine and through them had informed himself pretty thoroughly about the uses and action of steam . In Paris he made the acquaintance of a Mr. Barlow and the two decided to raise funds and build a steamboat to run on the Rhone . This they did , but unfortunately the boat sank before any degree of success had been achieved . Then Fulton , not a whit discouraged , told the French Government that if they would furnish the money he would build a similar boat to navigate the Seine . The French , however , had no faith in the plan and promptly refused to back it . " " I 'll bet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I presume they did , " agreed Mr. Ackerman . " It is very easy to see one 's mistakes after a thing is all over . Anyway , Mr. Barlow came back to America , where Fulton joined him , and immediately the latter went to building a steamboat that should be practical . On his way home he had stopped in England and purchased various parts for his engine and when he got to New York he had these set up in an American boat . You must not for a moment imagine that everything about this first steamboat of Fulton 's was original . On the contrary he combined what was best in the experiments of previous inventors . He adopted the English type of engine , the side paddle , everything that seemed to him workable . Barlow and a rich New Yorker named Livingston backed the enterprise . Now some time before the State of New York , half in jest and half in irony , had granted to Livingston the sole right to navigate the New York waters by means of ships driven by steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused much mirth for there were nothing but sailing ships in existence , and there was no prospect of there ever being any other kind of vessel . Hence the honor was a very empty one and nobody expected a time would arrive when it would ever be of any value to its owner . But Livingston was a shrewder and more far-seeing man than were the old legislators at Albany , and to Fulton he was an indispensable ally . " The boy listened breathlessly . " How these three men managed to keep their secret so well is a mystery ; but apparently they did , and when Fulton suddenly appeared on the Hudson with a steamboat named the Clermont for Mr. Livingston 's country seat on the Palisades , the public was amazed . A model of the boat with a miniature engine had previously been tried out so the three promoters had little doubt that their project would work , and it did . As the new craft moved along without any sails to propel it the sensation it made was tremendous . People were divided as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marvel at it . It is a pity that the newspapers of the period did not take the advent of this remarkable invention more seriously for it would have been interesting to know more of the impression it created . As it was little is recorded about it . Probably the very silence of the press is significant of the fact that there was scant faith in the invention , and that it was considered too visionary a scheme to dignify with any notice . However that may be , the newspapers passed this wonderful event by with almost no comment . History , however , is more generous and several amusing stories have come down to us of the fright the Clermont caused as she crept along the river at dusk with a shower of vermilion sparks rising from her funnel . One man who came around a bend of the stream in his boat and encountered the strange apparition for the first time told his wife afterward that he had met the devil traveling the river in a sawmill . " There was a shout of laughter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many distinguished guests were invited , took place a few days later , and after improving some of the defects that cropped up the steamboat was advertised to run regularly between New York and Albany . Now if you think this announcement was hailed with joy you are much mistaken , " continued Mr. Ackerman , smiling to himself at some memory that evidently amused him . " On the contrary the owners of the sailing ships which up to this time had had the monopoly of traffic were furious with rage . So vehemently did they maintain that the river belonged to them that at last the matter went to the courts and Daniel Webster was retained as Fulton 's counsel . The case attracted wide attention throughout the country , and when it was decided in Fulton 's favor there was great excitement . Every sort of force was brought to bear to thwart the new steamboat company . Angry opponents tried to blow up the boat as it lay at the dock ; attempts were made to burn it . At length affairs became so serious that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a public crime punishable by fine or imprisonment to attempt to injure the Clermont . " Mr. Ackerman paused to light a fresh cigar . " From the moment the law took this stand the success of the undertaking became assured and it is interesting to see how quickly the very men who jeered loudest at the enterprise now came fawning and begging to have a part in it . Other steamboats were added to the line and soon rival firms began to construct steamboats of their own and try to break up Fulton 's monopoly of the waters of the State . For years costly lawsuits raged , and in defiance of the right the New York legislature had granted to Livingston , the fiercest competition took place . Sometime I should like to tell you more of this phase of the story for it is a very exciting and interesting yarn . Yet in spite of all the strife and hatred that pursued him Fulton 's river-boats and ferries continued to run . " " The State stuck to its bargain , then , " murmured Steve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " replied Mr. Ackerman . " For a time they clung to their agreement ; but at last the courts withdrew the right as illegal , and poor Livingston , who had sunk the greater part of his fortune in the steamboat business , lived to see the fruit of his toil wrested from him . In point of fact , I believe the decision of the courts to have been a just one for no one person or group of persons should control the waterways of the country . You can see the wisdom of this yourself . Nevertheless , the decree hit Livingston pretty hard . It was the first step in the destruction of a monopoly , " added Mr. Ackerman whimsically . " Since then such decrees have become common happenings in America , monopolies being considered a menace to national prosperity . Certainly in this case it was well that the Supreme Court of the United States decided that all waters of the country should be free to navigators , no matter in what kind of vessel they chose to sail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , was n't it ? " observed Dick , who was plainly unconvinced as many another had been of the justice of the arguments . " Yes , " agreed Mr. Ackerman , smiling into his troubled eyes , " I grant you it was tough on them . " CHAPTER XIV A STEAMBOAT TRIP BY RAIL It was with a sense of deep regret that Stephen bade good-by to Mr. Ackerman and Dick and returned to the hotel to join his father . For the steamboat financier he had established one of those ardent admirations which a boy frequently cherishes toward a man of attractive personality who is older than himself ; and for Dick he had a genuine liking . There was a quality very winning in the youthful East-sider and now that the chance for betterment had come his way Steve felt sure that the boy would make good . There was a lot of pluck and grit in that wiry little frame ; a lot of honesty too , Stephen reflected , with a blush . He was not at all sure but that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the lead of him . Certainly he was not one who shrank from confessing when he had been at fault which , Steve owned with shame , could not be said of himself . For several days he had not thought of his automobile escapade but now once more it came to his mind , causing a cloud to chase the joyousness from his face . Alas , was he never to be free of the nagging mortification that had followed that single act ? Was it always to lurk in the background and make him ashamed to confront the world squarely ? Well , it was no use regretting it now . He had made his choice and he must abide by it . Nevertheless he was not quite so spontaneously happy when he met his father at luncheon and recounted to him the happenings of the morning . " Mr. Ackerman is taking a big chance with that boy , " was Mr. Tolman 's comment , when a pause came in the narrative . " I only hope he will not disappoint him . There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , Dick has some fine characteristics to build on -- honesty and manliness . I think the fact that he showed no coward blood and was ready to stand by what he had done appealed to Ackerman . It proved that although they had not had the same opportunity in life they at least had some good stuff in common . You ca n't do much with a boy who is n't honest . " Stephen felt the blood beating in his cheeks . Fortunately his father did not notice his embarrassment and as they soon were on their way to a picture show the memory that had so importunately raised its unwelcome head was banished by the stirring story of a Californian gold mine . Therefore by the time Stephen was ready to go to bed the ghost that haunted him was once more thrust into the background and he had gained his serenity . No , he was not troubled that night by dreams of his folly nor did he awaken with any remembrance of it . Instead he and his father chatted as they packed quite as pleasantly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , have you enjoyed your holiday ? " inquired Mr. Tolman , as they settled themselves in the great plush chairs of the parlor car and waited for the train to start . " Yes , I 've had a bully time , Dad . " " I 'm glad of that , " was the kind reply . " It was unlucky that my business took up so much more of my time than I had expected and that I had to leave you to amuse yourself instead of going about with you , as I had planned . It was too bad . However , if you have managed to get some fun out of your visit that is the main thing . In fact , I am not sure but that you rather enjoyed going about alone , " concluded he mischievously . Stephen smiled but did not reply . There was no denying that he had found being his own master a pleasant experience which had furnished him with a gratifying sense of freedom and belief in his own importance . What a tale he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked his mother would be to hear that he had been turned loose in a great city in this unceremonious fashion ! He could hear her now saying to his father : " I do n't see what you were thinking of , Henry , to let Stephen tear about all alone in a city like New York . I should have worried every instant if I had known what he was doing . Suppose anything had happened to him ! " Well , mercifully , nothing had happened ,  - -  that is , nothing worse than his falling into the hands of a detective and being almost arrested for robbery , reflected the boy with a grin . Perhaps Mr. Tolman interpreted his thoughts for presently he observed with a smile : " It is time you were branching out some for yourself , anyway , son . You are old enough now to be treated like a man , not like a little boy . " As he spoke he looked toward Stephen with an expression of such pride and affection that the force of it swept over the lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort his father was , he suddenly thought ; and how genuinely he believed in him ! Why not speak out now and clear up the wretched deception he had practiced , and start afresh with a clean conscience ? With impulsive resolve he gripped the arms of the chair and pulled himself together for his confession . But just at the crucial moment there was a stir in the aisle and a porter followed by two belated passengers hurried into the train which was on the brink of departure . That they had made their connection by a very narrow margin was evident in their appearance , for both were hot and out of breath , and the stout colored porter puffed under the stress of his haste and the heavy luggage which weighed him down . " It 's these two chairs , sir , " he gasped , as he tossed the new leather suit case into the rack . " Is there anything else I can do for you ? " " No , " replied the traveler , thrusting a bill into the darkey 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , " he added quickly . " Thank you , sir ! Thank you ! " stammered the vanishing negro . " Well , we caught it , did n't we , Dick ? It did n't look at one time as if it were possible . That block of cars on the avenue was terrible . But we are off now ! It was about the closest shave I ever made . " Then he turned around . " Hullo ! " he cried . " Who 's this ? Bless my soul ! " Both Mr. Tolman and Steve joined in the laugh of amazement . " Well , if this is n't a great note ! " went on Mr. Ackerman , still beaming with surprise . " I thought you people were not going until the afternoon train . " " I managed to finish up my business yesterday and get off earlier than I planned , " Mr. Tolman explained . " But I did not know you had any intention of going in this direction . " " I had n't until this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived saying they could take Dick at the New Haven school to which I had written if he entered right away , at the beginning of the term . So I dropped everything and here we are en route . It was rather short notice and things were a bit hectic ; but by turning the whole apartment upside down , rushing our packing , and keeping the telephone wire hot we contrived to make the train . " " It is mighty nice for us , " put in Mr. Tolman cordially . " So Dick is setting forth on his education , is he ? " " Yes , he is starting out to make of himself a good scholar , a good sport , a good athlete , and I hope a good man , " returned the New Yorker . " A pretty big order , is n't it , Dick ? " laughed Mr. Tolman . " It seems so , " returned the boy . " It is not a bit too big , " interrupted Mr. Ackerman . " Dick knows he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and I understand such things take time . But they can be done and we expect we are going to do them . " He flashed one of his rare smiles toward his protege and the lad smiled back frankly . " I expect so , too , " echoed Mr. Tolman . " You 've got plenty of backers behind you , Dick , and you have a clear path ahead . That is all any boy needs . " " You 're going back to school , are n't you , youngster ? " Mr. Ackerman suddenly inquired of Stephen . " Yes , sir . I start in next week . " " Decided yet whether you will be a railroad man like your Dad , or a steamboat man like me ? " went on the New Yorker facetiously . " Not yet . " " Oh , for shame ! It should not take you any time at all to decide a question like that , " the capitalist asserted teasingly . " What 's hindering you ? " Stephen gave a mischievous chuckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , " said he . " So far I know only half the steamboat story . " " I see ! In other words you think that between here and New Haven I might beguile the time by going on with the yarn I began yesterday . " " That thought crossed my mind , sir , yes . " " You should go into the diplomatic service , young man . Your talents are being wasted , " observed Mr. Ackerman good-humoredly . " Well , I suppose I could romance for the benefit of you two boys for part of the way , at least . It will give your father , Steve , a chance to go into the other car and smoke . Where did we break off our story ? Do you remember ? " " Where the United States said anybody had the right to sail anywhere he wanted to , in any kind of a boat he chose , " piped Dick with promptness . " Yes , yes . I recall it all now , " said Mr. Ackerman . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigate the waters of New York State by means of steamboats . So you want to hear more about it , do you ? " " Yes ! " came simultaneously from both the boys . " Then all aboard ! Tolman , you can read , or run off and enjoy your cigar . We are going on a steamboat cruise . " " Push off ! You wo n't bother me , " was the tolerant retort , as the elder man unfolded the morning paper . Mr. Ackerman cleared his throat . " Before this decree to give everybody an equal chance in navigating the waters of the country was handed down by the courts , " he began , " various companies , in defiance of Livingston 's contract , began building and running steamboats on the Hudson . Two rival boats were speedily in operation and it was only after a three years ' lawsuit that they were legally condemned and handed over to Fulton to be broken up . Then the ferryboat people got busy and petitioned the New York Legislature for the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Jersey sides of the river , and it is interesting to remember that it was on one of these ferry routes that Cornelius Vanderbilt , the great American financier , began his career . " " I never knew that ! " ejaculated Dick , intent on the story . " After the ruling of the Supreme Court in 1818 that all the waters of the country were free there was a rush to construct and launch steamers on the Hudson . The route was , you see , not only the most direct one between Albany and New York but it also lay in the line of travel between the eastern States and those of the west which were just being opened to traffic by the railroads and ships of the Great Lakes . Now you must not for a moment imagine that in those days there were any such vast numbers of persons traversing the country as there are now . Our early Americans worked hard and possessed only comparatively small fortunes so they had little money to throw away on travel simply for its own sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . Nevertheless there were a good many persons who were obliged to travel , and it followed that each of the Hudson River lines of steamers was eager to secure their patronage . Hence a bitter competition arose between the rival steamboat companies . " He paused and smiled whimsically at some memory that amused him . " Every inducement was offered the public by these battling forces . The older vessels were scrapped or reduced to tug service and finer steamboats were built ; and once upon the water the engines were driven at full speed that quicker trips might lure passengers to patronize the swifter boats . Captains and firemen pitted their energies against one another and without scruple raced their ships , with the result that there were many accidents . In spite of this , however , the rivalry grew rather than diminished . " " It must have been great sport , " remarked Stephen . " Oh , there was sport in plenty , " nodded Mr. Ackerman . " Had you lived during those first days of Hudson River transportation you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steamboat feud raged with fury , the several companies trying their uttermost to get the trade away from the Fulton people and from one another . Money became no object , the only aim being to win in the game . Fares were reduced from ten dollars to one , and frequently passengers were carried for nothing simply for the sheer spite of getting them away from other lines . Vanderbilt was in the thick of the fray , having now accumulated sufficient fortune to operate no less than fifty boats . Among the finest vessels were those of the Emerald Line ; and the Swallow and the Rochester , two of the speediest rivals , were continually racing each other . The devices resorted to in order to ensnare passengers were very amusing : some boats carried bands ; others served free meals ; and because there were few newspapers in those days , and only limited means for advertising , runners were hired to go about the city or waylay prospective travelers at the docks and try to coax them into making their trip by some particular steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " laughed Steve . " And often a very effective way , too , " rejoined Mr. Ackerman . " In June of 1847 a tremendously exciting race took place between the Oregon and the Vanderbilt , then a new boat , for a thousand dollars a side . The steamers left the Battery at eleven o'clock in the morning and a dense crowd turned out to see them start . For thirty miles they kept abreast ; then the Oregon gained half a length and in passing the other boat bumped into her , damaging her wheelhouse . It was said at the time that the disaster was not wholly an accident . Certainly there were grounds for suspicion . As you may imagine , the calamity roused the rage of the competing boat . But the commander of the Oregon was undaunted by what he had done . All he wished was to win the race and that he was determined to do . He got up a higher and higher pressure of steam , and used more and more coal until , when it was time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given out and that he had no more fuel . " " And he had to give up the race ? " queried Dick breathlessly . " Not he ! He was n't the giving-up kind , " said Mr. Ackerman . " Finding nothing at hand to run his boilers with he ordered all the expensive fittings of the boat to be torn up and cast into the fire -- woodwork , furniture , carvings ; anything that would burn . In that way he kept up his furious rate of speed and came in victorious by the rather close margin of twelve hundred feet . " " Bully for him ! " cried Dick . But Stephen did not echo the applause . " It was not a square race , " he said , " and he had no right to win . Anyway , his steamboat must have been pretty well ruined . " " I fancy it was an expensive triumph , " owned Mr. Ackerman . " Without doubt it cost much more than the thousand dollars he won to repair the vessel . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the company . " " Were there other races like that ? " Dick asked . " Yes , for years the racing went on until there were so many fires , explosions and collisions , that the steamer inspection law was put through to regulate the conditions of travel . It certainly was high time that something was done to protect the public , too , for such universal recklessness prevailed that everybody was in danger . Boats were overloaded ; safety valves were plugged ; boilers carried several times as much steam as they had any right to do , and many lives had been sacrificed before the government stepped in and put a stop to this strife for fame and money . Since then the traffic on the Hudson has dropped to a plane of sanity and is now carried on by fine lines of boats that conform to the rules for safety and efficient service . " " And what became of Mr. Vanderbilt ? " interrogated Dick , who was a New Yorker to the core and had no mind to lose sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Vanderbilt was a man who had many irons in the fire , " replied Mr. Ackerman , smiling at the boy 's eagerness . " He did not need to be pitied for just about this time gold was discovered in California and as the interest of the country swung in that direction Vanderbilt , ever quick to seize an opening wherever it presented itself , withdrew some of his steamers from the Hudson and headed them around to the Pacific coast instead . " " And your family , Mr. Ackerman , were mixed up in all this steamboat rumpus ? " commented Steve suddenly . " Yes , my grandfather was one of the Hudson River racers and quite as bad as the rest of them , " the man replied . " Nevertheless he was a stanch , clever old fellow , and because he did his part toward building up the commerce and prosperity of the nation I have always regarded him with the warmest respect . I do not approve of all his methods , however , any more than I approve of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looked back upon with as much shame as these have been . There are moments , I must confess , when I wonder if we , with all our supposed enlightenment , have made any very appreciable advance over the frank and open racing done by our forefathers on the Hudson , " reflected he half-humorously . " Perhaps we are a trifle more humane ; and yet there is certainly much to be desired in the way we still sacrifice the public to our greed for money . An evil sometimes has to come to a climax to make us conscious of our injustice . Let us hope that our generation will not be so blind that it will not heed the warnings of its conscience , and instead delay until some such catastrophe comes upon it as pursued the racing boats of the Hudson River . " CHAPTER XV THE ROMANCE OF THE CLIPPER SHIP It was with genuine regret that Mr. Tolman and Stephen parted from Mr. Ackerman and Dick when the train reached New Haven . " We shall not say good-by to Dick , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very far away and I hope sometime he will come to Coventry and spend a holiday with us . Why do n't you plan to do that too , Ackerman ? Run over from New York for Thanksgiving and bring the boy with you . Why not ? " " That is very kind of you . " " But I mean it , " persisted Mr. Tolman . " It is no perfunctory invitation . Plan to do it . We should all be delighted to have you . There is nothing in the world Mrs. Tolman loves better than a houseful of guests . Doris will be home from college and I should like you to see what a fine big daughter I have . As for Steve --  " " I wish you would come , Mr. Ackerman , " interrupted the boy . Mr. Ackerman hesitated . " I tell you what we 'll do , " replied he at length . " We 'll leave it to Dick . If he makes a good record at school and earns the holiday we will accept your invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that a bargain , youngster ? " he concluded , turning to the lad at his side . The boy flushed . " It is a rather stiff one , sir , " he answered , with a laughing glance . " I think that 's playing for too high stakes , Ackerman , " Mr. Tolman objected . " It is a little rough to put all the burden on Dick . Suppose we divide up the responsibility and foist half of it on Stephen ? Let us say you will come if both boys make good in their studies and conduct . " Dick drew a breath of relief at the words , regarding the speaker with gratitude . " That is a squarer deal , is n't it ? " continued Mr. Tolman . " I think so -- yes , " was Dick 's response . " And you , Steve -- do you subscribe to the contract ? " " Yes , I 'll sign , " grinned Stephen . " Then the agreement is clinched , " exclaimed his father , " and it will be the fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jolly reunion at Thanksgiving time . Good-by Ackerman ! Good-by , Dick . Good luck to you ! We are pinning our faith on you , remember . Do n't disappoint us . " " I 'll try not to , " the boy answered , as he stepped to the platform . " Dick is a fine , manly young chap , " observed Mr. Tolman , after the train was once more under way and he and Stephen were alone . " I have a feeling that he is going to make good , too . All he needed was a chance . He has splendid stuff in him . There is n't a mean bone in his body . " Stephen moved uncomfortably in his chair and a guilty blush rose to his cheek but apparently his father did not notice it . " You liked Mr. Ackerman also , did n't you , son ? Indeed there is no need to ask for he is a genius with young people and no boy could help liking a man of his type . It is a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of a boy 's school . " " He is corking at story-telling ! " was Steve 's comment . " He certainly is . I caught some fragments of his Hudson River tale and did not wonder that it fascinated you . What a remarkable era that was ! " he mused . " There were a lot of questions I wanted to ask him , " Stephen said . " Such as ? " " Well , for one thing I was curious to know what happened after the steamers on the Hudson were proved a success . " " I can answer that question , " replied his father promptly . " After the river boats had demonstrated their practicability steamships were built for traffic along short distances of the coast . Owing to the War of 1812 and the danger to our shipping from the British , however , the launching of these new lines did not take place immediately ; but in time the routes were established . The first of these was from New York to New Haven . You see , travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Norwich , first proposed as a destination , was felt to be too far away . It was like taking one 's life in one 's hands to venture such an immense distance from land on a steamboat . " Stephen smiled with amusement . " But gradually , " continued Mr. Tolman , " the public as well as the steamboat companies became more daring and a line from New York to Providence , with Vanderbilt 's Lexington as one of the ships , was put into operation . Then in 1818 a line of steamers to sail the Great Lakes was built ; and afterwards steamships to travel to points along the Maine coast . The problem of navigation on the rivers of the interior of the country followed and here a new conundrum in steamboat construction confronted the builders , for the channels of many of the streams were shallow and in consequence demanded a type of boat very long and wide in proportion to its depth of hull . After such a variety of boat had been worked out and constructed , lines were established on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old spirit of rivalry that pervaded the Hudson years before cropped up in these other localities . Bitter competition , for example , raged between the boats that plied up and down the Mississippi ; and in 1870 a very celebrated race took place between the Natchez and the Robert E. Lee . The distance to be covered was 1218 miles and the latter ship made it in three days , eighteen hours , and thirty minutes . The test , however , was not a totally fair one since the Natchez ran into a fog that held her up for six hours . But the event illustrates the keen interest with which men followed the progress of American shipping ; and you can see how natural it was that after the river boats , lake steamers , coastwise vessels and tugs had had their day the next logical step ( and very prodigious one ) was the --  " " The ocean liner ! " ejaculated Stephen . " Precisely ! " nodded his father . " Now there are two separate romances of our ocean-going ships . The first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure and bravery as enthralling as any you could wish to read . I wish I had time to tell it to you in full and do it justice , but I fear I can only sketch in a few of the facts and leave you to read the rest by yourself some time . You probably know already that whalers went out from Gloucester , New Bedford , and various of our eastern ports and often were gone on two or three-year cruises ; and when you recall that in those early days there not only was no wireless but not even the charts , lighthouses , and signals of a thoroughly surveyed coast you will appreciate that setting forth on such a voyage for whale-oil ( then used almost exclusively for lighting purposes ) took courage . Of course the captains of the ships had compasses for the compass came into use just before the beginning of the Fifteenth Century and was one of the things that stimulated the Portuguese and Spaniards to start out on voyages of discovery . The Spaniards built ships that were then considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm of the period and with the newly invented compass to guide him was stirred to brave the ocean and discover other territory to add to the riches of the land he loved . It was a golden age of romance and adventure and the journeys of Columbus grew out of it quite naturally . But in America shipping had its foundation in no such picturesque beginning . The first vessel made in this country was constructed as a mere matter of necessity , being built at the mouth of the Kennebec River to carry back to England a group of disheartened , homesick settlers . " He paused thoughtfully a moment . " Even the ships of later date had their birth in the same motive -- that of necessity . The early colonists were forced to procure supplies from England and they had no choice but to build ships for that purpose . At first these sailing packets were very small , and as one thinks of them to-day it is to marvel that they ever made so many trips without foundering . As for our coastwise ships , up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder where the word schooner came from , " commented Steve . " The legend goes that the term scoon was a colloquialism used when skipping stones . When a pebble glanced along the top of the water it was said to scoon , " answered his father , with a smile . " After the War of 1812 was over and our American vessels were safe from possible attack , and after the country itself had recovered somewhat from the stress of this financial burden so that men had more money to invest in commerce , we began to branch out and build finer vessels ; and when it came to rigging them there seemed to be no name to apply to the arrangement of the sails . The story goes that one day as one of these new ships sailed out of Gloucester harbor a fisherman watching her exclaimed with admiration , ' See her scoon ! ' The phrase not only caught the public fancy but that of the shipbuilders as well , and the word schooner was quickly adopted . " " I never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concluded . " Slowly the models of ships improved , " went on his father , without heeding the interruption . " Vessels became larger , faster , more graceful . Even the whalers and fishing smacks took on more delicate lines . Merchants from Salem , Gloucester , New Bedford invested their hard-earned savings in whalers and trading ships , and many of them made their fortunes by so doing . The sailing packets that went to Liverpool began to make excellent time records . Although the English were now using steamers for trans-Atlantic travel they had not perfected them to a sufficient extent to make their trips faster than those of sailing ships . " " About how long did it take them to cross ? " inquired Stephen . " The average time to Liverpool was from nineteen to twenty-one days , " was the answer . " And for the return voyage from thirty to thirty-five . " " Whew , Dad ! Why , one could walk it in that time ! " exclaimed the lad . " It was a long time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure it by present-day standards . Think how novel a thing it was to cross the ocean at all ! " " I suppose so , " came reflectively from Stephen . " It was not long , " continued his father , " before the English improved their engines so that their steamers made better time , and then our American sailing packets were left far behind . This , as you can imagine , did not please our proud and ambitious colonists who were anxious to increase their commerce and build up their young and growing country . Something must be done ! As yet they had not mastered the enigma of steam but they could make their sailing ships swifter and finer and this they set to work to do . Out of this impetus for prosperity came the remarkable clipper-ship era . " We shall probably never see such beautiful ships again , " continued Mr. Tolman , a trifle sadly . " Youth and romance go hand in hand , and our country was very young , and proud and eager in those days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world were strange , unexplored and alluring . It is like an Arabian Night 's Tale to read of those wonderful ships built to carry merchandise to China , India and other foreign ports . Speed was their aim -- speed , speed , speed ! They must hold their own against the English steamers if they would keep their place on the seas . For in those days the methods of packing produce were very primitive , and it was imperative that such perishable things as tea , dried fruits , spices and coffee should be rushed to the markets before the dampness spoiled them . If they mildewed they would be a dead loss to the merchants handling them . Moreover as cable and telegraph were unknown there was no way to keep in touch with the demands of the public , or be sure of prices . Therefore every merchant hurried his goods home in the hope of being the first in the field and reaping the largest profits . " " More racing ! " exclaimed Stephen . " It was racing , indeed ! " returned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each trying desperately to discharge her cargo before her rival did . Like great sea-birds these beautiful boats skimmed the waves , stretching every inch of canvas to be the winner at the goal . As a result the slow merchant packets with their stale cargoes could find no patrons , the clippers commanding not only all the trade but the highest prices for produce as well . Silks , chinaware , ivory , bamboo -- all the wealth of the Orient began to arrive in America where it was hungrily bought up , many a man making his fortune in the East India trade . Of this fascinating epoch Hawthorne gives us a vivid picture . " " It must have been great to travel on one of those ships ! " said Stephen . " It was not all pleasure , by any means , son , " Mr. Tolman replied . " Often the vessels encountered hurricanes and typhoons in the treacherous Eastern waters . Sometimes ships were blown out of their course and wrecked , or cast ashore on islands where their crews became the prey of cannibals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outs -- this cruising to distant ports , " announced his father . " Moreover , the charts in use were still imperfect and lighthouse protection was either very scanty or was lacking entirely . " " What became of the clipper ships ? " " Well , we Americans never do anything by halves , you know . When we go in we go in all over , " laughed his father . " That is what we did with our clipper ships . We were so pleased with them that we built more and more , sending them everywhere we could think of . Many went around to California to carry merchandise to the gold searchers . At last there were so many of these swift vessels that they cut into one another and freight rates dropped . Besides , steamboats were coming into general use and were now running on all the more important ocean routes . The day of the sailing ship was over and the marvelous vessels were compelled to yield their place to the heralds of progress and become things of the past . Nevertheless , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have them to thank not only for the fame they brought our country but also for much of its wealth . " With a quick gesture of surprise he rose hurriedly . " See ! " he exclaimed . " We are almost home . We have talked ' ships and sealing-wax ' for hours . " " It has n't seemed for hours , " retorted Stephen , springing to collect his luggage . " Nor to me , either . " " Some time I 'd like to hear about the ocean liners , " ventured the boy . " You must get Mr. Ackerman to tell you that story when he comes to visit us Thanksgiving , " was the reply , " if he does come . That part of it seems to be up to you and Dick . " " I mean to do my part to get him here , " Steve announced . " I hope Dick will plug , too . " " I rather think you can trust him for that , " was the quiet answer . CHAPTER XVI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief hour 's journey brought the travelers safely to Coventry where Havens met them with the automobile . " This will be our last ride this fall , " observed Mr. Tolman , as he loitered on the platform while the luggage was being lifted into the car . " We shall have to put the motor up in a day or two . It will not need much of an overhauling in the way of repairs this season , I guess , for it is comparatively new and should be in pretty good condition . There may be a few slight things necessary but nothing much . Is n't that so , Havens ? " " It is badly scratched , sir . " " Scratched ! " " Yes , sir -- both inside and out . I wonder you have n't noticed it . Still you would n't unless you got it in just the right light . I did not myself at first . There are terrible scratches everywhere . You would think ten men had climbed all over it . Look ! " " Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed Mr. Tolman good-humoredly , evidently not taking the chauffeur 's comment seriously . " The car was new in the spring and we have not given it very hard wear . What little luggage we have carried has been carefully put in ; I have seen to that myself . Only a short time ago I thought how splendidly fresh the varnish looked . In fact , I examined it just before you were ill . It ca n't have become very much defaced since then for we have not had the car out of the garage except for one short excursion . " Havens ' brow darkened into a puzzled frown . " I do n't understand it at all , sir , " he replied . " I could swear the scratches were not there when I went away . If you did n't tell me yourself the car had n't been used much I 'd stake my oath it had had a great deal of knocking about while I was gone . Look here , Mr. Tolman ! Look at that , and that , and that -- great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had climbed over the sides . " Mr. Tolman looked and so , with a sinking heart , did Stephen . " Mercy on us ! I never noticed all this before ! " cried Mr. Tolman , in consternation . " What in the world --  " he stopped as if he could find no words to voice his amazement . " Look at this ! " He placed a finger on a broad , clearly defined line that extended from the top of the tonneau to the bottom . " You would think somebody had dug his heels in here and then slid down until he reached the ground ! And this ! What on earth has happened to the thing , Havens ? It looks as if it had been used for a gymnasium . " Hot and cold by turns , Steve listened . The marks to which his father pointed told a truthful story . Somebody had braced his heels against the side and then slid to the ground ; it was Bud Taylor . And that other jagged line indicated where Tim Barclay had scrambled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole miserable adventure was etched in the varnish as vividly as if it had been traced there in words . Stephen gasped with horror when he saw how plainly the entire story stood out in the sunlight of the November day . Why , the most stupid person alive could read it ! Every moment he expected that his father or Havens would wheel on him and ask accusingly : " When was it you carried all those boys to Torrington ? " He could hear his heart thumping inside him and feel the beat of the blood that scorched his cheek . He had not pictured a dilemma like this . The affair had gone off so smoothly that he had flattered himself every possibility of discovery was past , and in this comforting knowledge he had basked with serenity . And now , behold , here he was at the brink of peril , and just when he had had such a glorious holiday , too ! " How do you solve the riddle , Havens ? " he heard his father asking . " I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawling answer . " Maybe Steve could give you a hint , though , " he added slyly . The lad stiffened . He and Havens had never been friends . They had been through too many battles for that . The chauffeur did not like boys and took no trouble to conceal the fact , and as a result he had been the prey of many a mischievous prank . It was through his vigilance that Stephen had more than once been brought to justice and in the punishment that followed Havens had exulted without restraint . As a retaliation the boy tormented him whenever opportunity presented , the two carrying on a half-bitter , half-humorous feud which was a source of mutual gratification . Had not this been the case the confession that trembled on Stephen 's tongue would doubtless have been uttered then and there . But to speak before Havens and afford him the chance to crow and rejoice ,  - -  that was not to be thought of . Therefore , drawing in his chin and holding his head a trifle higher than was his wont , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to offer . How could I have ? " For the fraction of a second Mr. Tolman looked sharply at his son as if some new thought had suddenly struck him ; then the piercing scrutiny faded from his eyes and he turned away . " Well , I guess we shall have to drop the matter for the present , anyway , and be getting home , " said he . " It will do no good for us to stand here in the cold and argue . We shall be no nearer an answer . Come , jump in , Steve ! " With a strange sense of reluctance the boy obeyed . He felt the door to confession closing with finality behind him ; and now that he saw all chance for dallying on its threshold cut off , he began to regret that it should so completely close . Once again the opportunity to clear his conscience had come about in an easy , natural manner ; confession had been gently and tactfully invited and he had turned his back . Never again , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ignominious preamble he could have spoken the few words necessary and been a free man ! But alas , he had hesitated too long . His father followed him into the car , banged the door , and they shot homeward . Perhaps , temporized the lad as they rode along , he would say something when they reached the house . Why was n't it better anyway to wait until he and his father were quiet and alone ? Who could blame him for not wanting to confess his misdemeanors before an audience ? His father would understand and forgive his reticence , he was sure . Having lulled his conscience to rest with the assurance of this future reparation he sank back against the cushions and drew the robe closer about him . There was no use in letting the ride be spoiled by worry . He did not need to speak until he got back , and he need n't speak at all if he did not wish to . If no favorable opening occurred , why , he could still remain silent and wait a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise ; nothing actually bound him to act unless he chose . It was surprising how his spirits rose with this realization . He even ventured to talk a little and make a joke or two . These overtures received only scant response from his father , however , for Mr. Tolman 's brow had settled into a frown and it needed no second glance to assure Stephen that the happenings of the past half-hour had put the elder man very much out of humor . How unfortunate , mused the boy , that this mood should have come upon his father . It would take more than an ordinary measure of courage to approach him now . Why , it would be braving the lions , actually tempting fate to go to him with a confession when he looked like this . Would it not be much wiser to wait ? With a sharp swerve they turned in at the gate and rolled up the long driveway ; then the front door burst open and from it issued not only Mrs. Tolman and Doris but with them the girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at Northampton . A hubbub of greeting ensued and in the interchange of gay conversation all thought of confession was swept from Stephen 's mind . Nor in the days that followed , with their round of skating , hockey , snow-shoeing , and holiday festivities , did the inclination to revert to the follies of the past arise . The big red touring-car was sent away without further allusion to its battered condition and with its departure the last link with the misfortunes that tormented him seemed destroyed . Once , it is true , when he overheard his father telling his mother that the bill for repainting and varnishing the car was going to be very large , his conscience smote him . But what , he argued , could he do ? Even were he to come forward now and shoulder the blame it would not reduce the expense of which his father complained . He had no money . Therefore he decided it was better to close his ears and try and forget the entire affair . His father had evidently accepted the calamity with resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further demur . Why not let the matter rest there ? At this late date it would be absurd to speak , especially when it could not alter the situation . In the meantime letters came from Mr. Ackerman and from Dick . The latter was very happy at the New Haven school and was making quite a record for himself , and it was easy to detect between the lines of the steamboat magnate 's epistle that he was much gratified by the progress of his protege . Thanksgiving would soon be here and if the Tolmans still extended their invitation for the holidays the two New Yorkers would be glad to accept it . " I 'll write Ackerman to-day , " announced Mr. Tolman at breakfast . " The invitation has hung on Stephen and Dick , and I am glad to say they each have made good . How fine that that little East Side chap should have turned out so well ! I do n't wonder Ackerman is pleased . Everybody does not get appreciation in return for kindness . I know many a parent whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unworthy conduct and utter ingratitude . Dick may not have been born into prosperity but he is a thoroughbred at heart and it shows in his actions . He is every inch a gentleman . " At the words Stephen 's blood tingled . What would his father think of him if he knew what a mean-spirited coward he was ? Well , it was impossible to tell him now . It would upset the whole Thanksgiving party . CHAPTER XVII MORE STEAMBOATING The night before Thanksgiving Mr. Ackerman and Dick arrived at Coventry and it was difficult to believe the change wrought in the New York boy . Not only was his face round , rosy and radiant with happiness but along with a new manliness had stolen a gentler bearing and a courtesy that had not been there when he had set forth to school . " Why , you must have put on ten pounds , Dick ! " cried Mr. Tolman , shaking hands with his young guest after greeting the steamboat magnate . " It is eleven pounds , sir , " laughed Dick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of them . " The final phrase had a reminiscent ring as if it harked back to a time when three ample meals were a mirage of the imagination . " Well , I am glad to hear you have done justice to them and encouraged the cook , " was Mr. Tolman 's jocular reply . " Now while you stay here you must cheer on our cook in the same fashion . If you do n't we shall think you like New Haven better . " " I guess there is no danger of that , " put in Mr. Ackerman . " Dick seems hollow down to his ankles . There is no filling him up ; is there , boy ? " " I could n't eat that third ice-cream you offered me yesterday , " was the humorous retort . " I hope you 've saved some room for to-morrow 's dinner , " Mrs. Tolman interrupted , " for there will be mince pie and plum pudding and I do n't know what not . And then there is the turkey -- we ordered an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sheepish grin . " Well , it is jolly to see you good people , " Mr. Tolman declared , as he ushered the visitors into the living room , where a bright fire burned on the hearth . " Our boys have done well , have n't they , Ackerman ? I do n't know which is to win the scholarship race -- the steamboats or the railroads . " " We could compare marks , " Stephen suggested . " That would hardly be fair , " Mr. Ackerman objected quickly , " for the steamboats did not start even with the railroads in this contest . Dick has had to put in a lot of hours with a tutor to make up for the work he missed at the beginning of the year . He has been compelled to bone down like a beaver to go ahead with his class ; but he has succeeded , have n't you , sonny ? " " I hope I have , " was the modest retort . " Furthermore , " went on Mr. Ackerman , " there are other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want fine , manly boys as well as wise ones . Conduct counts for a great deal , you know . " Stephen felt himself coloring . " There have been no black marks on Dick 's record thus far . How about yours , Steve ? " asked the New York man . " I -- er -- no . I have n't had any black marks , either , " responded Stephen , with a gulp of shame . " That is splendid , is n't it ! " commented Mr. Ackerman . " I was n't looking for them . You have too fine a father to be anything but a square boy . " Once more Stephen knew himself to be blushing . If they would only talk about something else ! " Are you going to finish your steamboat story for us while you are here ? " inquired he with sudden inspiration . " Why , I had not thought of doing any steamboating down here , " laughed the capitalist . " Rather I came to help the Pilgrims celebrate their first harvest . " " But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested Doris mischievously . " I admit that , " owned the New Yorker . " And what is more , they probably would have come in a steamboat if one had been running at the time . " " What was the first American steamship to cross the Atlantic , Ackerman ? " questioned Mr. Tolman when they were all seated before the library fire . " I suppose the Savannah had that distinction , " was the reply . " She was built in New York in 1818 to be used as a sailing packet ; but she had side wheels and an auxiliary engine , and although she did not make the entire trans-Atlantic distance by steam she did cover a part of it under steam power . Her paddle wheels , it is interesting to note , were so constructed that they could be unshipped and taken aboard when they were not in use , or when the weather was rough . I believe it took her twenty-seven days to make the trip from Savannah to Liverpool and eighty hours of that time she was using her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite a while before the American public was sufficiently convinced of the value of steam to build other steamships . A few small ones appeared in our harbors , it is true , but they came from Norway or England ; they made much better records , too , than anything previously known , the Sirius crossing in 1838 in nineteen days , and the Great Western in fifteen . In the meantime shipbuilders on both sides of the Atlantic were studying the steamboat problem and busy brains in Nova Scotia and on the Clyde were working out an answer to the puzzle . One of the most alert of these brains belonged to Samuel Cunard , the founder of the steamship line that has since become world famous . In May , 1840 , through his instrumentality , the Unicorn set out from England for Boston arriving in the harbor June third after a voyage of sixteen days . When we reflect that she was a wooden side-wheeler , not much larger than one of our tugboats , we marvel that she ever put in her appearance . Tidings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when after much anxious watching she was sighted there was the greatest enthusiasm along the water front , the over-zealous populace who wished to give her a royal welcome setting off a six-pounder in her honor that shattered to atoms most of her stained glass as she tied up at the dock . " His audience laughed . " You see , " continued the capitalist , " the ship came in answer to a circular sent out by our government to various shipbuilders asking bids from swift and reliable boats to carry our mails to England . Cunard immediately saw the commercial advantages of such an opportunity , and not having money enough to back the venture himself the Halifax man went to Scotland where he met Robert Napier , a person who like himself had had wide experience in shipping affairs . Both men were enthusiastic over the project ; before long the money necessary for the undertaking was raised , and the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company , with a line of four ships , was awarded the United States Government contract . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England , the Arcadia as a compliment to Mr. Cunard 's Nova Scotia home , the Caledonia in memory of Napier 's Scotch ancestry , and the Columbia out of regard to America . And in passing it is rather interesting to recall that in homage to these pioneer ships it has become a tradition of the Cunard Line to use names that terminate in the letter a for all the ships that have followed them . For , you must remember , it was this modest group of steam packets that were the ancestors of such magnificent boats as the Mauretania and Lusitania . " " There was some difference ! " interrupted Stephen . " Well , rather ! Had you , however , told Samuel Cunard then that such mammoth floating hotels were possible he would probably not have believed you . He had task enough on his hands to carry the mails ; transport the few venturesome souls that dared to cross the sea ; and compete with the many rival steamship lines that sprang up on both sides of the ocean as soon as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Cunard had blazed the path there were plenty of less daring persons ready to steal from him the fruits of his vision and courage . From 1847 to 1857 the Ocean Steamship Company carried mails between New York and Bremen , and there was a very popular line that ran from New York to Havre , up to the period of the Civil War . Among the individual ships none , perhaps , was more celebrated than the Great Eastern , a vessel of tremendous length , and one that more nearly approached our present-day liners as to size . Then there was the Collins Line that openly competed with the Cunard Line ; and to further increase trans-Atlantic travel , in 1855 Cornelius Vanderbilt , ever at the fore in novel projects , began operating lines of steamships not only to England and France but to Bremen . " Mr. Ackerman paused a moment . " By 1871 there was an American line between Philadelphia and Liverpool . In the meantime , ever since 1861 , there had been a slow but steady advance in ocean shipbuilding . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in vogue , no better method of locomotion having been discovered . When the change from this primitive device to the screw propeller came it was a veritable leap in naval architecture . Now revolutions in any direction seldom receive a welcome and just as the conservatives had at first hooted down the idea of iron ships , asserting they would never float , so they now decried the use of the screw propeller . Indeed there was no denying that this innovation presented to shipbuilders a multitude of new and balking problems . While the clipper ships had greatly improved the designs of vessels the stern was still their weakest point and now , in addition to this already existing difficulty , came the new conundrums presented by the pitch , or full turn of the thread , in the screw propeller ; also the churning of the current produced by the rapidly whirling wheel , which was found to retard the speed of the ship very materially . Valiantly engineers wrestled with one after another of these enigmas until they conquered them and put shipbuilding on the upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel ships replaced the cruder vessels of iron ; finer types of engines were worked out ; the wireless and the many electrical devices which herald approaching foes and announce the presence of icebergs have been invented ; until now the ocean liner is practically safe from all perils except fogs , icebergs and submarines . " He stopped a moment with eyes fixed on the glowing logs that crackled on the hearth . " Meanwhile , " he went on , " comfort aboard ship has progressed to luxury . Better systems of ventilation , more roomy sleeping quarters , more windows and improved lighting facilities have been installed . The general arrangement of the ship has also been vastly improved since the days when the high bulwark and long deckhouse were in use . Now iron railings allow the sea to wash back and forth in time of storm , and in consequence there is less danger of vessels being swamped by the waves . Then there are watertight doors and bulkheads , double bottoms to the hulls , and along with these more practical advances have come others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better ; the decoration of the cabins and saloons prettier and more harmonious ; there has been more hygienic sanitation . When the Oceanic of the White Star Line was built in 1870 she had a second deck , and this novel feature was adopted broadcast and eventually ushered in the many-deck liners now in use . The Servia , built in 1881 , was the first steel ship and the advantage of its greater elasticity was instantly seen . Builders were wise enough to grasp the fact that with the increasing length of vessels steel ships would be able to stand a greater strain . Little by little the gain went on in every direction . Nevertheless , in spite of the intelligence of the shipbuilders , it was long before trans-Atlantic navigators had the courage to trust themselves entirely to their engines and discard masts ; although they shifted to steel ones instead of those of iron or wood , they still persisted in carrying them . " He smiled as he spoke . " When the twin-screw propeller made its appearance it brought with it greater speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between the various shipping lines of all nations the contest for size and swiftness has raged ever since . Before the Great War , Germany had a very extensive collection of large and rapid liners , many of them built on the Clyde , that fought to surpass the Cunard ships . The White Star Line also took a hand in the game and built others . In the contest , alas , America has been far behind until gradually she has let other countries slip in and usurp the major proportion of ocean commerce . It is a pitiful thing that we should not have applied our skill and wealth of material to building fine American steamship lines of our own instead of letting so many of our tourists turn their patronage to ships of foreign nations . Perhaps if the public were not so eager for novelty , and so constantly in search for the newest , the largest and the fastest boats , we should be content to make our crossings in the older and less gaudy ships , which after all are quite as seaworthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore many a steamer has had to be scrapped simply because it had no palm gardens , no swimming pools , no shore luxuries . We have not , however , wholly neglected naval construction for we have many fine steamships , a praiseworthy lot of battleships and cruisers and some very fine submarines . I hope and believe that the time will come when our merchant marine will once again stand at the front as it did in the days of the clipper ships . Our commerce reaches out to every corner of the earth and why should we rely on other countries to transport our goods ? " " I suppose there are no pirates now , are there , Mr. Ackerman ? " asked Dick , raising his eyes expectantly to the capitalist 's face . " I am afraid there are very few , Dick boy , " returned the elder man kindly . " I suppose that is somewhat of a disappointment to you . You would have preferred to sail the seas in the days when every small liner carried her guns as a defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . But when international law began to regulate traffic on the high seas and the ocean thoroughfare ceased to be such a deserted one pirates went out of fashion , and every nation was granted equal rights to sail the seas unmolested . It was because this freedom was menaced by German submarines in the late war and our privilege to travel by water threatened that our nation refused to tolerate such conditions . A code of humane laws that had been established for the universal good was being broken and we could not permit it . For you must remember that now there are almost as many laws on the ocean as on the land . There are rules for all kinds of vessels , of which there are a far greater variety than perhaps you realize . Not only have we steamships , cruisers , and battleships but we have schooners , barques , brigs , tugboats , dredgers , oil-tankers , turret ships for freight , cargo boats , steam tramps , coalers , produce ships , ice-breakers , train ferries , steam trawlers , fire boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whalebacks , steam yachts , launches and lake steamers . Each of these is carefully classified and has its particular traffic rules , and in addition to these is obliged to obey certain other general marine laws to which all of them are subject , in order that travel by water may be made safe . " " Do n't all ships have to be inspected , too ? " asked Stephen . " Yes ; and not only are they inspected but to protect the lives of their passengers and crew , as well as preserve their cargo , they must adhere to specified conditions . The number of passengers and crew is regulated by law , as is the amount of the cargo . Ocean liners , for example , must have aboard a certain number of lifeboats , rafts , belts , life preservers , fire extinguishers , lines of hose ; and the size of all these is carefully designated . There must be frequent drills in manning the boats ; the fire hose must be tested to see that it works and is in proper condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at regular intervals . There is no such thing now as going to sea in haphazard fashion and trusting to luck . Everything that can be done for the safety of those who travel the ocean must be done . " He paused a moment , then added : " And in the meanwhile , that every protection possible shall be offered to ships , we have been as busy on the land as on the water and have established a code of laws to govern our coasts , harbors and rivers . Government surveys have charted the shores of all countries so that now there are complete maps that give not only the coast line but also the outlying islands , rocks and shoals that might be a menace to ships . It is no longer possible for a State bordering on the sea to put up a low building at the water 's edge and set a few candles in the windows as was done back in the year eighteen hundred . " Both the boys laughed . " We can laugh now , " assented Mr. Ackerman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no laughing matter . Even with all our up-to-date devices there are wrecks ; and think of the ships that must have gone down before charts were available , lighthouses and bell buoys in vogue , wireless signals invented and the coast patrol in operation . I shudder to picture it . Sailing the seas was a perilous undertaking then , I assure you . Even the first devices for safety were primitive . The Argand lamp of 1812 was not at all powerful and the lenses used were far from perfect . Foghorns were operated by hand or by horse power and were not strong enough to be heard at any great distance . Bell buoys were unknown although there were such things as bell-boats which were anchored in dangerous spots and rung by the wash of the waves . There were lightships , too , but more often than not their feeble light was obscured or unnoticed and they were run down by the ships they sought to protect . Altogether there was room for improvement at every point and slowly but surely it came . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer horns operated by steam or power engines supplanted them until now all along our coasts and inland streams signals of specified strength have been installed , a commission deciding just what size signals shall be used and where they shall be placed . There are lighthouses of prescribed candle power ; automatic flashlights and whistling buoys ; coastguard stations with carefully drilled crews ; all regulated by law and matters of compulsion . If men and ships are lost now it is because it is beyond human power to help it . " " There are facts about the water that are impossible to modify , " interrupted Mr. Tolman , " and I suppose we shall never be able wholly to eliminate the dangers growing out of them . There are for example silence zones where , because of the nature of air currents or atmospheric conditions , no sounds can be heard . Often a foghorn comparatively near at hand will belch forth its warning and its voice be swallowed up in this strange stillness . Many a calamity has occurred that could only be accounted for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is not omniscient and in the face of some of the caprices of nature he is powerless . " Mr. Ackerman rose and stood with his back to the fire . " And now , " went on Mr. Tolman , addressing Stephen and Dick , " I should say you two had had quite a lecture on steamboating and should move that you both go to bed . " Quickly Mr. Ackerman interrupted him . " I should amend the motion by suggesting that we all go to bed , " laughed he . " I am quite as tired as the boys are . " The amendment was passed , the motion carried , and soon the entire Tolman family was wrapped in sleep . CHAPTER XVIII A THANKSGIVING TRAGEDY Perhaps had Stephen known what was in store for him on the morrow he might not have slept so soundly . As it was , he and Dick had to be called three times before they opened their eyes on the Thanksgiving sunshine . A heavy frost had fallen during the night , touching the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep of gems that flashed like brilliants in the golden light . The boys scrambled into their clothes and , ruddy from a cold shower , descended to the dining room where amid the fragrance of steaming coffee the family were just sitting down to breakfast . " Well , what is up for to-day , boys ? " inquired Mrs. Tolman , after the more formal greetings were over . " What are you planning to do with Dick , Stephen ? " " We 're going skating over to the Hollow if the ice is any good , " was the prompt response . " It was fine yesterday and unless somebody has smashed it all up it ought to be good to-day . " " That plan sounds rather nice , does n't it , Jane ? " Doris suggested to her roommate . " Why do n't we go , too ? " " I 'd like nothing better , " was the answer . " The youngsters have sketched a very alluring program , " Mr. Ackerman said . " If I had any skates I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the ice in years but in my day I used to be quite a hockey player . " " Oh , do come , Mr. Ackerman ! " cried Steve eagerly . " If you used to skate it will all come back to you . It is like swimming , you know ; once you have learned you never forget how . " " But I 've nothing to skate with , " laughed the New Yorker . " Oh , we can fix you up with skates all right , if you really want to go , " Mr. Tolman said . " I have a couple of pairs and am sure you could manage to use one of them . " " So you are a skater , are you , Tolman ? " the capitalist observed , with surprise . " Oh , I am nothing great , " Mr. Tolman protested , " but I have always enjoyed sports and muddled along at them . Coventry is quite a distance from Broadway , you see , and therefore we must get our recreation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than anything New York has to offer , " commented the other man soberly . " Good wholesome out-of-door exercise is not to be mentioned in the same breath with a hot theater where a picture show is a makeshift for something better . Give me fresh air and exercise every time ! " " Well , since that is the way you feel about it we can comply with your request , " Mr. Tolman rejoined , with a smile . " If you do not mind hobbling back to New York lame as a cart-horse you can certainly have your wish , for we have the ice , the skates , plenty of coats and sweaters -- everything necessary . Suppose we all start for the Hollow at ten o'clock . It is a mile walk but as we are having a late dinner we shall still have a long morning . " " That will suit me all right , " returned Mr. Ackerman . " By the way , Henry , " interrupted Mrs. Tolman , addressing her husband , " Havens is waiting to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? " " In the hall . " " Ask Mary to tell him to go into my den . I 'll be there in a minute . " What a merry party it was that chatted and laughed there in the warmth of the sunny dining room ! For the time being the elders dropped their cares and became as young in spirit as the boys and girls . Jokes , stories and good-humored banter passed back and forth until with one accord everybody rose from the table and sauntered into the library where a great blaze of logs glowed and crackled . " If you will excuse me I will see what Havens wants , " remarked Mr. Tolman , as he lighted his cigar . " Probably the garage people have unearthed some more repairs that must be made on that car . They seem to have a faculty for that sort of thing . Every day they discover something new the matter with it . I shall have a nice little bill by the time they finish . " Shrugging his shoulders , he passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour before he returned and when he did a close observer would have noticed that his face had lost its brightness and that the gaiety with which he took up the conversation with his guests was forced and unnatural . However , he tried resolutely to banish his irritation , whatever its cause . He went up to the attic with Mr. Ackerman , where the two searched out skates , woolen gloves and sweaters ; he jested with Doris and Jane Harden ; he challenged Dick to a race across the frozen ground . But beneath his lightness lingered a grave depression which betokened to those who knew him best that something was wrong . Yet he was evidently determined the cloud should not obtrude itself and spoil the happiness of the day . Probably some business annoyance that could not be remedied had arisen ; or possibly Havens had given notice . Such contingencies were of course to be deplored but as they could not be helped , why let them ruin the entire holiday ? Therefore nobody heeded Mr. Tolman 's mood which was so well controlled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skaters swung along over the frosty fields with undiminished merriment . The Hollow for which they were bound lay in a deserted stone quarry where a little arm of the river had penetrated the barrier of rocks and , gradually flooding the place , made at one end a deep pool ; from this point the water spread itself over the meadows in a large , shallow pond . Had the spot been nearer the town it would doubtless have been overrun with skaters ; but as it was isolated , and there was a larger lake near the center of the village , few persons took the trouble to seek out this remote stretch of ice . This morning it lay desolate like a gleaming mirror , not a human being marring its solitude . " We shall have the place all to ourselves ! " exclaimed Mr. Ackerman . " There will be no spectators to watch me renew my youth , thank goodness ! " Quickly the skates were strapped on and the young people shot out into the sunshine and began to circle about . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't go into the quarry , " shouted Mr. Tolman , " for I doubt if it has been cold enough yet to freeze the ice very solidly there . There are liable to be air holes where the river makes in . " " Oh , we fellows have skated in the quarry millions of times , Dad , " Stephen protested . " It is perfectly safe . " " There is no way of telling whether it is or not , " was the response , " so suppose for to-day we keep away from it . " " But --  " " Oh , do n't argue , Stevie , " called Doris . " If Dad does n't want us to go there that 's enough , is n't it ? " " But half the fun is making that turn around the rocks , " grumbled Stephen , in a lower tone . " I do n't see why Dad is such a fraid-cat . I know this pond better than he does and --  " " If your father says not to skate there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He does n't want you to -- see ? Whether it is safe or not has nothing to do with it . " " But it 's so silly ! " went on Stephen . " Why --  " " Oh , cut it out ! Can it ! " ejaculated the East Side lad . " Your dad says No and he 's the boss . " The ungracious retort Steve offered was lost amid the babel of laughter that followed , and the skaters darted away up the pond . Indeed , one could not long have cherished ill humor amid such radiant surroundings . There was too much sunshine , too much sparkle in the clear air ; too much jollity and happiness . Almost before he realized it Stephen 's irritation had vanished and he was speeding across the glassy surface of the ice as gay as the gayest of the company . He never could explain afterward just how it happened that he found himself around the bend of the quarry and sweeping with the wind toward its farther end . He had not actually formulated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden spot . Nevertheless , there he was alone in the tiny cove with no one in sight . What followed was all over in a moment ,  - -  the breaking ice and the plunge into the frigid water . The next he knew he was fighting with all his strength to prevent himself from being drawn beneath the jagged , crumbling edge of the hole . To clamber out was impossible , for every time he tried the thin ice would break afresh under his hands and submerge him again in the bitter cold of the moving stream . Over and over he tried to pull himself to safety but without success . Then suddenly he felt himself becoming numb and helpless . His teeth chattered and he could no longer retain his hold on the frail support that was keeping his head above water . He was slipping back into the river . He was not going to be able to get out ! With a piercing scream he made one last desperate lunge forward , and again the ice that held him broke and the water dashed over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to find himself in his own bed with a confusion of faces bending over him . " There ! " he heard some one say in a very small , far-away voice . " He is coming to himself now , thank God ! It was chiefly cold and fright . He is safe now , Tolman . Do n't you worry ! You 'd better go and get off some of your wet clothing , or you will catch your death . " Mr. Ackerman was speaking . " Yes , Henry , do go ! " pleaded his wife . Illustration : He was fighting to prevent himself from being drawn beneath the jagged , crumbling edge of the hole . Page 244 . As Stephen looked about him in the vague , groping uncertainty of returning consciousness his glance fell upon his father who stood beside his pillow , shivering nervously . He put out his hand and touched the dripping coat sleeve . " What --  " began he weakly . Then with a rush it all came back to him and everything was clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water to save him ! A sob rose in his throat and he caught the elder man 's hand between both of his . " Oh , Dad , " he exclaimed , " I 've been so rotten to you -- so mean -- so cowardly . I 'm ashamed to --  " " Do n't talk about it now , son . I know . " " You know what I did ? " " Yes . " " But --  " the boy paused bewildered . " Do n't talk any more about it now , Stevie , " pleaded his mother . " But I 've got to know , " said the lad . " Ca n't you see that --  " " Let me talk with him alone a moment , " suggested Mr. Tolman in an undertone . " He is all upset and he wo n't calm down until he has this thing off his mind . Leave me here with him a little while . I 'll promise that he does not tire himself . " The doctor , Mr. Ackerman and Mrs. Tolman moved across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son , " began his father with extreme gentleness . " I did n't really know . I just put two and two together . There was the scratched machine and the gasoline gone -- both of which facts puzzled me not a little . But the proof that clinched it all and made me certain of what had happened came to me this morning when Havens brought me an old red sweater and some school papers of Bud Taylor 's that the men who were overhauling the car found under the seat . In an instant the whole thing was solved . " " You knew before we went skating then ? " " Yes . " " And -- and -- you jumped into the water after me just the same . " Mr. Tolman 's voice trembled : " You are my son and I love you no matter what you may do . " " Oh , Dad , I 'm so sorry ! " sobbed the boy . " I wanted to tell you -- I meant to . It was just that I was too much of a coward . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the nerve . After it was over it all seemed so wrong . I knew you would be angry --  " " Rather say sorry , son . " " Well , sorry . And now that you have been so white to me I 'm more ashamed still . " " There , there , my boy , we will say no more about it , " his father declared . " You and your conscience have probably had a pretty bitter battle and I judge you have not been altogether happy since your adventure . People who do wrong never are . It is no fun to carry your fault to bed with you and find it waiting when you wake up in the morning . " " You bet it is n't ! " replied the lad , with fervor . " But ca n't I do something now to make good , Dad ? " Mr. Tolman checked an impulsive protest and after a moment responded gravely : " We will see . Perhaps you would like to earn something toward doing over the car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , all that can be arranged later . We --  " " Henry , " broke in Mrs. Tolman , " you must go this instant and get into some dry clothes . You are chilled through . The doctor says Stephen is going to be none the worse for his ducking and that he can come down stairs to dinner after he has rested a little longer . So our Thanksgiving party is not to be spoiled , after all . In fact , I believe we shall have more to give thanks for than we expected , " concluded she , making an unsteady attempt to speak lightly . " I think so , too , " echoed her husband . " And so do I ! " added Stephen softly , as he exchanged an affectionate smile with his father . CHAPTER XIX THE END OF THE HOUSE PARTY As they were persons of strong constitution and in good athletic training neither Mr. Tolman nor Steve were any the worse for the narrow escape of the morning , and although a trifle spent with excitement both were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cloud rested on the festivity of the day . Certainly such a dinner never was , or if there ever had been one like it in history at least Dick Martin had never had the luck to sit down to it . The soup steaming and hot , the celery white and crisp , the sweet potatoes browned in the oven and gleaming beneath their glaze of sugar , the cranberry sauce vivid as a bowl of rubies ; to say nothing of squash , and parsnips and onions ! And as for the turkey ,  - -  why , it was the size of an ostrich ! With what resignation it lay upon its back , with what an abject spirit of surrender , as if it realized that resistance was futile and that it must docilely offer itself up to make perfect the feast . And the pudding , the golden-tinted pies with their delicate crust , the nuts ; the pyramid of fruit , riotous in color ; the candies of every imaginable hue and flavor ! Was it a wonder that Dick , who had never before beheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes as large as saucers and ate until there was not room for another mouthful ? " Gee ! " he gasped in a whisper to Stephen , as he sank weakly back into his chair when the coffee made its appearance . " This sure is some dinner . " The others who chanced to overhear the observation laughed . " Had enough , sonny ? " inquired Mr. Tolman . " Enough ! " There was more laughter . " I suppose were it not for the trains and the ships we should not be having such a meal as this to-day , " remarked Mrs. Tolman . " You are right , " was Mr. Ackerman 's reply . " Let me see ! Fruit from Florida , California and probably from Italy ; flour from the Middle West ; coffee from South America ; sugar probably from Cuba ; turkey from Rhode Island , no doubt ; and vegetables from scattered New England farms . Add to this cigarettes from Egypt and Turkey and you have covered quite a portion of the globe . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our neighbors all over the world oftener , " commented Mr. Tolman . " We take so much for granted these days . To appreciate our blessings to the full we should have lived in early Colonial times when the arrival of a ship from across the ocean was such an important event that the wares she brought were advertised broadcast . Whenever such a vessel came into port a list of her cargo was issued and purchasers scrambled eagerly to secure the luxuries she carried . Pipes of wine , bolts of cloth , china , silks , tea -- all were catalogued . It was no ordinary happening when such a boat docked , I assure you . " " I suppose it was a great event , " reflected Mrs. Tolman , " although I never half realized it . " " And not only was the advent of merchandise a red-letter day but so was the advent of travelers from the other side of the water . Picture if you can the excitement that ensued when Jenny Lind , the famous singer , visited this country ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman was not the only reason for our interest . She had actually come in a ship from across the sea ! Others would come also . America was no longer cut off from the culture of the old world , an isolated country bereft of the advantages of European civilization . We were near enough for distinguished persons to make trips here ! Charles Dickens and the Prince of Wales came -- and how cosmopolitan we felt to be entertaining guests from the mother-country ! Certainly the Atlantic could not be very wide if it could be crossed so easily and if we could have the same speakers , the same readers , the same singers as did the English ! Our fathers and grandfathers must have thrilled with satisfaction at the thought . The ocean was conquered and was no longer an estranging barrier . " " What would they have said to crossing the water by aeroplane or bobbing up in a foreign port in a submarine ? " put in Doris . " And some day I suppose the marvels of our age that cause our mouths to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as humdrum as the ocean liner and the Pullman have , " Mrs. Tolman remarked . " Yes , " returned her husband . " Think of the fight every one of these innovations has had to put up before it battled its way to success . The first locomotives , you remember , were not only rated as unsafe for travel but also actually destructive to property . The major part of the public had no faith in them and predicted they would never be used for general travel . As for crossing the ocean -- why , one was welcome to take his life in his hands if he chose , of course ; but to cross in an iron ship -- it was tempting Providence ! Did not iron always sink ? And how people ridiculed Darius Green and his flying machine ! Most of the prophets were thought to be crazy . History is filled with stories of men who wrecked their worldly fortunes to perpetuate an idea , and but too frequently an idea they never lived to see perfected . " During the pause that followed Mr. Ackerman leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischievously : " Well , Steve , having now heard both stories , have you come to a conclusion which one you are going to vote for ? " " No , sir , " was the dubious response . " I 'm farther away from a decision than ever . Just as I get it settled in my mind that the railroads have done the biggest things and conquered the most difficulties along come the steamships and I am certain they are six times as wonderful . " " And you , Dick -- what do you say ? " questioned the financier , smiling . " Surely you are going to stand up for the steamboat . " But to his chagrin Dick shook his head . " I feel as Steve does , " replied he . " No sooner do I get settled one way than something turns me round the other . " " So far as I can see we shall have to leave the matter a draw , sha n't we , Tolman ? " observed the New Yorker . " It would be a jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in Stephen . " Sometimes we have discussions like that at school and the next time we do I believe I 'll suggest this topic . It would be mighty interesting . " " It certainly would , " his father echoed . " But it also would be a very sorry event if you could not demonstrate that the railroads had the supremacy for were their prestige to be threatened I might have to move out of town . " " In case Connecticut did not want you , you might come to New York where you would be sure of being appreciated , " put in Mr. Ackerman . " And that is not all talk , either , for I want you and the whole family to give me a promise to-day that you will come over and join Dick and me at Christmas . I 've never had a boy of my own to celebrate the holiday with before , you must remember ; but this time I have a real family and I am going to have a real Christmas , " he continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want every one of you to come and help me to make the day a genuine landmark . And if I 'm a little new at playing Santa Claus some of you who have been schooled in the role for many years can show me how . We ca n't promise to stage for you such an excitement as Stephen got up for us this morning , and we never can give you a dinner equal to this ; but we can give you a royal welcome . You can come by boat or come by train , " added he slyly . " No guest who patronizes the railroads will be shut out , even if he is misguided . The chief thing is for you to come , one and all , and we will renew our friendship and once again bless Stephen , Dick , and my lost pocketbook , for bringing us together .

CHAPTER I THE LINE-RIDER Day was breaking in the Panhandle . The line-rider finished his breakfast of buffalo-hump , coffee , and biscuits . He had eaten heartily , for it would be long after sunset before he touched food again . Cheerfully and tunelessly he warbled a cowboy ditty as he packed his supplies and prepared to go . " Oh , it 's bacon and beans most every day , I 'd as lief be eatin ' prairie hay . " While he washed his dishes in the fine sand and rinsed them in the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad with spring : " I 'll sell my outfit soon as I can , Wo n't punch cattle for no damn ' man . " The tin cup beat time against the tin plate to accompany a kind of shuffling dance . Jack Roberts was fifty miles from nowhere , alone on the desert , but the warm blood of youth set his feet to moving . Why should he not dance ? He was one and twenty , stood five feet eleven in his socks , and weighed one hundred and seventy pounds of bone , sinew , and well-packed muscle . A son of blue skies and wide , wind-swept spaces , he had never been ill in his life . Wherefore the sun-kissed world looked good to him . He mounted a horse picketed near the camp and rode out to a remuda of seven cow-ponies grazing in a draw . Of these he roped one and brought it back to camp , where he saddled it with deft swiftness . The line-rider swung to the saddle and put his pony at a jog-trot . He topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in long swells far as the eye could see . The desert flowered gayly with the purple , pink , and scarlet blossoms of the cacti and with the white , lilylike buds of the Spanish bayonet . The yucca and the prickly pear were abloom . He swept the panorama with trained eyes . In the distance a little bunch of antelope was moving down to water in single file . On a slope two miles away grazed a small herd of buffalo . No sign of human habitation was written on that vast solitude of space . The cowboy swung to the south and held a steady road gait . With an almost uncanny accuracy he recognized all signs that had to do with cattle . Though cows , half hidden in the brush , melted into the color of the hillside , he picked them out unerringly . Brands , at a distance so great that a tenderfoot could have made of them only a blur , were plain as a primer to him . Cows that carried on their flanks the A T O , he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather up these strays and drive them back to their own range . For in those days , before the barbed wire had reached Texas and crisscrossed it with boundary lines , the cowboy was a fence more mobile than the wandering stock . It was past noon when Roberts dropped into a draw where an immense man was lying sprawled under a bush . The recumbent man was a mountain of flesh ; how he ever climbed to a saddle was a miracle ; how a little cow-pony carried him was another . Yet there was no better line-rider in the Panhandle than Jumbo Wilkins . " ' Lo , Texas , " the fat man greeted . The young line-rider had won the nickname of " Texas " in New Mexico a year or two before by his aggressive championship of his native State . Somehow the sobriquet had clung to him even after his return to the Panhandle . " ' Lo , Jumbo , " returned the other . " How ? " " Fat like a match . I 'm sure losin ' flesh . Took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted in the saddle , resting his weight on the horn and the ball of one foot for ease . He was a slim , brown youth , hard as nails and tough as whipcord . His eyes were quick and wary . In spite of the imps of mischief that just now lighted them , one got an impression of strength . He might or might not be , in the phrase of the country , a " bad hombre , " but it was safe to say he was an efficient one . " Quick consumption , sure , " pronounced the younger man promptly . " You do n't look to me like you weigh an ounce over three hundred an ' fifty pounds . Appetite kind o ' gone ? " " You 're damn whistlin ' . I got an ailment , I tell you , Tex . This mo'nin ' I did n't eat but a few slices of bacon an ' some lil ' steaks an ' a pan or two o ' flapjacks an ' mebbe nine or ten biscuits . Afterward I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sa'saparilla . Now , if I could make out to get off for a few days --  " " You could get that sarsaparilla across the bar at the Bird Cage , could n't you , Jumbo ? " the boy grinned . The whale of a man looked at him reproachfully . " You never seen me shootin ' up no towns or raisin ' hell when I was lit up . I can take a drink or leave it alone . " " That 's right too . Nobody lets it alone more than you do when it ca n't be got . I 've noticed that . " " You cay n't devil me , boy . I was punchin ' longhorns when yore mammy was paddlin ' you for stealin ' the sugar . Say , that reminds me . I 'm plumb out o ' sugar . Can you loan me some till Pedro gits around ? I got to have sugar or I begin to fall off right away , " the big man whined . The line-riders chatted casually of the topics that interest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians they had something to say , of their diminishing grub supply more . Jumbo mentioned that he had found an A T O cow dead by a water-hole . They spoke incidentally of the Dinsmore gang , a band of rustlers operating in No Man 's Land . They had little news of people , since neither of them had for three weeks seen another human being except Quint Sullivan , the line-rider who fenced the A T O cattle to the east of Roberts . Presently Roberts nodded a good-bye and passed again into the solitude of empty spaces . The land-waves swallowed him . Once more he followed draws , crossed washes , climbed cow-backed hills , picking up drift-cattle as he rode . It was late afternoon when he saw a thin spiral of smoke from a rise of ground . Smoke meant that some human being was abroad in the land , and every man on the range called for investigation . The rider moved forward to reconnoiter . He saw a man , a horse , a cow , a calf , and a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somebody was branding . The present business of Roberts was to find out what brand was on the cow and what one was being run on the flank of the calf . He rode forward at a slow canter . The man beside the fire straightened . He took off his hat and swept it in front of him in a semicircle from left to right . The line-rider understood the sign language of the plains . He was being " waved around . " The man was serving notice upon him to pass in a wide circle . It meant that the dismounted man did not intend to let himself be recognized . The easy deduction was that he was a rustler . The cowboy rode steadily forward . The man beside the fire picked up a rifle lying at his feet and dropped a bullet a few yards in front of the advancing man . Roberts drew to a halt . He was armed with a six-shooter , but a revolver was of no use at this distance . For a moment he hesitated . Another bullet lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The line-rider waited for no more definite warning . He waved a hand toward the rustler and shouted down the wind : " Some other day . " Quickly he swung his horse to the left and vanished into an arroyo . Then , without an instant 's loss of time , he put his pony swiftly up the draw toward a " rim-rock " edging a mesa . Over to the right was Box Canon , which led to the rough lands of a terrain unknown to Roberts . It was a three-to-one chance that the rustler would disappear into the canon . The young man rode fast , putting his bronco at the hills with a rush . He was in a treeless country , covered with polecat brush . Through this he plunged recklessly , taking breaks in the ground without slackening speed in the least . Near the summit of the rise Roberts swung from the saddle and ran forward through the brush , crouching as he moved . With a minimum of noise and a maximum of speed he negotiated the thick shrubbery and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the shin-oak which grew thick on the edge of the bluff he made out a man on horseback driving a calf . The mount was a sorrel with white stockings and a splash of white on the nose . The distance was too great for Roberts to make out the features of the rider clearly , though he could see the fellow was dark and slender . The line-rider watched him out of sight , then slithered down the face of the bluff to the sandy wash . He knelt down and studied intently the hoofprints written in the soil . They told him that the left hind hoof of the animal was broken in an odd way . Jack Roberts clambered up the steep edge of the gulch and returned to the cow-pony waiting for him with drooping hip and sleepy eyes . " Oh , you Two Bits , we 'll amble along and see where our friend is headin ' for . " He picked a way down into the canon and followed the rustler . At the head of the gulch the man on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in that direction . A sign by the side of the trail confronted him . THIS IS PETE DINSMORE 'S ROAD --  TAKE ANOTHER " The plot sure thickens , " grinned Jack . " Reckon I wo n't take Pete 's advice to-day . It do n't listen good . " He spoke aloud , to himself or to his horse or to the empty world at large , as lonely riders often do on the plains or in the hills , but from the heavens above an answer dropped down to him in a heavy , masterful voice : " Git back along that trail pronto ! " Roberts looked up . A flat rock topped the bluff above . From the edge of it the barrel of a rifle projected . Behind it was a face masked by a bandana handkerchief . The combination was a sinister one . If the line-rider was dismayed or even surprised , he gave no evidence of it . " Just as you say , stranger . I reckon you 're callin ' this dance , " he admitted . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' inside o ' five minutes . No funny business ! Git ! " The cowboy got . He whirled his pony in its tracks and sent it jogging down the back trail . A tenderfoot would have taken the gulch at breakneck speed . Most old-timers would have found a canter none too fast . But Jack Roberts held to a steady road gait . Not once did he look back -- but every foot of the way till he had turned a bend in the canon there was an ache in the small of his back . It was a purely sympathetic sensation , for at any moment a bullet might come crashing between the shoulders . Once safely out of range the rider mopped a perspiring face . " Wow ! This is your lucky day , Jack . Ai n't you got better sense than to trail rustlers with no weapon but a Sunday-School text ? Well , here 's hopin ' ! Maybe we 'll meet again in the sweet by an ' by . You never can always tell . " CHAPTER II " I 'LL BE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antelope steak he was frying , to watch a man cross the shallow creek . In the clear morning light of the Southwest his eyes had picked the rider out of the surrounding landscape nearly an hour before . For at least one fourth of the time since this discovery he had been aware that his approaching visitor was Pedro Menendez , of the A T O ranch . " Better ' light , son , " suggested Roberts . The Mexican flashed a white-toothed smile at the sizzling steak , took one whiff of the coffee and slid from the saddle . Eating was one of the things that Pedro did best . " The ol ' man -- he sen ' me , " the boy explained . " He wan ' you at the ranch . " Further explanation waited till the edge of Pedro 's appetite was blunted . The line-rider lighted a cigarette and casually asked a question . " Whyfor does he want me ? " It developed that the Mexican had been sent to relieve Roberts because the latter was needed to take charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelash did the line-rider show that this news meant anything to him . It was promotion -- better pay , a better chance for advancement , an easier life . But Jack Roberts had learned to take good and ill fortune with the impassive face of a gambler . " Keep an eye out for rustlers , Pedro , " he advised before he left . " You want to watch Box Canon . Unless I 'm ' way off , the Dinsmore gang are operatin ' through it . I ' most caught one red-handed the other day . Lucky for me I did n't . You an ' Jumbo would ' a ' had to bury me out on the lone prairee . " Nearly ten hours later Jack Roberts dismounted in front of the whitewashed adobe house that was the headquarters of the A T O ranch . On the porch an old cattleman sat slouched in a chair tilted back against the wall , a run-down heel of his boot hitched in the rung . The wrinkled coat he wore hung on him like a sack , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high boot . The owner of the A T O was a heavy-set , powerful man in the early fifties . Just now he was smoking a corncob pipe . The keen eyes of the cattleman watched lazily the young line-rider come up the walk . Most cowboys walked badly ; on horseback they might be kings of the earth , but out of the saddle they rolled like sailors . Clint Wadley noticed that the legs of this young fellow were straight and that he trod the ground lightly as a buck in mating-season . " He 'll make a hand , " was Wadley 's verdict , one he had arrived at after nearly a year of shrewd observation . But no evidence of satisfaction in his employee showed itself in the greeting of the " old man . " He grunted what might pass for " Howdy ! " if one were an optimist . Roberts explained his presence by saying : " You sent for me , Mr. Wadley . " " H 'm ! That durned fool York done bust his laig . Think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , sir . " " That 's the way all you brash young colts talk . But how many of ' em will you lose on the way ? How sorry will they look when you deliver the herd ? That 's what I 'd like to know . " Jack Roberts was paying no attention to the grumbling of his boss -- for a young girl had come out of the house . She was a slim little thing , with a slender throat that carried the small head like the stem of a rose . Dark , long-lashed eyes , eager and bubbling with laughter , were fixed on Wadley . She had slipped out on tiptoe to surprise him . Her soft fingers covered his eyes . " Guess who ! " she ordered . " Quit yore foolishness , " growled the cattleman . " Do n't you-all see I 'm talkin ' business ? " But the line-rider observed that his arm encircled the waist of the girl . With a flash of shy eyes the girl caught sight of Roberts , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! I did n't know , " she cried . The owner of the A T O introduced them . " This is Jack Roberts , one of my trail foremen . Roberts -- my daughter Ramona . I reckon you can see for yoreself she 's plumb spoiled . " A soft laugh welled from the throat of the girl . She knew that for her at least her father was all bark and no bite . " It 's you that is spoiled , Dad , " she said in the slow , sweet voice of the South . " I 've been away too long , but now I 'm back I mean to bring you up right . Now I 'll leave you to your business . " The eyes of the girl rested for a moment on those of the line-rider as she nodded good-bye . Jack had never before seen Ramona Wadley , nor for that matter had he seen her brother Rutherford . Since he had been in the neighborhood , both of them had been a good deal of the time in Tennessee at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in three months . It was hard to believe that this dainty child was the daughter of such a battered hulk as Clint Wadley . He was what the wind and the sun and the tough Southwest had made him . And she -- she was a daughter of the morning . But Wadley did not release Ramona . " Since you 're here you might as well go through with it , " he said . " What do you want ? " " What does a woman always want ? " she asked sweetly , and then answered her own question . " Clothes -- and money to buy them -- lots of it . I 'm going to town to-morrow , you know . " " H 'm ! " His grunt was half a chuckle , half a growl . " Do you call yoreself a woman -- a little bit of a trick like you ? Why , I could break you in two . " She drew herself up very straight . " I 'll be seventeen , coming grass . And it 's much more likely , sir , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in after I 've been to town . " With that she swung on her heel and vanished inside the house . The proud , fond eyes of the cattleman followed her . It was an easy guess that she was the apple of his eye . But when he turned to business again his manner was gruffer than usual . He was a trifle crisper to balance the effect of his new foreman having discovered that he was as putty in the hands of this slip of a girl . " Well , you know where you 're at , Roberts . Deliver that herd without any loss for strays , fat , an ' in good condition , an ' you wo n't need to go back to line-ridin ' . Fall down on the job , an ' you 'll never get another chance to drive A T O cows . " " That 's all I ask , Mr. Wadley , " the cowboy answered . " An ' much obliged for the chance . " " Do n't thank me . Thank York 's busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the gather for the drive to-morrow an ' Friday . " CHAPTER III TEX TAKES AN INTEREST Jack Roberts was in two minds whether to stop at the Longhorn saloon . He needed a cook in his trail outfit , and the most likely employment agency in Texas during that decade was the barroom of a gambling-house . Every man out of a job naturally drifted to the only place of entertainment . The wandering eye of the foreman decided the matter for him . It fell upon a horse , and instantly ceased to rove . The cow-pony was tied to a hitching-rack worn shiny by thousands of reins . On the nose of the bronco was a splash of white . Stockings of the same color marked its legs . The left hind hoof was gashed and broken . The rider communed with himself . " I reckon we 'll ' light and take an interest , Jack . Them that looks for , finds . " He slid from the saddle and rolled a cigarette , after which he made friends with the sorrel and examined carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a world after all , " he commented . " You never can tell who you 're liable to meet up with . " The foreman drew from its scabbard a revolver and slid it back into place to make sure that it lay easy in its case . " You ca n't guess for sure what 's likely to happen . I 'd a heap rather be too cautious than have flowers sent me . " He sauntered through the open door into the gambling-house . It was a large hall , in the front part of which was the saloon . In the back the side wall to the next building had been ripped out to give more room . There was a space for dancing , as well as roulette , faro , chuckaluck , and poker tables . In one corner a raised stand for the musicians had been built . The Longhorn was practically deserted . Not even a game of draw was in progress . The dance-girls were making up for lost sleep , and the patrons of the place were either at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the bar . One was a tall , lank person , hatchet-faced and sallow . He had a cast in his eye that gave him a sinister expression . The second was slender and trim , black of hair and eye and mustache . His clothes were very good and up to date . The one farthest from the door was a heavy-set , unwieldy man in jeans , slouchy as to dress and bearing . Perhaps it was the jade eyes of the man that made Roberts decide instantly he was one tough citizen . The line-rider ordered a drink . " Hardware , please , " said the bartender curtly . " Enforcin ' that rule , are they ? " asked Roberts casually as his eyes swept over the other men . " That 's whatever . Y'betcha . We do n't want no gay cowboys shootin ' out our lights . No reflections , y'understand . " The latest arrival handed over his revolver , and the man behind the bar hung the scabbard on a nail . Half a dozen others were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier was that each rider from the range should deposit his weapons at the first saloon he entered . They were returned to him when he called for them just before leaving town . This tended to lessen the number of sudden deaths . " Who you ridin ' for , young fellow ? " asked the sallow man of Roberts . " For the A T O. " The dark young man turned and looked at the cowboy . " So ? How long have you been riding for Wadley ? " " Nine months . " " Do n't think I 've seen you before . " " I 'm a line-rider -- do n't often get to the ranch-house . " " What ground do you cover ? " " From Dry Creek to the rim-rock , and south past Box Canon . " Three pair of eyes were focused watchfully on Roberts . The sallow man squirted tobacco at a knot in the floor and rubbed his bristly chin with the palm of a hand . " Kinda lonesome out there , ai n't it ? " he ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The country is filled with absentees , " admitted Roberts . " Reckoned it was . Never been up that way myself . A sort of a bad-lands proposition , I 've heard tell -- country creased with arroyos , packed with rocks an ' rattlesnakes mostly . " The heavy-set man broke in harshly . " Anybody else run cattle there except old man Wadley ? " " Settlers are comin ' in on the other side of the rim-rock . Cattle drift across . I can count half a dozen brands ' most any day . " " But you never see strangers . " " Do n't I ? " " I 'm askin ' , do you ? " The voice of the older man was heavy and dominant . It occurred to Roberts that he had heard that voice before . " Oh ! " Unholy imps of mirth lurked in the alert eyes of the line-rider . " Once in a while I do -- last Thursday , for instance . " The graceful , dark young man straightened as does a private called to attention . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought his level gaze back from a barefoot negro washing the floor . " Not this time . He was a rustler . " " How do you know ? " The high voice of the questioner betrayed excitement . " I caught him brandin ' a calf . He waved me round . I beat him to the Box Canon and saw him ridin ' through . " " You saw him ridin ' through ? Where were you ? " The startled eyes of the dark young man were fixed on him imperiously . " From the bluff above . " " You do n't say ! " The voice of the heavy man cut in with jeering irony . The gleam of his jade eyes came through narrow-slitted lids . " Well , did you take him back to the ranch for a necktie party , or did you bury him in the gulch ? " The dark young man interrupted irritably . " I 'm askin ' these questions , Dinsmore . Now you , young fellow -- what 's your name ? " " Jack Roberts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know him again ? " The line-rider smiled inscrutably . He did not intend to tell all that he did not know . " He was ridin ' a sorrel with a white splash on its nose , white stockin 's , an ' a bad hoof , the rear one --  " " You 're a damn ' liar . " The words , flung out from some inner compulsion , as it were , served both as a confession and a challenge . There was a moment of silence , tense and ominous . This was fighting talk . The lank man leaned forward and whispered some remonstrance in the ear of the young fellow , but his suggestion was waved aside . " I 'm runnin ' this , Gurley . " The rider for the A T O showed neither surprise nor anger . He made a business announcement without stress or accent . " I expect it 's you or me one for a lickin ' . Hop to it , Mr. Rustler ! " Roberts did not wait for an acceptance of his invitation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike first and to strike hard . His brown fist moved forward as though it had been shot from a gun . The other man crashed back against the wall and hung there dazed for a moment . The knuckles of that lean fist had caught him on the chin . " Give him hell , Ford . You can curry a li'l ' shorthorn like this guy with no trouble a-tall , " urged Dinsmore . The young man needed no urging . He gathered himself together and plunged forward . Always he had prided himself on being an athlete . He was the champion boxer of the small town where he had gone to school . Since he had returned to the West , he had put on flesh and muscle . But he had dissipated a good deal too , and no man not in the pink of condition had any right to stand up to tough Jack Roberts . While the fight lasted , there was rapid action . Roberts hit harder and cleaner , but the other was the better boxer . He lunged and sidestepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . For several minutes he peppered the line-rider with neat hits . Jack bored in for more . He drove a straight left home and closed one of his opponent 's eyes . He smashed through the defense of his foe with a power that would not be denied . " Keep a-comin ' , Ford . You shore have got him goin ' south , " encouraged Gurley . But the man he called Ford knew it was not true . His breath was coming raggedly . His arms were heavy as though weighted with lead . The science upon which he had prided himself was of no use against this man of steel . Already his head was singing so that he saw hazily . The finish came quickly . The cowboy saw his chance , feinted with his left and sent a heavy body blow to the heart . The knees of the other sagged . He sank down and did not try to rise again . Presently his companions helped him to his feet . " He -- he took me by surprise , " explained the beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet I did , " assented Jack cheerfully . " An ' I 'm liable to surprise you again if you call me a liar a second time . " " You 've said about enough , my friend , " snarled the man who had been spoken to as Dinsmore . " You get away with this because the fight was on the square , but do n't push yore luck too far . " The three men passed out of the front door . Roberts turned to the barkeeper . " I reckon the heavy-set one is Pete Dinsmore . The cock-eyed guy must be Steve Gurley . But who is the young fellow I had the mixup with ? " The man behind the bar gave information promptly . " He 's Rutherford Wadley -- son of the man who signs yore pay-checks . Say , I heard Buck Nelson needs a mule-skinner , in case you 're lookin ' for a job . " Jack felt a sudden sinking of the heart . He had as good as told the son of his boss that he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a first-class lacing . The air-castles he had been building came tumbling down with a crash . He had already dreamed himself from a trail foreman to the majordomo of the A T O ranch . Instead of which he was a line-rider out of a job . " Where can I find Nelson ? " he asked with a grin that found no echo in his heart . " Lead me to him . " CHAPTER IV TEX GRANDSTANDS Clint Wadley , massive and powerful , slouched back in his chair with one leg thrown over an arm of it . He puffed at a corncob pipe , and through the smoke watched narrowly with keen eyes from under heavy grizzled brows a young man standing on the porch steps . " So now you know what I expect , young fellow , " he said brusquely . " Take it or leave it ; but if you take it , go through . " Arthur Ridley smiled . " Thanks , I 'll take it . " The boy was not so much at ease as his manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T O was an exacting master . The old cattleman was game himself . Even now he would fight at the drop of the hat if necessary . In the phrase which he had just used , he would " go through " anything he undertook . Men who had bucked blizzards with him in the old days admitted that Clint would do to take along . But Ridley 's awe of him was due less to his roughness and to the big place he filled in the life of the Panhandle than to the fact that he was the father of his daughter . It was essential to Arthur 's plans that he stand well with the old-timer . Though he did not happen to know it , young Ridley was a favorite of the cattle king . He had been wished on him by an old friend , but there was something friendly and genial about the boy that won a place for him . His smile was modest and disarming , and his frank face was better than any letter of recommendation . But though Wadley was prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy had come from the East , and the standards of that section are not those of the West . The East asks of a man good family , pleasant manners , a decent reputation , and energy enough to carry a man to success along conventional lines . In those days the frontier West demanded first that a man be game , and second that he be one to tie to . He might be good or bad , but whichever he was , he , must be efficient to make any mark in the turbulent country of the border . Was there a hint of slackness in the jaw of this good-looking boy ? Wadley was not sure , but he intended to find out . " You 'll start Saturday . I 'll meet you at Tascosa two weeks from to-day . Understand ? " The cattleman knocked the ashes from his pipe and rose . The interview was at an end . Young Ridley nodded . " I 'll be there , sir -- with the six thousand dollars safe as if they were in a vault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-shooter . Can you shoot ? " Wadley flung at him abruptly . Arthur Ridley had always fancied himself as a shot . He had belonged to a gun-club at home , and since coming to the Southwest he had practiced a good deal with the revolver . " Pretty well , sir . " " Would you -- if it was up to you ? " The youngster looked into the steel-gray eyes roofed by the heavy thatch of brow . " I think so . I never have had to yet . In the East --  " Wadley waved the East back to where it belonged . " Yes , I know . But we 're talkin ' about Texas . Still , I reckon you ought not to have any trouble on this trip . Do n't let anybody know why you are at the fort . Do n't gamble or drink . Get the money from Major Ponsford and melt away inconspicuous into the brush . Hit the trail hard . A day and a night ought to bring you to Tascosa . " The cattleman was leading the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . A pile of empty cans , symbol of the arid lands , lay beside the path . He picked up one and put it on a post . Then he stepped off fifteen paces . " Ventilate it , " he ordered . The boy drew his revolver , took a long , steady aim , and fired . The bullet whistled past across the prairie . His second shot scored a clean hit . With pardonable pride he turned to the cattleman . " Set up another can , " commanded Wadley . From the pile of empties the young man picked another and put it on the post . Wadley , known in Texas as a two-gun man , flashed into sight a pair of revolvers almost quicker than the eye could follow . Both shots came instantly and together . The cattleman had fired from the hips . Before the can had reached the ground the weapons barked again . Ridley ran forward and picked up the can . It was torn and twisted with jagged holes , but the evidence was written there that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly believe his eyes . Such shooting was almost beyond human skill . The owner of the A T O thrust into place his two forty-fives . " If you 're goin ' to wear six-shooters , learn to use ' em , son . If you do n't , some bad-man is liable to bump you off for practice . " As the two men stepped around the corner of the house a girl came down the steps of the porch . She was dressed in summer white , but she herself was spring . Slim and lissome , the dew of childhood was still on her lips , and the mist of it in her eyes . But when she slanted her long lashes toward Arthur Ridley , it was not the child that peeped shyly and eagerly out from beneath them . Her heart was answering the world-old call of youth to youth . " I 'm going downtown , Dad , " she announced . Ridley stepped forward and lifted his hat . " May I walk with you , Miss Ramona ? " " Stop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mail , ' Mona , " her father said . The boy and the girl made a couple to catch and hold the eye . They went down the street together chattering gayly . One of the things young Ridley knew how to do well was to make himself agreeable to girls . He could talk nonsense charmingly and could hold his own in the jolly give-and-take of repartee . His good looks were a help . So too was the little touch of affectionate deference he used . He had the gift of being bold without being too bold . It was a beautiful morning and life sang in the blood of Ramona . It seemed to her companion that the warm sun caressed the little curls at her temples as she moved down the street light as a deer . Little jets of laughter bubbled from her round , birdlike throat . In her freshly starched white dress , with its broad waistband of red and purple ribbon , the girl was sweet and lovely and full of mystery to Ridley . A little man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with jingling spurs to meet them . At sight of Ramona his eyes lighted . From his well-shaped gray head he swept in a bow a jaunty , broad-brimmed white hat . The young girl smiled , because there were still a million unspent smiles in her warm and friendly heart . " Good-morning , Captain Ellison , " she called . " Do n't know you a-tall , ma'am . " He shook his head with decision . " Never met up with you before . " " Good gracious , Captain , and you 've fed me candy ever since I was a sticky little kid . " He burlesqued a business of recognizing her with much astonishment . " You ai n't little ' Mona Wadley . No ! Why , you are a young lady all dressed up in go-to-meet-him clothes . I reckon my little side-partner has gone forever . " " No , she has n't , Uncle Jim , " the girl cried . " And I want you to know I still like candy . " He laughed with delight and slapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you get it , ' Mona , sure as I 'm a foot high . " Chuckling , he passed down the street . " Captain Jim Ellison of the Rangers , " explained Ramona to her companion . " He is n't really my uncle , but I 've known him always . He 's a good old thing and we 're great friends . " Her soft , smiling eyes met those of Arthur . He thought that it was no merit in Ellison to be fond of her . How could he help it ? " He 's in luck , " was all the boy said . A little flag of color fluttered in her cheek . She liked his compliments , but they embarrassed her a little . " Did you fix it all up with Dad ? " she asked , by way of changing the subject . " Yes . I 'm to go to Fort Winston to get the money for the beeves , and if I fall down on the job I 'll never get another from him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teased . " Do n't you believe it -- know it . I sure enough am , " he admitted promptly . " Why ? I can twist him round my little finger , " she boasted . " Yes , but I 'm not his only daughter and the prettiest thing in West Texas . " She laughed shyly . " Are you sure you 're taking in enough territory ? " " I 'll say south of Mason and Dixon 's line , if you like . " " Really , he likes you . I can tell when Dad is for any one . " A sound had for some minutes been disturbing the calm peace of the morning . It was the bawling of thirsty cattle . The young people turned a corner into the main street of the town . Down it was moving toward them a cloud of yellow dust stirred up by a bunch of Texas longhorns . The call of the cattle for drink was insistent . Above it rose an occasional sharp " Yip yip ! " of a cowboy . Ramona stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs like the waves of a sea . The dust would irreparably soil the clean frock fresh from the hands of her black mammy . She made as if to turn , and knew with a flash of horror that it was too late . Perhaps it was the gleam of scarlet in her sash that caught the eye of the bull leading the van . It gave a bellow of rage , lowered its head , and dashed at her . Ramona gave a horror-stricken little cry of fear and stood motionless . She could not run . The fascination of terror held her paralyzed . Her heart died away in her while the great brute thundered toward her . Out of the dust-cloud came a horse and rider in the wake of the bull . Frozen in her tracks , Ramona saw with dilated eyes all that followed . The galloping horse gained , was at the heels of the maddened animal , drew up side by side . It seemed to the girl that in another moment she must be trampled underfoot . Nothing but a miracle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time without end to the girl 's fear-numbed brain , horse and bull raced knee to knee . Then the miracle came . The rider leaned far out from the saddle , loosened his feet from the stirrups , and launched himself at the crazed half-ton of charging fury . His hands gripped the horns of the bull . He was dragged from the saddle into the dust , but his weight deflected the course of the animal . With every ounce of strength given by his rough life in the open the cowboy hung on , dragging the head of the bull down with him toward the ground . Man and beast came to a slithering halt together in a great cloud of dust not ten feet from Ramona . Even now terror held her a prisoner . The brute would free itself and stamp the man to death . A haze gathered before her eyes . She swayed , then steadied herself . Man and bull were fighting desperately , one with sheer strength , the other with strength plus brains and skill . The object of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in frantic rage to shake off this incubus that had fastened itself to its horns . The man hung on for life . All his power and weight were centered in an effort to twist the head of the bull sideways and back . Slowly , inch by inch , by the steady , insistent pressure of muscles as well packed as any in Texas , the man began to gain . The bull no longer tossed and flung him at will . The big roan head went down , turned backward , yielded to the pressure on the neck-muscles that never relaxed . The man put at the decisive moment his last ounce of strength into one last twist . The bull collapsed , went down heavily to its side . A second cowboy rode up , roped the bull , and deftly hogtied it . The bulldogger rose and limped forward to the girl leaning whitely against a wall . " Sorry , Miss Wadley . I had n't ought to have brought the herd through town . We was drivin ' to water . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask . " Me ! " he said in surprise . " Why , no , ma'am . " He was a tall , lean youth , sunburned and tough , with a face that looked sardonic . Ramona recognized him now as her father 's new foreman , the man she had been introduced to a few days before . Hard on that memory came another . It was this same Jack Roberts who had taken her brother by surprise and beaten him so cruelly only yesterday . " It threw you around so , " she murmured . " Sho ! I reckon I can curry a li'l ol ' longhorn when I have it to do , ma'am , " he answered , a bit embarrassed . " Are -- are you hurt ? " another voice quavered . With a pang of pain Ramona remembered Arthur Ridley . Where had he been when she so desperately needed help ? " No . Mr. Roberts saved me . " She did not look at Ridley . A queer feeling of shame for him made her keep her eyes averted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy explained feebly . " Thank you , " she said . The girl was miserably unhappy . For the boy to whom she had given the largesse of her friendship had fled in panic ; the one she hated for bullying and mistreating her brother had flung himself in the path of the furious bull to save her . Captain Ellison came running up . He bristled at the trail foreman like a bantam . " What do you mean by drivin ' these wild critters through town ? Ai n't you got a lick o ' sense a-tall ? If anything had happened to this little girl --  " The Ranger left his threat suspended in midair . His arms were round Ramona , who was sobbing into his coat . The red-headed foreman shifted his weight from one foot to another . He was acutely uncomfortable at having made this young woman weep . " I ai n't got a word to say , Captain . It was plumb thoughtless of me , " he apologized . " You come to my office this mo'nin ' at twelve o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word to say to you . " " Yes , " agreed the bulldogger humbly . " I did n't go for to scare the young lady . Will you tell her I 'm right sorry , Captain ? " " You eat yore own humble pie . You 've got a tongue , I reckon , " snorted Ellison , dragging at his goatee fiercely . The complexion of Roberts matched his hair . " I -- I -- I 'm turrible sorry , miss . I 'd ought to be rode on a rail . " With which the range-rider turned , swung to the saddle of his pony without touching the stirrups , and fairly bolted down the street after his retreating herd . CHAPTER V CAPTAIN ELLISON HIRES A HAND Captain Ellison was preparing for the Adjutant-General a report of a little affair during which one of his men had been obliged to snuff out the lives of a couple of Mexican horsethieves and seriously damage a third . Writing was laborious work for the Captain of Rangers , though he told no varnished tale . His head and shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the point of the pen . Each letter as it was set down had its whispered echo from his pursed lips . " Doggone these here reports , " he commented in exasperation . " Looks like a man had n't ought to make out one every time he bumps off a rustler . " He tugged at his goatee and read again what he had just written : Then this Jose Barela and his gang of skoundrels struck out for the Brazos with the stolen stock . Ranger Cullom trailed them to Goose Creek and recovered the cattle . While resisting arrest Barela and another Mexican were killed and a third wounded . Cullom brought back the wounded man and the rustled stock . A short noontime shadow darkened the sunny doorway of the adobe office . Ellison looked up quickly , his hand falling naturally to the handle of his forty-five . Among the Rangers the price of life was vigilance . A tall , lean , young man with a sardonic eye and a sunburned face jingled up the steps . " Come in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a minute . " The cowboy lounged in , very much at his ease . Roberts had been embarrassed before Ramona Wadley that morning , but he was not in the least self-conscious now . In the course of a short and turbid life he had looked too many tough characters in the eye to let any mere man disturb his poise . " Do you spell scoundrel with a k ? " the Ranger chief fired abruptly at him . " Nary a k , Captain . I spell it b-a-d m-a-n . " " H'mp ! " snorted the little man . " Ai n't you got no education ? A man 's got to use a syllogism oncet in a while , I reckon . " " Mebbeso . What kind of a gun is it ? " drawled Jack Roberts . " A syllogism is a word meanin ' the same as another word , like as if I was to say caballo for horse or six-shooter for revolver . " " I see -- or tough guy for Texas ranger . " " Or durn fool for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're shoutin ' , Cap . Stomp on me proper . I certainly need to be curried . " Again the Ranger snorted . " H'mp ! Been scarin ' any more young ladies to death ? " " No more this mo'nin ' , Captain , " answered Jack equably . " Nor grandstandin ' with any more ladino steers ? " " I exhibit only once a day . " " By dog , you give a sure-enough good show , " exploded Ellison . " You got yore nerve , boy . Wait around till the prettiest girl in Texas can see you pull off the big play -- run the risk of havin ' her trampled to death , just so 's you can grin an ' say , ' Pleased to meet you , ma'am . ' When I call you durn fool , I realize it 's too weak a name . " " Hop to it , Captain . Use up some real language on me . Spill out a lot of those syllogisms you got bottled up inside you . I got it comin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . The Captain had been a mule-skinner once , and for five glorious minutes he did himself proud while the graceless young cowpuncher beamed on him . " You sure go some , Cap , " applauded the young fellow . " I 'd admire to have your flow of talk . " Ellison subsided into anticlimax . " Well , do n't you ever drive yore wild hill-critters through town again . Hear me , young fellow ? " " You 'll have to speak to Wadley about that . I 'm not his trail boss any longer . " " Since when ? " " Since five o'clock yesterday evenin ' . I was turnin ' over the herd this mo'nin ' when the little lady showed up an ' I had to pull off the bulldoggin ' . " " Wadley fire you ? " " That 's whatever . " " Why ? " " Did n't like the way I mussed up son Rutherford , I kind o ' gathered . " " Another of yore fool plays . First you beat up Wadley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything more ? " " That 's all up to date -- except that the old man hinted I was a brand-burner . " " The deuce he did ! " " I judge that son Rutherford had told him I was one of the Dinsmore gang . Seems I 'm all right except for bein ' a rowdy an ' a bully an ' a thief an ' a bad egg generally . " " H'mp ! Said you was a rustler , did he ? " The Ranger caressed his goatee and reflected on this before he pumped a question at the line-rider . " Are you ? " " No more than Rutherford Wadley . " The Captain shot a swift slant look at this imperturbable young man . Was there a hidden meaning in that answer ? " What 's the matter with Wadley ? Does he expect you to let Ford run it over you ? That ai n't like Clint . " " He 's likely listened to a pack o ' lies . " " And you have n't heard from him since ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' a hundred-dollar bill . " Ellison sat up . " What for ? " " For my fancy bulldoggin ' . " The hard eyes of the young fellow smouldered with resentment . " By dog , did Clint send you money for savin ' ' Mona ? " " He did n't say what it was for -- so I rolled up the bill an ' lit a cigarette with it . " " You take expensive smokes , young man , " chuckled the officer . " It was on Wadley . I burned only half the bill . He can cash in the other half , for I sent it back to him . When he got it , he sent for me . " " And you went ? " " You know damn well I did n't . When he wants me , he knows where to find me . " " Most young hill-billies step when Clint tells ' em to . " " Do they ? " asked the range-rider indifferently . " You bet you . They jump when he whistles . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't made up my mind yet . Mebbe I 'll drift along the trail to the Pecos country . " " What was Clint payin ' you ? " " Sixty a month an ' found . " " How 'd you like to have yore wages lowered ? " " Meanin '  --  " " That I 'll give you a job . " Young Roberts had a capacity for silence . He asked no questions now , but waited for Ellison to develop the situation . " With the Rangers . Dollar a day an ' furnish yore own bronc , " explained the Captain . " The State of Texas is liberal , " said the cowboy with dry sarcasm . " That 's as you look at it . If you 're a money-grubber , do n't join us . But if you 'd like to be one of the finest fightin ' force in the world with somethin ' doin ' every minute , then you 'd better sign up . I 'll promise that you die young an ' not in yore bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with amiable irony . " It is , for men with red blood in ' em , " retorted the gray-haired fire-eater hotly . " All right . I 'll take your word for it , Captain . You 've hired a hand . " CHAPTER VI CLINT WADLEY 'S MESSENGER Outside the door of the commandant 's office Arthur Ridley stood for a moment and glanced nervously up and down the dirt road . In a hog-leather belt around his waist was six thousand dollars just turned over to him by Major Ponsford as the last payment for beef steers delivered at the fort according to contract some weeks earlier . Arthur had decided not to start on the return journey until next morning , but he was not sure his judgment had been good . It was still early afternoon . Before nightfall he might be thirty miles on his way . The trouble with that was that he would then have to spend two nights out , and the long hours of darkness with their flickering shadows cast by the camp-fires would be full of torture for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till morning , word might leak out from the officers ' quarters that he was carrying a large sum of money . A drunken man came weaving down the street . He stopped opposite Ridley and balanced himself with the careful dignity of the inebriate . But the gray eyes , hard as those of a gunman , showed no trace of intoxication . Nor did the steady voice . " Friend , are you Clint Wadley 's messenger ? " The startled face of Ridley flew a flag of confession . " Why -- what do you mean ? " he stammered . Nobody was to have known that he had come to get the money for the owner of the A T O. " None of my business , you mean , " flung back the man curtly . " Good enough ! It ai n't . What 's more , I do n't give a damn . But listen : I was at the Buffalo Hump when two fellows came in . Me , I was most asleep , and they sat in the booth next to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this -- that they 're aimin ' to hold up some messenger of Clint Wadley after he leaves town to-morrow . You 're the man , I reckon . All right . Look out for yourself . That 's all . " " But -- what shall I do ? " asked Ridley . " Do ? I do n't care . I 'm tellin ' you -- see ? Do as you please . " " What would you do ? " The danger and the responsibility that had fallen upon him out of a sky of sunshine paralyzed the young man 's initiative . The deep-set , flinty eyes narrowed to slits . " What I 'd do ai n't necessarily what you 'd better do . What are you , stranger -- high-grade stuff , or the run o ' the pen ? " " I 'm no gun-fighter , if that 's what you mean . " " Then I 'd make my get-away like a jackrabbit hell-poppin ' for its hole . I got one slant at these fellows in the Buffalo Hump . They 're bully-puss kind o ' men , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm from the East . " " They 'll run it over you , bluff you off the map , take any advantage they can . " " Will they fight ? " " They 'll burn powder quick if they get the drop on you . " " What are they like ? " The Texan considered . " One is a tall , red-headed guy ; the other 's a sawed-off , hammered-down little runt -- but gunmen , both of ' em , or I 'm a liar . " " They would probably follow me , " said the messenger , worried . " You better believe they will , soon as they hear you 've gone . " Arthur kicked a little hole in the ground with the toe of his shoe . What had he better do ? He could stay at the fort , of course , and appeal to Major Ponsford for help . But if he did , he would probably be late for his appointment with Wadley . It happened that the cattleman and the army officer had had a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been delivered , and it was not at all likely that Ponsford would give him a military guard to Tascosa . Moreover , he had a feeling that the owner of the A T O would resent any call to the soldiers for assistance . Clint Wadley usually played his own hand , and he expected the same of his men . But the habit of young Ridley 's life had not made for fitness to cope with a frontier emergency . Nor was he of stiff enough clay to fight free of his difficulty without help . " What about you ? " he asked the other man . " Can I hire you to ride with me to Tascosa ? " " As a tenderfoot-wrangler ? " sneered the Texan . Arthur flushed . " I 've never been there . I do n't know the way . " " You follow a gun-barrel road from the fort . But I 'll ride with you -- if the pay is right . " " What do you say to twenty dollars for the trip ? " " You 've hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I pack a six-shooter . " The troubled young man looked into the hard , reckless face of this stranger who had gone out of his way to warn him of the impending attack . No certificate was necessary to tell him that this man would fight . " I do n't know your name , " said Ridley , still hesitating . " Any more than I know yours , " returned the other . " Call me Bill Moore , an ' I 'll be on hand to eat my share of the chuck . " " We 'd better leave at once , do n't you think ? " " You 're the doc . Meet you here in an hour ready for the trail . " The man who called himself Bill Moore went his uncertain way down the street . To the casual eye he was far gone in drink . Young Ridley went straight to the corral where he had put up his horse . He watered and fed the animal , and after an endless half-hour saddled the bronco . Moore joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together they rode out of the post . As the Texan had said , the road to Tascosa ran straight as a gun-barrel . At first they rode in silence , swiftly , leaving behind them mile after mile of dusty trail . It was a brown , level country thickly dotted with yucca . Once Moore shot a wild turkey running in the grass . Prairie-chicken were abundant , and a flight of pigeons numbering thousands passed at one time over their heads and obscured the sky . " Goin ' down to the encinal to roost , " explained Moore . " A man could come pretty near living off his rifle in this country , " Arthur remarked . " Outside o ' flour an ' salt , I 've done it many a time . I rode through the Pecos Valley to Fort Sumner an ' on to Denver oncet an ' lived off the land . Time an ' again I 've done it from the Brazos to the Canadian . If he gets tired of game , a man can jerk the hind quarters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet mast an ' cooked on a hackberry bush fire , an ' I 'll never ask for better chuck , " the Texan promised . In spite of Ridley 's manifest desire to push on far into the night , Moore made an early camp . " No use gauntin ' our broncs when we 've got all the time there is before us . A horse is a man 's friend . He do n't want to waste it into a sorry-lookin ' shadow . Besides , we 're better off here than at Painted Rock . It 's nothin ' but a whistlin ' - post in the desert . " " Yes , but I 'd like to get as far from the fort as we can . I -- I 'm in a hurry to reach Tascosa , " the younger man urged . Moore opened a row of worn and stained teeth to smile . " Do n't worry , young fellow . I 'm with you now . " After they had made camp and eaten , the two men sat beside the flickering fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known around Dodge City and in the Lincoln County War that was still waging in New Mexico . He had freighted to the Panhandle from El Moro , Colorado , from Wichita Falls , and even from Dodge . The consummate confidence of the man soothed the unease of the young fellow with the hogskin belt . This plainsman knew all that the Southwest had to offer of danger and was equal to any of it . Presently Arthur Ridley grew drowsy . The last that he remembered before he fell asleep was seeing Moore light his pipe again with a live coal from the fire . The Texan was to keep the first watch . It was well along toward morning when the snapping of a bush awakened Ridley . He sat upright and reached quickly for the revolver by his side . " Do n't you , " called a voice sharply from the brush . Two men , masked with slitted handkerchiefs , broke through the shin-oak just as Arthur whipped up his gun . The hammer fell once -- twice , but no explosion followed . With two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropped his harmless weapon . Moore came to life with sleepy eyes , but he was taken at a disadvantage , and with a smothered oath handed over his revolver . " Wha-what do you want ? " asked Ridley , his teeth chattering . The shorter of the two outlaws , a stocky man with deep chest and extraordinarily broad shoulders , growled an answer . " We want that money of Clint Wadley 's you 're packin ' . " The camp-fire had died to ashes , and the early-morning air was chill . Arthur felt himself trembling so that his hands shook . A prickling of the skin went goose-quilling down his back . In the dim light those masked figures behind the businesslike guns were sinister with the threat of mystery and menace . " I -- have n't any money , " he quavered . " You 'd better have it , young fellow , me lad ! " jeered the tall bandit . " We 're here strictly for business . Dig up . " " I do n't reckon he 's carryin ' any money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look reasonable that an old-timer like Clint , who knocked the bark off'n this country when I was still a kid , would send a tenderfoot to pack gold ' cross country for him . " The tall man swung his revolver on Moore . " ' Nuff from you , " he ordered grimly . The heavy-set outlaw did not say a word . He moved forward and pressed the cold rim of his forty-five against the forehead of the messenger . The fluttering heart of the young man beat hard against his ribs . His voice stuck in his throat , but he managed to gasp a surrender . " It 's in my belt . For God 's sake , do n't shoot . " " Gim me yore belt . " The boy unbuckled the ribbon of hogskin beneath his shirt and passed it to the man behind the gun . The outlaw noticed that his fingers were cold and clammy . " Stand back to back , " commanded the heavy man . Deftly he swung a rope over the heads of his captives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knotted it here and there , and finished with a triple knot where their heels came together . " That 'll hold ' em hitched a few minutes , " the lank man approved after he had tested the rope . " I 'd like to get a lick at you fellows . I will , too , some day , " mentioned Moore casually . " When you meet up with us we 'll be there , " retorted the heavy-weight . " Let 's go , Steve . " The long man nodded . " Adios , boys . " " See you later , and when I meet up with you , it 'll be me ' n ' you to a finish , " the Texan called . The thud of the retreating , hoofs grew faint and died . Already Moore was busy with the rope that tied them together . " What 's the matter , kid ? You shakin ' for the drinks ? Did n't you see from the first we were n't in any danger ? If they 'd wanted to harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How much was in that belt ? " " Six thousand dollars , " the boy groaned . " Well , it does n't cost you a cent . Cheer up , son . " By this time Moore had both his arms free and was loosening one of the knots . " I was in charge of it . I 'll never dare face Mr. Wadley . " " Sho ! It was his own fault . How in Mexico come he to send a boy to market for such a big stake ? " " Nobody was to have known what I came for . I do n't see how it got out . " " Must ' a ' been a leak somewhere . Do n't you care . Play the hand that 's dealt you and let the boss worry . Take it from me , you 're lucky not to be even powder-burnt when a shot from the chaparral might have done yore business . " " If you only had n't fallen asleep ! " " Reckon I dozed off . I was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last knot and stepped out from the loop . " I 'm goin ' to saddle the broncs . You ride in to Tascosa and tell Wadley . I 'll take up the trail an ' follow it while it 's warm . We 'll see if a pair of shorthorns can run a sandy like that on me . " He fell suddenly into the violent , pungent speech of the mule-skinner . " I 'll go with you , " announced Ridley . He had no desire to face Clint Wadley with such a lame tale . The cold eyes of the Texan drilled into his . " No , you wo n't . You 'll go to town an ' tell the old man what 's happened . Tell him to send his posse across the malpais toward the rim-rock . I 'll meet him at Two Buck Crossin ' with any news I 've got . " A quarter of an hour later the hoofs of his horse flung back faint echoes from the distance . The boy collapsed . His head sank into his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANCE Long since the sun had slid behind the horizon edge and given place to a desert night of shimmering moonlight and far stars . From the enchanted mesa Rutherford Wadley descended to a valley draw in which were huddled a score of Mexican jacals , huts built of stakes stuck in a trench , roofed with sod and floored with mud . Beyond these was a more pretentious house . Originally it had been a log " hogan , " but a large adobe addition had been constructed for a store . Inside this the dance was being held . Light filtered through the chinks in the mud . From door and windows came the sounds of scraping fiddles and stamping feet . The singsong voice of the caller and the occasional whoop of a cowboy punctuated the medley of noises . A man whose girth would have put Falstaff to shame greeted Rutherford wheezily . " Fall off and ' light , Ford . She 's in full swing and the bridle 's off . " The man was Jumbo Wilkins , line-rider for the A T O. Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer his father 's employee . It was in little ways like this that he endeared himself to those at hand , and it was just this spirit that the democratic West would not tolerate . While the rider was tying his horse to the hitch-rack , Jumbo Wilkins , who was a friendly soul , made another try at conversation . " Glad you got an invite . Old man Cobb had n't room for everybody , so he did n't make his bid wide open . " The young man jingled up the steps . " That so ? Well , I did n't get an invite , as you call it . But I 'm here . " He contrived to say it so offensively that Jumbo flushed with anger . Wadley sauntered into the room and stood for a moment by the door . His trim , graceful figure and dark good looks made him at once a focus of eyes . Nonchalantly he sunned himself in the limelight , with that little touch of swagger that captures the imagination of girls . No man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blind the one-eyed are kings , and to these frontier women this young fellow was a glass of fashion . There was about him , too , a certain dash , a spice of the devil more desirable in a breaker of hearts than any mere beauty . His bold , possessive eyes ranged over the room to claim what they might desire . He had come to the dance at Tomichi Creek to make love to Tony Alviro 's betrothed sweetheart Bonita . She was in the far corner with her little court about her . If Bonita was a flirt , it must be admitted she was a charming one . No girl within a day 's ride was so courted as she . Compact of fire and passion , brimming with life and health , she drew men to her as the flame the moth . Presently the music started . Bonita , in the arms of Tony , floated past Rutherford , a miracle of supple lightness . A flash of soft eyes darted at the heir of the A T O ranch . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the dance was over , Wadley made his way indolently toward her . He claimed the next waltz . She had promised it to Tony , the girl said -- and the next . " Tony ca n't close-herd you , " laughed Rutherford . " His title ai n't clear yet -- wo n't be till the priest has said so . You 'll dance the second one with me , Bonita . " " We shall see , senor , " she mocked . But the Mexican blood in the girl beat fast . In her soft , liquid eyes lurked the hunger for sex adventure . And this man was a prince of the blood -- the son of Clint Wadley , the biggest cattleman in West Texas . There were challenging stars of deviltry in Bonita 's eyes when they met those of Rutherford over the shoulder of Alviro while she danced , but the color was beating warm through her dark skin . The lift of her round , brown throat to an indifferent tilt of the chin was mere pretense . The languorous passion of the South was her inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the melodious dance . Alviro was master of ceremonies , and Wadley found his chance while the young Mexican was of necessity away from Bonita . Rutherford bowed to her with elaborate mockery . " Come . Let us walk in the moonlight , sweetheart , " he said . Bonita turned to him with slow grace . The eyes of the man and the woman met and fought . In hers there was a kind of savage fierceness , in his an insolent confidence . " No , " she answered . " Ah ! You 're afraid of me -- afraid to trust yourself with me , " he boasted . She was an untutored child of the desert , and his words were a spur to her quick pride . She rose at once , her bosom rising and falling fast . She would never confess that -- never . The girl walked beside him with the fluent grace of youth , beautiful as a forest fawn . In ten years she would be fat and slovenly like her Mexican mother , but now she carried her slender body as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank into a little patch of mud where some one had watered a horse . Under the cottonwoods she pulled up her skirt a trifle and made a moue of disgust at the soiled slipper . " See what you 've done ! " Small , even teeth , gleamed in a coquettish smile from the ripe lips of the little mouth . He understood that he was being invited to kneel and clean the mud-stained shoe . " If you 're looking for a doormat to wipe your feet on , I 'll send for Tony , " he jeered . The father of Bonita was Anglo-Saxon . She flashed anger at his presumption . " Do n't you think it . Tony will never be a doormat to anybody . Be warned , senor , and do not try to take what is his . " Again their eyes battled . Neither of them saw a man who had come out from the house and was watching them from the end of the porch . " I take what the gods give , my dear , and ask leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? " " Ah ! That is different . When the woman is Bonita , muchacha , I am her slave . " He dropped to one knee and with his handkerchief wiped the mud from the heel of her slipper . For a moment his fingers touched lightly the trim little ankle ; then he rose quickly and caught her in his arms . " Sometime -- soon -- it 's going to be me and you , sweetheart , " he whispered . " Do n't , " she begged , struggling against herself and him . " If Tony sees --  " His passion was too keen-edged to take warning . He kissed her lips and throat and eyes . The eyes of the watcher never wavered . They were narrowed to shining slits of jet . " Why do you come and -- and follow me ? " the girl cried softly . " It is not that you do not know Tony is jealous . This is not play with him . He loves me and will fight for me . You are mad . " " For love of you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The instinct that served her for a conscience had long since told her as much . But her vanity , and perhaps something deeper , craved satisfaction . She wanted to believe he meant it . Under his ardent gaze the long lashes of the girl drooped to her dusky cheeks . It was Tony she loved , but Tony offered her only happiness and not excitement . A moment later she gave a startled little cry and pushed herself free . Her dilated eyes were fixed on something behind the cattleman . Rutherford , warned by her expression , whirled on his heel . Tony Alviro , knife in hand , was close upon him . Wadley lashed out hard with his left and caught the Mexican on the point of the chin . The blow lifted Tony from his feet and flung him at full length to the ground . He tried to rise , groaned -- rolled over . Bonita was beside him in an instant . From where she knelt , with Tony 's dark head in her arms pressed close to her bosom , she lie through and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen men were charging from the house . Jumbo pinned Wadley 's arms by the elbows to prevent him from drawing a revolver . " What 's the rumpus ? " he demanded . " The fellow tried to knife me in the back , " explained Rutherford . " Jealous , because I took his girl . " " So ? " grunted Wilkins . " Well , you 'd better light a shuck out o ' here . You came on yore own invite . You can go on mine . " " Why should I go ? I 'll see you at Tombstone first . " " Why ? " Jumbo 's voice was no longer amiable and ingratiating . " Because you gave Tony a raw deal , an ' he 's got friends here . Have you ? " Wadley looked round and saw here and there Mexican faces filled with sullen resentment . It came to him swiftly that this was no place for his father 's son to linger . " I do n't push my society on any one , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go . But I serve notice right here that any one who tries to pull a knife on me will get cold lead next time . " Jumbo , with his arm tucked under that of Wadley , led the way to the house . He untied the rein of Rutherford 's horse and handed it to the son of his boss . " Vamos ! " he said . The young man pulled himself to the saddle . " You 're a hell of a friend , " he snarled . " Who said anything about bein ' a friend ? I 'm particular about when I use that word , " replied Wilkins evenly , with hard eyes . Wadley 's quirt burned the flank of the cow-pony and it leaped for the road . When five minutes later some one inquired for Tony he too had disappeared . CHAPTER VIII RUTHERFORD MAKES A MISTAKE Rutherford Wadley struck across country toward the rim-rock . Anger burned high in him , and like the bully he was he took it out of his good horse by roweling its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving forward straight as an arrow . Behind him in the darkness followed a shadow , sinister and silent , out of sight , but within sound of the horse 's footfall . It stopped when Wadley stopped ; when he moved , it moved . Midnight found young Wadley still moving straight forward , the moon on his left . Painted Rock was ten miles to the west . Except for the stage station there , and the settlement he had left , there was no other habitation for fifty miles . It was a wilderness of silence . Yet in that waste of empty space Rutherford " jumped up " a camper . The man was a trader , carrying honey and pecans to Fort Worth . He was awakened by the sound of a raucous curse , he testified later , and in the bright moonlight saw the young cattleman beating his horse . Evidently the young animal had been startled at sight of his white-topped wagon . An angry sentence or two passed between the men before the cattleman moved over the hill-brow . As the trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him faintly the sound of another horse . He was not able to explain later why this struck him as ominous , beyond the strangeness of the fact that two men , not in each other 's company , should be traveling so close together in the desert . At any rate , he rose , crept forward to a clump of Spanish bayonet , and from behind it saw a young Mexican pass along the swale . He was close enough almost to have touched him , and in the rich moonlight saw the boyish face clearly . By the time Wadley reached the rough country of the cap-rock , the young day was beginning to awaken . A quail piped its morning greeting from the brush . A gleam of blue in the dun sky flashed warning of a sun soon to rise . He had struck the rim-rock a little too far to the right , and deflected from his course to find the pocket he was seeking . For half a mile he traveled parallel to the ridge , then turned into a break in the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whistle . Presently , from above a big boulder , a head appeared cautiously . " Hello , out there ! Who is it ? " " Ford . " The rider swung to the ground stiffly and led his horse forward down a sharply descending path to a little draw . A lank , sallow man with a rifle joined him . With his back to a flat rock , a heavy-set , broad-shouldered fellow was lounging . " ' Lo , Ford . Did n't expect you to-night , " he grumbled . " Drifted over from the dance at Tomichi Creek . Beat up a young Mexican and had to get out . " " You 're such a sullen brute ! Why ca n't you let folks alone ? " Pete Dinsmore wanted to know . He was annoyed . Rutherford Wadley was not a partner in the business on hand to-night , and he would rather the man had been a hundred miles away . " He got jealous and tried to knife me , " explained the heir of the A T O sulkily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn sense ? Who was it this time ? " " Tony Alviro . His girl 's crazy about me . " The keen , hard eyes of Dinsmore took in the smug complacency of the handsome young cad . He knew that this particular brand of fool would go its own way , but he wasted a word of advice . " I do n't guess you want any pearls o ' wisdom from me , but I 'll onload some gratis . You let Bonita Menendez alone or Tony will camp on yore trail till he gits you . " " Sure will , " agreed Gurley , setting down his rifle . " Them Mexicans hang together , too . We need their friendship in our business . Better lay off them . " " I do n't remember askin ' your advice , Gurley . " " Well , I 'm givin ' it . See ? " Another sharp whistle cut the air . Gurley picked up the rifle again and climbed the lookout rock . Presently he returned with a dismounted horseman . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours earlier as Bill Moore . " Howdy , boys . Got the stuff all safe ? " he asked cheerfully . From behind Wadley Pete Dinsmore was making a series of facial contortions . Unfortunately the new arrival did not happen to be looking at him , and so missed the warning . " Never saw anything work prettier , " Moore said with a grin as he put down his saddle on a boulder . " Ridley had n't ought to be let out without a nurse . He swallowed my whole yarn -- gobbled down bait , sinker an ' line . Where 's the gold , Pete ? " " In a sack back of the big rock . " Pete was disgusted with his brother Homer , alias Bill Moore . They would probably have to divide with young Wadley now , to keep his mouth shut . Rutherford jumped at the truth . His father had told him that he was going to give Art Ridley a try-out by sending him to the fort for a payment of gold . Probably he , Rutherford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drunk . They had held up the messenger , intending to freeze him out of any share of the profits . All right -- he would show them whether he was a two-spot . " Bring out the sack . Let 's have a look at it , " he ordered . Gurley handed the sack to Pete Dinsmore , and the men squatted in a circle tailor-fashion . " Smooth work , I call it , " said Homer Dinsmore . He explained to Wadley why he was of this opinion . " Steve heard tell of a wagon-train goin ' to Tascosa to-day . If Ridley slept overnight at the fort he would hear of it an ' stay with the freight outfit till he had delivered the gold to yore dad . We had to get him started right away . So I pulled on him a story about hearin ' the boys intended to hold him up . He hired me as a guard to help him stand off the bad men . Whilst I was keepin ' watch I fixed up his six-shooter so 's it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed piece of work I ever did pull off . I 'd ought to get a half of what we took off'n him instead of a third . " " A third ! Who says you get a third ? " asked Wadley . " Three of us did this job , did n't we ? " cut in Gurley . " Sure . You took what belongs to me -- or at least to my dad , " protested young Wadley . " Tried to slip one over on me . Guess again , boys . I wo n't stand for it . " The jade eyes of the older brother narrowed . " Meanin ' just what , Ford ? " " What do you take me for , Pete ? Think I 'm goin ' to let you rob me of my own money an ' never cheep ? I 'll see you all in blazes first , " cried Wadley wildly . " Yes , but -- just what would you do about it ? " " Do ? I 'll ride to town an ' tell Cap Ellison . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hot . " There was a moment of chill silence . Three of the four men present knew that Rutherford Wadley had just passed sentence of death upon himself . They had doubted him before , vaguely , and without any definite reason . But after this open threat the fear that he would betray them would never lift until he was where he could no longer tell tales . " How much of this money do you think is comin ' to you , Ford ? " asked Pete quietly . " It 's all mine , anyhow . You boys know that . " Rutherford hesitated ; then his greed dominated . He had them where they had to eat out of his hand . " Give me two thirds , an ' you fellows divide the other third for your trouble . That 's fair . " " Goddlemighty , what 's eatin ' you ? " Gurley exploded . " Think we 're plumb idjits ? You ' n ' me will mix bullets first , you traitor ! " The Dinsmores exchanged one long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get on the prod , Steve . Ford sure has got us where the wool 's short , but I reckon he aims to be reasonable . Let 's say half for you , Ford , an ' the other half divided among the rest of us . " Wadley had refreshed himself out of a bottle several times during the night . Ordinarily he would have accepted the proposed compromise , but the sullen and obstinate side of him was uppermost . " You 've heard my terms , Pete . I stand pat . " Again a significant look passed , this time between Pete Dinsmore and Gurley . " All right , " said Homer Dinsmore shortly . " It 's a raw deal you 're givin ' us , but I reckon you know yore own business , Wadley . " The money was emptied from the pigskin belt and divided . Rutherford repacked his two thirds in the belt and put it on next his shirt . " I do n't know what you fellows are goin ' to do , but I 'm goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I aim to get back in time to join one of the posses in their hunt for the outlaws . " His jest did not win any smiles . The men grimly watched him saddle and ride away . A quarter of an hour later they too were in the saddle . CHAPTER IX MURDER IN THE CHAPARRAL To Jack Roberts , engaged at the Delmonico restaurant in the serious business of demolishing a steak smothered in onions , came Pedro Menendez with a strange story of a man lying dead in the rim-rock , a bullet-hole in the back of his head . The Mexican vaquero came to his news haltingly . He enveloped it in mystery . There was a dead man lying at the foot of Battle Butte , out in the rim-rock country , and there was this wound in the back of his head . That was all . Pedro became vague at once as to detail . He took refuge in shrugs and a poor memory when the Ranger pressed him in regard to the source of his information . Roberts knew the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell and no more . He accepted the news given him and for the moment did not push his questions home . For twenty-four hours the Ranger had been in the saddle , and he was expecting to turn in for a round-the-clock sleep . But Pedro 's tale changed his mind . Captain Ellison was at Austin , Lieutenant Hawley at Tascosa . Regretfully Roberts gave up his overdue rest and ordered another cup of strong coffee . Soon he was in the saddle again with a fresh horse under him . The Panhandle was at its best . Winter snows and spring rains had set it blooming . The cacti were a glory of white , yellow , purple , pink , and scarlet blossoms . The white , lilylike flowers of the Spanish bayonet flaunted themselves everywhere . Meadowlarks chirruped gayly and prairie-hens fluttered across the path in front of the rider . Battle Butte had received its name from an old tradition of an Indian fight . Here a party of braves had made a last stand against an overwhelming force of an enemy tribe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bastion from the rim-rock . The erosions of centuries had given it an appearance very like a fort . Jack skirted the base of the butte . At the edge of a clump of prickly pear he found the evidence of grim tragedy which the circling buzzards had already warned him to expect . He moved toward it very carefully , in order not to obliterate any footprints . The body lay face down in a huddled heap , one hand with outstretched finger reaching forth like a sign-post . A bullet-hole in the back of the head showed how the man had come to his death . He had been shot from behind . The Ranger turned the body and recognized it as that of Rutherford Wadley . The face was crushed and one of the arms broken . It was an easy guess that the murder had been done on the butte above and the body flung down . Jack , on all fours , began to quarter over the ground like a bloodhound seeking a trail . Every sense in him seemed to quicken to the hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he crept forward , touched the sand soft as velvet . His body was tense as a coiled spring . No cougar stalking its prey could have been more lithely wary . For the Ranger had found a faint boot-track , and with amazing pains he was following this delible record of guilt . Some one had come here and looked at the dead body . Why ? To make sure that the victim was quite dead ? To identify the victim ? Roberts did not know why , but he meant to find out . The footprint was alone . Apparently none led to it or led from it . On that one impressionable spot alone had been written the signature of a man 's presence . But " Tex " Roberts was not an old plainsman for nothing . He knew that if he were patient enough he would find other marks of betrayal . He found a second track -- a third , and from them determined a course to follow . It brought him to a stretch of soft ground at the edge of a wash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an arroyo to the bluff above . The Ranger knelt dose to the most distinct print and studied it for a long time . All its details and peculiarities were recorded in his mind . The broken sole , the worn heel , the beveled edge of the toe-cap -- all these fastened themselves in his memory . With a tape-line he measured minutely the length of the whole foot , of the sole and of the heel . These he jotted down in his notebook , together with cross-sections of width . He duplicated this process with the best print he could find of the left foot . His investigation led him next to the summit of the bluff . A little stain of blood on a rock showed him where Wadley had probably been standing when he was shot . The murder might have been done by treachery on the part of one of his companions . If so , probably the bullet had been fired from a revolver . In that case the man who did it would have made sure by standing close behind his victim . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the wound . The chances were that the shooting had been done from ambush , and if this was a true guess , it was a fair deduction that the assassin had hidden behind the point of rocks just back of the bluff . For he could reach that point by following the rim-rock without being seen by his victim . Roberts next studied the ground just back of the point of rocks . The soil here was of disintegrated granite , so that there were no footprints to betray anybody who might have been hidden there . But Jack picked up something that was in its way as decisive as what he had been seeking . It was a cartridge that had been ejected from a ' 731 rifle . The harmless bit of metal in his hand was the receptacle from which death had flashed across the open toward Ford Wadley . At the foot of the rim-rock the Ranger found signs where horses had been left . He could not at first make sure whether there were three or four . From that spot he back-tracked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the night-camp where Wadley had met the outlaws . This , too , he studied for a long time . He had learned a good deal , but he did not know why Ford Wadley had been shot . The young fellow had not been in Texas more than six or eight months , and he could not have made many enemies . If he had nothing about him worth stealing -- and in West Texas men were not in the habit of carrying valuables -- the object could not have been robbery . He rode back to Battle Butte and carried to town with him the body of the murdered man . There he heard two bits of news , either of which might serve as a cause for the murder : Young Wadley had quarreled with Tony Alviro at a dance and grossly insulted him ; Arthur Ridley had been robbed of six thousand dollars by masked men while on his way to Tascosa . Ranger Roberts decided that he would like to have a talk with Tony . Footnote 1 : The ' 73 rifle was not a seventy-three-caliber weapon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its cartridges could be used for a forty-four revolver . CHAPTER X " A DAMNED POOR APOLOGY FOR A MAN " The big cattleman from New Mexico who was talking with the owner of the A T O threw his leg across the arm of the chair . " The grass is good on the Pecos this year . Up in Mexico2 the cattle look fine . " " Same here , " agreed Wadley . " I 'm puttin ' ten thousand yearlin 's on the Canadian . " A barefoot negro boy appeared at his elbow with a note . The owner of the A T O ripped open the envelope and read : Dear Mr. Wadley : I was held up last night by masked men and robbed . They took the gold . I 'm too sick to go farther . Arthur Ridley . The jaw of the Texas cattleman clamped . He rose abruptly . " I got business on hand . A messenger of mine has been robbed of six thousand dollars . " He turned to the colored boy . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buffalo Corral , sah . " Wadley strode from the hotel , flung himself on a horse , and galloped down the street toward the corral . Young Ridley was lying on a pile of hay when his employer entered . His heart was sick with fear and worry . For he knew now that his lack of boldness had led him into a serious mistake . He had by his indecision put himself in the power of Moore , and the chances were that the man was in collusion with the gang that had held him up . He had made another mistake in not going directly to Wadley with the news . The truth was that he had not the nerve to face his employer . It was quite on the cards that the old-timer might use a blacksnake whip on him . So he had taken refuge in a plea of illness . The cattleman took one look at him and understood . He reached down and jerked the young fellow from the hay as if he had been a child . The stomach muscles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clint Wadley in anger was dangerous . In his youth he had been a gun-fighter and the habit had never entirely been broken . " I -- I 'm ill , " the young fellow pleaded . " You 'll be sure enough ill if you do n't watch out . I 'll gamble on that . Onload yore tale like shot off'n a shovel . Quit yore whinin ' . I got no time for it . " Arthur told his story . The cattleman fired at him crisp , keen questions . He dragged from the trembling youth the when , where , and how of the robbery . What kind of pilgrim was this fellow Moore ? Was he tall ? Short ? Dark ? Bearded ? Young ? Old ? What were the masked men like ? Did they use any names ? Did he see their horses ? Which way did they go ? The messenger made lame answers . Mostly he could only say , " I do n't know . " " You 're a damned poor apology for a man -- not worth the powder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for the money entrusted to you , nor the nerve to face me after you had lost it . Get out of here . Vamos ! Do n't ever let me hear yore smooth , glib tongue again . " The words of Wadley stung like hail . Arthur was thin-skinned ; he wanted the good opinion of all those with whom he came in contact , and especially that of this man . Like a whipped cur he crept away and hid himself in the barn loft , alone with his soul-wounds . From its window he watched the swift bustle of preparation for the pursuit . Wadley himself , big and vigorous to the last masculine inch of him , was the dominant figure . He gave curt orders to the members of the posse , arranged for supplies to be forwarded to a given point , and outlined plans of action . In the late afternoon the boy in the loft saw them ride away , a dozen lean , long-bodied men armed to the limit . With all his heart the watcher wished he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rough-and-tumble life of the frontier might develop . In every fiber of his jarred being he was sore . He despised himself for his failure to measure up to the standard of manhood demanded of him by his environment . Twice now he had failed . The memory of his first failure still scorched his soul . During ghastly hours of many nights he had lived over that moment when he had shown the white feather before Ramona Wadley . He had run for his life and left her alone to face a charging bull . It was no excuse to plead with himself that he could have done nothing for her if he had stayed . At least he could have pushed her to one side and put himself in the path of the enraged animal . The loss of the money was different . It had been due not wholly to lack of nerve , but in part at least to bad judgment . Surely there was something to be said for his inexperience . Wadley ought not to have sent him alone on such an errand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last man anybody was likely to suspect of carrying treasure .... Late that night Ridley crept out , bought supplies , saddled his horse , and slipped into the wilderness . He was still writhing with self- contempt . There was a futile longing in his soul for oblivion to blot out his misery . Footnote 2 : In western Texas when one speaks of Mexico he means New Mexico . If he refers to the country Mexico , he says Old Mexico . CHAPTER XI ONE TO FOUR Through the great gray desert with its freakish effects of erosion a rider had moved steadily in the hours of star-strewn darkness . He had crossed the boundary of that No Man 's Land which ran as a neutral strip between Texas and its neighbor and was claimed by each . Since the courts had as yet recognized the rights of neither litigant there was properly no State jurisdiction here . Therefore those at outs with the law fled to this strip and claimed immunity . In the Panhandle itself law was a variable quantity . Its counties had been laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes they were attached to Wheeler County . Even the Rangers did not pretend to police this district . When they wanted a man they went in and got him . The rider swung at last from his saddle and dropped the bridle reins to the ground . He crept forward to some long , flat sheep-sheds that bulked dimly in the night shadows . Farther back , he could just make out the ghost of a dwelling-hut . Beyond that , he knew , was a Mexican village of three or four houses . A windmill reared its gaunt frame in the corral . A long trough was supplied by it with water for the sheep . The night-rider dipped a bucket of water from the tank that fed the trough . He carried it to the gate of the corral and poured it slowly into the fine dust made by the sharp feet of the sheep , mixing the water and dust to a thick paste with the end of an old branding-iron . He brought bucket after bucket of water until he had prepared a bed of smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his preparation a dog inside the adobe hut began to bark violently . The interloper slipped over the fence and retreated to the darkness of the barranca . From the direction of the hut men poured . The one crouching in the chaparral heard voices . He made out a snatch or two of talk in Spanish . The men were explaining to themselves that the dog must have been barking at a wolf or a coyote . Presently they trooped back into the house . Silence fell again over the night . The man in the chaparral once more crept forward and climbed the fence . He made straight for the entrance of the corral . Carefully he examined the footprints written in the bed of mud he had prepared . One after another he studied them . Some had been crossed out or blotted by subsequent prints , but a few were perfect . One of these he scrutinized for a long time , measuring its dimensions with a tape-line from toe to heel , across the ball of the foot , the instep , and the heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining with satisfaction . He had found what he wanted . Once more the dog was uneasy with growlings . The man retreated from the corral , returned to his horse , and rode away across the mesa . A quarter of an hour later he unsaddled , hobbled his horse , and rolled up in a blanket . Immediately he fell into sound sleep . It was broad day when he wakened . The young morning sun bathed him in warmth . He lighted a fire of mesquite and boiled coffee . In his frying- pan he cooked flapjacks , after he had heated the jerked beef which he carried in his saddlebags . When he had eaten , he washed his pan with clean , fine sand , repacked his supplies , and rode forward past the sheep-corral to the village . In front of a mud-and-log tendejon two Mexicans lounged . They watched him with silent hostility as he dismounted , tied his horse to a snubbing-post worn shiny as a razor-strap , and sauntered into the tendejon . This stranger wore the broad-rimmed felt hat and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force was welcome here . Back of a flimsy counter was a shelf upon which were half a dozen bottles and some glasses . One could buy here mescal , American whiskey , and even wine of a sort . The owner of the place , a white man , was talking to a young Mexican at the time the Ranger entered . The proprietor looked hard at the Ranger with dislike he did not try to veil . The Mexican in front of the bar was a slim young man with quick eyes and an intelligent face . The Ranger recognized him at once as Tony Alviro . " Buenos ! " the Ranger said with the most casual of nods . " I 've come to take you back with me , Tony . " The other two Mexicans had followed the Ranger into the room . The Texan stood sideways at the end of the bar , quite at his ease , the right forearm resting on the counter lightly . Not far from his fingers the butt of a revolver projected from a holster . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The four men watched him steadily . " No , Senor Roberts , " answered Alviro . " You can touch me not . I 'm out of Texas . " " Mebbeso , Tony . But till I get further orders , this is Texas for me . You 're goin ' back with me . " Rangers and outlaws held different views about this strip of land . To the latter it was a refuge ; law ended at its border ; they could not be touched here by State constabulary . But the Ranger did not split hairs . He was law in the Panhandle , and if the man he wanted fled to disputed territory the Ranger went after him . " Not so , " argued Alviro . " If you arrest me in Texas , I say ' Bad luck , ' but I go wiz you . There you are an offizer , an ' I am oblige ' surrender . But in thees No Man 's Land , we are man to man . I refuse . " The lift of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the record of the Texas Rangers . They took their men in dead or alive . This particular member of the force was an unusually tough nut to crack . In the heart of Tony was the drench of a chill wave . He was no coward , but he knew he had no such unflawed nerve as this man . Through his mind there ran a common laconic report handed in by Rangers returning from an assignment --  " Killed while resisting arrest . " Alviro did not want Ranger Roberts to write that about him . " Better not , Alviro . I have a warrant for your arrest . " The Texan did not raise his voice . He made no movement to draw a gun . But to Tony , fascinated by his hard , steel-gray eyes , came the certainty that he must go or fight . They were four to one against the Ranger , but that would not make the least difference . In the curt alternative of this clean-jawed young officer was cold finality . The worried eyes of the fugitive referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew that if it came to a fight they would . But he wanted more than that . His glance was an appeal for one of them to make his decision for him . The voice of the tendejon-keeper interjected itself smoothly . " You 've played yore hand out , friend . We 're four to one . You go back an ' report nothin ' doin ' . " Roberts looked at the man , and a little shiver ran down the barkeeper 's spine . " There wo n't be four of you when we get through arguin ' this , amigo , if we ever start , " the Ranger suggested gently . The proprietor of the place dropped his hand to the butt of his gun . But he did not draw . Some deep , wise instinct warned him to go slow . He knew the others would take their cue from him . If he threw down the gage of battle the room would instantly become a shambles . How many of them would again pass alive through the door nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he could not quite bring himself to such a decision while those chilled-steel eyes bored into his . Anyhow , the game was not worth the candle . " What is it you want Tony for ? " he temporized , playing for time and any chance that might arise . " For killin ' Rutherford Wadley last month . " " A mistake . Tony has been here since the full of the moon . " " Oh , no . He was at the dance on Tomichi Creek . He tried to knife young Wadley . He left the house right after him . " " I left -- si , senor -- but to come here , " cried the accused man . " To follow Wadley , Tony . You jumped a camper that night an ' did n't know it . He saw you . " " Wadley was a dog , but I did not kill him , " Alviro said gloomily . " That so ? You were on the spot . You left tracks . I measured ' em . They were the same tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony 's eyes flashed with a sudden discovery . " The mud -- you meex it to get my footprints . " " You 're a good guesser . " Alviro threw up his hands . " I was there . It iss true . But I did not kill the gringo dog . I was too late . " " You can tell me all about that on the way back . " " If I go back they will hang me . " " You 'll get a fair trial . " " By a gringo jury before a gringo judge . " The tone of Alviro was more than skeptical . It was bitter with the sense of racial injustice . " I ca n't argue that with you , Tony . My business is to take you to Tascosa . That 's what I 'm here for . " The American behind the bar spoke again . " Listens fine ! He 's a Mexican , ai n't he ? They claim he killed a white man . Well , then , the mob would take him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rangers do n't give up their prisoners , my friend . They take ' em an ' they keep ' em . You 'd ought to know that . " The tendejon-keeper flushed . He had been dragged to justice once by one of the force . The eyes of the four consulted again . They were still hesitant . The shame of letting this youth take from them their companion without a fight was like a burr under a saddle-blanket to a bronco . But after all , the Ranger stood for law . If they killed him , other Rangers would come to avenge his death . When men are in doubt the one who is sure dominates the situation . The eye of Roberts carried the compulsion of a deadly weapon . His voice was crisp . " Come here , Tony , " he ordered , and his fingers slipped into the pocket of his coat . Alviro looked at him for a long second -- swore to himself that he would not come -- and came . " Hold out yore hands . " The Mexican set his will to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told himself that was what he was going to do . But he could not hold his own in that steady battle of the eyes . His hands moved forward -- empty . A moment , and the Ranger had slipped and fastened the handcuffs on his wrists . Roberts had won . Psychologically it was now too late for the others to resort to arms . The tendejon-keeper recognized this with a shrug that refused responsibility for the outcome . After all , Tony had made his own decision . He had chosen to take his chances in Tascosa rather than on the spot with the Ranger . " Saddle Tony 's horse , " ordered Roberts , looking at one of the Mexicans . The man growled something in his native tongue , but none the less he moved toward the corral . Within a quarter of an hour the Ranger and his prisoner were on their way . Two days later Roberts delivered his man to the deputy sheriff who had charge of the sod-house jail in the little town . " There 's a message here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wants you to go to Clarendon . Says you were to jog on down soon as you show up here . " " All right , Snark . " He rode down next day , changed horses at the halfway station , and reached Clarendon early in the morning . Ellison had been called to Mobeetie , but left instructions for him to await his return . The semi-weekly stage brought two days later a letter , to Captain Ellison from Snark . Jack Roberts , obeying office instructions , opened the mail . The letter said : Dere Cap , They are aiming to lynch that Mexican Roberts brought in . The Dinsmore outfit is stirring up the town . Send a company of your Rangers , for God 's sake , quick . Respectably yours Jim Snark Jack Roberts was the only Ranger in town . He glanced at the clock . There was just time to catch the stage to Tascosa . He reached for his guns and his hat . CHAPTER XII TEX REARRANGES THE SEATING The Tascosa stage was full . Its passengers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of them , an ex-Confederate who had drifted West after the war . They were of the varied types common to the old Southwest -- a drover , a cattle-buyer , a cowpuncher looking for a job , a smart salesman from St. Louis , and one young woman . Beside the driver on the box sat a long-bodied man in buckskin with a clean brown jaw and an alert , sardonic eye . The salesman , a smooth , good-looking fellow whose eye instinctively rested on attractive women , made inquiries of Joe Johnson 's old trooper . " Who 's the damsel ? " " Which ? " " The girl . She 's a pippin . " His possessive eye gloated on the young woman in front . " She did n't learn how to dress in this neck of the woods , either . Betcha she 's from New Orleans or St. Louis . " The old warrior helped himself to a chew of tobacco . " You lose . She 's Clint Wadley 's daughter , an ' he 's an old-timer . Knocked the bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know him when he was takin ' the hides off the buffaloes . Got his start that way , I reckon . Clint 's outfit got six thousand tongues in six months oncet . Pickled the tongues an ' sold ' em for three cents apiece , by gum . Delivered the hides at Clarendon for one-fifty straight on contract . " " I 've heard of Wadley , " the salesman said . " What 's the kid going to Tascosa for ? " " Goin ' to stay awhile with her aunt , I ' low . Her brother was killed recent . " " I 've heard about that , too . They caught the fellow , did n't they -- the one that did it ? " " They got a Mexican jailed for it . I du n no whether he done it or not . That young Ranger on the box run him down . " " That kid in buckskin ? " sneered the city man . The ex-Confederate bristled at the tone rather than the words . He happened to be a friend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any day of the week . He 's one hell-poppin ' rooster . No better man rides leather . When I druv a wagon oncet gatherin ' bones --  " " Gathering bones ? " " Sure -- buffalo-bones , for fertilizer . Well , that same Jack Roberts yanked me out o ' the Canadian when I was drowndin ' . Took a big chance , too . " " What about this Mexican ? Are they going to hang him ? " " I reckon . He 's in a soddy up at Tascosa . I done heard they 're aimin ' to tear it down and hang him to a wagon-tongue. " 3 The black-haired traveling man caressed his little mustache and watched the girl boldly . Her face was a little wan , and in the deep eyes was shadowed a heartache . But it had been impossible even for grief to submerge the sweet youth in her . There were lights in her soft , wavy hair , and the line of her exquisite throat would have delighted a sculptor . The slim figure was exquisitely poised , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at noon for dinner the salesman made it a point to sit beside her at the long table . His persistent attentions to the girl made the delicate color of her cheek deepen . She was too shy , too unused to the world , to know how to suppress his audacities effectively . But it was plain to one young man sitting at the opposite end of the table that the familiarities of the man were unwelcome . While they were waiting outside for the change-horses to be hitched , the Ranger made a request of the old soldier . " Wish you 'd swap places with me , Sam . " " Sure . I 'd a heap ruther sit outside . Say , that drummer had n't ought to worry Miss Ramona . She 's not feelin ' very peart , anyhow . I reckon she set the world an ' all by that scalawag brother of hers . " " He 's not goin ' to trouble her any more , Sam . " The ex-Confederate looked at the narrow-flanked young man with an alert question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a hand , the salesman was certainly riding for a fall . The salesman had made up his mind to sit beside Miss Wadley for the rest of the journey . He emerged from the dining-room at her heels and was beside her to offer a hand into the stage . Ramona gave him a look of reproach and entreaty . She was near tears . The man from St. Louis smiled confidently . " I know a good thing when I see it , " he whispered . " I 'll ride beside you and keep off the rough-necks , Miss Wadley . " A heavy heel smashed down on the toes of his neat shoe and crunched round . A hard elbow bumped up forcefully against his chin as if by accident . A muscular hand caught the loose fat of his plump stomach and tightened like a vise . The dapper salesman opened his mouth in a shriek of pain . " Indigestion ? " asked the Ranger sympathetically , and his sinewy fingers twisted in the cushion of flesh they gripped . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Roberts flung the man back and rearranged the seating inside so that the drover sat beside Ramona as before dinner . Then he tucked an arm under that of the St. Louis man and led him back into the stage station . The salesman jerked along beside him unhappily . His wrist , wrenched by Roberts in a steady pressure of well-trained muscles , hurt exquisitely . When at last he was flung helplessly into a chair , tears of pain and rage filled his eyes . Never in the course of a cushioned and pampered life had he been so manhandled . " My God , you brute , you 've killed me ! " he sobbed . " Sho ! I have n't begun yet . If you take the stage to-day to Tascosa I 'm goin ' to sit beside you real friendly , an ' we 'll play like we been doin ' all the way in to town . It 's just my way of bein ' neighborly . " " I 'll have the law of you for this , " the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . " I would , " agreed the Texan . " Well , so long , if you ai n't comin ' . " Roberts moved back with long , easy stride to the stage . He nodded to the driver . " All ready , Hank . The drummer ai n't feelin ' well . He 'll stay here overnight . I reckon I 'll keep my own seat outside , Sam . " And Roberts swung himself up . The old soldier climbed in , chuckling to himself . It had been the neatest piece of work he had ever seen . The big body of the cowboy had been between Ramona and her tormentor , so that she did not know what had taken place . She did know , however , that the woman-killer had been obliterated swiftly from her path . " Did you ever see anything like the way he got shet o ' that drummer ? " Sam asked his neighbor in a whisper . " I 'll bet that doggoned masher will be hard to find when Jack 's on the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Meanwhile Jack was flagellating himself . It was his bad luck always to be associated in the mind of Miss Wadley with violence . He had beaten up the brother whom she was now mourning . He had almost been the cause of her own death . Now a third time she saw him in the role of a trouble-maker . To her , of course , he could be nothing but a bully and a bad lot . The least he could do was to make himself as inconspicuous as possible for the rest of the journey . Man may shuffle the pack , but when all is done woman is likely to cut the cards . The driver stopped at Tin Cup Creek to water the horses . To Jack , sitting on the box , came the cattle-drover with orders . " The young lady has somethin ' to say to you , Tex . You 're to swap seats with me . " The lean , bronzed young man swung down . He had , when he wished , a wooden face that told no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood flushing his veins . By a little gesture the girl indicated the seat beside her . Not till the creaking of the moving stage drowned her words did she speak . Her eyes were dilated with excitement . " I overheard them talking in the back seat , " she said . " They think there 's going to be a lynching at Tascosa -- that the mob is going to hang the Mexican who killed my brother . Are you going to let them do it ? " " Not in this year of our Lord , Miss Wadley , " he answered evenly . " Can you stop them ? " " That 's what I draw a dollar a day for . " " You must n't let them do it ! " she cried , a little wildly . " Let the law punish him ! " " Suits me . I 'll try to persuade the boys to look at it that way . " " But what can you do ? You 're only a boy . " With a grim little smile he paraphrased Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pecos right now , Miss Wadley . Do n't you worry . The Dinsmores wo n't get him if I can help it . " " I might speak to my father , " she went on , thinking aloud . " But he 's so bitter I 'm afraid he wo n't do anything . " " He will after I 've talked with him . " Her anxious young eyes rested in his clear , steady gaze . There was something about this youth that compelled confidence . His broad-shouldered vigor , the virile strength so confidently reposeful , were expressions of personality rather than accidentals of physique . The road dipped suddenly into a deep wash that was almost a little gulch . There was a grinding of brakes , then a sudden lurch that threw Ramona against the shoulder of the Ranger . " The brake 's done bust , " she heard the ex-Confederate say . Another violent swing flung Ramona outward . The horses were off the road , and the coach swayed ominously on two wheels . The girl caught at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered her hand with his other one , released his fingers , and put a strong arm round her shoulders . Hank 's whip snaked out across the backs of the wheelers . He flung at his horses a torrent of abuse . The stage reached the bottom of the wash in a succession of lurches . Then , as suddenly as the danger had come upon them , it had passed ; the stage was safely climbing the opposite side of the ravine . The Ranger 's arm slipped from the shoulders of the girl . Her hand crept from under his . He did not look at her , but he knew that a shell-pink wave had washed into the wan face . The slim bosom of the girl rose and fell fast . Already she was beginning to puzzle over the difficulties of a clear-cut right and wrong , to discover that no unshaded line of cleavage differentiates them sometimes . Surely this young fellow could not be all bad . Of course she did not like him . She was quite sure of that . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten brutally her brother Rutherford -- the wild brother whose dissipations she had wept and prayed over , and whose death she was now mourning . Yet Fate kept throwing him in her way to do her services . He had saved her life . He had adroitly -- somehow , she did not quite know in what way -- rid her of an offensive fellow traveler . She had just asked a favor of him , and there was yet another she must ask . Ramona put off her request to the last moment . At Tascosa she left her purse in the stage seat and discovered it after the coach had started to the barn . " My purse . I left it in the seat , " she cried . The announcement was made to the world at large , but it was intended for a particular pair of ears set close to a small head of wavy , sun-reddened hair . The owner of them ran to the stage and recovered the purse . By the time he reached Ramona , the rest of the party were inside the post-office . She thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shy daring . " You travel a good deal , do n't you -- about the country ? " " Considerable . " " I -- I wonder if --  " She took courage from his friendly smile . " I 'm worried about Mr. Ridley -- for fear something has happened to him . " " You mean an accident ? " he asked gently . " I do n't know . " Her cheeks flew color-signals of embarrassment . " My father was harsh to him . He 's very sensitive . I feel -- sort of responsible . He might do something foolish . " " I do n't reckon he will . But I 'll sure keep an eye out for him . " She gave him her little hand gratefully , then remembered what he had done to her brother and withdrew it hastily from his grip . In another moment she had passed into the post-office and left him alone . Footnote 3 : There was no timber in the Panhandle . The first man ever hanged in the short-grass country was suspended from a propped-up wagon-tongue . CHAPTER XIII " ONLY ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disappeared in the post-office a man touched Roberts on the shoulder . " Where are the Rangers I sent for ? " he asked . " Here I am , Snark . " " You did n't come alone ? " " Captain Ellison was out of town . The rest of the force was away on assignment . I could n't reach any of ' em . " The deputy sheriff broke out in excited annoyance . " All right ! I wash my hands of it . They can lynch the Mexican soon as they 've a mind to . Let ' em go to it . Here I send for a company of Rangers , an ' one kid shows up . What in Mexico can you do alone ? " " I would n't say alone . You 're here , Snark . " " I 'm not goin ' to lift a hand -- not a hand . " " Sure it 's necessary ? What makes you think they 're goin ' to lynch Alviro ? " " They do n't make any bones of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town stirrin ' up feelin ' . You might as well have stayed away . There 's not a thing you can do . " " I reckon mebbe we can figure a way to save Tony , " answered the Ranger easily . The deputy voiced his impatience . " Yore talk sounds plumb foolish to me . Do n't you get it ? We 're not dealin ' with one or two men . Half the town is in this thing . " " I promised Tony there would be nothin ' of that sort . " " You ca n't handle a mob all by yoreself , can you ? " asked Snark sarcastically . " There 's only one of you , I reckon . " The little flicker in the Ranger 's eye was not wholly amusement . " There 's goin ' to be only one mob , too , ai n't there ? " he drawled . " You ca n't slip him out unnoticed , if that 's yore idee . They 've got watchers round the jail , " the deputy went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you 'll let ' em hang him ? " " Oh , no ! " " What in hell do you mean to do , then ? " Roberts told him , in part . The deputy shook his head vehemently . " Ca n't be done . First place , you ca n't get Wadley to do it . He wo n't lift a hand to stop this hangin ' . Second place , he could n't stop it if he wanted to . Folks in Tascosa ai n't a bit gun-shy , an ' right now they 've got their necks bowed . An ' this Dinsmore gang -- they 'll eat you alive if you get in their way . " " Mebbeso . You ca n't always be sure . I 've got one card up my sleeve I have n't mentioned to you . " " If you want my opinion --  " The Ranger cut him off short . " I do n't , Snark . Not right now . I 'm too busy to listen to it . I want to know just one thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ' em when I want ' em ? " " You 're the doc , " acknowledged the deputy grudgingly . " They 'll be there , but just the same I think it 's a fool play . You ca n't get away with it . " Jack asked a question . " Where am I most likely to find Wadley ? " " At McGuffey 's store . It 's a block this-a-way and a block that-a-way . " He indicated directions with his hand . Wadley was not among those who sat on the porch of the general store known as McGuffey 's Emporium . He had just gone to his sister 's house to meet his daughter Ramona , of whose arrival he had received notice by a boy . Roberts followed him . In answer to the Ranger 's " Hello , the house ! " the cattleman came out in his shirt-sleeves . Jack cut straight to business . " I 've come to see you about that Mexican Alviro , Mr. Wadley . Is it true they 're goin ' to lynch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full at Roberts . This young fellow was the one who had beaten his son and later had had the impudence to burn as a spill for a cigarette the hundred-dollar bill he had sent him . " Whyfor do you ask me about it ? " he demanded harshly . " Because you 've got to help me stop this thing . " The cattleman laughed mirthlessly . " They can go as far as they like for me . Suits me fine . Hangin ' is too good for him . That 's all I 've got to say . " Already he had refused the pleadings of his daughter , and he had no intention of letting this young scalawag change his mind . " Are you sure this Mexican is guilty -- sure he 's the man who killed yore son , Mr. Wadley ? " " He 's as guilty as hell . " " I do n't think it . Has n't it ever struck you as strange that yore son was killed an ' yore messenger Ridley held up the same night , an ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Of course it has . I 'm no fool . What of it ? " " I 've always thought the same men did both . " " Young fellow , have you ever thought that Ridley never was held up , that it was a fake robbery pulled off to deceive me ? Where is Ridley ? He lit out mighty sudden when he saw how I took it . He could n't even tell me where the hold-up happened . I never did hit the trail of the robbers . " " It was n't a fake . I can prove that . " " I 'm here to be shown , " said the cattleman skeptically . " But first about Tony . It looks bad for him on the surface . I 'll admit that . But --  " " Do n't talk to me about my boy 's murderer , Roberts ! " cried Wadley , flushing angrily . " I 'll not do a thing for him . I 'll help those that aim to do justice on him . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't you arrest him yoreself for it ? " " When I arrested him , I did n't believe he had done it . I know it now . He 's my star witness , an ' I knew he would skip across the border if I let him out . " " You ca n't convince me , but let 's hear yore fairy tale . I got to listen , I reckon . " Jack told his story in few words . He explained what he had found at the scene of the murder and how he had picked up the trail of the three horsemen who had followed Rutherford to the place of his death . He had back-tracked to the camp of the rendezvous at the rim-rock , and he had found there corroborative evidence of the statement Tony Alviro had made to him . " What was it he told you , and what did you find ? " The big cattleman looked at him with a suspicion that was akin to hostility . His son had been a ne'er-do-well . In his heart Wadley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ready to fight at the drop of the hat any man who dared suggest it . He did not want to listen to any evidence that would lead him to believe ill of the son who had gone wrong . " Tony admits all the evidence against him . He did follow Rutherford intendin ' to kill him . But when he saw yore son strike straight across country to the cap-rock , he trailed him to see where he was goin ' . Alviro had heard stories . " " You ca n't tell me anything against my boy . I wo n't stand for it , " broke out the tortured father . The Ranger looked straight at him . " I 'm goin ' to tell you no harm of him except that he kept bad company , " he said gently . " I reckon you know that already . " " Go on , " commanded the father hoarsely . " Tony followed him to the rim-rock , an ' on the way they jumped up the camper , though Alviro did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently another man joined them . " " Who were they ? " " Alviro is n't dead sure . He climbed up to a rock bluff back of them , but it was still dark an ' he could n't make them out . Pretty soon Rutherford found out they had a sack of gold . He must have found out where they got it , too . " Underneath the deep tan of his cheeks the old-timer whitened . " So you 're tryin ' to tell me that my boy was one of the gang that robbed my messenger ! An ' you 're askin ' me to believe it on the word of a greaser with a rope around his neck . Is that it ? " " No . They had a quarrel , but yore son bluffed ' em out . They gave the gold to him . He saddled an ' rode away with it . On his way back to town he was murdered . So he never got a chance to turn it back to you . " The father of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath of relief . His clenched fists slowly opened . " Tony saw all this , did he ? " " Not all of it . Day was comin ' on , an ' he could n't follow Rutherford right away . Before he got goin ' the three men saddled . They trailed along after yore son , an ' Tony a mile or so behind ' em . After awhile he heard a shot . He took his time investigatin ' , because he did n't want to stop any bullets himself . At the foot of Battle Butte he found Rutherford . He had been shot from behind an ' flung over the bluff . " The face of the cattleman twitched . " If I can lay my hands on the man or men that did it --  " " Mebbe you can , if you 'll give me time . I checked up Tony 's story , an ' everywhere there was evidence to back it . He had no rifle with him , but I picked up a shell back of some rocks a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was shot . The shell came from a ' 73 . I back-tracked to the night-camp , an ' it was just like Tony had said . Four men had been there . One left before the others . You could see the signs where they had trailed him . Once or twice they missed his tracks an ' found ' em again . Same way with the single man followin ' them . He had taken short-cuts too . Sometimes he blotted out the hoofprints of the three in front , so I know he was not ahead of ' em . " " You think the Dinsmores did this , Jack ? " " I want more evidence before I say so publicly . But Tony did n't . Here 's another point in his favor . If Tony shot him on the bluff an ' flung the body over , why did he have to go down below an ' look at it ? No need a-tall of that . No ; Tony went down to make sure who it was that had been killed . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , an ' he lit out for No Man 's Land . I found him there three weeks later . " The cattleman apologized after a fashion for some hard things he had said and thought about his former employee . " I do n't spend any of my time likin ' yore style , Roberts . You 're too high-heeled for me . But I 'll say this for you : Ellison picked a good man when he got you . You 're a straight-up rider , an ' you 'll do to take along . What 's yore programme ? " He told it . The cattleman looked at him with increased respect . He gave a short , barking laugh . " If it was anybody else I 'd say it was crazy , but you 're such a doggoned hellion of a go-getter mebbe you can put it over . " " Looks to me like a good bet , " said Roberts mildly . " Well , I an ' my friends will be right there if we 're needed . I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness strung up to a wagon-tongue yet awhile . " They talked over the details ; then the Ranger started for the jail , and the cattleman breezed around to give a little tip to some reliable friends . Wadley was quite of a mind with Roberts . There was going to be no lynching at Tascosa if he could help it . CHAPTER XIV JACK SERVES NOTICE Jack Roberts liked to get his information first hand . On his way to the jail he deflected , passed up the wide , dusty main street , and stopped at a log " hogan " made of bois d'arc timber and cedar from the brakes . Across the front of it was printed roughly a sign : THE SILVER DOLLAR The Ranger took a little hitch at his guns to make sure they would slide easily from the holsters in case of need , then strolled into the saloon , a picture of negligent indifference . A tall man , lank as a shad , was master of ceremonies . Steve Gurley was in high feather . He was treating the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the bulk of the talking . His theme was the righteousness of mob law , with particular application to the case of Tony Alviro . He talked loudly , as befits one who is a leader of public opinion . Some wandering of attention in his audience brought him to a pause . He turned , to see the Ranger leaning indolently against the door-jamb . Jack was smiling in the manner of one quietly amused . " Who invited you here ? " demanded Gurley , taken aback , but unwilling to show it . " Me , I just dropped in to hear yore big talk . Reminds me of old Geronimo . Like you , he gets all filled up with words about every so often and has to steam off . Go ahead , Gurley . Do n't let me interrupt you . Make heap oration . " But Gurley 's fluency was gone . His cross-eyed glance slid round the room to take stock of his backers . Was this fellow Roberts alone , or had he a dozen Rangers in town with him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence . For into the picture had walked a man , a personality , dynamic and forceful . The outlaw had seen him in action once , and he had been on that occasion as easy to handle as a cageful of panthers . " Come to see the hangin ' , have you , Mr. Ranger ? " " Is there goin ' to be a hangin ' ? " " You betcha -- to-night ! Git around early , an ' you can have a front seat . " Gurley added a word of explanation . " No greaser can git biggity an ' shoot up our friends without hangin ' from the end of a wagon-tongue pronto . " " We 'll see what a judge an ' jury say about it , " suggested the Ranger mildly . " That so ? No brindle-thatched guy in buckskin can interfere without sleepin ' in smoke . Understand ? " The long , sallow man nervously stroked his hair , which was flattened down on his forehead in a semicircle in the absurd fashion of the day . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What I say goes . There 's goin ' to be no hangin ' till the courts say so . " A man had come into the saloon by the back door . He was a heavy-set , slouchy man in jeans , broad-shouldered and bowlegged . He laughed grimly . " I do n't reckon you can put that over on folks of the short-grass country , young fellow , me lad . We grow man-size , an ' I do n't expect we 'll ask yore say-so when we 're ready for business . " Pete Dinsmore had the advantage of his colleague . He knew that Roberts was the only Ranger in town . Also he was of tougher stuff . The leader of the Dinsmore gang would go through . Into the gray-blue eye of the young man came a look that chilled . " Dinsmore , I 'm not here to get into a rookus with you . But I 'll serve notice on you right now to keep yore mind off Alviro . He 's in the hands of the Texas Rangers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning with a sneer . " I was hittin ' my heels on this range when you was knee-high to a duck , kid . Do n't make a mistake . Folks do n't make ' em with me twice . " He thrust the head on his bull neck forward and dropped a hand to the gun by his side . The Ranger shook his head . " Not just now , Pete . You 're a bad hombre ; I know that . Some day we 're liable to tangle . But it will be in the way of business . While I 'm workin ' for the State I 've got no private feuds . " Jack turned and walked out of the place as casually as he had entered . He knew now that Snark was right . Tascosa meant to hang the Mexican within a few hours . Evidently Tony had heard the news . He looked up with quick apprehension when Snark opened the door of his cell to admit the Ranger . " You promise ' me fair trial , senor . Yet to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried . The young Mexican was sweating drops of fear . " That 's why I 'm here , Tony , " answered Jack cheerfully . " The hangin ' programme wo n't go through if you do exactly as I say . I 'll stand by you . They 'll not get you unless they get me . Is that fair ? " Confidence is born of confidence . Alviro felt himself buttressed by the quiet strength of this vigorous youth . Broader shoulders than his had assumed the responsibility . " What is it that I am to do ? " he asked , his liquid eyes filled with the dumb worship of a dog . " You 're to walk right beside me . No matter how the crowd presses -- no matter what it does -- stick right there . If you try to run , you 're gone . I ca n't save you . Understand ? " " Si , senor . " Roberts looked at his watch . " ' Most time for the fireworks to begin . You 'll wait here till I come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition first . Be with you pronto . " Little beads of sweat gathered again on the forehead of the prisoner . The palms of his hands were hot and moist . He glanced nervously out of the window . Ten minutes before there had been a few lookouts in sight ; now there were a hundred men or more . The mob was beginning to gather for the storming of the sod-house . Soon the affairs of Tony Alviro would reach a crisis . " I -- I 'll nev ' get out alive , " said the Mexican in a dry whisper . The Ranger grinned at him . " Do n't worry . If the luck breaks right we 'll camp to-night under the stars . If it does n't they 'll bury us both , Tony . " In that smile was life for Alviro . It expressed a soul unperturbed , ready for anything that might come up . With this man beside him Tony felt courage flowing back into his heart . CHAPTER XV A CLOSE SHAVE The Ranger opened the door of the " soddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeers , threats , bits of advice greeted him from those in front of the jail . " Better p'int for the hills , Mr. Ranger . " ... " A whole passel of sheriffs ca n't save the greaser . " ... " Do n't you-all try an ' stop us if you know what 's good for you . " ... " Skedaddle while yore skin 's whole . " ... " It 's the Mexican , anyhow ; it 's him an ' you too , if you show fight . " The lean-flanked young Ranger looked them over coolly . Men were coming in driblets from the main street . Already perhaps there were a hundred and fifty men and boys in sight . They were the advance guard of the gathering mob . Never in his gusty lifetime had Jack Roberts been more master of himself . He had that rare temperament which warms to danger . He stood there bareheaded , his crisp , curly bronze hair reflecting the glow of the setting sun , one hand thrust carelessly into his trousers pocket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you . We got nothin ' against you , " a voice cried . Jack did not answer . His left hand came out of the pocket bringing with it half a dozen silver dollars . Simultaneously the nose of his revolver flashed into sight . A dollar went up into the air . The revolver cracked . The coin , struck by the bullet in its descent , was flung aside at an angle . Dollar after dollar went up and was hurled from its course as the weapon barked . Out of six shots the Ranger missed only one . It was marvelous marksmanship , but it did not in the least cow those who saw the exhibition . They were frontiersmen themselves , many of them crack shots , and they knew that one man could do nothing against several hundred . Their taunts followed Roberts as he stepped back into the sod-house . Jack reloaded his revolver and joined the Mexican . " All ready , Tony . We 're off soon as I 've put the cuffs on you , " he said briskly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun an ' a chance for my life , " begged Alviro . He was trembling like an aspen leaf in a summer breeze . The Ranger shook his head . " No , Tony . If you were n't wearin ' cuffs they 'd think I meant to turn you loose . You would n't have a chance . I 'm the law , an ' you 're my prisoner . That 's goin ' to help pull us through . Brace up , boy . I 've got an ace up my sleeve you do n't know about . " A minute later a great yell of triumph rose in the air . The door of the sod-house had opened , and the Ranger and his prisoner stood in front of it . The mob pushed closer , uncertain as to what its next move would be . Had Roberts brought out the Mexican with the intention of making a merely formal resistance ? Pete Dinsmore , just arrived on the scene at the head of a group from the saloons , shouldered his way to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Ranger . Much obliged for savin ' us the trouble of tearin ' down the soddy , " he called jubilantly . " You got more sense an ' less grit than I figured you had , " jeered Gurley . " Now light a shuck back to Mobeetie an ' write a report on it . " Roberts waited , silent and motionless , for the tumult to die . Only his eyes and his brain were active . Homer Dinsmore was in the crowd , well to the front . So were Jumbo Wilkins , Clint Wadley , and half a dozen other line-riders and cowmen , all grouped together to the left . Fifty yards back of them a group of saddled horses waited . The shouting spent itself . The motionless figure beside the pallid Mexican excited curiosity . Did he mean to give up his prisoner without a fight ? That was not the usual habit of the Texas Ranger . With his left hand Jack drew from a coat-pocket some dark sticks a few inches long . A second time his six-shooter leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " 4 yelled Gurley . The voice of Wadley boomed out harsh and strong , so that every man present heard what he said . " Gad , he 's got dynamite ! " The revolvers of the two Dinsmores were already out . They had moved forward a step or two , crouching warily , eyes narrowed and steady . If this brash young Ranger wanted a fight he could have it on the jump . But at Wadley 's shout they stopped abruptly . The owner of the A T O was right . The fool officer had several sticks of dynamite in his hand tied together loosely by a string . The crowd had been edging forward . There was no break in it now , but one could see a kind of uneasy ripple , almost as though it held its mob breath tensely and waited to see what was to come . " He 's got no fuse ! " screamed Gurley . " Here 's my fuse , " retorted the Ranger . He held up his revolver so that all could see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first man who tries to stop me an ' hit it while it 's in the air close to his head . Come on , Tony . We 're on our way . " He moved slowly forward . The Dinsmores stood fast , but the crowd sagged . As the Ranger got closer there was a sudden break . Men began to scramble for safety . " Look out , Dinsmore , " an excited voice cried . It belonged to Jumbo Wilkins . " He 'll blow you to hell an ' back . " Both of the Dinsmores had a reputation for gameness in a country where the ordinary citizen was of proved courage . With revolvers or rifles they would have fought against odds , had done it more than once . But dynamite was a weapon to which they were not used . It carried with it the terror of an instant death which would leave them no chance to strike back . Very slowly at first , a step at a time , they gave ground . Roberts , as he moved with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he had won , that the big cattleman and his friends would close behind him in apparent slow pursuit , so adroitly as to form a shield between him and the mob and thus prevent a rifle-shot from cutting him down . The horses were in sight scarce half a hundred yards away . And in the moment of victory he shaved disaster . From the right there came the pad of light , running feet and the rustle of skirts . " Goddlemighty , it 's ' Mona ! " cried Wadley , aghast . It was . Ramona had known that something was in the air when the Ranger and her father held their conference in front of the house . Her aunt had commented on the fact that Clint had taken from the wall a sawed-off shotgun he sometimes carried by his saddle . The girl had waited , desperately anxious , until she could stand suspense no longer . Bareheaded , she had slipped out of the house and hurried toward the jail in time to see the Ranger facing alone an angry mob . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join him . Homer Dinsmore gave a whoop of triumph and rushed forward . The Ranger could not play with dynamite when the life of Wadley 's daughter was at stake . His brother , Gurley , a dozen others , came close at his heels , just behind Ramona . The Ranger dropped the black sticks into his pocket and backed away , screening his prisoner as he did so . The ex-Confederate who had come up on the stage was standing beside Wadley . He let out the old yell of his war days and plunged forward . The Dinsmores bumped into the surprise of their lives . Somehow the man upon whom they had almost laid clutches was out of reach . Between him and them was a line of tough old-timers with drawn guns . The owner of the A T O handed his sawed-off shotgun to Jumbo Wilkins , caught Ramona round the shoulders with one arm , and ran her hurriedly out of the danger-zone . Joe Johnston 's old trooper pushed the end of his rifle urgently against Homer Dinsmore 's ribs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ther ! This gun 's liable to go off . " " What 's ailin ' you ? " snarled Gurley . " Ai n't you goin ' to help us string up the Mexican ? " " No , Steve . Our intentions is otherwise , " replied Jumbo with a grin . " An ' do n't any of you-all come closeter . This sawed-off shotgun of Clint 's is loaded with buckshot , an ' she spatters all over the State of Texas . " The little posse round the prisoner backed steadily to the left . Not till they were almost at the horses did Dinsmore 's mob guess the intentions of the Ranger . Pete gave a howl of rage and let fly a bullet at Alviro . Before the sound of the shot had died away , the outlaw dropped his revolver with an oath . The accurate answering fire of Roberts had broken his wrist . " No use , Pete , " growled his brother . " They 've got the deadwood on us to-day . But I reckon there are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mob had melted away like a small snowbank in a hot sun . It was one thing to help lynch a defenseless Mexican ; it was quite another to face nine or ten determined men backing the law . Scarce a score of the vigilantes remained , and most of them were looking for a chance to save their faces " without starting anything , " as Jumbo put it later . The lynching-party stood sullenly at a distance and watched the Ranger , his prisoner , and three other men mount the horses . The rest of the posse covered the retreat of the horsemen . Just before the riders left , Jumbo asked a question that had been disturbing him . " Say , Tex , honest Injun , would you ' a ' fired off that dynamite if it had come to a showdown ? " Roberts laughed . He drew from his pocket the sticks , tossed them into the air , and took a quick shot with his revolver . For a moment not a soul in the posse nor one of Dinsmore 's watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in self-defense . The bullet hit its mark . All present saw the little spasmodic jerk of the bundle in the air . But there was no explosion . The dynamite fell harmlessly to the ground . The old Confederate stepped forward and picked up the bundle . He examined it curiously , then let out a whoop of joyous mirth . " Nothin ' but painted sticks ! Son , you 're sure a jim-dandy ! Take off yore hats , boys , to the man that ran a bluff on the Dinsmore outfit an ' made a pair of deuces stick against a royal flush . " He tossed the bits of wood across to Pete Dinsmore , who caught the bundle and looked down at it with a sinister face of evil . This boy had out-maneuvered , outgamed , and outshot him . Dinsmore was a terror in the land , a bad-man known and feared widely . Mothers , when they wanted to frighten their children , warned them to behave , or the Dinsmore gang would get them . Law officers let these outlaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of the Texas Rangers had moved up into the Panhandle . This young cub had not only thrown down the gauntlet to him ; he had wounded him , thwarted him , laughed at him , and made a fool of him . The prestige he had built up so carefully was shaken . The black eyes of the outlaw blazed in their deep sockets . " By God , young fellow , it 's you or me next time we meet . I 'll learn you that no scrub Ranger can cross Pete Dinsmore an ' get away with it . This ai n't the first time you 've run on the rope with me . I 've had more ' n plenty of you . " The riders were moving away , but Jack Roberts turned in the saddle , one hand on the rump of the bronco . " It wo n't be the last time either , Dinsmore . You look like any other cheap cow-thief to me . The Rangers are going to bring law to this country . Tell yore friends they 'll live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put spurs to his horse and galloped after his posse . Footnote 4 : In the early days in Texas a revolver was sometimes called a " cutter . " CHAPTER XVI WADLEY GOES HOME IN A BUCKBOARD Clint Wadley took his daughter to the end of the street where his sister lived , blowing her up like a Dutch uncle every foot of the way . The thing she had done had violated his sense of the proprieties and he did not hesitate to tell her so . He was the more unrestrained in his scolding because for a few moments his heart had stood still at the danger in which she had placed herself . " If you was just a little younger I 'd sure enough paddle you . Have n't you been brought up a-tall ? Did you grow up like Topsy , without any folks ? Do n't you know better than to mix up in men 's affairs an ' git yoreself talked about ? " he spluttered . Ramona hung her head and accepted his reproaches humbly . It was easy for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitude . Probably Mr. Roberts -- and everybody else , for that matter -- thought she could not be a nice girl , since she had been so silly . " You go home an ' stay there , " continued Clint severely . " Do n't you poke yore head outside the door till I come back . I 'll not have you traipsing around this-a-way . Hear me , honey ? " " Yes , Dad , " she murmured through the tears that were beginning to come . " I reckon , when it comes to standin ' off a crowd o ' hoodlums , I do n't need any help from a half-grown little squab like you . I been too easy on you . That 's what ails you . " Ramona had not a word to say for herself . She crept into the house and up to her room , flung herself on the bed and burst into a passion of weeping . Why had she made such an exhibition of herself ? She was ashamed in every fiber of her being . Not only had she disgraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile her father was on his way back downtown . In spite of his years the cattleman was hot-headed . He had something to say to Pete Dinsmore . If it led to trouble Wadley would be more than content , for he believed now that the Dinsmore gang -- or some one of them acting in behalf of all -- had murdered his son , and he would not rest easy until he had avenged the boy . The Dinsmores were not at the Silver Dollar nor at the Bird Cage . A lounger at the bar of the latter told the owner of the A T O that they had gone to the corral for their horses . He had heard them say they were going to leave town . The cattleman followed them to the corral they frequented . Pete Dinsmore was saddling his horse in front of the stable . The others were not in sight , but a stable boy in ragged jeans was working over some harness near the door . Dinsmore sulkily watched Wadley approach . He was in a sour and sullen rage . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step softly and speak humbly in his presence . But to-day a young fellow scarcely out of his teens had made him look like a fool . Until he had killed Roberts , the chief of the outlaws would never be satisfied , nor would his prestige be what it had been . It had been the interference of Wadley and his crowd that had saved the Ranger from him , and he was ready to vent his anger on the cattleman if he found a good chance . The outlaw knew well enough that he could not afford to quarrel with the owner of the A T O. There was nothing to gain by it and everything to lose , for even if the cattleman should be killed in a fair fight , the Rangers would eventually either shoot the Dinsmores or run them out of the country . But Pete was beyond reason just now . He was like a man with a toothache who grinds on his sore molar in the intensity of his pain . " I 've come to tell you somethin ' , Dinsmore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwin ' me down , I reckon . You need n't . I 'm through with you . " " I 'm not through with you . What I want to say is that you 're a dog . No , you 're worse than any hound I ever knew ; you 're a yellow wolf . " " What 's that ? " cried the bad-man , astounded . His uninjured hand crept to a revolver-butt . " I believe in my soul that you murdered my boy . " " You 're crazy , man -- locoed sure enough . The Mexican --  " " Is a witness against you . When you heard that he had followed Ford that night , you got to worryin ' . You did n't know how much he had seen . So you decided to play safe an ' lynch him , you hellhound . " " Where did you dream that stuff , Wadley ? " demanded Dinsmore , eyes narrowed wrathfully . " I did n't dream it , any more than I dreamed that you followed Ford from the cap-rock where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle Butte . " " That 's war talk , Wadley . I 've just got one word to say to it . You 're a liar . Come a-shootin ' , soon as you 're ready . " " That 's now . " The cattleman reached for his forty-five , but before he could draw , a shot rang out from the corral . Wadley staggered forward a step or two and collapsed . Pete did not relax his wariness . He knew that one of the gang had shot Wadley , but he did not yet know how badly the man was hurt . From his place behind the horse he took a couple of left-handed shots across the saddle at the helpless man . The cattleman raised himself on an elbow , but fell back with a grunt . The position of Dinsmore was an awkward one to fire from . Without lifting his gaze from the victim , he edged slowly round the bronco . There was a shout of terror , a sudden rush of hurried feet . The stableboy had flung himself down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body with his own . " Git away from there ! " ordered the outlaw , his face distorted with the lust for blood that comes to the man-killer . " No . You 've done enough harm . Let him alone ! " cried the boy wildly . The young fellow was gaunt and ragged . A thin beard straggled over the boyish face . The lips were bloodless , and the eyes filled with fear . But he made no move to scramble for safety . It was plain that in spite of his paralyzing horror he meant to stick where he was . Dinsmore 's lip curled cruelly . He hesitated . This boy was the only witness against him . Why not make a clean job of it and wipe him out too ? He fired -- and missed ; Pete was not an expert left-hand shot . " Look out , Pete . Men comin ' down the road , " called the other Dinsmore from the gate of the corral . Pete looked and saw two riders approaching . It was too late now to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his revolver back into its place and swung to the saddle . " Was it you shot Wadley ? " he asked his brother . " Yep , an none too soon . He was reachin ' for his six-shooter . " " The fool would have it . Come , let 's burn the wind out of here before a crowd gathers . " Gurley and a fourth man joined them . The four galloped down the road and disappeared in a cloud of white dust . A moment later Jumbo Wilkins descended heavily from his horse . Quint Sullivan , another rider for the A T O , was with him . The big line-rider knelt beside his employer and examined the wound . " Hit once -- in the side , " he pronounced . " Will -- will he live ? " asked the white-faced stableboy . " Do n't know . But he 's a tough nut , Clint is . He 's liable to be cussin ' out the boys again in a month or two . " Wadley opened his eyes . " You 're damn ' whistlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quint , a black-haired youth of twenty , gave a repressed whoop . " One li'l ' bit of a lead pill ca n't faze the boss . They took four or five cracks at him an ' did n't hit but once . That 's plumb lucky . " " It would ' a ' been luckier if they had n't hit him at all , Quint , " answered Jumbo dryly . " You fork yore hawss , son , an ' go git Doc Bridgman . An ' you -- whatever they call you , Mr. Hawss -- rustler -- harness a team to that buckboard . " Jumbo , with the expertness of an old-timer who had faced emergencies of this kind before , bound up the wound temporarily . The stable-rustler hitched a team , covered the bottom of the buckboard with hay , and helped Wilkins lift the wounded man to it . Clint grinned faintly at the white-faced boy beside him . A flicker of recognition lighted his eyes . " You look like you 'd seen a ghost , Ridley . Close call for both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shootin ' arm . Pete 's no two-gun man . Ca n't shoot for sour apples with his left hand . Kicked up dust all around us , an ' did n't score once . " " Quit yore talkin ' , Clint , " ordered Jumbo . " All right , Doc . " The cattleman turned to Ridley . " Run ahead , boy , an ' prepare ' Mona so 's she wo n't be scared plumb to death . Tell her it 's only a triflin ' flesh-wound . Keep her busy fixin ' up a bed for me -- an ' bandages . Do n't let her worry . See ? " Ridley had come to town only two days before . Ever since the robbery he had kept a lone camp on Turkey Creek . There was plenty of game for the shooting , and in that vast emptiness of space he could nurse his wounded self-respect . But he had run out of flour and salt . Because Tascosa was farther from the A T O ranch than Clarendon he had chosen it as a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered him a job , and he had taken it . He had not supposed that Ramona was within a hundred miles of the spot . The last thing in the world he wanted was to meet her , but there was no help for it now . Her aunt carried to Ramona the word that a man was waiting outside with a message from her father . When she came down the porch steps , there were still traces of tear-stains on her cheeks . In the gathering dusk she did not at first recognize the man at the gate . She moved forward doubtfully , a slip of a slender-limbed girl , full of the unstudied charm and grace of youth . Halfway down the path she stopped , her heart beating a little faster . Could this wan and ragged man with the unkempt beard be Art Ridley , always so careful of his clothes and his personal appearance ? She was a child of impulse . Her sympathy went out to him with a rush , and she streamed down the path to meet him . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soft eyes irradiated him . On her lips was the tender smile that told him she was still his friend . " Where in the world have you been ? " she cried . " And what have you been doing to yourself ? " His blood glowed at the sweetness of her generosity . " I 've been -- camping . " With the shyness and the boldness of a child she pushed home her friendliness . " Why do n't you ever come to see a fellow any more ? " He did not answer that , but plunged at his mission . " Miss Ramona , I 've got bad news for you . Your father has been hurt -- not very badly , I think . He told me to tell you that the wound was only a slight one . " ' Mona went white to the lips . " How ? " she whispered . " The Dinsmores shot him . The men are bringing him here . " He caught her in his arms as she reeled . For a moment her little head lay against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifling flesh-wound , your father called it , " went on Ridley . " He said you were to get a bed ready for him , and fix bandages . " She steadied herself and beat back the wave of weakness that had swept over her . " Yes , " she said . " I 'll tell Aunt . Have they sent for the doctor ? " " Quint Sullivan went . " A wagon creaked . ' Mona flew into the house to tell her aunt , and out again to meet her father . Her little ankles flashed down the road . Agile as a boy , she climbed into the back of the buckboard . " Oh , Dad ! " she cried in a broken little voice , and her arms went round him in a passion of love . He was hurt worse than he was willing to admit to her . " It 's all right , honeybug . Doc Bridgman will fix me up fine . Yore old dad is a mighty live sinner yet . " Ridley helped Jumbo carry the cattleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor passed him going in . Ridley slipped away in the gathering darkness and disappeared . CHAPTER XVII OLD-TIMERS As soon as Captain Ellison heard of what had happened at Tascosa , he went over on the stage from Mobeetie to look at the situation himself . He dropped in at once to see his old friends the Wadleys . Ramona opened the door to him . " Uncle Jim ! " she cried , and promptly disappeared in his arms for a hug and a kiss . The Ranger Captain held her off and examined the lovely flushed face . " Dog it , you get prettier every day you live . I wisht I was thirty years younger . I 'd make some of these lads get a move on ' em . " " I wish you were , " she laughed . " They need some competition to make them look at me . None of them would have a chance then -- even if they wanted it . " " I believe that . I got to believe it to keep my self-respect . It 's all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Better . You should hear him swear under his breath because the doctor wo n't let him smoke more than two pipes a day , and because we wo n't let him eat whatever he wants to . He 's worse than a sore bear , " said Ramona proudly . " Lead me to him . " A moment later the Ranger and the cattleman were shaking hands . They had been partners in their youth , had fought side by side in the Civil War , and had shot plains Indians together at Adobe Walls a few years since . They were so close to each other that they could quarrel whenever they chose , which they frequently did . " How , old-timer ! " exclaimed the Ranger Captain . " Starved to death . They feed me nothin ' but slops -- soup an ' gruel an ' custard an ' milk-toast . Fine for a full-grown man , ai n't it ? Jim , you go out an ' get me a big steak an ' cook it in boilin ' grease on a camp-fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A T O. " " To-morrow , Clint . The Doc says --  " " Manana ! That 's what they all say . Is this Mexico or God 's country ? What I want , I want now . " " You always did -- an ' you ' most always got it too , " said Ellison , his eyes twinkling reminiscently . ' Mona shook a warning finger at her father . " Well , he wo n't get it now . He 'll behave , too , or he 'll not get his pipe to-night . " The sick man grinned . " See how she bullies a poor old man , Jim . I 'm worse than that Lear fellow in the play -- most henpecked father you ever did see . " " Will she let you talk ? " " He may talk to you , Uncle Jim . " " What did I tell you ? " demanded the big cattleman from the bed with the mock bitterness that was a part of the fun they both enjoyed . " You see , I got to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what a nurse is for , Clint . You want to be glad you got the sweetest one in Texas . " The Captain patted Ramona affectionately on the shoulder before he passed to the business of the day . " I want to know about all these ructions in Tascosa . Tell me the whole story . " They told him . He listened in silence till they had finished , asked a question or two , and made one comment . " That boy Roberts of mine is sure some go-getter . " " He 'll do , " conceded the cattleman . " That lucky shot of his -- the one that busted Dinsmore 's arm -- certainly saved my life later . " " Lucky shot ! " exploded Ellison . " And you just through tellin ' me how he plugged the dollars in the air ! Doggone it , I want you to know there was no darned luck about it ! My boys are the best shots in Texas . " " I 'll take any one of ' em on soon as I 'm out -- any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly . " I 'll go you . Roberts is a new man an ' has n't had much experience . I 'll match him with you . " " New man ! H'mp ! He 's the best you 've got , an ' you know it . " " I do n't know whether he is , but he 's good enough to make any old-timer like you look like a plugged nickel . " The cattleman snorted again , disdaining an answer . " Dad is the best shot in Texas , " pronounced Ramona calmly , rallying to her father 's support . For years she had been the umpire between the two . The Captain threw up his hands . " I give up . " " And Mr. Roberts is just about as good . " " That 's settled , then , " said Ellison . " But what I came to say is that I 'm goin ' to round up the Dinsmore bunch . We ca n't convict ' em of murder on the evidence we have , but I 'll arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a confession out of one of ' em . Does that look reasonable , Clint ? " Wadley considered this . " It 's worth a try-out . The Dinsmores are game . They wo n't squeal . But I 've a sneakin ' notion Gurley is yellow . He might come through -- or that other fellow Overstreet might . I do n't know him . You want to be careful how you try to take that outfit , though , Jim . They 're dangerous as rattlesnakes . " " That 's the kind of outfit my boys eat up , " answered the chipper little officer as he rose to leave . " Well , so long , Clint . Behave proper , an ' mebbe this young tyrant will give you a nice stick o ' candy for a good boy . " He went out chuckling . The cattleman snorted . " Beats all how crazy Jim is about those Ranger boys of his . He thinks the sun rises an ' sets by them . I want to tell you they 've got to sleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mo'nin ' to catch the Dinsmores in bed . That bird Pete always has one eye open . What 's more , he an ' his gang wear their guns low . " " I do n't think Uncle Jim ought to send boys like Jack Roberts out against such desperadoes . It 's not fair , " Ramona said decisively . " Oh , ai n't it ? " Her father promptly switched to the other side . " You give me a bunch of boys like young Roberts , an ' I 'd undertake to clean up this whole country , an ' Lincoln County too . He 's a dead shot . He 's an A-1 trailer . He can whip his weight in wildcats . He 's got savvy . He uses his brains . An ' he 's game from the toes up . What more does a man need ? " " I did n't know you liked him , " his daughter said innocently . " Like him ? Jumpin ' snakes , no ! He 's too darned fresh to suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ? I 'm just tellin ' you that no better officer ever stood in shoe-leather . " " Oh , I see . " Ramona said no more . She asked herself no questions as to the reason , but she knew that her father 's words of praise were sweet to hear . They sent a warm glow of pride through her heart . She wanted to think well of this red-haired Ranger who trod the earth as though he were the heir of all the ages . In some strange way Fate had linked his life with hers from that moment when he had literally flung himself in her path to fight a mad bull for her life . CHAPTER XVIII A SHOT OUT OF THE NIGHT Ramona sat on the porch in the gathering darkness . She had been reading aloud to her father , but he had fallen asleep beside her in his big armchair . During these convalescent days he usually took a nap after dinner and after supper . He called it forty winks , but to an unprejudiced listener the voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate clicked , and a man walked up the path . He did not know that the soft eyes of the girl , sitting in the porch shadows , lit with pleasure at sight of him . Nothing in her voice or in her greeting told him so . He took off his hat and stood awkwardly with one booted foot on the lowest step . " I came to see Mr. Wadley , " he presently explained , unaccountably short of small talk . She looked at her father and laughed . The saw was ripping through a series of knots in alternate crescendo and diminuendo . " Shall I wake him ? He likes to sleep after eating . I think it does him good . " " Do n't you ! I 'll come some other time . " " Could n't you wait a little ? He does n't usually sleep long . " The girl suggested it hospitably . His embarrassment relieved any she might otherwise have felt . " I reckon not . " At the end of that simple sentence he stuck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no sense in it , he told himself . It never troubled him to meet men . He had n't felt any shyness when there had been a chance to function in action for her . But now he was all feet and hands before this slip of a girl . Was it because of that day when she had come flying between him and the guns of Dinsmore 's lynching-party ? He wanted to thank her , to tell her how deeply grateful he had been for the thought that had inspired her impulse . Instead of which he was , he did not forget to remind himself later , as expressive as a bump on a log . " Have you seen anything of Mr. Ridley ? " she asked . " No , miss . He saved yore father 's life from Pete Dinsmore . I reckon you know that . " " Yes . I saw him for a moment . Poor boy ! I think he is worrying himself sick . If you meet him will you tell him that everything 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their voices had dropped a note in order not to waken her father . For the same reason she had come down the steps and was moving with him toward the gate . If Jack had known how to say good-bye they would probably have parted at the fence , but he was not socially adequate for the business of turning his back gracefully on a young woman and walking away . As he backed from her he blurted out what was in his mind . " I got ta thank you for -- for buttin ' in the other day , Miss Ramona . " She laughed , quite at her ease now . Why is it that the most tender-hearted young women like to see big two-fisted men afraid of them ? " Oh , you thought I was buttin ' in , " she mocked , tilting a gay challenge of the eyes at him . " I roped the wrong word , miss . I -- I thought --  " What he thought was never a matter of record . She had followed him along the fence to complete his discomfiture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man into a bashful hobbledehoy . " Father gave me an awful scolding . He said I did n't act like a lady . " " He 's ' way off , " differed Jack hotly . She shook her head . " No . You see I could n't explain to everybody there that I did it for -- for Rutherford -- because I did n't want anything so dreadful as that poor Mexican 's death on his account . Dad said some of the men might think I did it -- oh , just to be showing off , " she finished untruthfully . " Nobody would think that -- nobody but a plumb idjit . I think you did fine . " Having explained satisfactorily that she had not interfered for his sake , there was really no occasion for Ramona to linger . But Jack had found his tongue at last and the minutes slipped away . A sound in the brush on the far side of the road brought the Ranger to attention . It was the breaking of a twig . The foot that crushed it might belong to a cow or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was lying in wait , it was probably to get him . " Turn round an ' walk to the house , " he ordered the girl crisply . " Sing ' Swanee River ' as you go . Quick ! " There was a note in his voice that called for obedience . Ramona turned , a flurry of fear in her heart . She did not know what there was to be afraid of , but she was quite sure her companion had his reason . The words of the old plantation song trembled from her lips into the night . A dozen yards behind her Jack followed , backing toward the house . His six-shooter was in his hand , close to his side . He flashed one look backward . The parlor was lit up and Clint Wadley was lying on a lounge reading a paper . He was a tempting mark for anybody with a grudge against him . Jack took the last twenty yards on the run . He plunged into the parlor on the heels of Ramona . Simultaneously came the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in time to see the Ranger blow out the lamp . Jack caught Ramona by the shoulders and thrust her down to her knees in a corner of the room . " What in blue blazes --  ? " Clint began to demand angrily . " Keep still , " interrupted Jack . " Some one 's bushwhackin ' either you or me . " He crept to the window and drew down the blind . A small hole showed where the bullet had gone through the window and left behind it a star of shattered glass . Ramona began to whimper . Her father 's arm found and encircled her . " It 's all right , honey . He ca n't git us now . " " I 'm goin ' out by the back door . Mebbe I can put salt on this bird 's tail , " said Jack . " You stay right where you are , Mr. Wadley . They ca n't hit either of you in that corner . " " Oh , do n't ! Please do n't go ! " wailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sent a glow through his blood . He knew that at that moment she was not thinking of the danger to herself . " Do n't you worry . I 'll swing round on him wide . Ten to one he 's already hittin ' the dust fast to make his get-away . " He slipped out of the room and out of the house . So slowly did he move that it was more than an hour before he returned to them . " I guessed right , " he told the cattleman . " The fellow hit it up at a gallop through the brush . He 's ten miles from here now . " " Was he after me or you ? " " Probably me . The Rangers ai n't popular with some citizens . Looks to me like Steve Gurley 's work . " " I would n't be a Ranger if I was you . I 'd resign , " said Ramona impulsively . " Would you ? " Jack glanced humorously at Wadley . " I do n't expect yore father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go through . " Clint nodded . " ' Mona said you wanted to see me about somethin ' . " The young man showed a little embarrassment . The cattleman guessed the reason . He turned to his daughter . " Private business , honey . " Ramona kissed her father good-night and shook hands with Jack . When they were alone the Ranger mentioned the reason for his call . " It 's goin ' around that Pete Dinsmore claims to have somethin ' on Rutherford . The story is that he says you 'd better lay off him or he 'll tell what he knows . " The eyes of the cattleman winced . Otherwise he gave no sign of distress . " I 've got to stand the gaff , Jack . He ca n't blackmail me , even if the hound cooks up some infernal story about Ford . I hate it most on ' Mona 's account . It 'll hurt the little girl like sixty . " Jack was of that opinion too , but he knew that Wadley 's decision not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right one . " She thought a heap o ' Ford , ' Mona did , " the cattleman went on . " He was all she had except me . The boy was wild . Most young colts are . My fault . I made things too easy for him -- gave him too much money to spend . But outside of bein ' wild he was all right . I 'd hate to have her hear anything against him . " He sighed . " Well , I reckon what must be must . " " Stories the Dinsmores tell wo n't count with honest folks . Pete is one bad hombre . Everybody will know why he talks -- if he does . That 's a big if too . He knows we 've got evidence to tie his gang up with the killin ' of Ford . He does n't know how much . Consequence is he 'll not want to raise any question about the boy . We might come back at him too strong . " " Mebbeso . " Wadley looked at the Ranger and his gaze appraised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given a son like this . " Boy , you kept yore wits fine to-night . That idea of makin ' ' Mona walk alone to the house an ' keepin ' her singin ' so 's a bushwhacker could n't make any mistake an ' think she was a man was a jim-dandy . " The Ranger rose . He had not the same difficulty in parting from Wadley or any other man that he found in making his adieux to a woman . He simply reached for his hat , nodded almost imperceptibly , and walked out of the house . CHAPTER XIX TRAPPED The territory which Captain Ellison had to cover to find the Dinsmore gang was as large as Maine . Over this country the buffalo-hunter had come and gone ; the cattleman was coming and intended to stay . Large stretches of it were entirely uninhabited ; here and there sod or adobe houses marked where hardy ranchers had located on the creeks ; and in a few places small settlements dotted the vast prairies . There were in those days three towns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Tascosa , it will pass very close to Mobeetie , a hundred miles away . Clarendon is farther to the south . In the seventies Amarillo was only what Jumbo Wilkins would have called " a whistlin ' - post in the desert , " a place where team outfits camped because water was handy . The official capital of the Panhandle was Mobeetie , the seat of government of Wheeler County , to which were attached for judicial purposes more than a score of other counties not yet organized or even peopled . To the towns of the Panhandle were drifting in cowboys , freighters , merchants , gamblers , cattle outfits , and a few rustlers from Colorado , New Mexico , and the more settled parts of Texas . They were the hardier sons of an adventurous race , for each man had to make good his footing by his own strength . At first there had been no law except that which lay in the good-will of men , and the holster by their side . The sheriff of Wheeler County had neither the deputies nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunmen served as marshals in the towns , but these had no authority on the plains . Until Captain Ellison and his little company of Rangers moved into the district there had been no way of taking law into the chaparral . The coming of these quiet men in buckskin was notice to the bad-man that murder and robbery were not merely pleasant pastimes . Yet it would be easy to overstate the lawlessness of the Panhandle . There were bad men . Every frontier of civilization has them . But of all the great cattle country which stretched from Mexico to the Canadian line none had a finer or more orderly citizenry than this . The country was notably free of the bloodshed which drenched such places as Dodge City to the east or Lincoln County , New Mexico , to the west of the Panhandle . Ellison wanted the Dinsmores , not because he believed he could yet hang any serious crime on them but for the moral effect upon them and the community . Clint Wadley had gone looking for trouble and had been wounded in consequence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not a conviction the fire-eating little Captain wanted just now . He intended to show that his boys could go out and arrest the Dinsmores or any other lawbreakers , whenever the occasion called for it . It might take them a week or a month or six months , but they would bag their game in the end . The rule of the Texas Rangers was to sleep on a man 's trail until they found him . The Captain stationed a man at each of the three towns . He sent two on a scouting-trip through No Man 's Land , and two more to search Palo Duro Canon . He watched the stages as they went and came , questioned mule-skinners with freight outfits , kept an eye on tendejons and feed-corrals . And at the end of three weeks he had no results whatever to show , except a sarcastic note from Pete Dinsmore complimenting him on his force of Rangers . The Captain was furious , but not a whit discouraged . " Dog it , we 'll fight it out on this line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawley , his second in command . To them came Jack Roberts with a proposition . " I 've found out that Homer Dinsmore has a girl in Tascosa . She 's a Mexican . I know about her through Tony Alviro . It seems she 's a cousin of Bonita , the girl Tony is going to marry . About once a week Dinsmore rides into town at night , ties his horse in the brush back of her house , and goes in to see her . If you say so , Chief , I 'll make it my business to be there when he comes . " " Need any help , do you reckon ? " " No . I 'll have to hide out in the mesquite . One man will be better on that job than two . " " All right , son . You know yore job . Get him . " That was all the warrant Jack wanted or needed . He returned to Tascosa and made his preparations . Every night after dark he slipped out of town by the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung round in a semicircle skirting the lights of the settlement . He had arranged a blind in the brush from which he could see the back of the Menendez " soddy . " Occasionally he comforted himself with a cautiously smoked cigarette , but mostly he lay patiently watching the trap that was to lure his prey . At one o'clock each morning he rose , returned on his beat , went to bed , and fell instantly asleep . On the fifth night there was a variation of the programme . It was between nine and ten o'clock that Jack heard the hoot of an owl . He sat up instantly , eyes and ears keyed for action . The back door of the sod-house opened , and through the night stillness floated the faint strumming of a guitar . Jack did not doubt that it was the answering signal to show that all was safe . A man crept forward from the mesquite and disappeared inside the house . Through the brush the Ranger snaked his way to the point from which the hooting of the owl had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An examination showed that the horse had been ridden far , but not too fast . Jack was satisfied the man had come alone . A faint trail wound in and out among the mesquite and the cactus to the house . Beside this trail , behind a clump of prickly pear , the Ranger sat down and waited . The hour-hand of his watch crept to ten , to eleven , to twelve . Roberts rose occasionally , stretched himself to avoid any chance of cramped muscles , and counted stars by way of entertainment . He had spent more diverting evenings , but there was a good chance that the fag end of this one would be lively enough to compensate . Shortly after midnight a shaft of light reached out from the house into the desert . The back door had opened . A woman came out , took a few steps forward , peered about her , and called that all was clear . A man followed . The two stood talking for a minute in low tones ; then the man kissed her and turned briskly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl should have returned to the house , but instead she waited in the moonlight to see the last of her lover . When he waved an arm to her and cried " Buenos noches , chachita , " she threw him a kiss across the starlit prairie . Intent on his good-night , the man missed the ill-defined trail that led to his horse and zigzagged through the brush at another angle . The Ranger , light-footed as a cat , moved forward noiselessly to intercept him , crouching low and taking advantage of all the cover he could find . Luck was with him . Dinsmore strode within a yard of the kneeling man without a suspicion of danger . A powerful forearm slid out from the brush . Sinewy fingers caught the far ankle of the moving man . One strong pull sent Dinsmore off his balance . The outlaw clutched wildly at the air and came crashing down . He fell into a bush of catclaw cactus . The Ranger was on him like a wildcat . Before his victim could make a move to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . Dinsmore , his face in the catclaw , gave a smothered cry for help . From where he was , the Ranger could not see the house , but he heard the excited voice of the woman , the sound of a commotion , and the beat of rapid footsteps . An excited voice called : " Quien es ? " The trapped man wanted to explain , but his captor rubbed the face of the outlaw deeper into the torturing spines of the cactus . " Do n't ask any questions , " advised Roberts . " Get back into the house pronto . The Rangers have taken Dinsmore . Unless you 're lookin ' for trouble , you 'd better vamos . " Evidently two or three Mexicans had run out to the rescue . Jack could hear them discussing the situation in whispers . He had them at a double disadvantage . They did not know how many Rangers lay in the mesquite ; nor did they want to fall foul of them in any case . The men drew back slowly , still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman protested volubly and bitterly till the closing of the door stifled her voice . Jack pulled his prisoner to a more comfortable position . " Sorry you fell into the catclaw , Dinsmore , " he said . " If you 'll stand hitched , I 'll draw the spine from your face . " The man cursed him savagely . " All right , " said the Ranger amiably . " If you want ' em as souvenirs , I 'll not object . Suits me if it does you . We 'll go now . " He tied to the handcuffs the end of the lariat which was attached to the saddle . The other end he fastened to the pommel . " I 'll not go a step with you , " growled Dinsmore . " Oh , yes , you 'd better step along . I 'd hate to have to drag you through this brush . It 's some rough . " The Ranger swung to the saddle . The bronco answered the pressure of the rider 's knee and began to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his spirit was unbroken . As he stumbled along in front of the horse , he filled the night with raucous oaths . " Take these cuffs off'n me and come down from that horse , " he stormed . " Do that , and I 'll beat off yore head . " The man on horseback smiled . " You 're the laziest fellow I ever did see , Dinsmore , " he drawled . " The last fellow that licked me pulled me from the saddle . " " Just let me get a lick at you , " pleaded the outlaw . " I 'll give you that bronc you 're ridin ' if you 'll stand up to me man to man . " " Ca n't do it . I 'm here for business an ' not for pleasure . Sorry . " " You 've got no right to arrest me . What 's the charge ? " " I 've forgot whether it 's brand-burning , highway robbery , murder , or mayhem -- any old crime would fit you . " " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered the Ranger lightly . " Cap Ellison said he 'd like to have a squint at you , anyhow , so I said I 'd fetch you along . No trouble a-tall to show goods . " The outlaw bared his tobacco-stained teeth in a sudden fury of rage . " Some day I 'll gun you right for this . " The narrow-loined youth with the well-packed shoulders looked down at him , and the eyes of the officer were hard and steady as steel . " Dinsmore , " he said , " we 're goin ' to put you an ' yore outfit out o ' business in the Panhandle . Your day is done . You 've run on the rope long enough . I 'll live to see you hanged -- an ' soon . " CHAPTER XX KIOWAS ON THE WARPATH Jack Roberts did not leave town inconspicuously with his prisoner in the middle of the night . He made instead a public exit , for Captain Ellison wanted to show the Panhandle that the law could reach out and get the Dinsmores just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captive on a horse beside him , the Ranger rode down to the post-office just before the stage left . Already the word had spread that one of the Dinsmores had been taken by an officer . Now the town gathered to see the notorious " bad-man " and his tamer . Dinsmore faced the curious crowd with a defiant sneer , but he was burning with rage and humiliation . He and his crowd had carried things with a high hand . They were not only outlaws ; they were " bad-men " in the frontier sense of the word . They had shot down turbulent citizens who disputed their sway . Pete and Homer especially had won reputations as killers , and game men sidestepped them rather than deny their claims . Yet twice within a month this smooth-faced boy had crossed their path and bested them . The pride of Homer Dinsmore was galled to the quick . He would have given all he had to " get a lick at " the Ranger now before all these people . Tascosa watched the young officer and his captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the situation , either by way of approval or disapproval . The fear of the outlaws had been too long over them . This was not the end of the matter . It was still a good betting proposition that some one of the gang would " get " this jaunty youth before he was much older . But it is certain that the arrest he had made single-handed had its effect . It is inevitable that a frontier camp shall some day discard its wild youth and put on the sobriety of a settled community . Was this time at hand for the Panhandle ? A rider galloped out of town after the horsemen . The Ranger turned to face him and made sure that the rifle beneath his leg would slip easily from its scabbard . An attempt at a rescue was always a possibility on the cards . The man drew his cow-pony up beside them . " ' Evenin ' , Mr. Man-in-a-Hurry . Lookin ' for anybody in particular ? " asked the red-haired Ranger , his chill eyes fixed on the stranger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mobeetie . " " Much obliged , " answered Roberts dryly . " Am I needin ' help ? " " You may . You 've got to sleep . Let me ride with you . " The brain of Jack Roberts began to register a memory . This young fellow was in ragged jeans and a butternut shirt . His hair was long and unkempt . He looked haggard and ill-fed . But he was the same youth the Ranger had glimpsed for a moment in the bravery of fine clothes and gay address on the day of the bulldogging . Jack remembered his promise to Ramona Wadley . " Fine ! Come along . We 'll take watch and watch through the night , " he told the boy . Homer Dinsmore 's teeth drew back in a derisive snarl . " Want company again on the trip so 's you wo n't be robbed , Mr. Ridley ? " The Easterner did not answer , but color flushed his face at the taunt . Roberts offered a comment on his behalf : " Ridley was young then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice he did n't ask for company when he flung himself down over Clint Wadley 's body to protect it from the bullets of a killer . " All afternoon they followed the Canadian River as it wound to the east . They made camp beside it at night , cooking the coffee on a fire of buffalo chips . Jerked beef and hardtack , washed down with coffee , was their fare . Dinsmore had fallen into a sullen silence , but the other two carried on desultory talk . The two young fellows were not very comfortable in each other 's society ; they did not understand the mental habits of each other . But Jack maintained a cheerful friendliness to which Arthur responded gratefully . Behind the curtain of their talk was a girl . The spell of her was on them both . Each of them could see her in the coals of the fire , light-footed and slim , with shy eyes tender and shining . But neither of them drew the curtain to their deeper thoughts . After they had eaten , the Ranger handcuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the fire , for he did not want the location of the camp to be betrayed by smoke . He gave Ridley the first watch -- because it was the easier of the two . With a saddle for a pillow and a slicker for a blanket , he lay down beneath the stars and fell asleep . Once , in his dreams , he thought he heard the sound of beating drums . When he wakened at the time set , the night was still . The prisoner was sound asleep , and Ridley , propped against his saddle , was keeping vigilant watch . Robert mentioned his fancy about the drums . Arthur smiled . " Before Dinsmore turned over he was snoring like a far-away thunder-storm . I expect that 's what you heard . " Jack roused the others as soon as the promise of day was in the sky . By sunup they were ready to travel . There was a bluff back of the camp that gave an outlook over the country . The Ranger left his prisoner in the care of Arthur while he climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . He knew that the Mexican girl would get word to the friends of her sweetheart that he had been arrested . There was a chance that they might already be close . Anyhow , it would do no harm to see . If he had not taken that precaution undoubtedly all three of the party would have been dead inside of half an hour . For the first sweeping glance of the Ranger showed him a tragedy . The valley was filled with Indians . Apparently as yet they did not know that any white men were in the neighborhood , for the smoke was beginning to rise from morning fires . In a little pocket , just off from the camp , their ponies were herded . At the opposite side were a dozen ox-wagons grouped together in a circle to form a corral . The tongue of the nearest wagon was propped up by a yoke , and across it was the naked body of a man who had been crucified and tortured . The other drivers of the freight outfit were nowhere in sight . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had escaped on horseback . The Ranger drew back at once from the bluff . He knew that probably he had been seen by the Indian lookouts ; if he and his party were going to get away , it must be done quickly . He ran down the hill to his companions . " **25;4875;TOOLONG of them , " he explained . " They 've captured a freight outfit and killed the drivers . We 'll cross the river below their camp if we can . " As he spoke , he was busy unlocking the handcuffs of the prisoner . To Dinsmore he gave a revolver . It seemed to Ridley that his heart was pumping water . Death with torture was the punishment given captives by the plains Indians . He knew he must be ghastly white , but he said nothing . The three men rode out of the ravine to the river . Already they could hear the yelling of the Kiowas a few hundred yards above . A moment later they caught sight of the savages pouring down the bank . Those in front were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian ponies , were galloping to catch up . Half a mile farther down , there was a break in the river-bank which offered a better chance for crossing . The stream there broadened , cut in two by a little island . The three riders gained on their pursuers . Bullets whistled past them , but they did not stop to exchange shots . When they reached the place Jack had chosen to cross , they were four or five hundred yards ahead of the leading Indians . They splashed into the water . Here it was shallow , but along the edge of the island the current was running swift . The Kiowas , following the fugitives down the bank , kept up a scattering fire . The bullets struck the water on all sides of the three moving targets . Arthur was on the right , closest to the Indians . A little ahead of him was Dinsmore . Farther over , the Ranger 's horse was already breasting the deep water . Roberts heard young Ridley cry : " He 's hit ! " The Ranger turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arthur was riding beside the wounded man and trying to support him . Jack drew up his horse , holding it strongly against the current , until the others were abreast of him . " We 've got to swim for it , " he called across to Ridley . " I 'll get him if he slips out of the saddle before we reach shore . " The horses swam side by side . Roberts encouraged Dinsmore , riding knee to knee with him . " Just a little way now . Stick it out .... We 're right close to the bank .... Grab the horn tight . " As Dinsmore slid into the water Jack caught him by the hair of the head . The swift water , racing fast round the shoulder of the island , tugged mightily at him . But the body of the Ranger 's horse was a barrier to keep the unconscious man from being swept downstream , and the fingers of the rider clung to the thick black hair like steel clamps . They reached shallow water . The Ranger swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that edged the bank . The horses clambered up without guidance , and Ridley drove them into the big rocks , where they would be better protected from the shots of the Indians . The Ranger chose the best cover available near the head of the island and put the wounded man down gently on the ground . Already the Kiowas were halfway across the river . Jack counted twenty of them on horseback in the water . " Can you shoot ? " he asked his companion . Ridley was behind a rock around which bushes grew thick . " B-better than I could . " He was shaking with excitement . " You ca n't miss ' em . We 've got ' em right this time . " Jack fired . An Indian plunged headfirst into the water like a stone from a sling . A moment later his body could be seen swirling in the swift current . A second shot shook the death scream from the throat of another brave . Twice Arthur missed . " You 've got buck-fever . Try for the horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little whoop of encouragement . The naked shining body of a Kiowa had collapsed on the bare back of a pony . Ridley at last had scored . Instantly the nervousness of the Easterner disappeared . His shooting had not the deadly accuracy of Roberts , but he was a good marksman , and at this close-range work his forty-five-seventy did clean work . The Texan did not miss a shot . He picked the leaders and took his time . A third , a fourth , and a fifth brave went sliding from the backs of the swimming ponies . The Kiowas broke under the deadly fire . Those not yet in the deep water turned and made for the shore from which they had come . The others gave with the current and drifted past the island , their bodies hanging from the far side of the ponies . The whites on the island shot at the horses . More than one redskin , unable to get out of the current after his pony had been shot , floated down the river for miles before the body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ten , " said the Ranger . " They 'll never try another attack from that bank . Probably they 'll surround the island to starve us . " He put down his rifle and opened the shirt of the wounded man . Dinsmore had been shot in the back , above the heart . Jack washed out the wound and bound it up as best he could . The outlaw might live , or he might not -- assuming that the party would escape from the savages . Jack knew that this was an assumption not likely to be fulfilled . His guess was that there were four or five hundred of the Kiowas . They would immediately post a line of guards on both sides of the river . There was a chance that a man on a fast horse might make a get-away if he left at once . He proposed to Ridley that he try this . " Will you go too ? " asked Arthur . The Ranger shook his head . " Got to stay with my prisoner . " " I 'll stay too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could send me help . " " Think I could get away ? " The Westerner pointed to two Indians who were swimming the river below out of rifle-shot . " I doubt it . You might fight yore way through , but they 'd likely get you . " " I 'll stick it out here , then . " In his heart Arthur knew that he was not staying to face the danger with the Texan . When once he had got over his panic , he had fought coolly enough under the eye of his companion , but he lacked the stark courage to face the chances of that long ride alone for help . " I reckon it 's too late , anyhow , " agreed Roberts . He shrugged his shoulders . " It 's a toss-up , either way . But we 'll sure send a few to their happy hunting-grounds before we take our long journey . " " You think --  " Arthur let his fear-filled eyes finish the question . The Ranger smiled wryly . " Yore guess is as good as mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight holes before an ' came through O. K. I 'll back my luck to stand up this time too . " Arthur looked into the brown face of this spare , clear-eyed youth and felt that he would give his hopes of heaven for such gameness . They had not one chance in ten thousand to escape , but the sheer nerve of the boy held him as cool and easy as though he were sauntering down the main street at Clarendon . CHAPTER XXI TEX TAKES A LONG WALK Except for desultory firing the Kiowas left the islanders alone for the rest of the day . The fever of the wounded man mounted . Most of the time he was out of his head , and in tossing to and fro was continually disturbing the cold-water bandages applied by the Texan . As soon as night had fallen , Roberts put a proposition to his companion . " One of us has got to go for help . Take yore choice , Ridley . Will you go or stay ? " The Easterner felt as though his heart had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until some one comes ? " he asked timidly . " Who 's likely to come ? You got any friends on the way ? I have n't . There 's another thing : the stage will be along to-morrow . We 've got to get warnin ' to it that the Kiowas are on the warpath . If we don't -- well , you know what happened to the freight outfit . " " If one of us goes , how can he get away ? " " I 've thought of that . It will be dark for an hour before the moon gets up . The one that goes will have to drop off the bank an ' swim down with the current for a quarter of a mile or so , then get to the shore , crawl across the prairie till he 's clear of the sentries , an ' make a bee-line for Tascosa . " " I could n't find my way in the dark , " faltered Arthur . Jack nodded . " I doubt if you could . I 'm elected , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We could n't take Dinsmore fifty yards . He 's too sick a man . " " He 's going to die anyhow . If I stay , we 'll both die -- horribly . It 's every man for himself now . " Jack shook his head . " If you feel that way , you go an ' I 'll stay . " " I -- I ca n't go alone . " He pushed his plea one step farther . " He 's a criminal -- a murderer . He 'd kill you if he could , and he 's already betrayed me . There 's no call for us to wait for certain death on his account . " The Ranger spoke gently . " None for you , but he 's in my hands . I 'll see it out . Mebbe you can get through the lines . Crawl through the grass . Keep yore nerve an ' lie low if you hear ' em comin ' . Once you 're through , you 'll be all right . " " I tell you I ca n't go alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays , then I 'll stay . " " That 's how it has to be . It 's about an even break , I reckon . They 're liable to get me if I go . They 're liable to get you if you stay . Then again , they 're liable to get neither of us if I can get through . " " What if they rush me ? " " Do n't lose yore head . You can stand ' em off . They 'll never make as strong an attack as they did this mo'nin ' . If they make any real rush , it will likely be just before daybreak . Indians do n't do business at night . " Jack made his preparations swiftly . He took off his boots and tied them to his belt . His hat he left behind . " How will I know whether you get through the sentries ? " asked Ridley . " If you hear any shootin ' , you 'll know I probably did n't . But I 'm sure figurin ' on gettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every hour brings help nearer . So long , old man . Best of luck ! " The Ranger grinned cheerfully at the other boy as he crept into the brush at the edge of the water . Presently Arthur heard a faint plop and knew that the Texan had begun his journey . The swift current carried the swimmer downstream rapidly . He used his arms just enough to keep himself up , and let the power of the water do the rest . As a small boy he had lived on the Brazos . He knew the tricks of the expert , so that he was able now to swim with only his nose showing . For it was certain that the Indians had set watchers on the river to guard against an escape . The island vanished behind him . Now and then he caught from one bank or the other the glow of camp-fires . Once he was sure he heard the beating of a tom-tom . And once he gave himself up for lost . The rapid current had swept him close to the right bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed with bow and arrow standing above him on the shore . He dived instantly . When he came up for air , only a bit of his red topknot showed . The swimmer heard the twang of an arrow and dived a second time . He was in the deep shadows of overhanging brush when he shook the water out of his eyes next time . For a dozen seconds he drew his breath in fear . But there came no shout of warning to other watchers , no shot or outcry to shatter the stillness . He guessed that the Kiowa had taken him for a log drifting downstream and had aimed wantonly to test his accuracy . Several hundred yards below the island Jack caught at a bush projecting into the water . He swung close to the bank and very cautiously drew himself out of the river . He listened . Except for the sound of the rushing water the night was still . Very carefully he wormed his way forward into the prairie . His progress was slow , for he had to make sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesquite-bush he put on his water-soaked boots . He crept fifty yards -- one hundred . To his right a camp-fire was burning . It seemed to him once or twice that he heard voices . An old trail worn nearly a foot deep by buffaloes served his need . In this trench he was partly hidden and could make better progress . He traveled on all fours , still alert in every sense for danger . Suddenly he sank full length into the trench . On the other side of a cactus-bush two Indians were squatting . They sat and talked . The heart of the Ranger sank . At any moment they might discover his presence , or they might sit there the whole night and hold him prisoner in his ditch . For an hour he lay there , wondering each moment whether the ticking of his watch might not betray him . Then , in a leisurely way , the sentries got up and sauntered toward the river . The moon was up now , and he could see their naked bodies shining in the light . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they separated . One moved up the river ; the other turned and came back directly toward Roberts . The Ranger lay in the buffalo-trail hoping that in the darkness he might escape observation . He was helpless . Even if he had brought a gun with him he dared not shoot , for if the alarm were given he would be driven out of cover in a few minutes . The brave came forward to the very edge of the wallow . His moccasin touched the body of the prostrate man . Some slight shift of his attitude precipitated the crisis . He turned to listen to some sound , and his foot pressed upon the leg of the Ranger . There was an instant volcanic upheaval . The Indian , startled , leaped back . Jack was upon him like a wildcat . They struggled , their bodies so close that the Kiowa could not use his rifle . The Texan had a double advantage , that of surprise and of a more muscular body . Moreover , the redskin made the mistake of trying to cling to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the white man on top of him . Jack became aware that the Indian was going to shout , and knew that if he did all was lost . His strong , brown fingers closed on the throat of the brave . There was a wild thrashing of limbs in a struggle to escape . The grip tightened , cut off a gurgle of escaping air . The naked arms and legs jerked more feebly .... When Roberts crept away into the darkness he carried with him the knife of the Kiowa . The rifle would only have hampered him , since he had to travel fast and light . With every yard gained now he was nearer safety . He knew he was leaving the camp behind . Presently he rose to his feet and traveled faster . For the safety of the two on the island depended upon the speed with which he covered the distance between him and Tascosa . The plainsman seldom walks . His high-heeled boots would be torture on a long tramp . When he wants to reach a place , he rides on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time within a dozen years . Now his long legs reached for the ground in a steady stride that ate up the leagues . He guided his course by the stars until he struck the river far above the camp . Once he stopped for a drink , but the thought of Ridley on the island drove his tired limbs on . Heel and toe , heel and toe , the steady march continued , till the Ranger , lithe and strong though the wind and sun and outdoor life had made him , was ready to drop with fatigue . His feet , pushed forward in the boots by the height of the heels , burned as with fire from the pain of outraged flesh rubbing against stiff leather . But it was not in him to quit . He set his teeth in his exhaustion and ploughed on up the trail . At last he saw the far , faint lights of Tascosa . The last mile or two were interminable , but he walked into the Bird Cage just as the clock on the wall was striking three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in a spangled dress ran up to him . " Come on . Let 's dance , " she cried ; then stopped and looked at him in surprise : " What 's the matter with you ? " The Ranger climbed up on the bar and beat upon it with the heel of his boot . The dancers stopped in their tracks as the music died . " The Kiowas are on the warpath . They 've got two white men trapped on the big island below the bend . Gather all the horses , guns , and men you can . We start in twenty minutes . " Cowboys left their partners standing in the middle of the floor . The musicians dropped their bows and fiddles . Bar-tenders left unfilled the orders they had just taken . For Indians in their war-paint were a fact always very near to the frontiersman , and whatever faults the Southwest may have had in those days , its warm heart answered instantly the call for help . The dancers scattered in all directions to get ready . A gong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out stridently into the quiet night to rally sleeping citizens . Children , wakened by the clamor , began to wail . Dogs barked . Excited men flung out questions and hurried away without waiting for answers . But out of the confusion came swift action . Each man looked to his own ammunition , weapons , horse . Women hurriedly put up lunches and packed saddlebags with supplies . In an incredibly short time a company of fifty riders had gathered in front of the Bird Cage . With the Ranger at their head , they went out of town at a fast trot . If there had been anybody there to notice it , he would have seen that the clock on the wall at the Bird Cage registered the time as twenty-seven minutes past three . CHAPTER XXII THE TEST When Ridley heard the faint plop of the Ranger 's body as it dropped into the water , his heart died under the fifth rib . He was alone -- alone with a wounded man in his care , and five hundred fiends ravenous for his blood . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water . Why should he stay to let these devils torture him ? Dinsmore had betrayed him , to the ruination of his life . He owed the fellow nothing but ill-will . And the man was a triple-notch murderer . It would be a good riddance to the country if he should be killed . But the arguments of the young fellow did not convince him . He had showed the white feather once on impulse , without a chance to reason out the thing . But if he deserted this wounded man now he would be a yellow coyote -- and he knew it . There was something in him stronger than fear that took him back to the helpless outlaw babbling disjointed ravings . He bathed the man 's fevered body with cold water from the river and changed the bandages on the wound . He listened , in an agony of apprehension , for the sound of a shot . None came , but this did not bring certainty that the Ranger had escaped . He had left behind all his arms , and it was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arthur reasoned with himself about his terror . Of what use was it ? Why fear , since he had to face the danger anyhow ? But when he thought of the morning and what it would bring forth he was sick with the dread he could not crush . The hours lagged endlessly . He had his watch out a thousand times trying to read its face . Occasionally he crept around the island to make sure the Kiowas were not trying to surprise him . Hope began to grow in him as the night grew old , and this alternated with terror ; for he knew that with the coming of dawn , the redskins would begin an attack . His mind followed the Ranger on his journey . By this time he must surely be halfway to Tascosa if he had escaped the Kiowas .... Now he might have reached the cottonwood clump beyond Big Ford .... Perhaps he might jump up a camp outfit with horses . If so , that would cut down the time needed to reach town . Five o'clock by Ridley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the head of it stopped to peer into the lessening darkness . A log , traveling down the river from some point near its headwaters in New Mexico , was drifting toward the island . His attention was arrested by the way it traveled . A log in a stream follows the line of least resistance . It floats in such a way as to offer the smallest surface to the force of the current . But this log was going down at a right angle to the bank instead of parallel to it . Was it being propelled by the current alone , or by some living power behind it ? Ridley posted himself behind a cottonwood , his repeater ready for action . In another moment he would know , because if the log was adrift in the river , it would miss the point of the island and keep on its way . Straight to the point of land the log came . There it stuck against the nose of the island . A head followed by a naked body drew itself from behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second head and body appeared , a third and a fourth . Ridley 's fear was gone . He had a job to do , and he went at it in a workmanlike manner . His first shot dropped the brave on the bank . His second missed , his third went hissing up the river . But the fourth caught full in the throat one of the Kiowas on the log . The painted warrior shot headfirst into the water and dropped as though he had been a stone . Before Arthur could fire again , the passengers astride the dead tree dived into the stream . Slowly the log swung around and was sucked into the current . Here and there a feathered head bobbed up . The boy fired at them from a sense of duty , but he did not flatter himself that he had scored another hit . But the immediate danger of being rushed was past . Ridley circled the island again to make sure that the attack at the head had not been a feint to cover one in the rear . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large rock he had scooped out a small cave in which he and the wounded man might lie protected . Now the Indians , in the full light of day , were spraying the spot with bullets . Fortunately they were notoriously poor shots , and their guns were the worst ever made . For hours the fusillade continued . Occasionally the defender answered with a shot or two to discourage any further attempt at storming his position . The most welcome sound in Ridley 's life was a scattering volley of shots that came from back of the Kiowa camp . There was a sudden rush for horses by the braves and the scurry of pounding hoofs as they fled across the prairie . A moment later came the whoop of the cowboys in the rescue party . Arthur , in an ecstasy of relief , ran to the edge of the water and waved his hat . Across the river came in answer the " Yip-yip , yippy-yip-yip " of the line-riders in the company . Several of them plunged into the stream and swam their horses across to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts . " I see you done held the fort , son , " said the fat man . " Fine and dandy ! How 's Dinsmore ? " " Quieter . He slept a good deal in the night . How are we going to get him across the river ? " The Ranger joined them . He nodded a friendly greeting at Ridley . " Our luck held up all right . I see you been doin ' some fancy shootin ' . " Arthur looked at him . The eyes of the Easterner were full of timid doubt . What did this game Texan think of him who had proposed to leave a wounded man to his fate ? The Ranger beamed a kindly comradeship , but the other young fellow wondered what was passing in the back of his mind . They held a committee on ways and means about Dinsmore . " We ca n't stay here -- got to get him to town where he can be fixed up , " Jumbo said . " We 'll take him over to the other bank and send for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried to the head of the island , and strapped to the back of a horse . Jumbo , Roberts , and Ridley guided the horse into the current and helped it fight through to the shallow water beyond . Twenty-four hours later Dinsmore was in bed in Tascosa . Dr. Bridgman said , with the usual qualification about complications , that the man probably would get well . The bullet had not punctured his lungs . CHAPTER XXIII A SHY YOUNG MAN DINES Ramona met Arthur Ridley face to face just outside of the post-office . " You dandy boy ! " she cried , and held out both hands to him . Her eyes were shining . The gifts of friendship and admiration were in them . He could not find a word to say . A lump rose in his throat and choked him . " It was just fine of you -- fine ! " she told him . " I was so glad to hear that a friend of mine did it . You are still my friend , are n't you ? " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But -- I have n't done anything to deserve it . " " Everybody 's praising you because you stayed with that Dinsmore man and saved his life at the risk of your own -- after he had treated you so mean too . I 'm so proud of you . " " You need n't be , " he answered bluntly . " I wanted to slip away and leave him . I -- I proposed it to Jack Roberts . But he would n't have it . He laid the law down . One of us had to go , one stay . I had n't the nerve to go , so I stayed . " " I do n't believe it -- not for a minute , " came her quick , indignant response . " And if you did -- what of it ? It is n't what we want to do that counts . It 's what we really do ! " He shook his head wistfully . He would have liked to believe her , but he felt there was no credit due him . " I fought because I had to if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't told any one else this , but I ca n't have you thinking me game when I know I 'm not . " " Was it to save yourself you flung yourself down in front of father and let that awful man Dinsmore shoot at you ? " she demanded , eyes flashing . " A fellow ca n't stand by and see some one murdered without lifting a hand . I did n't have time to get frightened that time . " " Well , all I 've got to say is that you 're the biggest goose I ever saw , Art Ridley . Here you 've done two fine things and you go around trying to show what a big coward you are . " He smiled gravely . " I 'm not advertising it . I told you because --  " "  - -  Because you 're afraid I 'll think too well of you . " " Because I want you to know me as I am . " " Then if I 'm to know you as you are I 'll have to get a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will expect you to supper to-morrow night . " " Thank you . I 'll be there . " Casually she enlarged her invitation . " I do n't suppose you 'll see that very shy young man , Mr. Roberts . " " I might . " " Then , will you ask him to come too ? I 'm going to find out whether you acted as scared as you say you did . " " Jack knows how scared I was , but he wo n't tell . Sure I 'll get word to him . " He did . At precisely six o'clock the two young men appeared at the home of Clint Wadley 's sister . The Ranger was a very self-conscious guest . It was the first time he had dined with ladies at their home since he had lost his own mother ten years earlier . He did not know what to do with his hands and feet . The same would have been true of his hat if Ramona had not solved that problem by taking it from him . His tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal warmer than the actual temperature of the room demanded . But Ramona noticed from the background that as soon as she and her aunt retired from the scene his embarrassment vanished . This slim , brown young man was quite at his ease with Clint Wadley , much more so than young Ridley . He was essentially a man 's man , and his young hostess liked him none the less for that . She made a chance to talk with him alone after supper . They were standing in the parlor near the window . Ramona pressed the end of her little finger against a hole in the pane . " I wonder if you 'd like me to sing ' Swanee River ' for you , Mr. Roberts ? " she asked . He did not mind being teased . By this time he had regained his confidence . He had discovered that she would not bite even though she might laugh at him in a friendly way . " You sing it fine , " he said . " I was n't singing it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I could n't very well have you keep shoutin ' out , ' I 'm a girl , ' so I figured --  ? " " I know what you figured , sir . You wanted to take all the chances that were taken . Father says it was the quickest-witted thing he ever knew . " She shot another dart at him , to his confusion . " Do you like my voice ? " " Well , ma'am , I --  " " You do n't have to tell any stories . I see you do n't . " Jack took heart . " If you 're fishin ' for a compliment --  " " What a tactful thing to tell a girl , " she said , smiling . "  - -  I 'll tell you that I never heard you sing better . " " Or worse , for that matter , " she added ; and with one of her swift changes of mood switched the topic of conversation . " How do you like Art Ridley ? " " He 'll do to take along . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he -- he wanted to run away from the island and leave that man Dinsmore , but you would n't let him . " Her eyes met his very directly . " He 's a great lad for imaginin ' things . I never want to see any one hold up his end better . " " You mean that he did n't say he wanted to leave Dinsmore ? " With her gaze searching him so steadily , it had to be an out-and-out lie to serve . Jack lied competently . " Not a word . " Her little finger tapped the hole in the pane gently while she reflected . " He told me --  " " That boy 's still worryin ' about losin ' that money for Mr. Wadley , do n't you reckon ? He 's got it tucked in his mind that a game man never would have been robbed . So he 's decided he must be yellow . Nothin ' to it a-tall . No quitter ever would have stood off those Kiowas like he did . " " That 's what I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement . " You 've relieved my mind . I should n't like to think that --  " She let her sentence trail out to nothing . Jack Roberts guessed its conclusion . She would n't like to think that the man she loved was not game . CHAPTER XXIV TEX BORROWS A BLACKSNAKE Dinsmore recovered from his wound and was held prisoner by Captain Ellison for a month after he was well . Then the ranger captain dismissed the man with a warning . " Skedaddle , you damn jayhawker , " was his cavalier farewell . " But listen . If ever I get the deadwood on you an ' yore outfit , I 'll sure put you through . You know me , Dinsmore . I went through the war . For two years I took the hides off'n ' em. 5 I 'm one of the lads that knocked the bark off this country . An ' I 've got the best bunch of man-hunters you ever did see . I 'm not braggin ' . I 'm tellin ' you that my boys will make you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yore meanness . They 're a hell-poppin ' bunch of jim-dandies , an ' do n't you ever forget it . " Homer Dinsmore spat tobacco-juice on the floor by way of expressing his contempt . " Hell ! " he sneered . " We were doin ' business in this neck of the woods before ever you come , an ' we 'll be here after you 've gone . " The Ranger Captain gave a little shrug to his shoulders . " Some folks ai n't got any more sense than that hog rootin ' under the pecan tree , Dinsmore . I 've seen this country when you could swap a buffalo-bull hide for a box of cartridges or a plug o ' tobacco . You cay n't do it now , can you ? I had thirty wagons full of bales of hides at old Fort Griffin two years ago . Now I could n't fill one with the best of luck . In five years the buffaloes will be gone absolutely -- mebbe in less time . The Indians are goin ' with the buffaloes-an ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside of three years they 'll sure be hard to find outside of jails . But you got to go yore own way . You 're hard to curry , an ' you wear ' em low . Suits me if it does you . We 'll plant you with yore boots on , one of these days . " Dinsmore swaggered from the jail and presently rode out of town to join his companions . Three days later an acquaintance stopped Jack Roberts on the street . " Seen Cap Ellison this mo'nin ' ? He was down at the shippin ' - pen an ' wanted to see you . The old man 's hot as a ginger-mill about somethin ' . " The Ranger strolled down toward the cattle-yards . On the way he met Arthur Ridley . They had come to be pretty good friends in the past month . The standards of the Texan were undergoing revision . He had been brought up in an outdoor school which taught that the rock-bottom factor of a man 's character is gameness . Without it nothing else counted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . But it had begun to reach him that pluck is largely a matter of training . Arthur had lived soft , and his nerve , like his muscles , needed toughening . Were his gayety , his loyalty , his fundamental decency , the affectionate sweetness of his disposition , to count for nothing ? He had a dozen advantages that Jack had not , and the cowboy admired him even though he was not hard as a rock . " Have you spoken to Captain Ellison yet ? " asked Ridley eagerly . " Says he 's thinkin ' about it , Art . There 's goin ' to be a vacancy on the force soon . My notion is that you 'll get the appointment . " It was a part of Ridley 's charm for the Texan that he would not give up to his timidity . The young fellow meant to fight it out to a finish . That was one of the reasons why he wanted to join the Rangers , to be put in places that would force him to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arthur wanted to settle a score with the Dinsmores . Captain Ellison was listening to the complaint of a drover . " I aim to drive a clean herd , Cap , but you know how it is yore own self . I start to drive in the spring when the hair 's long an ' the brand 's hard to read . By the time I get here , the old hair is fallin ' out an ' the brand is plain . But what 's a fellow to do ? I cay n't drop those off-brands by the way , can I ? The inspector --  " " That 's all right , Steel . The inspector knows you 're on the level . Hello , Jack ! I been lookin ' for you . " The Captain drew his man to one side . " Steve Gurley 's in town . He came as a spokesman for the Dinsmores an ' went to see Clint Wadley . The damn scoundrel served notice on Clint that the gang had written evidence which tied Ford up with their deviltry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's I 'd let ' em alone , they would disgrace his son 's memory . Of course Wadley is all broke up about it . But he 's no quitter . He knows I 'm goin ' through , an ' he would n't expect me not to do the work I 'm paid for . " " Do you want me to arrest Gurley ? " " Would n't do any good . No ; just keep tabs on the coyote till he leaves town . He ought to be black-snaked , but that 's not our business , I reckon . " Ridley walked back with the Ranger toward the main street of the town . From round a corner there came to them a strident voice . " You stay right here , missy , till I 'm through . I 'm tellin ' you about yore high-heeled brother . See ? He was a rustler . That 's what he was -- a low-down thief and brand-blotter . " " Let me pass . I wo n't listen to you . " The clear young voice was expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I 'm through tellin ' you . Me , I 'm Steve Gurley , the curly-haired terror of the Panhandle . When I talk , you listen . Un'erstand ? " The speech of the man was thick with drink . He had spent the night at the Bird Cage and was now on his way to the corral for his horse . " You take Miss Ramona home . I 'll tend to Gurley , " said Roberts curtly to his friend . Into his eyes had come a cold rage Arthur had never before seen there . At sight of them the bully 's brutal insolence vanished . He tried to pass on his way , but the Ranger stopped him . " Just a moment , Gurley . You 're goin ' with me , " said Jack , ominously quiet . White and shaken , ' Mona bit her lip to keep from weeping . She flashed one look of gratitude at her father 's former line-rider , and with a little sob of relief took Ridley 's offered arm . " You got a warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range there is no weapon more deadly than the human eye . Jack Roberts looked at the bully and said : " Give me yore gun . " Steve Gurley shot his slant look at the Ranger , considered possibilities -- and did as he was told . " Now right about face and back-track uptown , " ordered the officer . At McGuffey 's store Jack stopped his prisoner . A dozen punchers and cattlemen were hanging about . Among them was Jumbo Wilkins . He had a blacksnake whip in his hand and was teasing a pup with it . The Ranger handed over to Jumbo his guns and borrowed the whip . Gurley backed off in a sudden alarm . " Do n't you touch me ! Do n't you dass touch me ! I 'll cut yore heart out if you do . " The lash whistled through the air and wound itself cruelly round the legs of the bully . The man gave a yell of rage and pain . He lunged forward to close with Roberts , and met a driving left that caught him between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ranger had him by the collar at arm 's length and the torture of the whip was maddening him . He cursed , struggled , raved , threatened , begged for mercy . He tried to fling himself to the ground . He wept tears of agony . But there was no escape from the deadly blacksnake that was cutting his flesh to ribbons . Roberts , sick at the thing he had been doing , flung the shrieking man aside and leaned up against the wall of the store . Jumbo came across to him and offered his friend a drink . " You 'll feel better if you take a swallow of old forty-rod , " he promised . The younger man shook his head . " Much obliged , old-timer . I 'm all right now . It was a kind of sickenin ' job , but I had to do it or kill him . " " What was it all about ? " asked Jumbo eagerly . The fat line-rider was a good deal of a gossip and loved to know the inside of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He -- he said I had red hair . " " Well , you old son of a mule-skinner , what 's the matter with that ? You have , ai n't you ? " demanded the amazed Wilkins . " Mebbe I have , but he ca n't tell me so . " That was all the satisfaction the public ever got . It did a good deal of guessing , however , and none of it came near the truth . Footnote 5 : To " take the hides off'n ' em " was the expressive phraseology in which the buffalo-hunter described his business . CHAPTER XXV " THEY 'RE RUNNIN ' ME OUTA TOWN " Jumbo Wilkins came wheezing into the Sunset Trail corral , where Jack Roberts was mending a broken bridle . " ' Lo , Tex . Looks like you 're gittin ' popular , son . Folks a-comin ' in fifty miles for to have a little talk with you . " The eyes of the Ranger grew intelligent . He knew Jumbo 's habit of mind . The big line-rider always made the most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Jack casually . " Well , mebbe friends ai n't just the word . Say acquaintances . You know ' em well enough to shoot at and to blacksnake ' em , but not well enough to drink with . " " Did they say they wanted to see me ? " " A nod is as good as a wink to a blind bronc . They said they 'd come to make you hard to find . " The Ranger hammered down a rivet carefully . " Many of ' em ? " " Two this trip . One of ' em used to think yore topknot was red . I du n no what he thinks now . " " And the other ? " " Carries the brand of Overstreet . " " Where are these anxious citizens , Jumbo ? " " Last I saw of ' em they were at the Bird Cage lappin ' up another of the same . They 've got business with Clint Wadley , too , they said . " Jack guessed that business was blackmail . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to see him , he had better gratify their desire promptly . Perhaps after they had talked with him they might not have time to do their business with Wadley . As Jumbo waddled uptown beside him , Roberts arranged the details of his little plan . They separated at the corner of the street a block from the Bird Cage . Wilkins had offered to lend a hand , but his friend defined the limit of the help he might give . " You come in , shake hands with me , an ' ask that question . Then you 're through . Understand , Jumbo ? " " Sure . But I want to tell you again Overstreet is no false-alarm bad-man . He 'll fight at the drop of the hat . That 's his reputation , anyhow -- wears ' em low an ' comes a-shootin ' . " " I 'll watch out for him . An ' I 'll look for you in about three minutes . " " Me , I 'll be there , son , and I wish you the best of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Ranger walked into the Bird Cage . He had been just ready to gulp down another drink , but as his eyes fell on this youth who came forward with an elastic step the heart died within him . It had been easy while the liquor was in his brain to brag of what he meant to do . It was quite another thing to face in battle this brown , competent youth who could hit silver dollars in the air with a revolver . His companion read in Gurley 's sallow face the dismay that had attacked him . Overstreet turned and faced the newcomer . The outlaw was a short , heavy-set man with remarkably long arms . He had come from Trinidad , Colorado , and brought with him the reputation of a killer . His eyes looked hard at the red-haired youngster , but he made no comment . Jack spoke to the bartender . He looked at neither of the bad-men , but he was very coolly and alertly on guard . " Joe , I left my blacksnake at home , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some guys are lucky , Steve , " jeered Overstreet , taking his cue from the Ranger . " Because you fell over a box and this fellow beat you up while you was down , he thinks he 's a regular go-getter . He looks to me like a counterfeit four-bit piece , if anybody asks you . " Jumbo Wilkins puffed into the place and accepted the Ranger 's invitation to take a drink . " What makes you so gaunted , Jack ? You look right peaked , " he commented as they waited for their drinks . " Scared stiff , Jumbo . I hear two wild an ' woolly bad-men are after me . One is a tall , lopsided , cock-eyed rooster , an ' the other is a hammered-down sawed-off runt . They sure have got me good an ' scared . I 've been runnin ' ever since I heard they were in town . " Gurley gulped down his drink and turned toward the door hastily . " Come , let 's go , Overstreet . I got to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other with steel-cold eyes . They measured each other in deadly silence , and while one might have counted twenty the shadow of death hovered over the room . Then Overstreet made his choice . The bragging had all been done by Gurley . He could save his face without putting up a fight . " Funny how some folks are all blown up by a little luck , " he sneered , and he followed his friend to the street . " You got ' em buffaloed sure , Jack . Tell me how you do it , " demanded Jumbo with a fat grin . " I 'm the law , Jumbo . " " Go tell that to the Mexicans , son . What do you reckon a killer like Overstreet cares for the law ? He figured you might down him before he could gun you -- did n't want to risk an even break with you . " The Ranger poured his untasted liquor into the spittoon and settled the bill . " Think I 'll drop around to the Silver Dollar an ' see if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack found his friend the ex-Confederate doing business with another cattleman . " I 'd call that a sorry-lookin ' lot , Winters , " he was saying . " I know a jackpot bunch of cows when I see ' em . They look to me like they been fed on short grass an ' shin-oak . " His face lighted at sight of the Ranger . " Hello , brindle-haid ! Did n't know you was in town . " The quick eye of the officer had swept over the place and found the two men he wanted sitting inconspicuously at a small table . " I 'm not here for long , Sam . Two genuwine blown-in-the-bottle bad-men are after my scalp . They 're runnin ' me outa town . Seen anything of ' em ? They belong to the Dinsmore outfit . " The old soldier looked at him with a sudden startled expression . He knew well what men were sitting against the wall a few steps from him . This was talk that might have to be backed by a six-shooter . Bullets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to me like you 're hittin ' yore heels very fast to make a get-away , Jack , " he said dryly . " I 'm sure on the jump . They 're no bully-puss kind of men , but sure enough terrors from the chaparral . If I never get out o ' town , ship my saddle in a gunny-sack to my brother at Dallas . " " Makin ' yore will , are you ? " inquired Joe Johnston 's former trooper . The red-haired man grinned . " I got to make arrangements . They came here to get me . Two of ' em -- bad-men with blood in their eyes . " He hummed , with jaunty insolence : " He 's a killer and a hater ! He 's the great annihilator ! He 's a terror of the boundless prai-ree . " That goes double . I 'm certainly one anxious citizen . Do n't you let ' em hurt me , Sam . " There was a movement at the table where the two men were sitting . One of them had slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Ranger pretended to catch sight of him for the first time . " Hello , Gurley ! What 's yore hurry ? Got to see another man , have you ? " The rustler did not wait to answer . He vanished through the door and fled down the alley in the direction of the corral . Overstreet could do as he pleased , but he intended to slap a saddle on his horse and make tracks for the cap-rock country . Overstreet himself was not precisely comfortable in his mind , but he did not intend to let a smooth-faced boy run him out of the gambling-house before a dozen witnesses . If he had to fight , he would fight . But in his heart he cursed Gurley for a yellow-backed braggart . The fellow had got him into this and then turned tail . The man from Colorado wished devoutly that Pete Dinsmore were beside him . " You 're talkin ' at me , young fellow . Listen : I ai n't lookin ' for any trouble with you -- none a-tall . But I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-size . Do n't lean on me too hard . I 'm liable to decrease the census of red-haired guys . " Overstreet rose and glared at him , but at the same time one hand was reaching for his hat . " You leavin ' town too , Mr. Overstreet ? " inquired the Ranger . " What 's it to you ? I 'll go when I 'm ready . " " ' We shall meet , but we shall miss you -- there will be one vacant chair , ' " murmured the young officer , misquoting a song of the day . " Seems like there 's nothin ' to this life but meetin ' an ' partin ' . Here you are one minute , an ' in a quarter of an hour you 're hittin ' the high spots tryin ' to catch up with friend Steve . " " Who said so ? I 'll go when I 'm good an ' ready , " reiterated the bad-man . " Well , yore bronc needs a gallop to take the kinks out of his legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em that Tascosa is no sort of place for shorthorns or tinhorns . " " Better come an ' give them regards yore own self . " " Mebbe I will , one of these glad mo'nin 's . So long , Mr. Overstreet . Much obliged to you an ' Steve for not massacreein ' me . " The ironic thanks of the Ranger were lost , for the killer from Colorado was already swaggering out of the front door . The old Confederate gave a whoop of delight . " I never did see yore match , you doggoned old scalawag . You 'd better go up into Mexico and make Billy the Kid6 eat out of yore hand . This tame country is no place for you , Jack . " Roberts made his usual patient explanation . " It 's the law . They ca n't buck the whole Lone Star State . If he shot me , a whole passel of Rangers would be on his back pretty soon . So he hits the trail instead . " He turned to Ridley , who had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep cases on Overstreet an ' see whether he leaves town right away ? " A quarter of an hour later Ridley was back with information . " Overstreet 's left town -- lit out after Gurley . " The old Rebel grinned . " He wo n't catch him this side of the cap-rock . " Footnote 6 : Billy The Kid was the most notorious outlaw of the day . He is said to have killed twenty-one men before Sheriff Pat Garrett killed him at the age of twenty-one years . CHAPTER XXVI FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES Mr. Peter Dinsmore was of both an impulsive and obstinate disposition . He wanted what he wanted when he wanted it . Somewhere he had heard that if a man desired his business well done , he must do it himself . Gurley had proved a poor messenger . Peter would call upon Clint Wadley in person and arrange an armistice . He had another and a more urgent reason for getting to town promptly . A jumping toothache had kept him awake all night . After he reached Tascosa , Dinsmore was annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look after the fractured leg of a mule-skinner . " Is n't there any one else in this condemned burg can pull teeth ? " he demanded irritably of the bartender at the Bird Cage . " There certainly is . Buttermilk Brown is a sure-enough dentist . He had to take to bull-whackin ' for to make a livin ' , but I reckon he 's not forgot how . You 'll probably find him sleepin ' off a hang-over at the Four-Bit Corral . " This prophecy proved true , but Dinsmore was not one to let trifles turn him aside . He led the reluctant ex-dentist to a water-trough and soused his head under the pump . " Is that a-plenty ? " he asked presently , desisting from his exercise with the pump-handle . Buttermilk sputtered a half-drowned assent . His nerves were still jumpy , and his head was not clear , but he had had enough cold water . Heroic treatment of this sort was not necessary to fit him for pulling a tooth . They adjourned to the room where Buttermilk had stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to come out . The dentist peered at it , inserted his forceps and set to work . The tooth came out hard , but at last he exhibited its long prongs to the tortured victim . " We get results , " said Buttermilk proudly . " How much ? " asked Pete . It happened that the dentist did not know his patient . He put a price of five dollars on the job . Dinsmore paid it and walked with Buttermilk to the nearest saloon for a drink . Pete needed a little bracer . The jumping pain still pounded like a piledriver at his jaw . While the bartender was handing him a glass and a bottle , Dinsmore caressed tenderly the aching emptiness and made a horrible discovery . Buttermilk Brown had pulled the wrong tooth . Considering his temperament , Pete showed remarkable self-restraint . He did not slay Buttermilk violently and instantly . Instead he led him back to the room of torture . " You pulled the wrong tooth , you drunken wreck , " he said in effect , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right one , and if you make another mistake --  " He did not finish the threat , but it is possible that Buttermilk understood . The dentist removed with difficulty the diseased molar . " Well , we 're through now , " he said cheerfully . " I do n't know as I ought to charge you for that last one . I 'll leave that to you to say . " " We 're not quite through , " corrected the patient . " I 'm goin ' to teach you to play monkey-shines with Pete Dinsmore 's teeth . " He laid a large revolver on the table and picked up the forceps . " Take that chair , you bowlegged , knock-kneed , run-down runt . " Buttermilk protested in vain . He begged the bad-man for mercy with tears in his eyes . " I 'm goin ' to do Scripture to you , and then some , " explained Dinsmore . " It says in the Bible a tooth for a tooth , but I aim to pay good measure . " The amateur dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bicuspid , a canine , and an incisor were laid in succession on the table . Buttermilk Brown wept with rage and pain . " Four times five is twenty . Dig up twenty dollars for professional services , " said Pete . His tearful patient paid the fee . This was the most painful , violent , and high-handed episode of Buttermilk 's young life . Never in Shelbyville , Indiana , from which town he had migrated hopefully westward with his diploma , had such outrages been heard of . The instruments of Providence are sometimes strange ones . Nobody would have picked Pete Dinsmore for a reformer , but he changed the course of one young dentist 's life . Buttermilk fled from the Southwest in horror , took the pledge eagerly , returned to Shelbyville and married the belle of the town . He became a specialist in bridge-work , of which he carried a golden example in his own mouth . His wife has always understood that Dr. Brown -- nobody ever called him Buttermilk in his portly , prosperous Indiana days -- lost his teeth trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may , there is no record that he ever again pulled the wrong tooth for a patient . Having completed his deed of justice , Dinsmore in high good humor with himself set out to call on Clint Wadley . He had made an inoffensive human being suffer , and that is always something to a man 's credit . If he could not do any better , Pete would bully a horse , but he naturally preferred humans . They were more sensitive to pain . CHAPTER XXVII CLINT FREES HIS MIND Wadley was sitting on the porch with Ramona . He was still a semi-invalid , and when he exercised too much his daughter scolded him like the little mother she was . " Keep me here much longer , an ' I 'll turn into a regular old gossip in breeches , " he complained . " I 'll be Jumbo Wilkins Number Two , like as not . " " Is Jumbo a specialist in gossip ? " asked Ramona . She liked to get her father at reminiscences . It helped to pass time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl , he could talk a hind leg off'n a buckskin mule , Jumbo could . " He stopped to chuckle . " Oncet , when we were drivin ' a bunch of yearlin 's on the Brazos , one of the boys picked up an old skull . Prob'ly some poor fellow killed by the Indians . Anyhow , that night when Jumbo was wound up good , one of the lads pretended to discover that skull an ' brought it into the camp-fire light . Some one had wrote on it : ' Talked to death by Jumbo Wilkins . ' " ' Mona rather missed the point . She was watching a man slouching down the road toward them . He was heavy-set and unwieldy , and he wore a wrinkled suit of butternut jeans . The eyes of the cattleman chilled . " You go into the house , ' Mona . That fellow 's Pete Dinsmore . I do n't want you to meet him . " " Do n't you , Dad ? " The heart of the girl fluttered at sight of this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fear but anger that burned in her eyes . " I 'm going to sit right here . What does he want ? He 's not coming -- to make trouble , is he ? " " No . We 've got business to settle . You run along in . " " I know what your business is . It's -- about Ford . " He looked at her in surprised dismay . " Who told you that , honey ? " " I 'll tell you about that after he 's gone . I want to stay , Dad , to show him that I know all about it , and that we 're not going to let him carry out any blackmailing scheme against us . " Dinsmore nodded grouchily as he came up the walk to the house . Wadley did not ask him to sit down , and since there were no unoccupied chairs the rustler remained standing . " I got to have a talk with you , Clint , " the outlaw said . " Send yore girl into the house . " " She 'll listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with it soon as you can , an ' hit the trail , " said the cattleman curtly . The other man flushed darkly . " You talk mighty biggity these days . I remember when you was n't nothin ' but a busted line-rider . " " Mebbeso . And before that I was a soldier in the army while you was doin ' guerrilla jayhawkin ' . " " Go ahead . Say anything you 've a mind to , Clint . I 'll make you pay before I 'm through with you , " answered the bad-man venomously . " You will if you can ; I know that . You 're a bad lot , Dinsmore , you an ' yore whole outfit . I 'm glad Ellison an ' his Rangers are goin ' to clear you out of the country . A sure-enough good riddance , if any one asks me . " The cattleman looked hard at him . He too had been a fighting man , but it was not his reputation for gameness that restrained the ruffian . Wadley was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad-man or some drunken loafer and get away with it . But he had seen the sentiment of the country when his brother had wounded the cattleman . It would not do to go too far . Times were changing in the Panhandle . Henceforth lawlessness would have to travel by night and work under cover . With the coming of the Rangers , men who favored law were more outspoken . Dinsmore noticed that they deferred less to him , partly , no doubt , because of what that fool boy Roberts had done without having yet had to pay for it . " That 's what I 've come to see you about , Wadley . I 'm not lookin ' for trouble , but I never ran away from it in my life . No livin ' man can lay on me without hell poppin ' . You know it . " " Is that what you came to tell me , Dinsmore ? " asked the owner of the A T O , his mouth set grim and hard . There was an ugly look on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his deep-set eyes . " I hear you set the world an ' all by that girl of yours there . Better send her in , Wadley . I 'm loaded with straight talk . " The girl leaned forward in the chair . She looked at him with a flash of disdainful eyes in which was a touch of feminine ferocity . But she let her father answer the man . " Go on , " said the old Texan . " Onload what you 've got to say , an ' then pull yore freight . " " Suits me , Clint . I 'm here to make a bargain with you . Call Ellison off . Make him let me an ' my friends alone . If you do n't , we 're goin ' to talk -- about yore boy Ford . " The man 's upper lip lifted in a grin . He looked first at the father , then at the daughter . There was a tightening of the soft , round throat , but she met his look without wincing . The pallor of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " What are you goin ' to say -- that you murdered him , shot him down from behind ? " demanded Wadley . " That 's a lie , Clint . You know who killed him -- an ' why he did it . Ford could n't let the girls alone . I warned him as a friend , but he was hell-bent on havin ' his own way . " The voice of the cattleman trembled . " Some day -- I 'm goin ' to hunt you down like a wolf for what you did to my boy . " A lump jumped to Ramona 's throat . She slipped her little hand into the big one of her father , and with it went all her sympathy and all her love . " You 're ' way off , Wadley . The boy was our friend . Why should we shoot him ? " asked the man from the chaparral . " Because he interfered with you when you robbed my messenger . " The startled eyes of the outlaw jumped to meet those of the cattleman . For a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the film of wary craftiness covered them again . " That 's plumb foolishness , Clint . The Mexican -- what 's his name ?  - -  killed Ford because he was jealous , an ' if it had n't been for you , he 'd ' a ' paid for it long ago . But that ai n't what I came to talk about . I 'm here to tell you that I 've got evidence to prove that Ford was a rustler an ' a hold-up . If it comes to a showdown , we 're goin ' to tell what we know . Mebbe you want folks to know what kind of a brother yore girl had . That 's up to you . " Wadley exploded in a sudden fury of passion . " I 'll make no bargain with the murderer of my boy . Get out of here , you damned yellow wolf . I do n't want any truck with you at all till I get a chance to stomp you down like I would a rattler . " The bad-man bared his fangs . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the reptile to which her father had compared him . He glared at the cattleman , the impulse strong in him to kill and be done with it . But the other side of him -- the caution that had made it possible for him to survive so long in a world of violent men -- held his hand until the blood-lust passed from his brain . " You 've said a-plenty , " he snarled thickly . " Me , I 've made my last offer to you . It 's war between me ' n ' you from now on . " He turned away and went slouching down the path to the road . The two on the porch watched him out of sight . The girl had slipped inside her father 's arm and was sobbing softly on his shoulder . " There , honeybug , now do n't you -- do n't you , " Clint comforted . " He cay n't do us any harm . Ellison 's hot on his trail . I 'll give him six months , an ' then he 's through . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " " I -- I was n't thinking about me , " she whispered . Both of them were thinking of the dead boy and the threat to blacken his memory , but neither of them confessed it to the other . Wadley cast about for something to divert her mind and found it in an unanswered question of his own . " You was goin ' to tell me how come you to know what he wanted to talk with me about , " the father reminded her . " You remember that day when Arthur Ridley brought me home ? " He nodded assent . " One of the Dinsmore gang -- the one they call Steve Gurley -- met me on the street . He was drunk , an ' he stopped me to tell me about -- Ford . I tried to pass , an ' he would n't let me . He frightened me . Then Arthur an ' Mr. Roberts came round the corner . Arthur came home with me , an ' you know what happened in front of McGuffey 's store . " The face of the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in an amazement that gave way to understanding . Through his veins there crashed a wave of emotion . If he had held any secret grudge against Tex Roberts , it vanished forever that moment . This was the kind of son he would have liked to have himself . " By ginger , that was what he beat Gurley up for ! Nobody knows why , an ' Roberts kept the real reason under his hat . He 's a prince , Jack Roberts is . I did that boy a wrong , ' Mona , an ' guessed it all the time , just because he had a mixup with Ford . He was n't to blame for that , anyhow , I 've been told . " Ramona felt herself unaccountably trembling . There was a queer little lump in her throat , but she knew it was born of gladness . " He 's been good to me , " she said , and told of the experience with the traveling salesman on the stage . Clint Wadley laughed . " I never saw that boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win . I can tell you one thing ; he 's goin ' to get a chance to run the A T O for me before he 's forty-eight hours older . He 'll be a good buy , no matter what salary he sticks me for . " ' Mona became aware that she was going to break down -- and " make a little fool of herself , " as she would have put it . " I forgot to water my canary , " she announced abruptly . The girl jumped up , ran into the house and to her room . But if the canary was suffering from thirst , it remained neglected . Ramona 's telltale face was buried in a pillow . She was not quite ready yet to look into her own eyes and read the message they told . CHAPTER XXVIII ON A COLD TRAIL " Dog it , Jack , we got to go after the Dinsmores , " said Ellison , pounding the table with his fist . " I 've just had a letter from the old man wantin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Ranger policy to wait for outlaws to come to us . We go after ' em . " Tex smiled cheerfully . " Suits me fine . What are your instructions , Captain ? Want me to arrest Homer Dinsmore again ? " " What would I do with him if you got him ? " snapped the old-timer . " You could turn him loose again , " suggested Roberts , not entirely without sarcasm . " If you boys were worth the powder to blow you-all up --  ! " exploded the veteran . " Instead of bein ' a jackpot bunch of triflin ' no-account scalawags , " murmured Jack . "  - -  You 'd hustle out an ' get evidence against ' em . " " Sounds reasonable . " The Ranger lifted his heels to the seat of a second chair and rolled him a cigarette . " You 'd find out where they 're hidin ' the cattle they rustle . " " Are you givin ' me an assignment , Captain ? " " You done said it , son . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know it . Question is , can you find the cache ? " " I can try . " " Was n't it you told me once about bumpin ' into a rustler doin ' business whilst you was ridin ' the line ? " " At the mouth of Box Canon -- yes . " " Well , wha 's the matter with you scoutin ' up Box Canon an ' seein ' what you find ? " " They 're roostin ' up there somewheres . I 'll bet a hat on that . " " How many boys you want with you ? " Jack considered . " One . I 'll take Ridley if you do n't mind . " " He 's a tenderfoot , " suggested Ellison doubtfully . " Wo n't be of any help to you a-tall in cutting sign . If you leave him he 's liable to get lost . Better take Moser , had n't you ? " " Rather have Ridley . He does n't claim to know it all . Besides , we 've got to break him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's yore party . " " We 'll start in the mo'nin ' . " " The sooner the quicker , " agreed the Captain . " I want the old man to know we 're not spendin ' our time settin ' around a office . He 's got no call to crawl my hump when you boys are doin ' the best you can . Well , go to it , son . See if you-all can get evidence that will stand up so 's we can collect that bunch of hawss-thieves . " Before daybreak the two Rangers were on their way . They drove a pack-horse , their supplies loaded on a sawbuck saddle with kyacks . Jack had been brought up in the Panhandle . He knew this country as a seventh-grade teacher does her geography . Therefore he cut across the desert to the cap-rock , thence to Dry Creek , and so by sunset to Box Canon . At the mouth of the gulch they slept under the stars . As soon as they had cooked their coffee and bacon Roberts stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise we 're here . I 'm some particular about my health . I 'd hate to get dry-gulched7 on this job , " said Jack . " Would the Dinsmores shoot us if they found us ? " asked Ridley , searching with his head for the softest spot in his saddle for a pillow . " Would a calf milk its mother ? They 're sore as a toad at me , an ' I expect that goes for any other Ranger too . Homer might give us an even break because we stayed with him on the island , but I 'd hate to bet my head on that . " " If we get any evidence against them they ca n't afford to let us go , " agreed Arthur . " An ' if they jump us up , how 're they goin ' to know how much we 've seen ? There 's one safe way , an ' they would ce'tainly take it . " " Dead men tell no tales , it 's said . " " Some of ' em do an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proverb yet that was n't ' way off about half the time . For instance , that one you quoted . Rutherford Wadley 's body told me considerable . It said that he 'd been killed on the bluff above an ' flung down ; that he 'd been shot by a rifle in the hands of a man standin ' about a hundred an ' fifty yards away ; that he 'd been taken by surprise an ' probably robbed . " " It would n't have told me all that . " " Not till you learn to read sign closer than you do . An outdoor education is like a school-book one . You ca n't learn it in a day or a week or a year . " " You 're no Methuselah . There 's still hope for me . " " Lots o ' hope . It 's mostly keepin ' yore eyes open an ' yore brain workin ' . I 'm still only in the A B C class , but a fellow learns somethin ' every day if he 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains , why do Indians make the best trailers ? You would n't say their brains are as good as a white man 's , would you ? " " No ; an ' I 'd say there 's nothin ' on earth an Indian can do as well as a white man , given the same chance to learn it . Indians know the outdoors because they have to know it to live . The desert 's no prodigal mother . Her sons have to rustle right smart to keep their tummies satisfied . If the ' Paches and the Kiowas did n't know how to cut sign an ' read it , how to hunt an ' fish an ' follow a trail , they 'd all be in their happy huntin ' grounds long ago . They 're what old Nature has made ' em . But I 'll tell you this . When a white man gives his mind to it he understands the life of the plains better than any Indian does . His brains are better , an ' he goes back an ' looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , not redskins . " " I did n't know that , " Arthur said . " Ask any old-timer if it ai n't so . " They were eating breakfast when the light on the horizon announced a new day on the way . Already this light was saturating the atmosphere and dissolving shadows . The vegetation of the plains , the wave rolls of the land , the distant horizon line , became more distinct . By the time the sun pushed into sight the Rangers were in the saddle . Roberts led through the polecat brush to the summit of a little mesa which overlooked the gulch . Along the edge of the ravine he rode , preferring the bluff to the sandy wash below because the ground was less likely to tell the Dinsmores a story of two travelers riding up Box Canon . At the head of the gorge a faint trail dipped to the left . Painted on a rock was a sign that Jack had seen before . THIS IS PETE DINSMORE 'S ROAD --  TAKE ANOTHER . He grinned reminiscently . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . " " Whose orders ? " asked Ridley . " Pete 's , I reckon . " " If there 's a story goes with that grin --  " suggested Arthur . " No story a-tall . I caught a fellow brandin ' a calf below the canon . He waved me around . Some curious to see who the guy was that did n't want to say ' How ? ' to me , I followed him into Box . " That seemed to be the end of the yarn . At any rate , Jack stopped . " Well , did you find out who he was ? " " No , but I found this sign , an ' above it a rifle slantin ' down at me , an ' back of the rifle a masked face . The fellow that owned the face advised me about my health . " " What about it ? " " Why , that this rough country was n't suited to my disposition , temperament , an ' general proclivities . So I p'inted back to where I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity about who the rustler was ? " " Did n't I ? " drawled Jack . " Did you ? " " Mebbe I did . I 'm not tellin ' that yarn -- not to-day . " The country was rougher and hillier . The trail they had been following died away in the hills , but they crossed and recrossed others , made by buffaloes , antelopes , and coyotes driven by the spur of their needs in the years that had passed . Countless generations of desert life had come and gone before even the Indians drifted in to live on the buffalo . " Why is it that there 's more warfare on the desert than there is back East ? The cactus has spines . The rattlesnake , the centipede , the Gila monster , the tarantula , all carry poison . Even the toad has a horn . Everywhere it is a fight to survive . The vegetation , as well as the animal life , fights all the time against drought . It 's a regular hell on earth , " Arthur concluded . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature made the desert an ' grinned at life , much as to say , ' I defy you to live there , ' do n't it ? Sure there 's warfare , but I reckon there 's always war between different forms of life . If there was n't , the world would be rank with all sorts of things crowdin ' each other . The war would have to come then after all . Me , I like it . I like the way life came back with an answer to the challenge . It equipped itself with spines an ' stings an ' horns an ' tough hides because it had to have ' em . It developed pores an ' stomachs that could get along without much water . Who wants to live in a land where you do n't have to rustle for a livin ' ? " " You belong to the West . You 're of it , " Ridley said . " If you 'd seen the fine grasslands of the East , the beautiful , well-kept farms and the fat stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homesick for them . " Roberts nodded . " I 've seen ' em an ' I understand . Oncet I went back East an ' spent three months there . I could n't stand it . I got sick for the whinin ' of a rope , wanted to hump over the hills after cows ' tails . The nice little farms an ' the nice little people with their nice little ways kinda cramped me . I reckon in this ol ' world it 's every one to his own taste . " His eye swept the landscape . " Looks like there 's water down there . If so , we 'll fall off for a spell an ' rest the hawsses . " Footnote 7 : A man is said to be " dry-gulched " when he mysteriously disappears ,  - -  killed by his enemies and buried under a pile of rocks . CHAPTER XXIX BURNT BRANDS At the end of the third day of scouting Jack came back to camp late , but jubilant . " I 've found what we 're lookin ' for , Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a draw this evenin ' . A fellow was ridin ' herd on a bunch of cows . They looked to me like a jackpot lot , but I could n't be sure at that distance . I 'm gon na find out what brands they carry . " " How ? " " The only way I know is to get close enough to see . " " Can you do that without being noticed ? " " Mebbe I can . The fellow watchin ' the herd ai n't expectin ' visitors . Probably he loafs on the job some of the time . I 'm gamblin ' he does . " Roberts unloaded from the saddle the hindquarters of a black-tail deer he had shot just before sunset . He cut off a couple of steaks for supper and Ridley raked together the coals of the fire . " Throw these into a fry-pan , Art , while I picket old Ten-Penny , " said Jack . " I 'm sure hungry enough to eat a mail sack . I lay up there in the brush ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted to me till I was about ready to march down an ' hold him up for it . " " What 's the programme ? " asked Arthur later , as they lay on their tarpaulins smoking postprandial cigarettes . " I 'll watch for a chance , then slip down an ' see what 's what . I want to know who the man is an ' what brand the stock are carryin ' . That 's all . If it works out right mebbe we 'll gather in the man an ' drive the herd back to town . " " Then I go along , do I ? " " Yes , but probably you stay back in the brush till I signal for you to come down . We 'll see how the thing works out . " Ridley lay awake for hours beneath a million stars , unable to get his alert nerves quiet enough for sleep . The crisis of his adventure was near and his active imagination was already dramatizing it vividly . He envied his friend , who had dropped into restful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that Roberts was not insensitive . He , too , had a lively fancy , but it was relegated to the place of servant rather than master . In the small hours Arthur fell into troubled sleep and before his eyes were fully shut -- as it seemed to the drowsy man -- he was roused by his companion pulling the blankets from under him . Ridley sat up . The soft sounds of the desert night had died away , the less subdued ones of day showed that another life was astir . " Time to get up , Sleepy Haid . Breakfast is ready . Come an ' get it , " called Jack . They packed their supplies on the extra horse and saddled their mounts . The day was still young when they struck across the plains to the north . The way they took was a circuitous one , for Roberts was following the draws and valleys as far as possible in order to escape observation . The sun was high in the heavens when he drew up in the rim-rock . " We 'll ' light here an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , both men examined their rifles and revolvers carefully to guard against any hitch in the mechanism . Then , still following the low country , they worked forward cautiously for another half-mile . Jack fell back to give the other Ranger final instructions . " There 's a clump of cactus on the summit . We 'll lie back o ' there . You stay right there when I go forward . If I get the breaks I 'll wave you on later . If I do n't get ' em you may have to come a-shootin ' to help me . " They crept up an incline , wriggling forward on their stomachs the last few yards to the shelter of the cactus on the crest . Before them lay a little valley . On the cactus-covered slope opposite a herd of cattle was grazing . No guard was in sight . For two hours they lay there silently , watching intently . " I 'll slip down right now an ' take a look at the brands , " said Jack . " Had n't I better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're at , Art . I might need a friend under cover to do some fancy shootin ' for me if the Dinsmores arrived unexpected . " There was no cover on the near slope . Jack made no attempt to conceal himself , but strode swiftly down into the valley . Goosequills ran up and down his spine , for he did not know at what moment a bullet might come singing down at him . He reached the outgrazers of the herd and identified the A T O brand on half a dozen cows . The brand had been changed by an adroit touch or two of a running-iron . Probably the cattle were being held here until the hair had grown again enough to conceal the fact of a recent burn . The Ranger circled the herd , moving toward the brow of the land swell . He made the most of the cactus , but there was an emptiness about the pit of his stomach . If some one happened to be watching him , a single shot would make an end of Tex Roberts . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand were dragging at it . From one clump to another he slipped , every sense keyed to alertness . The rifle in his hand , resting easily against the right hip , could be lifted instantly . At the top of the rise the Ranger waited behind a prickly pear to search the landscape . It rolled away in long low waves to the horizon . A mile or more away , to the left , a faint , thin film of smoke hung lazily in the air . This meant a camp . The rustlers , to play safe , had located it not too near the grazing herd . It was a place , no doubt , where water was handy and from which the outlaws , if caught by surprise , could make a safe and swift retreat to the rim-rock . Again , in a wide circuit in order not to meet anybody who might be riding from the camp to the herd , the Ranger moved forward warily . The smoke trickle was his guide and his destination . He took his time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his programme . Far more important was secrecy . With that patience which the frontiersman has learned from the Indian he followed a tortuous course through the brush . His trained eye told him the best direction for approach , the side from which he could get nearest to the camp with the least risk of being seen . Through the curly mesquite he crawled , hiding behind the short bushlike clumps until he had chosen the next line of advance . At last , screened by a Spanish bayonet , he commanded a view of the camp . So far as he could tell it was deserted . Camp equipment lay scattered about . A frying-pan , a coffee-pot , tin cups and plates , had been dropped here and there . The coals of the fire still smouldered and gave forth a wisp of smoke . Fifty yards away a horse was picketed . It was an easy guess that the campers had not gone permanently , but were away from home for a few hours . Where were they ? Recalling the horses he and his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary qualm . If the Dinsmores should happen to stumble on them the situation would be an awkward one . The hunters would become the hunted . Deprived of their horses and supplies , the Rangers would be at a decided disadvantage . The only option left them would be to come to close quarters with the rustlers or to limp back home discouraged and discredited . Roberts preferred not to have his hand forced . He wanted to wait on opportunity and see what it brought him . He moved forward to the camp and made a swift examination of it . Several men had slept here last night and four had eaten breakfast a few hours since . He could find no extra supplies , which confirmed his opinion that this was only a temporary camp of a night or two . A heavy buzzing of flies in a buffalo wallow not far away drew his steps . The swarm covered a saddle of deer from which enough for a meal had been slashed before it was thrown away . The Ranger moved nothing . He left no signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at the camp . As soon as he had inspected it he withdrew . He had decided that the first thing to do was to join Ridley , make sure of their horses , and leave his companion in charge of them . Afterward he could return alone and watch the rustlers . Since he knew that the rustlers were away from their camp , the Ranger did not feel the need of taking such elaborate precautions against discovery during the return journey . He made a wide circuit , but his long , easy stride carried him swiftly over the ground . Swinging round the valley in which the herd was grazing , he came up from the rear to the brush-covered summit where he had left Ridley . Arthur had gone . He was nowhere in sight . Nor was there any sign to show where he had gone . It was possible that some alarm might have sent him back to look after the horses . Jack ran down the incline to the little draw where the animals had been picketed . The broncos were safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DISAGREE With a heart that pounded queerly Arthur watched his friend cross the valley and work his way to the ridge beyond . Even after Jack had disappeared , he waited , nerves jumpy , for the crack of a rifle to carry news of death in the mesquite . No tidings of tragedy came . The minutes fulfilled the hour . The many small sounds of the desert were shattered by no report . At last , drowsing in the warmth of the sunlit land , the Ranger 's eyes closed , opened , and shut again . He nodded , fell asleep . When he awakened it was with a shock of dread . His heart died . Four men were watching him . Two of them had him covered with revolvers . A third was just removing noiselessly his rifle and six-shooter from reach of his hand . He jumped to his feet . The consternation in his eyes showed how completely he had been caught napping . One of the men -- a long , lank , cross-eyed fellow -- laughed mockingly , and the sound of his mirth was evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whom he recognized as Pete Dinsmore . For a moment the Ranger 's mind was a blank . He could not make it serve his needs . Words were out of reach of his tongue . Then , " I 'm lost , " he stammered . " Are you alone ? " " Yes . " Out of his confusion one idea stood up imperatively . He must not betray Jack . " Where 's yore hawss ? " " It -- it got away from me . " " When ? " " Last night . " It seemed to him that he could keep just one jump ahead of this dominant man 's menacing questions . " Howcome that ? " " I shot a prairie-hen , and when I got down to get it -- I do n't know -- my horse got frightened and jerked away . I tried to catch it . The brute would n't let me . Then night came . " " What were you doin ' so far from town ? " cut in one of the two who were covering him . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave . Looks funny to me . " Gurley seemed fairly to ooze malice . " Just happened to drift here to this herd , I reckon . It sure was yore unlucky day . " Arthur looked from one to another despairingly . He found no hope anywhere , not even in the expressionless face of Homer Dinsmore , who as yet had not spoken a word . There came over the boy what he afterward described as a " gone " feeling . It was the sensation , intensified many times , felt when an elevator drops from under one in swift descent . " I -- do n't know what you mean , " he faltered . " You will , " said Gurley brutally . " Been across the valley to the herd yet ? " asked Overstreet , elaborately careless . Here was one question Ridley could answer with the truth . He spoke swiftly , eagerly . " No . " His questioner exchanged looks with Homer Dinsmore and laughed . The Ranger had betrayed himself . He had been so quick to deny that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They knew he suspected them of having rustled the stock grazing on the slope . Very likely he had already verified his doubts as to burnt brands . Homer Dinsmore spoke for the first time . His voice was harsh . " Why do n't you tell the truth ? You came to get evidence against us . " " Evidence ? " repeated Arthur dully . " To prove we 're rustlin ' stock . You know damn well . " " Why , I -- I --  " " And you did n't come alone . Ellison never sent a tenderfoot like you out except with others . Where are the rest of yore party ? Come through . " " I 'm alone . " Arthur stuck to that doggedly . " If he 's got a bunch of Rangers back of him we better burn the wind outa here , " suggested Gurley , looking around uneasily . Overstreet looked at him with scorn and chewed tobacco imperturbably . " Keep yore shirt on , Steve . Time enough to holler when you 're hurt . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Ridley desperately , beads of sweat on his brow . It had come to him that if he persuaded these men he had no companions with him he would be sealing his doom . They could murder him with impunity . But he could not betray Jack . He must set his teeth to meet the worst before he did that . " I tell you I 'm alone . I do n't know what you mean about the cattle . I have n't been across the valley . I came here , and I had n't slept all night . So I was all worn out . And somehow I fell asleep . " " All alone , eh ? " Pete Dinsmore murmured it suavely . His crafty mind was weighing the difference this made in the problem before the outlaws -- the question as to what to do with this man . They could not let him go back with his evidence . It would not be safe to kill him if he had merely strayed from a band of Rangers . But assuming he told the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very easy and simple way out for the rustlers . The Ranger could not tell what he knew -- however much or little that might be -- if he never returned to town . " I keep telling you that I 'm alone , that I got lost , " Arthur insisted . " What would I be doing here without a horse if I had friends ? " " Tha 's right , " agreed Gurley . " I reckon he got lost like he said . " He , too , by the same process of reasoning as Pete Dinsmore , had come to a similar conclusion . He reflected craftily that Ridley was probably telling the truth . Why should he persist in the claim that he was alone if he had friends in the neighborhood , since to persuade his captors of this was to put himself wholly in their power ? " You 're easily fooled , Steve , " sneered Homer . " I 've camped with this bird , an ' I tell you he 's got a passel of Rangers with him somewheres . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round us up , I reckon . " Overstreet looked at Homer . His eyebrows lifted in a slight surprise . He and the younger Dinsmore had been side partners for years . Homer was a cool customer . It was n't like him to scare . There was something in this he did not understand . Anyhow , he would back his pal 's play till he found out . " I expect you 're right . We can easy enough prove it . Let 's light out for the cap-rock an ' hole up for a coupla days . Then one of us will slip out an ' see if the herd 's still here an ' no Rangers in sight . We 'll keep this gent a prisoner till we know where we 're at ? How 's that ? " " You talk like we was the United States Army , Dave , " growled Pete Dinsmore . " We got no way to take care o ' prisoners . I 'm for settlin ' this thing right here . " The outlaws drew closer together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their power . If he tried to run he could not get twenty yards . The voices of the men fell . Arthur began to tremble . His face grew gray , his lips bloodless . On the issue of that conference his life hung . The easiest thing to do would be to make an end of him now . Would they choose that way out of the difficulty ? He could see that Gurley had , for the moment at least , joined forces with Homer and Dave Overstreet against Pete , but he could hear none of the arguments . " You 're wrong , Pete . We 're playin ' safe . That 's all . My notion is this guy 's tellin ' the truth . There 's only one thing to do . I do n't reckon any of us want him to go back to town . But if we do anything with him here , the Rangers are liable to find his body . Oncet up in the cap-rock we can dry-gulch him . " The older Dinsmore gave way with an oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . Majority rules . We 'll postpone this discussion till later . " Gurley brought the horses . Arthur was mounted behind him , his feet tied beneath the belly of the horse . The rustlers rode in pairs , Homer Dinsmore and Overstreet in the rear . " What makes you think this fellow has friends near , Homer ? " asked his companion . " He does n't know enough to ride alone . But I do n't care whether he 's alone or not . I 'm not goin ' to have the boy killed . He stood by me on the island to a finish . Of course that would n't go with Steve an ' Pete , so I put it on the other ground . " " Want to turn him loose , do you ? " " I 'd swear him first to padlock his mouth . He 'd do it , too , if he said so . " " Some risk that , old-timer . " " I got to do it , Dave . Ca n't throw him down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . Well , make yore play when you get ready . I 'll shove my chips in beside yours . I never yet killed a man except in a fight an ' I 've got no fancy for beginnin ' now . " " Much obliged , Dave . " " How far do you ' low to go ? If Pete gets ugly like he sometimes does , he 'll be onreasonable . " " I 'll manage him . If he does get set there 'll be a pair of us . Mebbe I 'm just about as stubborn as he is . " " I believe you . Well , I 'll be with you at every jump of the road , " Overstreet promised . The discussion renewed itself as soon as the outlaws had hidden themselves in a pocket of the cap-rock . Again they drew apart from their prisoner and talked in excited but reduced voices . " The Rangers have got no evidence we collected this fellow , " argued Gurley . " Say he disappears off'n the earth . Mebbe he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull killed him . Mebbe --  " " Mebbe he went to heaven in a chariot of fire , " drawled Overstreet , to help out the other 's imagination . " The point is , why should we be held responsible ? Nobody knows we were within fifty miles of him , doggone it . " " That 's where you 're wrong . The Rangers know it . They 're right on our heels , I tell you , " differed Homer Dinsmore . " We 'll get the blame . No manner o ' doubt about that , " said Overstreet . " Say we do . They ca n't prove a thing -- not a thing . " " You talk plumb foolish , Steve . Why do n't you use yore brains ? " answered Homer impatiently . " We can go just so far . If we overstep the limit this country will get too hot for us . There 'll be a grand round-up , an ' we 'd get ours without any judge or jury . The folks of this country are law-abidin ' , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all right , " agreed Pete . " But there 's somethin ' in what Steve says . If this tenderfoot wandered off an ' got lost , nobody 's goin ' to hold us responsible for him . " " He did n't no such thing get lost . Listen . Tex Roberts was with him the day Steve -- fell over the box . Tex was with him when we had the rumpus with the Kiowas on the Canadian . Those lads hunt together . Is it likely this Ridley , who do n't know sic ' ' em , got so far away from the beaten trails alone ? Not in a thousand years . There 's a bunch of Rangers somewheres near . We got to play our hands close , Pete . " " We 're millin ' around in circles , Homer . Why does this fellow Ridley claim he 's alone ? He must know it 's up to him to persuade us his friends are about two jumps behind us . " " One guess is as good as another . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw us off our guard . He 's hopin ' we 'll pull some fool break an ' the Rangers will make a gather of our whole bunch . " " Good enough , " said Homer , nodding agreement . " Another thing . This lad Ridley 's not game . But he 's a long way from bein ' yellow . He 's not gon na queer the campaign of the Rangers by tellin ' what he knows . " " Betcha I can make him talk , " boasted Gurley . " Put a coupla sticks between the roots of his fingers an ' press --  " " Think we 're a bunch of ' Paches , Steve ? " demanded Homer roughly . " Come to that , I 'll say plain that I 'm no murderer , let alone torture . I 've killed when I had to , but the other fellow had a run for his money . If I beat him to the draw that was his lookout . He had no holler comin ' . But this kid -- not for me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew what he was up against when he started . If it was us or him that had to go , I would n't hesitate a minute . Question is , what 's safest for us ? " " The most dangerous thing for us is to harm him . Do that , an ' we wo n't last a month in this country . " " What 's yore idea , then , Homer ? We ca n't hold him till Christmas . Soon as we let him go , he 'll trot back an ' tell all he knows , " protested his brother irritably . " What does he know ? Nothin ' except that we found him when he claimed to be lost an ' that we looked after him an ' showed him how to get home . Even if he 's seen those cattle he ca n't prove we burned the brands , can he ? " " No-o . " " In a day or two we 'll take the trail . I 'll put it to Ridley that we have n't time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sure get lost if we turned him loose here . We 'll drop him somewheres on the trail after we 've crossed the line . " " Fine an ' dandy , " jeered Gurley . " We 'll introduce him to the herd an ' take him along so 's he 'll be sure we 're the rustlers . " They wrangled back and forth , covering the same ground time and again . At last they agreed to postpone a decision till next day . Homer reported the issue of their debate , colored to suit his purpose , to the white-faced Ranger . " I reckon we 'll have to look out for you , Ridley . It would n't do to turn you loose . You 'd get lost sure . Mebbe in a day or two some of us will be driftin' ' in to town an ' can take you along . " " If you 'd start me in the right direction I think I could find my way back , " Arthur said timidly . " No chance , young fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ready for you to go . See ? " The Ranger did not push the point . He knew very well it would not be of the least use . His fears were temporarily allayed . He felt sure that Homer Dinsmore would put up a stiff argument before he would let him be sacrificed . CHAPTER XXXI A PAIR OF DEUCES From the lookout point among the rocks where he was stationed Overstreet shouted a warning to his companions below . " Fellow with a white flag ridin ' in . Looks like he might be a Ranger . " Pete Dinsmore dropped a coffee-pot and took three strides to his rifle . His brother Homer and Steve Gurley garnished themselves promptly with weapons . They joined the lookout , and from the big rocks could see without being seen . The man coming to their hang-out had a handkerchief or a flour sack tied to the barrel of his rifle and was holding it in the air . He jogged along steadily without any haste and without any apparent hesitation . He was leading a saddled riderless horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily . " What you do that for ? " Malice , like some evil creature , writhed in Gurley 's face . " It 's that fellow Roberts . We got him right at last . Leggo my arm . " " I 'll beat yore head off if you shoot again . Lucky for you you missed . Do n't you see he comes here as a messenger . Ellison musta sent him . " " I don ' care how he comes . He 'll never go away except feet first . " The man who had been horsewhipped by the Ranger was livid with rage . Dinsmore swung him round by the shoulder savagely . " Who elected you boss of this outfit , Steve ? Do n't ride on the rope or you 'll sure git a fall . " The eyes of Pete were blazing . Gurley gave way sullenly . " Tha 's all right . I ai n't aimin ' noways to cross you . I can wait to git this fellow if you say so . " The Ranger had pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave directions . " Homer , you an ' Dave go down an ' find out what he wants . Do n't bring him in unless you blindfold him first . We do n't wanta introduce him to the place so as he can walk right in again any time . " The two men named walked out to meet the Ranger . They greeted him with grim little nods , which was exactly the salutation he gave them . The hard level eyes of the men met without yielding an eyebeat . " Do n't you know a flag of truce when you see it , Dinsmore ? " demanded Roberts . " Excuse that shot , Mr. Ranger , " said Homer evenly . " It was a mistake . " " Gurley does make ' em , " returned Jack , guessing shrewdly . " Some day he 'll make one too many . " " I take it you came on business . " " Why , yes . Captain Ellison sent me with his compliments to get Ranger Ridley . " " Lost him , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost when we know where he is . " " Meanin ' that he 's here ? " " You ring the bell first shot . " Overstreet broke in , to mark time . " You think we 've got him ? " " We do . Do n't you ? " " And Ellison wants him , does he ? " " Wants him worse ' n a heifer cow does her calf . " Roberts laughed softly , as though from some fund of inner mirth . " He 's kinda hopin ' you 'll prove stubborn so as to give him a chance to come an ' get him . " " Where is Ellison ? " The Ranger smiled . " He did n't give me any instructions about tellin ' you where he is . " " H'mp ! You can come in an ' talk with Pete . We 'll have to blindfold you , " said Dinsmore . The envoy made no objections . He dismounted . A bandana was tied across his eyes , and the men led him into the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again what he had come for . " How did you know we were here ? " demanded Pete . " It 's our business to know such things . " Jack did not think it wise to mention that he had been here once before , the same day he found Rutherford Wadley 's body a few miles away at the foot of a bluff . " Ridley told us he was alone -- no Rangers a-tall with him , he said . " " Did he ? " Jack showed amusement . " What did you expect him to tell you ? He draws pay as a Ranger . " " What 's Ellison 's proposition ? " " Captain Ellison has n't any proposition to make , if by that you mean compromise . You 're to turn Ridley over to me . That 's all . " " An ' where do we get off ? " snorted Pete . " What does that buy us ? " " It buys you six hours ' time for a get-away . I 've got no business to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to Captain Ellison till after noon . I 'll go that far . " " I don ' know 's we want to make any get-away . We could hold the fort right here against quite a few Rangers , I reckon . " " Suit yourself , " said Jack indifferently . Pete chewed tobacco slowly and looked down sullenly at a flat rock without seeing it . Anger burned in him like a smouldering fire in peat . He hated this man Roberts , and Ellison he regarded as a natural enemy . Nothing would have pleased him more than to settle his feud with the Ranger on the spot with a six-shooter . But that meant a hurried exit from the Panhandle at a sacrifice of his accumulated profits . This did not suit Dinsmore 's plans . His purpose was to leave Texas with enough money to set him up in business in Colorado or Wyoming . It would not do to gratify his revenge just now . Nor did he dare to carry out his threat and let the Rangers attack him . His policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk it over with the other boys , " he said abruptly . " You wait here . " Jack sat down on a rock while the rustlers retired and discussed the situation . There was not room for much difference of opinion . The Rangers had forced their hand . All they could do was to slip out of the rim-rock and make for another zone of safety . This would involve losing the stock they had rustled , but their option was a choice of two evils and this was decidedly the lesser . Pete announced their decision truculently , his chin thrust out . " One of these days we 'll tangle , you ' n ' me , young fellow . But not to-day . Take Ridley an ' git out pronto before I change my mind . For a plug of tobacco I 'd go to foggin ' the air right now . " The prisoner was brought forward . His weapons were restored to him . With the long strain of fear lifted at last from his mind , it was hard for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he managed to return Jack 's casual greeting with one as careless to all appearance . He had caught the drift of the talk and he played up to his friend promptly . " I was rather lookin ' for you or one of the other boys about now , Jack , " he said . " Mighty careless of me to get nabbed asleep . " Ten minutes later the two Rangers were outside the pocket riding across the plain . " Hope Pete wo n't change his mind an ' plump a few bullets at us . He 's a right explosive proposition , " said Roberts . It was all Arthur could do to keep from quickening the pace . His mind would n't be easy until several miles lay between him and his late captors . " Where 's Captain Ellison waiting ? " asked Ridley . " He 's probably at Tascosa or Mobeetie . I have n't seen him since you have . " " Did n't he send you to the Dinsmores after me ? " " Why , no . " Arthur drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his story that he was alone and had told the truth , he would have brought ruin upon both himself and his friend . " You mean you went in there on a pure bluff , knowing how they hated you and what a big chance there was that they would murder you ? " " I took a chance , I reckon . But it looked good to me . " " If I had told them you and I were alone --  " " I figured you would n't do that . I had a notion my bluff would stick . They would n't think I 'd come to them unless I had strong backin ' . The bigger the bluff the better the chance of its workin ' . " " Unless I had told that there were only two of us . " " That was one of the risks I had to gamble on , but I felt easy in my mind about that . You 'll notice one thing if you stay with the Rangers , Art . They can get away with a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The law is back of us , and back of the law is the State of Texas . When it comes to a showdown , mighty few citizens want to get us after them good and hard . We always win in the end . The bad-men all know that . " " Just the same , for cold nerve I never saw the beat of what you did now . " " Sho ! Nothin ' to that . A pair of deuces is good as a full house when your hand ai n't called . We 'll swing over to the left here an ' gather up that bunch of rustled stock , Art . " Late that afternoon , as they were following the dust of the drive , Ridley voiced a doubt in his heart . " Is n't there a chance that the Dinsmores will follow us and find out we 're alone ? " " Quite a chance , " agreed Jack cheerfully . " If so , we 're liable to swap bullets yet . But I do n't reckon they 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail for Palo Duro to hole up . " The outlaws did not molest them during the drive . Four days later they reached town with their thirsty , travel-worn herd . Captain Ellison was at the hotel and Jack reported to him at once . The eyes of the little Ranger Chief gleamed . " Good boys , both of you . By dog , the old man wo n't write me any more sassy letters when he reads what you done . I always did say that my boys --  " "  - -  Were a bunch of triflin ' scalawags , " Jack reminded him . The Captain fired up , peppery as ever . " You light outa here and see if a square meal wo n't help some , you blamed impudent young rascal . " CHAPTER XXXII THE HOLD-UP When Wadley made to Jack Roberts the offer he had spoken of to his daughter , the face of that young man lighted up at once . But without hesitation he refused the chance to manage the A T O ranch . " Sorry , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texan stiffened . " All right , " he said huffily . " Just as you please . I 'm not goin ' to beg you on my knees to take the best job in the Panhandle . Plenty of good men want it . " The frank smile of the Ranger was disarming . " They do n't want it any worse than I do , Mr. Wadley . I 'm not a fool . Just because we had a difference oncet , I 'm not standin ' on my dignity . Nothin ' like that . You 're offerin ' me a big chance -- the biggest I 'm ever likely to get . When you pick me to boss the A T O under yore orders , you pay me a sure-enough compliment , an ' I 'd be plumb glad to say yes . " " Well , why do n't you ? " " Because the Rangers have got an unfinished job before them here , an ' I 'm not goin ' to leave Captain Ellison in the lurch . I 'll stick to my dollar a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattleman clapped him on the shoulder . " That 's right , boy . That 's the way to talk . Make yore clean-up , then come see me . I wo n't promise to hold this job open , but I want you to talk with me before you sign up with any one else . " But the weeks passed , and the Dinsmores still operated in the land . They worked under cover , less openly than in the old days , but still a storm-center of trouble . It was well known that they set the law at defiance , but no man who could prove it would produce evidence . Meanwhile spring had made way for summer , and summer was beginning to burn into autumn . The little force of Rangers rode the land and watched for that false move which some day the Dinsmores would make to bring them within reach of the law . On one of its trips in the early fall , the Clarendon stage left town almost half an hour late . It carried with it a secret , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a gold shipment in the box consigned to Tascosa . A smooth-faced Ranger sat beside the driver with a rifle across his knees . He had lately been appointed to the force , and this was one of his first assignments . Perhaps that was why Arthur Ridley was a little conscious of his new buckskin suit and the importance of his job . The passengers were three . One was a jolly Irish mule-skinner with a picturesque vocabulary and an inimitable brogue . The second wore the black suit and low-crowned hat of a clergyman , and yellow goggles to protect his eyes from the sun . He carried a roll of Scriptural charts such as are used in Sunday-Schools . The third was an angular and spectacled schoolmarm , for Tascosa was going to celebrate by starting a school . Most of those on board were a trifle nervous . The driver was not quite at his ease ; nor was the shotgun messenger . For somehow word had got out a day or two in advance of the gold shipment that it was to be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint doubts about the wisdom of going to Tascosa on that particular trip . The first twenty miles of the journey were safely covered . The stage drew near to the place where now is located the famous Goodnight cattalo ranch . From the farther side of a cut in the road came a sharp order to the driver . Two men had ridden out from the brush and were moving beside the stage . Each of them carried a rifle . The driver leaned backward on the reins with a loud " Whoa ! " It was an article of faith with him never to argue with a road-agent . Ridley swung round to fire . From the opposite side of the road a shot rang out . Two more horsemen had appeared . The reins slid from the hands of the driver , and he himself from the seat . His body struck the wheel on the way to the ground . The bullet intended for the armed guard had passed through his head . In the packed moments that followed , a dozen shots were fired , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the box . A bullet struck Arthur in the elbow , and the shock of it for a time paralyzed his arm . The rifle clattered against the singletree in its fall . But the shortest of the outlaws was sagging in his saddle and clutching at the pommel to support himself . From an unexpected quarter there came a diversion . With one rapid gesture the man in the clergyman 's garb had brushed aside his yellow goggles ; with another he had stripped the outer cover of charts from his roll and revealed a sawed-off shotgun . As he stepped down to the road , he fired from his hip . The whole force of the load of buckshot took the nearest outlaw in the vitals and lifted him from his horse . Before he struck the ground he was dead . In the flash of an eye the tide of battle had turned . The surprise of seeing the clergyman galvanized into action tipped the scale . One moment the treasure lay unguarded within reach of the outlaws ; the next saw their leader struck down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a sudden oath of alarm from behind the handkerchief he wore as a mask and turned his horse in its tracks . He dug home his spurs and galloped for the brow of the hill . The other unwounded robber backed away more deliberately , covering the retreat of his injured companion . Presently they , too , had passed over the top of the hill and disappeared . The ex-clergyman turned to the treasure-guard . " How bad is it with you , Art ? " he asked gently . That young man grinned down a little wanly at Jack Roberts . He felt suddenly nauseated and ill . This business of shooting men and being shot at filled him with horror . " Not so bad . I got it in the arm , Jack . Poor old Hank will never drive again . " The Ranger who had been camouflaged as a clergyman stooped to examine the driver . That old-timer 's heart had stopped beating . " He 's gone on his last long trip , Art . " " This schoolmarm lady has fainted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the world to faint . In Iowa , where she comes from , folks live in peace . Better sprinkle water on her face , Mike . " Jack moved over to the dead outlaw and lifted the bandana mask from the face . " Pete Dinsmore , just like I thought , " he told Ridley . " Well , he had to have it -- could n't learn his lesson any other way . " Roberts drove the stage with its load of dead and wounded back to Clarendon . As quickly as possible he gathered a small posse to follow the bandits . Hampered as the outlaws were with a badly wounded man , there was a good chance of running them to earth at last . Before night he and his deputies were far out on the plains following a trail that led toward Palo Duro Canon . CHAPTER XXXIII THE MAN WITH THE YELLOW STREAK Night fell on both a dry and fireless camp for the outlaws who had tried to rob the Clarendon-Tascosa stage . They had covered a scant twenty miles instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overstreet had been literally dying in the saddle every step of the way . He had clenched his teeth and clung to the pommel desperately . Once he had fainted and slid from his seat . But the bandits could not stop and camp , though Dinsmore kept the pace to a walk . " Once we reach Palo Duro , we 'll hole up among the rocks an ' fix you up fine , Dave , " his companion kept promising . " Sure , Homer . I 'm doin ' dandy , " the wounded man would answer from white , bloodless lips . The yellow streak in Gurley was to the fore all day . It evidenced itself in his precipitate retreat from the field of battle -- a flight which carried him miles across the desert before he dared wait for his comrades . It showed again in the proposal which he made early in the afternoon to Dinsmore . The trio of outlaws had been moving very slowly on account of the suffering of the wounded man . Gurley kept looking back nervously every few minutes to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Dinsmore and spoke low . " They 'll get us sure if we do n't move livelier , Homer . " " How in Mexico can we move faster when Dave ca n't stand it ? " asked Dinsmore impatiently . " He 's a mighty sick man . He had n't ought to be on horseback at all . He needs a doctor . " " Will you go an ' get him one ? " demanded Homer with sour sarcasm . " What I say is , let 's fix him up comfortable , an ' after a while mebbe a posse will come along an ' pick him up . They can look after him better than we got a chance to do , " argued Gurley . " And mebbe a posse wo n't find him -- what then ? " rasped Dinsmore . " They will . If they do n't , he 'll die easy . This is sure enough hell for him now . " " All right . Shall we stop right here with him ? " " That would n't do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I see . Yore idea is to let Dave die easy while we 're savin ' our hides . Steve , you 've got a streak in you a foot wide . " " Nothin ' like that , " protested the man with the eyes that did n't track . " I 'd stay by him if it was any use . But it ai n't . Whyfor should you an ' me stretch a rope when we ca n't help Dave a mite ? It ai n't reasonable . " Overstreet could not hear what was said , but he guessed the tenor of their talk . " Go ahead , boys , an ' leave me . I 'm about done anyhow , " he said . " If Gurley has a mind to go , he can . I 'll stick , " answered Dinsmore gruffly . But Gurley did not want to go alone . There were possible dangers to be faced that two men could meet a good deal more safely than one . It might be that they would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sallow outlaw felt that he could not afford just now to break with his companion . It was not likely that the Rangers would reach them that night , and he guessed craftily that Overstreet would not live till morning . The wound was a very serious one . The man had traveled miles before Dinsmore could stop to give him such slight first aid as was possible , and the jolting of the long horseback ride had made it difficult to stop the bleeding which broke out again and again . After Dinsmore had eased the wounded man from his horse at dusk and laid him on a blanket with a saddle for a pillow , Overstreet smiled faintly up at him . " It wo n't be for long , Homer . You 'll be shet of me right soon now , " he murmured . " Do n't you talk that-a-way , Dave . I do n't want to be shet of you . After a good night 's rest you 'll feel a new man . " " No , I 've got more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm right comfortable here . Steve 's in a hurry . You go on an ' hit the trail with him . " " Where did you get the notion I was yellow , old-timer ? I 've hunted in couples with you for years . Do you reckon I 'm goin ' to run like a cur now you 've struck a streak o ' bad luck ? " asked Dinsmore huskily . The dying man smiled his thanks . " You always was a stubborn son-of-a-gun , Homer . But Steve , he wants --  " " Steve can go to -- Hell Creek , if he 's so set on travelin ' in a hurry . Here , drink some of this water . " The blanket of darkness fell over the land . Stars came out , at first one or two , then by thousands , till the night was full of them . The wounded man dozed and stirred and dozed again . It was plain that the sands of his life were running low . Dinsmore , watching beside him , knew that it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recognized the watcher , and nodded good-bye . " So long , Homer . I 'm hittin ' the home trail now . " His hand groped feebly till it found that of his friend . A few minutes later he died , still holding the strong warm hand of the man who was nursing him . Dinsmore crossed the hands of the dead outlaw and covered him with a blanket . " Saddle up , Steve , " he told Gurley . While he waited for the horses , he looked down with a blur over his eyes . He had ridden hard and crooked trails all his life , but he had lost that day his brother and his best friend . The three of them had been miscreants . They had broken the laws of society and had fought against it because of the evil in them that had made them a destructive force . But they had always played fair with each other . They had at least been loyal to their own bad code . Now he was alone , for Gurley did not count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddled horses . Dinsmore swung to the saddle and rode away . Not once did he look back , but he had no answer for Gurley 's cheerful prediction that now they would reach Palo Duro Canon all right and would hole up there till the pursuit had spent itself , after which they could amble down across the line to Old Mexico or could strike the Pecos and join Billy the Kid . Only one idea was fixed definitely in his mind , that as soon as he could , he would part company with the man riding beside him . When day came , it found them riding westward in the direction of Deaf Smith County . The Canon was not far south of them , but there was no need of plunging into it yet . The pursuit must be hours behind them , even if their trail had not been lost altogether . They rode easily , prepared to camp at the first stream or water-hole they reached . " We 'll throw off here , " Dinsmore decided at the first brook they reached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire for the coffee , the other man strolled up the creek to get a shot at any small game he might find . Presently a brace of prairie-chickens rose with a whir of wings . The rifle cracked , and one of them fell fluttering to the ground . Dinsmore moved forward to pick up the bird . Abruptly he stopped in his stride . He fancied he heard a faint cry . It came again , carried on the light morning breeze . He could have sworn that it was the call of a woman for help . Dinsmore grew wary . He knew the tricks of the Indians , the wily ways with which they lured men into ambush . There had been rumors for days that the Indians were out again . Yet it was not like Indians to announce their presence before they pounced upon their prey . He moved very slowly forward under cover of the brush along the bed of the stream . The voice came to him again , closer this time , and in spite of the distance clear as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble . Still he did not answer as he crept forward up the stream . Then he caught sight of her -- a girl , slim and young , stumbling forward through the grass , exhaustion showing in every line of the body . She stretched out her hands to him across the space between , with a little despairing cry . CHAPTER XXXIV RAMONA GOES DUCK-HUNTING " I 'm going duck-hunting , Daddy , " announced Ramona one evening at supper . " Quint Sullivan is going with me . We 're to get up early in the morning and leave before daybreak . " They had been back at the ranch several weeks , and ' Mona was tired of practicing on the piano and reading Scott 's novels after her work about the house was done . She was restless . Her father had noticed it and wondered why . He would have been amazed to learn that the longing to see or hear about a certain brindle-haired former line-rider of his had anything to do with her unrest . Indeed , Ramona did not confess this even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooped up in the house too long . Hence the duck-hunting as an escape . " All right , honey . I 'll give Quint notice who his boss is to-morrow . " " I 've already given him his orders , Dad , " his daughter said , with a saucy little moue at her father . Clint chuckled . " ' Nough said . When you give orders I take a back seat . Every rider on the place knows that . I 'm the most henpecked dad in Texas . " By daybreak Ramona and her escort were several miles from the ranch on their way to the nearest lake . Quint was a black-haired , good-looking youth who rode the range for the A T O outfit . Like most of the unmarried men about her between the ages of fifteen and fifty , he imagined himself in love with the daughter of the boss . He had no expectation whatever of marrying her . He would as soon have thought of asking Wadley to give him a deed to the ranch as he would of mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman , in spite of her manner of frank innocence , knew quite accurately how matters stood , just as she knew that in due time Quint would transfer his misplaced affections to some more reciprocal object of them . Her particular reason for selecting Quint as her companion of the day was that he happened to be a devoted admirer of Jack Roberts . All one needed to do was to mention the Ranger to set him off on a string of illustrative anecdotes , and Ramona was hungry for the very sound of his name . One advantage in talking to young Sullivan about his friend was that the ingenuous youth would never guess that the subject of their conversation had been chosen by her rather than by him . " Did I ever tell you , Miss Ramona , about the time Texas an ' me went to Denver ? Gentlemen , hush ! We ce'tainly had one large time . " " You boys ought not to spend your time in the saloons whenever you go to town . It is n't good for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen . " She was speaking for a purpose , and Quint very innocently answered the question in her mind . " No , ma'am . I reckon you 're right . But we did n't infest the saloons none that time . Texas , he 's one of these here good bad-men . He 's one sure-enough tough nut , an ' I 'd hate to try to crack him , but the queer thing is he do n't drink or chew or go hellin ' around with the boys . But , say , he 's some live lad , lemme tell you . What do you reckon he pulled off on me whilst we was in Denver ? " " Some foolishness , I suppose , " said Ramona severely , but she was not missing a word . " He meets up with a newspaper guy an ' gets to fillin ' him plumb full o ' misinformation about me . To hear him tell it I was the white-haired guy from the Panhandle an ' had come to Denver for to hunt a girl to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes a piece in his paper about how it was the chance of a lifetime for any onmarried fe-male , of even disposition an ' pleasin ' appearance , between the ages of twenty an ' thirty-five , to marry a guaranteed Texas cowpuncher , warranted kind an ' sound an ' to run easy in double harness . An ' would the ladies please come early to the St. Peter hotel an ' inquire for Mr. Quint Sullivan . " " Did any of them come ? " asked Ramona , her eyes dancing . " Did they ? Wow ! They swarmed up the stairs an ' crowded the elevators , while that doggoned Tex sicked ' em on me . Honest , I did n't know there was so many onmarried ladies in the world . " " How did you escape ? " asked the girl , well aware that he was drawing the long bow . " Ma'am , the fire department rescued me . But I ce'tainly did lie awake the balance of the trip tryin ' to get even with Jack Roberts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up every time . " After they had reached Crane Lake the cowpuncher tied the horses while Ramona started around to the far side , following the shore line and keeping her eyes open for ducks . The girl made a half-circuit of the lake without getting a shot . There were ducks enough to be seen , but as yet none of them were within range . It might have been half an hour after Ramona left Sullivan that there came a shot from the other side of the lake . It was followed almost immediately by a second , a third , and a fourth . ' Mona caught sight of Quint running fast toward the horses . Her heart felt a sudden constriction as of an iron band tightening upon it , for half a dozen mounted Indians were in hot pursuit . She saw the boy reach the nearest bronco , jerk loose the bridle rein , vault to the saddle , and gallop away , lying low on the back of the horse . The Indians fired from their horses as they rode , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot . For a moment ' Mona stood in plain view by the lake shore . Then she dropped among the rushes , her heart fluttering wildly like that of a forest bird held captive in the hand . She was alone , at the mercy of twoscore of hostile Indians . They would know that the cowboy had a companion because of the second bronco , and as soon as they returned from the pursuit they would begin a search for her . Perhaps they might not even wait till then . ' Mona lay there in despair while one might have counted a hundred . During that time she gave herself up for lost . She could neither move nor think . But presently there flowed back into her heart a faint hope . Perhaps she had not yet been seen . There was a little arroyo farther to the left . If she could reach it , still unnoticed , at least she could then run for her life . She crept through the rushes on hands and knees , sinking sometimes wrist-deep in water . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rushes that had to be taken without cover . She flew across the open , a miracle of supple lightness , reached the safety of the little gulch , and ran as she had never run before . Every moment she expected to hear the crash of the pursuers breaking through the brush . On the ranch she had lived largely an outdoor life , and in spite of her slenderness was lithe and agile . Beneath her soft flesh hard muscles flowed , for she had known the sting of sleet and the splash of sun . But the rapid climb had set her heart pumping fast . Her speed began to slacken . Near the summit was a long , uptilted stratum of rock which led to the left and dipped over the ridge . She followed this because no tracks would here betray where she had escaped . For almost a quarter of a mile she descended on the outcropping quartz , flying in an ecstasy of terror from the deadly danger that might at any instant appear on the crest of the divide behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep , narrow gash that looked as if it might have been made by a sword stroke of the gods . She peered into the shadowy gulf , but could not see the bottom of the fissure . A pebble dropped by her took so long to strike that she knew the chasm must be deep . If she could get down into it , perhaps she might hide from the savages . It was her one possible chance of escape . The girl moved along the edge of the precipice trying to find a way down that was not sheer . An arrowweed thicket had struggled up from a jutting spar of rock . Below this was a ridge where her foot might find a support . Beyond was a rock wall that disappeared into empty space . But ' Mona could not choose . She must take this or nothing . By means of the arrowweed she lowered herself over the edge while her foot groped for the spar of quartz . Her last look up the hill showed Indians pouring across the ridge in pursuit . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the certainty of the torture waiting for her outside . Foot by foot she lowered herself , making the most of every irregularity in the rock wall that offered a grip for hand or foot . The distance down seemed interminable . She worked herself into a position where she could move neither up nor down . While her foot was searching for a brace one of her hands slipped and she went the rest of the way with a rush . For a time she lay there in the darkness , shaken and bruised by the fall , a sharp pain shooting through one of her legs just above the ankle . During those minutes of daze voices came to her from the slit of light above . The painted face of an Apache leaned over the edge of the wall and looked into the gulf . The girl made not the least movement . She did not stir to relieve the pain of her leg . Scarcely did she dare breathe lest the sound of it might reach those above . The Apaches began to fire into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . Shot after shot was flung into the cavern at random . Fortunately for Ramona the strain of the situation relaxed abruptly . A wave of light-headedness seemed to carry her floating into space . She fainted . When she came to herself no sound reached the girl from above . The Indians had no doubt concluded that their victim was not in the cavern and taken up the pursuit again . But she knew the cunning of the Apache . Probably one or two braves had been left to watch the cleft . She lay quite still and listened . All she could hear was the fearful beating of her heart . For hours she lay there without making a sound . The patience of the Apache is proverbial . It was possible they knew where she was and were waiting for her to deliver herself to them . ' Mona had one ghastly comfort . The little revolver she had brought along with which to shoot rattlesnakes was still in its scabbard by her side . If they would give her only a moment or two of warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the redskins . Time was unmarked for her in the darkness of the cavern . She could not tell whether it was still morning or whether the afternoon was nearing an end . Such a day , so full of dreadful horrors , so long from morning till night , she had never before passed . It seemed to her that a week of hours had come and gone before the light above began to fade . CHAPTER XXXV THE DESERT It was only recently that Clint Wadley had become a man of wealth , and life in the Panhandle was even yet very primitive according to present-day standards . There was no railroad within one hundred and fifty miles of the A T O ranch . Once in two weeks one of the cowboys rode to Clarendon to get the mail and to buy small supplies . Otherwise contact with the world was limited to occasional visits to town . As a little girl Ramona had lived in a one-room house built of round logs , with a stick-and-mud chimney , a door of clapboards daubed with mud at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had slept in a one-legged bedstead fitted into the wall , through the sides and ends of which bed , at intervals of eight inches , holes had been bored to admit of green rawhide strips for slats . She had sat on a home-made three-legged stool at a home-made table in homespun clothes and eaten a dish of cush8 for her supper . She had watched her aunt make soap out of lye dripping from an ash-hopper . The only cooking utensils in the house had been a Dutch oven , a three-legged skillet , a dinner-pot , a tea-kettle , a big iron shovel , and a pair of pot-hooks suspended from an iron that hung above the open fire . But those were memories of her childhood in southern Texas . With the coming of prosperity Clint had sent his children to Tennessee to school , and Ramona had been patiently trained to the feebleness of purpose civilization in those days demanded of women of her class and section . She had been taught to do fancy needlework and to play the piano as a parlor accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in life was to marry and keep the home fires burning , and her schooling had been designed , not to prepare her as a mate for her future husband , but to fit her with the little graces that might entice him into choosing her for a wife . Upon her return to the ranch Ramona had compromised between her training and her inheritance . She took again to horseback riding and to shooting , even though she read a good deal and paid due attention to her pink-and-white complexion . So that when she looked up from the cavern in which she was buried and caught a gleam of a star in the slit of blue sky above , she was not so helpless as her schooling had been designed to make her . The girl was compact of supple strength . Endurance and a certain toughness of fiber had come to her from old Clint Wadley . She began the climb , taking advantage of every bit of roughness , of every projection in the almost sheer wall . A knob of feldspar , a stunted shrub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , offered here and there toe-or hand-holds . She struggled upward , stopped more than once by the smooth surface against which her soft warm body was pressing . On such occasions she would lower herself again , turn to the right or the left , and work toward another objective . Ramona knew that the least slip , the slightest failure of any one of her muscles , would send her plunging down to the bottom of the crevasse . The worst of it was that she could not put any dependence upon her injured leg . It might see her through or it might not . It was within a few feet of the top , just below the arrowweed bush , that she came to an impasse . The cold wall offered no hand-hold by which she could gain the few inches that would bring her within reach of the bunched roots . She undid her belt , threw one end of it over the body of the bush , and worked it carefully down until she could buckle it . By means of this she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her knee found support in the loop of the belt , and in another moment she had zigzagged herself inch by inch over the edge to the flat surface above . No sign of the Apaches was to be seen . ' Mona recovered her belt and began to move up the rock spur toward the summit of the hill . A sound stopped her in her tracks . It was the beating of a tom-tom . She knew the Indians must be camped by the lake . They were probably having a feast and dances . In any case she could not strike direct for home . She must keep on this side of the hill , make a wide circuit , and come in from the west . Already her leg was paining her a good deal . Since five o'clock in the morning she had eaten nothing . Her throat was parched with thirst . But these were details that must be forgotten . She had to tramp more than twenty miles through the desert regardless of her physical condition . The girl went at it doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . But it was not until she discovered that she was lost to all sense of direction that she broke down and wept . The land here was creased by swales , one so like another that in the darkness she had gone astray and did not know north from south . After tears came renewed resolution . She tried to guide herself by the stars , but though she could hold a straight course there was no assurance in her mind that she was going toward the A T O. Each step might be taking her farther from home . A lime kiln burned in her throat . She was so worn out from lack of food and the tremendous strain under which she had been carrying on that her knees buckled under her weight as she stumbled through the sand . The bad ankle complained continuously . In this vast solitude there was something weird and eerie that shook her courage . Nor was the danger all fantastic imaginings . The Indians might yet discover her . She might wander far from beaten trails of travel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possibilities of disaster trooped through her mind . She was still a child , on the sunny side of seventeen . So it was natural that when she sat down to rest her ankle she presently began to sob again , and that in her exhaustion she cried herself to sleep . When her eyes opened , the sun was peeping over the desert horizon . She could tell directions now . The A T O ranch must be far to the northeast of where she was . But scarcely a mile from her ran a line of straggling brush . It must be watered by a stream . She hobbled forward painfully to relieve the thirst that was already a torment to her . She breasted the rise of a little hill and looked down a gentle slope toward the thicket . For a moment her heart lost a beat . A trickle of smoke was rising from a camp-fire and a man was bending over it . He was in the clothes of a white man . Simultaneously there came to her the sound of a shot . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hurried forward , and as she went she called again and still again . She was pitifully anxious lest the campers ride away before they should discover her . A man with a gun in his hand moved toward her from the creek . She gave a little sobbing cry and stumbled toward him .

" Where from ? " asked Dinsmore . " From the A T O. " " You 're Clint Wadley 's daughter , then ? " She nodded . " We met Indians . I ... got away . " The girl knelt beside the brook , put her hands on two stones that jutted up from the water , and drank till her thirst was assuaged . " I 'm hungry , " she said simply , after she had risen . He led her back to the camp-fire and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mona saw that he noticed her limp , though he said nothing about it . " I had an accident , " she explained . " Fell down a rock wall while I was getting away from the ' Paches . " " They 're out again , are they -- the devils ? " He asked another question . " You said ' we . ' Who was with you when the Indians took after you ? " " Quint Sullivan . I was on the other side of Crane Lake from him and heard shots . I saw Quint running for the horses with the ' Paches after him . " " Did he get away ? " She shuddered . " He reached the horses . They rode after him . I do n't know whether .... " Her voice thinned away . The man at the camp-fire turned , and at sight of them dropped a sudden , startled oath . Ramona looked at him , then at Dinsmore . A faint tremor passed through her slight body . She knew now who these men were . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's lost . The ' Paches are out , Steve . " " Where are they ? " " Up at Crane Lake last night . " " Are they headed this way ? " " Do n't know . She " with a jerk of his thumb toward Ramona --  " bumped into ' em an ' got away . " " We 'd better light a shuck out o ' here , " said Gurley , visibly disturbed . " Why ? They ai n't liable to come this way more than any other . We 'll have breakfast an ' talk things over . Fix up this bird , Steve . Cook it in the skillet . She 's hungry . " Ramona observed that both the men referred to her as she whenever any reference was made to her . While they ate breakfast the girl told the story of her experience . Dinsmore watched her with a reluctant admiration . The lines of her figure drooped with weariness , but fatigue could not blot out the grace of her young vitality . " When can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eaten . " For the A T O ? " asked the lank , sallow outlaw brutally . " What 's ailin ' you ? Think we 're goin ' to take you home with the ' Paches between us an ' there ? We ai n't plumb crazy . " " But I must get home right away . My father -- he 'll be frightened about me . " " Will he ? " jeered Gurley . " If he knew you was in such good company he 'd be real easy in his mind . " The man flashed a look at her that made the girl burn with shame . " We could go round an ' miss the ' Paches , " suggested Ramona timidly . " Forget that notion , " answered Gurley , and there was a flash of cruelty in his eyes . " Mebbe you misremember that I 'm obligated to you , miss , for what that condemned Ranger Roberts did to me when I fell over the box in front of the store . We 'll settle accounts whilst you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinsmore . " You 're not going to let him ... mistreat me , are you ? " The pathos of her situation , the slim , helpless , wonderful youth of the girl , touched the not very accessible heart of Dinsmore . " You bet I 'm not . He 'll cut out that kind o ' talk right now , " he said . The eyes of Ramona met his , and she knew she was safe . This man had the respect for a good woman that was characteristic of the turbulent West in its most lawless days . He might be a miscreant and a murderer , but he would fight at the drop of a hat in response to the appeal of any woman who was " straight . " " Playin ' up to Clint , are you , Homer ? " sneered the other man . " You better take her straight home like she wants , since you 're so friendly to the family . " " That 's exactly what I 'm goin ' to do , " retorted Dinsmore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His alarm voiced itself in a wheedling apology . " I did n't go for to rile you , Homer . O ' course you cay n't do that . We got to stick together . The Indians is one reason . An ' there 's another . No need for me to tell you what it is . " " You 'll have to wait for me in the canon till I get back . It 's not far from here to you-know-where . I 'm goin ' to take the horses an ' see this girl back to her home . " " You 're good , " Ramona said simply . " You 're not figurin ' on takin ' my horse , are you ? " Gurley burst out with an oath . " You 've done guessed it , Steve . You 'll have to hoof it into the canon . " " Like hell I will . Take another think , my friend . " The eyes of the men clashed , one pair filled with impotent rage , the other cold and hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullenly . " It 's no square deal , Homer . We did n't bring her here . Why cay n't she go along with us an ' hole up till the ' Paches are gone an ' till ... things kinda settle down ? " " Because she 's got no business with folks like us . Her place is back at the A T O , an ' that 's where I aim to take her . She 's had one hell of a time , if you ask me . What that kid needs is for her home folks to tuck her up in bed an ' send her to sleep . She 's had about all the trouble a li'l ' trick like her can stand , I should n't wonder . " " You ai n't her nurse , " growled Gurley . " That 's why I 'm goin ' to take her home to those that are . ' Nuff said , Steve . What I say goes . " " You act mighty high-heeled , " grumbled the other man . " Mebbeso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Steve . " " I du n no as I 'm yore horse-rustler , " mumbled Gurley , smothering his sullen rage . None the less he rose slowly and shuffled away toward the hobbled horses . ' Mona touched Dinsmore on the sleeve . Her soft eyes poured gratitude on him . " I 'll remember this as long as I live . No matter what anybody says I 'll always know that you 're good . " The blood crept up beneath the tan of the outlaw 's face . It had been many years since an innocent child had made so naive a confession of faith in him . He was a bad-man , and he knew it . But at the core of him was a dynamic spark of self-respect that had always remained alight . He had ridden crooked trails through all his gusty lifetime . His hand had been against every man 's , but at least he had fought fair and been loyal to his pals . And there had never been a time when a good woman need be afraid to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that . I got ta take you home so as you wo n't be in the way , " he told her with a touch of embarrassed annoyance . No man alive knew this country better than Homer Dinsmore . Every draw was like its neighbor , every rolling rise a replica of the next . But the outlaw rode as straight a course as if his road had been marked out for him by stakes across the plains . He knew that he might be riding directly toward a posse of Rangers headed for Palo Duro to round up the stage robbers . He could not help that . He would have to take his chance of an escape in case they met such a posse . The sun climbed high in the heavens . " How far do you think we are now from the ranch ? " asked Ramona . " Most twenty miles . We 've been swingin ' well to the left . I reckon we can cut in now . " They climbed at a walk a little hill and looked across a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry and pointed an outstretched finger at some riders emerging from a dry wash . " ' Paches ! " cried Dinsmore . " Back over the hill , girl . " They turned , but too late . On the breeze there came to them a yell that sent the blood from ' Mona 's heart . CHAPTER XXXVII ON A HOT TRAIL Roberts picked up from the fort a Mescalero Apache famous as a trailer . He reckoned to be rather expert in that line himself , but few white men could boast of such skill as old Guadaloupe had . Jumbo Wilkins was one of the posse Jack had hastily gathered . " I 'm good an ' glad I was in town an ' not out herdin ' vacas , Tex . A fellow kinda needs a little excitement oncet in a while . I got a hunch we 're goin ' to git these birds this time . " " You 're the greatest little optimist I ever did see , Jumbo , " answered the Ranger with a smile . " We 're goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch of this country an ' are ridin ' hell-for-leather to make a get-away . We 're liable to ride our broncs to shadows an ' never see hair or hide of the fellows we want . I 'd like to know what license you 've got for yore hunch . " " You 're such a lucky guy , Tex . If you was lookin ' for a needle in a haystack you 'd find it in yore mouth when you picked up a straw to chew on . " " Lucky , nothin ' . A man makes his own luck , I always did tell you , an ' I have n't bumped into any yet . You do n't see any big bunch of fat cows with my brand on ' em , do you ? I 'm pluggin ' along for a dollar a day with a promise from Cap Ellison that I 'll probably cash in soon with my boots on . Old Man Luck always hides behind the door when I pass , if there 's any such Santa Claus in the business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't Clint Wadley offer you the job of bossin ' the best cow-ranch in the Panhandle ? " " An ' did n't I have to turn down his offer an ' hang on to a dollar-a-day job ? " " Then you saved Miss ' Mona from that bull an ' made a friend of her . " " Yes , an ' then I butted in an ' kept the Kiowas from mussin ' up Art Ridley , who is liable to ask me to stand up with him when he marries Miss Ramona , " added the Ranger . " Shucks ! She 'll never marry Ridley so long as you 're runnin ' around unbranded , son . " " A lot you know about girls , Jumbo , " said Roberts with a rueful grin . " I do n't know sic ' ' em about the things they like . I 'm one chaparral-raised roughneck . That little lady never wasted two thoughts on me . But Art -- he knows a lot about books an ' style an ' New York 's four hundred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to talk , an ' makes a sure-enough hit with the girls . " " He 's a sissy boy beside you . No Texas girl would look twice --  " " Nothin ' a-tall to that . Did n't he save Clint Wadley 's life ? Did n't he stay by Dinsmore when the Kiowas had ' em holed ? He fought good enough to get shot up this mo'nin ' , did n't he ? No , sir . You 'll find he 's got me backed off the map so far as Miss Ramona goes . I know it , old-timer . " " Where do you get that notion you 're a roughneck , Tex ? " asked Jumbo . " You 've read more books than any man on the range . You do n't hell around like most of the boys . You do n't drink . Mebbe you ai n't exactly pretty , but yore face does n't scare critters when they see it onexpected . An ' when the band begins to play -- Gentlemen , watch Tex . " " If the girls would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jumbo , " suggested Roberts with his sardonic smile . Through rabbit weed and curly mesquite , among the catclaw and the prickly pear , they followed the faint ribbon trail left by the outlaws in their retreat from the scene of the hold-up . When it was too late to cut sign any longer , the Ranger gave orders to throw in to a small draw where the grass was good . At daybreak they were on the trail again and came within the hour to the body of Overstreet . They dug a grave in a buffalo run with their knives and buried the body as well as they could before they picked up again the tracks of two horses now traveling much faster . " They 're headin ' for Palo Duro , looks like , ' " commented Roberts . " Looks like , " agreed his friend . Early in the afternoon the posse reached the little creek where the outlaws had breakfasted . Old Guadaloupe crisscrossed the ground like a bloodhound as he read what was written there . But before he made any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fugitives and that this recruit was a woman . The Ranger followed the Apache upstream , guessed by some feathers and some drops of blood that one of the outlaws had shot a prairie-hen , and read some hint of the story of the meeting between the woman and the bandit . Was this woman some one who had been living in Palo Duro Canon with the outlaws ? Or was this meeting an accidental one ? The odd thing about it was that there was no sign of her horse . She had come on foot , in a country where nobody ever travels that way . Roberts told Guadaloupe to find out where the party had gone from the camp . He himself followed into the desert the footsteps of the woman who had come across it toward the creek . He was puzzled and a little disturbed in mind . She had not come from the canon . What was a woman doing alone and on foot in this desert empty of human life for fifty miles or more ? He found no answer to his questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his report . One man had started out on foot along the edge of the canon . The other man and the woman had struck on horseback across the plain . " We 'll follow those on horseback , " decided the Ranger at once . He could not have told why the urgent impulse was on him to do this , nor why he did not split his party and send part of his men in pursuit of the foot traveler . Later he laid it to what Jumbo would have called a hunch . He was puzzled by the direction the two riders were taking . It led neither to the A T O nor to Tascosa , and was making no account of the streams where the travelers would have to find water . They seemed to be plunging ignorantly into the desert , but since Gurley or Dinsmore was one of the two this could not be . Either of these men could have traveled the Panhandle blindfolded . They followed the tracks for hours . The line of travel was so direct that it told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing . Then , abruptly , the tracks pointed to the right , straight for the A T O. But not for long . At the summit of a little rise the riders had plainly stopped for a few moments , then had turned and galloped fast for the southwest . The lengthening tracks , the sharpness of them , the carelessness with which the riders took the rougher ground to follow a straight line , all suggested an urgent and imperative reason . That reason became plain to Roberts in another minute . A great number of tracks swept in from the left and blotted out those of the two flying riders . " Chiricahua Apaches , " grunted Guadaloupe . The scout had a feud with that branch of the tribe and was at war with them . " How many ? " questioned Jack . The Indian held up the fingers of both hands , closed them , opened them , and a third time shut and lifted the fingers . " Thirty ? " asked the Ranger . The Apache nodded . " Dinsmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilkins as they followed at a canter the plain trail marked for them . " I 'll bet he do n't throw down on himself none on that race either . He 's sure hell-bent on gettin ' there . " One of the riders called to the Rangers . " Look over to the left , Tex . We got company . " A little group of riders -- three , four , five of them -- emerged from behind a clump of Spanish bayonet and signaled with a bandana handkerchief . As they rode closer the heart of the Ranger died under his ribs . His stomach muscles tightened , and he felt a prickling of the skin run down his back . For Clint Wadley rode at the head of these men , and like a flash of lightning the truth had seared across the brain of Jack Roberts . His daughter was the woman riding to escape from the savages . The face of Wadley confirmed the guess of the Ranger . On the unshaven face of the cattleman dust was caked . His eyes were red and inflamed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expression of the man was that of one passing through the torments of hell . In five broken sentences he told his story . Quint Sullivan , escaping from his pursuers after a thirty-mile run , had reached the ranch in the middle of the night . Clint had gathered together such men as were at hand and started at once . At Crane Lake he had found no trace of her . He could not escape the conviction that the Apaches had captured Ramona and taken her with them . On this last point the Ranger offered him comfort , though it was sorry comfort at that . Five hours ago she was still safe , but in terrible danger . " Dinsmore 's a man -- none gamer in Texas , Mr. Wadley . He wo n't desert her , " said Jumbo . " You could n't ' a ' picked a better man to look out for her . " " How do you know it 's Dinsmore ? Perhaps it 's that yellow wolf Gurley , " answered the father out of his tortured heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , too , carried with him a private hell of fear in his heart , but he knew that the big cattleman was nearly insane with anxiety . " Because the man with Miss Ramona was takin ' her back to the ranch when they bumped into the ' Paches . You know Steve Gurley would never have taken her home in the world , " replied the Ranger . " What can one man do against thirty ? He 'll do what Quint here did -- run to save his own hide . " Young Sullivan winced . It was the truth . He had run and left the girl to the mercy of these devils . But his one chance of helping her had been to run . He tried to say as much . " I know that , Quint . I 'm not blamin ' you , " broke out the father in his agony . " But my little lamb -- in the hands of ' Paches -- God ! " Wadley covered his eyes with his hand and tried to press back from his brain the horrible visions he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bite yore teeth into this , Clint . She 's got ridin ' beside her as game a man as ever threw his leg over leather . He knows this country like you do yore ranch . He 'll hole up in Palo Duro where the ' Paches wo n't find ' em , an ' if the devils do he 'll sure stand ' em off till we blow in . " His friend on the other side of the cattleman backed him up strongly , but the heart of the Ranger was heavy with dread . CHAPTER XXXVIII DINSMORE TO THE RESCUE If ' Mona lives to be eighty the high-lights of that wild ride will never fade from her memory . The mesas rolled in long swells as far as the eye could see . Through the chaparral the galloping horses plunged while the prickly pear and the cholla clutched at their flanks and at the legs of the riders . Into water-gutted arroyos they descended , slid down breakneck shale ridges , climbed like heather cats the banks of dry washes , pounded over white porous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of her picking out the best way , now he was beside her with cool , easy words of confidence , now he rode between her and the naked Apaches , firing with deliberate and deadly accuracy . " Do n't look back , " he warned her more than once . " My job is to look out for them . Yours is to see yore horse do n't throw you or break a leg in a prairie-dog hole . They cay n't outrun us . Do n't worry about that . " The man was so easy in manner , apparently so equal to the occasion , that as the miles slid behind them her panic vanished . She felt for the small revolver in her belt to make sure it was safe . If she should be thrown , or if her horse should be shot , one thing must be done instantly . She must send a bullet crashing into her brain . To the right and to the left of her jets of dirt spat up where the shots of the Indians struck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of the bareback riders at their heels so unnerved her that she obeyed the orders of her companion and resisted the dreadful fascination of turning in her saddle . It had seemed to ' Mona at first with each backward glance that the Indians were gaining fast on them , but after a time she knew this was not true . The sound of their shots became fainter . She no longer saw the spitting of the dust from their bullets and guessed they must be falling short . Her eyes flashed a question at the man riding beside her . " We 're gaining ? " " That 's whatever . We 'll make the canon all right an ' keep goin ' . Do n't you be scared , " he told her cheerfully . Even as he spoke , Ramona went plunging over the head of her horse into a bunch of shin-oak . Up in an instant , she ran to remount . The bronco tried to rise from where it lay , but fell back helplessly to its side . One of its fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung round his horse and galloped back , disengaging one foot from the stirrup . The girl caught the hand he held down to her and leaped up beside the saddle , the arch of her foot resting lightly on the toe of his boot . Almost with the same motion she swung astride the cow-pony . It jumped to a gallop and Ramona clung to the waist of the man in front of her . She could hear plainly now the yells of the exultant savages . The outlaw knew that it would be nip and tuck to reach Palo Duro , close though it was . He abandoned at once his hopes of racing up the canon until the Apaches dropped the pursuit . It was now solely a question of speed . He must get into the gulch , even though he had to kill his bronco to do it . After that he must trust to luck and hold the redskins off as long as he could . There was always a chance that Ellison 's Rangers might be close . Homer Dinsmore knew how slender a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was the only one they had . His quirt rose and fell once , though he recognized that his horse was doing its best . But the lash fell in the air and did not burn the flank of the animal . He patted its neck . He murmured encouragement in its ear . " Good old Black Jack , I knew you would n't throw down on me . Keep a-humpin ' , old-timer .... You 're doin ' fine .... Here we are at Palo Duro .... Another half-mile , pal . " Dinsmore turned to the left after they had dropped down a shale slide into the canon . The trail wound through a thick growth of young foliage close to the bed of the stream . The man slipped down from the back of the laboring horse and followed it up the trail . Once he caught a glimpse of the savages coming down the shale slide and took a shot through the brush . " Got one of their horses , " he told ' Mona . " That 'll keep ' em for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll figure I 'll try to hold ' em here . " ' Mona let the horse pick its way up the rapidly ascending trail . Presently the canon opened a little . Its walls fell back from a small , grassy valley containing two or three acres . The trail led up a ledge of rock jutting out from one of the sheer faces of cliff . Presently it dipped down behind some great boulders that had fallen from above some time in the ages that this great cleft had been in the making . A voice hailed them . " That you , Homer ? " " Yep . The ' Paches are right on our heels , Steve . " Gurley let out a wailing oath . " Goddlemighty , man , why did you come here ? " " Driven in . They chased us ten miles . Better ' light , ma'am . We 're liable to stay here quite a spell . " Dinsmore unsaddled the horse and tied it to a shrub . " You 're sure all in , Black Jack . Mebbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got this to say , old pal . I never straddled a better hawss than you . That goes without copperin ' . " He patted its sweat-stained neck , fondled its nose for a moment , then turned briskly to the business in hand . " Get behind that p'int o ' rocks , Steve . I 'll cover the trail up . Girl , you 'll find a kind of cave under that flat boulder . You get in there an ' hunt cover . " ' Mona did as she was told . Inside the cave were blankets , a saddle , the remains of an old camp-fire , and a piece of jerked venison hanging from a peg driven between two rocks . There were , too , a rifle leaning against the big boulder and a canvas bag containing ammunition . The rifle was a ' 73 . She busied herself loading it . Just as she finished there came to her the crack of Dinsmore 's repeater . The outlaw gave a little whoop of exultation . " Tally one . " CHAPTER XXXIX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue party reached Palo Duro . The canon was at that time a terra incognita to these cattlemen of the Panhandle . To attempt to explore it in the darkness would be to court disaster . The Apaches might trap the whole party . But neither the Ranger nor Wadley could endure the thought of waiting till morning to push forward . The anxiety that weighed on them both could find relief only in action . Jack made a proposal to Ramona 's father . " We 've got to throw off and camp here . No two ways about that . But I 'm goin ' to ride forward to Palo Duro an ' see what I can find out . Want to go along ? " " Boy , I had in mind that very thing . We 'll leave Jumbo in charge of the camp with orders to get started soon as he can see in the mo'nin ' . " The two men rode into the darkness . They knew the general direction of Palo Duro and were both plainsmen enough to follow a straight course even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road gait , letting the horses pick their own way through the mesquite . Presently a star came out -- and another . Banked clouds scudded across the sky in squadrons . At last , below their feet , lay the great earth rift that made Palo Duro . It stretched before them an impenetrable black gulf of silence . " No use trying to go down at random , " said Jack , peering into its bottomless deeps . " Even if we did n't break our necks we 'd get lost down there . My notion is for me to follow the bank in one direction an ' for you to take the other . We might hear something . " " Sounds reasonable , " agreed Wadley . The cattleman turned to the left , the Ranger to the right . Roberts rode at a slow trot , stopping every few minutes to listen for any noise that might rise from the gulch . His mind was full of pictures of the girl , one following another inconsequently . They stabbed him poignantly . He had a white dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun sparkling in her soft , wavy hair . Another memory jumped to the fore of her on the stage , avoiding with shy distress the advances of the salesman he had jolted into his place . He saw her grave and gay , sweet and candid and sincere , but always just emerging with innocent radiance from the chrysalis of childhood . Her presence was so near , she was so intimately close , that more than once he pulled up under an impression that she was calling him . It was while he was waiting so , his weight resting easily in the saddle , that out of the night there came to him a faint , far-away cry of dreadful agony . The sound of it shook Jack to the soul . Cold beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead . Gooseflesh ran down his spine . His hand trembled . The heart inside his ribs was a heavy weight of ice . Though he had never heard it before , the Ranger knew that awful cry for the scream of a man in torment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinsmore had been captured by them the chances were that ' Mona had been taken , too , unless he had given her the horse and remained to hold the savages back . Roberts galloped wildly along the edge of the rift . Once again he heard that long-drawn wail of anguish and pulled up his horse to listen , the while he shook like a man with a heavy chill . Before the sound of it had died away a shot echoed up the canon to him . His heart seemed to give an answering lift of relief . Some one was still holding the Apaches at bay . He fired at once as a message that help was on the way . His trained ear told him that the rifle had been fired scarcely a hundred yards below him , apparently from some ledge of the cliff well up from the bottom of the gulch . It might have come from the defenders or it might have been a shot fired by an Apache . Jack determined to find out . He unfastened the tientos of his saddle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the cliff and to this he tied securely one end of the rope . Rifle in hand , he worked over the edge and lowered himself foot by foot . The rope spun round like a thing alive , bumped him against the rock wall , twisted in the other direction , and rubbed his face against the harsh stone . He had no assurance that the lariat would reach to the foot of the cliff , and as he went jerkily down , hand under hand , he knew that at any moment he might come to the end of it and be dashed against the boulders below . His foot touched loose rubble , and he could see that the face of the precipice was rooted here in a slope that led down steeply to another wall . The ledge was like a roof pitched at an extremely acute angle . He had to get down on hands and knees to keep from sliding to the edge of the second precipice . At every movement he started small avalanches of stone and dirt . He crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side . A shot rang out scarcely fifty yards from him , fired from the same ledge upon which he was crawling . Had that shot been fired by an Apache or by those whom he had come to aid ? CHAPTER XL GURLEY 'S GET-AWAY The boulder cave to which the Apaches had driven Dinsmore and Ramona had long since been picked out by the outlaws as a defensible position in case of need . The ledge that ran up to it on the right offered no cover for attackers . It was scarcely three feet wide , and above and below it the wall was for practical purposes perpendicular . In anticipation of a day when his gang might be rounded up by a posse , Pete Dinsmore had gone over the path and flung down into the gulch every bit of quartz big enough to shelter a man . The contour of the rock face back of the big boulders was concave , so that the defenders were protected from sharpshooters at the edge of the precipice above . Another way led up from the bed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb terminating in the loose rubble about the point where the ledge ran out . This Dinsmore had set Gurley to watch , but it was not likely that the Indians would reach here for several hours a point dangerous to the attacked . Of what happened that day Ramona saw little . She loaded rifles and pushed them out to Dinsmore from the safety of the cave . Once he had shouted out to her or to Gurley news of a second successful shot . " One more good Indian . Hi-yi-yi ! " The last was a taunt to the Apaches hidden below . There came a time late in the afternoon when the serious attack of the redskins developed . It came from the left , and it was soon plain that a number of Apaches had found cover in the rough boulder bed halfway up from the creek . Ramona took Dinsmore 's place as guard over the pathway while he moved across to help Gurley rout the sharpshooters slowly edging forward . One hour of sharp work did it . Man for man there never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting men . Dinsmore and Gurley , both good shots , better armed and better trained than the Apaches , drove the bucks back from the boulder bed where they were deployed . One certainly was killed , another probably . As quickly as they could with safety disengage themselves the braves drew down into the shelter of the brush below . But Dinsmore knew that the temporary victory achieved could not affect the end of this one-sided battle . The Apaches would wipe all three of them out -- unless by some miracle help reached them from outside . Ramona , too , knew it . So did Gurley . As the darkness fell the fingers of ' Mona crept often to the little revolver by her side . Sometime soon -- perhaps in three hours , perhaps in twelve , perhaps in twenty-four -- she must send a bullet into her brain . She decided quite calmly that she would do it at the last possible moment that would admit of certainty . She must not make any mistake , must not wait till it was too late . It would be a horrible thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the Apaches . Crouched behind his boulder in the darkness , Gurley too knew that the party was facing extinction . He could not save the others by staying . Was it possible to save himself by going ? He knew that rough climb down through the boulder beds to the canon below . The night was black as Egypt . Surely it would be possible , if he kept well to the left , to dodge any sentries the Indians might have set . He moistened his dry lips with his tongue . Furtively he glanced back toward the cave where the girl was hidden . She could not see him . Nor could Dinsmore . They would know nothing about it till long after he had gone . Their stupidity had brought the Apaches upon them . If they had taken his advice the savages would have missed them by ten miles . Why should he let their folly destroy him too ? If he escaped he might meet some freight outfit and send help to them . The man edged out from his rock , crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubble slide , wary and soft-footed as a panther . It took him a long half-hour to reach the boulder bed . Rifle in hand , he lowered himself from rock to rock , taking advantage of every shadow .... An hour later Dinsmore called to ' Mona . " Asleep , girl ? " " No , " she answered in a small voice . " Slip out with these cartridges to Steve and find out if anythin 's doin ' . Then you 'd better try to sleep . ' Paches do n't attack at night . " Ramona crept along the ledge back of the big boulders . Gurley had gone -- vanished completely . Her heart stood still . There was some vague thought in her mind that the Indians had somehow disposed of him . She called to Dinsmore in a little stifled shout that brought him on the run . " He 's gone ! " she gasped . The eyes of Dinsmore blazed . He knew exactly how to account for the absence of the man . " I might ' a ' known it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save his own hide ! " " Perhaps he 's gone for help , " the girl suggested faintly . " No chance . He 's playin ' a lone hand -- tryin ' for a get-away himself , " her companion said bitterly . " You 'll have to take his place here . If you see anything move , no matter what it is , shoot at it . " " If I call you will you come ? " she begged . " On the jump , " he promised . " Do n't go to sleep . If they should come it will be up through the boulder bed . I 'm leavin ' you here because you can watch from cover where you ca n't possibly be seen . It 's different on the other side . " She knew that , but as soon as he had left her the heart of the girl sank . She was alone , lost in a night of howling savages . The horrible things they did to their captives -- she recalled a story whispered to her by a girl friend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the middle of the night she had more than once found herself sitting bolt upright in bed , wakened from terrible dreams of herself as a prisoner of the Apaches . ' Mona prayed , and found some comfort in her prayers . They were the frank , selfish petitions of a little child . " God , do n't let me die . I 'm so young , and so frightened . Send Daddy to save me ... or Jack Roberts . " She recited the twenty-third Psalm aloud in a low voice . The fourth verse she went back to , repeating it several times . " ' Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil ; for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me . ' " And the last verse : " ' Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever . ' " Somehow she felt less lonely afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father or Jack Roberts . Then , into her newborn calm , there came a far cry of agony that shattered it instantly . Her taut nerves gave way like a broken bow-string . Her light body began to shake . She leaned against the cold rock wall in hysterical collapse . The voice of Dinsmore boomed along the passageway . " It 's a cougar , girl . They 've got a yell like the scream of lost souls . I 've often heard it here . " Ramona knew he was lying , but the sound of his cheerful voice was something . She was not utterly alone . Again that shriek lifted into the night and echoed up the canon . The girl covered her ears with her hands and trembled violently . A shot rang out from the other end of the passage . " Saw one of ' em movin ' down below , " the outlaw called to her . But Ramona did not hear him . She had fainted . CHAPTER XLI HOMING HEARTS Jack crept closer , very carefully . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not do to make a mistake . Lives were at stake -- one life much more precious than his own . He drew his revolver and snaked forward . There was nothing else to do but take a chance . But he meant at least to minimize it , and certainly not to let himself be captured alive . It was strange that nobody yet had challenged him . He was close enough now to peer into the darkness of the tunnel between the boulders and the wall . There seemed to be no one on guard . He crept forward to the last boulder , and his boot pressed against something soft lying on the ground . It moved . A white , startled face was lifted to his -- a face that held only the darkness of despair . He knelt , put down his revolver , and slipped an arm around the warm young body . " Thank God ! " he cried softly . He was trembling in every limb . Tears filled his voice . And over and over again he murmured , " Thank God ! ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly dissolved . He read there doubt , a growing certainty , and then a swift , soft radiance of joy and tears . " I prayed for you , and you 've come . God sent you to me . Oh , Jack , at last ! " Her arms crept round his neck . He held her close and kissed the sweet lips salt with tears of happiness . He was ashamed of himself . Not since he had been a little boy had he cried till now . His life had made for stoicism . But tears furrowed down his lean , brown cheeks . The streak in him that was still tender-hearted child had suddenly come to the surface . For he had expected to find her dead at best ; instead , her warm , soft body was in his arms , her eyes were telling him an unbelievable story that her tongue as yet could find no words to utter . There flamed in him , like fire in dead tumbleweeds , a surge of glad triumph that inexplicably blended with humble thankfulness . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tough as a hickory withe . She knew him hard as tempered steel to those whom he opposed , and her heart throbbed with excitement at his tears . She alone among all women could have touched him so . It came to her like a revelation that she need never have feared . He was her destined mate . Across that wide desert space empty of life he had come straight to her as to a magnet . And from that moment , all through the night , she never once thought of being afraid . Her man was beside her . He would let no harm come to her . Womanlike , she exulted in him . He was so lithe and brown and slender , so strong and clean , and in all the world there was nothing that he feared . With her hand in his she walked through the passage to where Dinsmore held watch . The outlaw turned and looked at the Ranger . If anybody had told him that a time would come when he would be glad to see Tex Roberts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a swift , curt answer ready . But at sight of him his heart leaped . No hint of this showed in his leathery face . " Earnin ' that dollar a day , are you ? " he jeered . " A dollar a day an ' grub , " corrected Jack , smiling . " Much of a posse with you ? " " Dropped in alone . My men are camped a few miles back . Mr. Wadley is with us . " " They got Gurley , I reckon . He tried to sneak away . " Dinsmore flashed a quick look toward Ramona and back at Jack . " Leastways I 'm not bettin ' on his chances . Likely one of the ' Paches shot him . " " Mebbeso . " The girl said nothing . She knew that neither of the men believed Gurley had been shot . Those horrible cries that had come out of the night had been wrung from him by past-masters in the business of torture . " You 'd better get back an ' hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He jerked his head toward ' Mona . " She 'll show you where . " Ramona sat beside her lover while he kept watch , her head against his shoulder , his arm around her waist . Beneath the stars that were beginning to prick through the sky they made their confessions of love to each other . She told him how she had tried to hate him because of her brother and could not , and he in turn told her how he had thought Arthur Ridley was her choice . " I did think so once -- before I knew you , " she admitted , soft eyes veiled beneath long lashes . " Then that day you fought with the bull to save me : I began to love you then . " They talked most of the night away , but in the hours toward morning he made her lie down and rest . She protested that she could n't sleep ; she would far rather sit beside him . But almost as soon as her head touched the saddle she was asleep . A little before dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft loveliness of curved cheek and flowing lines touched him profoundly . The spell of her innocence moved him to reverence . She was still a child , and she was giving her life into his keeping . The flush of sleep was still on her wrinkled cheek when she sat up at his touch . " The Apaches are climbing up the boulder field , " he explained . " I did n't want to waken you with a shot . " She stood before him in shy , sweet surrender , waiting for him to kiss her before he took his post . He did . " It 's goin ' to be all right , " he promised her . " We 'll drive ' em back an ' soon yore father will be here with the men . " " I 'm not afraid , " she said --  " not the least littlest bit . But you 're not to expose yourself . " " They ca n't hit a barn door -- never can . But I 'll take no chances , " he promised . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found cover behind quartz slabs which yielded them protection as good as that of the white man above . They took no chances , since there was plenty of time to get the imprisoned party without rushing the fort . Nobody knew they were here . Therefore nobody would come to their rescue . It was possible that they had food with them , but they could not have much water . In good time -- it might be one sleep , perhaps two , possibly three -- those on the ledge must surrender or die . So the Indians reasoned , and so the Ranger guessed that they would reason . Jack lay behind his rocks as patiently as the savages did . Every ten or fifteen minutes he fired a shot , not so much with the expectation of hitting one of the enemy as to notify his friends where he was . Above the canon wall opposite the sun crept up and poured a golden light into the misty shadows of the gulch . Its shaft stole farther down the hillside till it touched the yellowing foliage of the cottonwoods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drifted up yells and whoops . The Indians hidden in the rock slide began to appear , dodging swiftly down toward the trees . Jack let out the " Hi-yi-yi " of the line-rider and stepped out from the boulders to get a better shot . The naked Apaches , leaping like jack-rabbits , scurried for cover . Their retreat was cut off from the right , and they raced up the gorge to escape the galloping cowboys who swung round the bend . One of the red men , struck just as he was sliding from a flat rock , whirled , plunged down headfirst like a diver , and disappeared in the brush . Jack waited to see no more . He turned and walked back into the cave where his incomparable sweetheart was standing with her little fingers clasped tightly together . " It 's all over . The ' Paches are on the run , " he told her . She drew a deep , long breath and trembled into his arms . There Clint Wadley found her five minutes later . The cattleman brushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness . Jack waited to see no more , but joined Dinsmore outside . After a long time Wadley , his arm still around Ramona , joined them on the ledge . " Boys , I 'm no hand at talkin ' , " he said huskily . " I owe both of you a damned sight more than I can ever pay . I 'll talk with you later , Jack . What about you , Dinsmore ? You 're in one hell of a fix . I 'll get you out of it or go broke . " " What fix am I in ? " demanded the outlaw boldly . " They ai n't got a thing on me -- not a thing . Suspicions are n't proof . " The Ranger said nothing . He knew that the evidence he could give would hang Dinsmore before any Panhandle jury , and now his heart was wholly on the side of the ruffian who had saved the life of his sweetheart . None the less , it was his duty to take the man in charge and he meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case stick , Dinsmore . I sure hope so . Anyway , from now on I 'm with you at every turn of the road , " the cattleman promised . " Much obliged , " answered the outlaw with a lift of his lip that might have been either a smile or a sneer . " You 've been trailin ' with a bad outfit . You 're a sure-enough wolf , I 've heard tell . But you 're a man all the way , by gad . " " Did you figure I was yellow like Steve , Clint ? Mebbe I 'm a bad hombre all right . But you 've known me twenty years . What license have you ever had to think I 'd leave a kid like her for the ' Paches to play with ? " The hard eyes of the outlaw challenged a refutation of his claim . " None in the world , Homer . You 're game . Nobody ever denied you guts . An ' you 're a better man than I thought you were . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his stained teeth showed in a sardonic grin . " I 've got a white black heart , " he jeered . CHAPTER XLII A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION Rescued and rescuers rode out of the canon as soon as the Apaches had been driven away . Nobody suggested that the Indians who had been killed in the surprise attack be buried . The bodies were left lying where they had fallen . For in those days no frontiersman ever buried a dead redskin . If the body happened to be inconveniently near a house , a mounted cowboy roped one foot and dragged it to a distance . Those were the years when all settlers agreed that the only good Indian was a dead Indian . The Indian wars are over now , and a new generation can safely hold a more humane view ; but old-timers in the Panhandle will tell you to-day that the saying was literally true . The little group of riders drew out of the gorge and climbed the shale slide to the plain above . Roberts rode knee to knee with Dinsmore . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man between them still carried his rifle and his revolver , but he understood without being told that he was a prisoner . Wadley dropped back from his place beside Ramona and ranged up beside the officer . " What are you aimin ' to do with him , Jack ? " he asked in a low voice . " I 'm goin ' to turn him over to Cap Ellison . " The cattleman pondered that awhile before he continued . " ' Mona has been tellin ' me about you an ' her , Jack . I ai n't got a word to say -- not a word . If you 're the man she wants , you 're sure the man she 'll get . But I want to tell you that you 're a lucky young scamp . You do n't deserve her . I 've got to see the man yet that does . " " We 're not goin ' to quarrel about that , Mr. Wadley , " agreed Jack . " I 'm nothin ' but a rough cowboy , an ' she 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sees in me . " " H 'm ! " grunted the owner of the A T O , and looked at the lithe , brown , young fellow , supple as a whip and strong as tested steel . It was not hard to understand what a girl saw in him . " Glad you got sense enough to know that . " " I 'm not a plumb fool , you know . " Clint changed the subject apparently . " Boy , I 've been in hell ever since Sullivan rode in with the bad news . My God ! how I suffered till I saw my little trick standing there alive and well . " The Ranger nodded . He thought he knew what Wadley was driving toward . But he was resolved to give him no help . He must make his own plea . " You helped save her , Jack . That 's all right . I reckon you care for her too . Any man would ' a ' done what you did . But Dinsmore , he did a whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape from you , he turned round an ' started to bring her back to the ranch . Steve Gurley , he said to take ' Mona along with ' em to the canon . You know what that hellhound meant . But Dinsmore would n't stand for that . He said she was entitled to be took home . Well , you know how the ' Paches cut ' em off . " " Yes . That 's how we figured it out , " said Roberts . " Her hawss stepped into a prairie-dog hole an ' broke its leg . Dinsmore stopped an ' swung her up behind him , the ' Paches gainin ' every jump of the road . Oncet they reached Palo Duro he stood off the devils till she reached the ledge . Jack , we 're lucky that a man like Homer Dinsmore was beside her yesterday , do n't you reckon ? " " I reckon . " Tiny beads of sweat stood on the forehead of the boy . He knew now what was coming . " Good enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinsmore in to be hanged . That would n't be human , would it ? " The roof of the Ranger 's mouth was dry . He looked away across the rolling waves of prairie while the cattleman waited for his answer . Every impulse of desire in him leaned toward the argument Wadley was making . His love for Ramona , his gratitude to Dinsmore , his keen desire to meet halfway the man who was to be his father-in-law and had accepted the prospect so generously , his boyish admiration for the thing that the outlaw had done , all tugged mightily at him . " An ' look a-here , " went on the cattleman , " you got to keep in mind that you never would ' a ' got Dinsmore this trip in kingdom come if he had n't stopped to save ' Mona . He 'd ' a ' kep ' right up the canon till he was sure enough lost . It would be a damned mean trick for you to take a man in to be hanged because he had risked his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You make me feel like a yellow hound , Mr. Wadley , " admitted Roberts . " But what am I to do ? When I joined the Rangers I swore to enforce the law . You know how it is in the force . We 've got no friends when we 're sent out to get a man . I 'd bring in my own brother if he was wanted . That 's why the Texas Rangers stack up so high . They play no favorites an ' they let no prisoners escape . You 're askin ' me to throw down Cap Ellison who trusts me , the State that pays me , the boys on the force that pal with me , an ' my loyalty to the people . You want me to do it because I 've got a personal reason to wish Dinsmore to get away . If I do n't take him in to town I 'm a traitor . That 's the long an ' the short of it . " " Hell 's blazes ! " broke in the cattleman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine . You want to marry my li'l ' girl , but you 're not willin ' to do a favor to the man who has just saved her from a hundred horrible deaths . Have n't you any guts in you a-tall ? " The muscles stood out on the lean , set face of the Ranger like rawhide ropes . " I ca n't lie down on my job . Ramona would n't ask it of me . I 've got to go through . That 's what I 'm paid for . " " She 's askin ' it right now . Through me . " " Then she does n't understand what she 's askin ' . Let me talk with her . Let me explain --  " " We do n't want any of yore damned explanations , " interrupted Wadley roughly . " Talk turkey . Will you or wo n't you ? Me , I ai n't plumb crazy about law . It 's justice I want done . I 'll be doggoned if I 'm goin ' to stand by an ' let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord . " " I 'll do all I can for him --  " " Except that you 're bound an ' determined to see him hanged . You sure beat my time . I 'd think you would be right anxious to tell him to cut his stick -- kinda slide out inconspicuous when we ai n't watchin ' . Be reasonable , Roberts . That 's all I ask . I want to be yore friend if you 'll let me . My bank 's behind you to back any business proposition you want to start . Or that job I offered you before is open to you . After a little we can fix up some kind of a partnership . " The dark color burned under the tan of the Ranger 's face . His lips were like a steel trap , and in his eyes there was a cold glitter . " It does n't get you anywhere to talk that-a-way to me , Mr. Wadley . I 'd want to marry Miss Ramona just the same if she was the poorest girl in the Panhandle . Offer me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't make any difference to me . I 'm not goin ' to turn Dinsmore loose because it 's to my advantage . " " Do n't get on the prod , young fellow . I was n't tryin ' to bribe you . I was showin ' you how I felt . But you 're so damned high-headed a plain man ca n't talk sense to you . " The impulsive anger of the old Texan suddenly ripped out . " Hell , I 'm not goin ' to beg you to do what yore own decency ought to tell you right away . But I 'll say this right off the reel : neither ' Mona nor I want to have a thing to do with a man who 's so selfish he ca n't yield the first favor she ever asked of him . We 're through with you . " The two men had fallen back of the others and were riding alone . Now the young Texan looked hard at the old-timer . The eyes of neither of them gave way even for a beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Ramona say that before it goes with me , " answered Roberts steadily . " All right . You can hear it right this minute . " The cattleman touched his horse with the spur and cantered forward . The Ranger was with him when they drew up beside Ramona . The smile in the eyes of the girl died away as she looked first at one and then at the other of them . She was sensitive to atmospheres , and if she had not been the harsh surface of both of them would have been evidence enough of a clash . " Ramona , " began her father , " this fellow here is a Ranger first an ' a human bein ' afterward . He 's hell-bent on takin ' Dinsmore to prison so as to make a big name for himself . I 've told him how we feel , an ' he says that does n't make any difference a-tall , that Dinsmore 's got to hang . " " That is n't what I meant a-tall , " explained Jack . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give an arm to turn him loose . But I ca n't . It would n't be right . " The soft eyes of the girl pleaded with her lover . " I think we ought to free him , Jack . He saved my life . He fought for me . Nobody could have done more for me . He ... he was so good to me . " Her voice broke on the last sentence . The young man swallowed a lump in his throat . " I wish I could . But do n't you see I ca n't ? I 'm not Jack Roberts , the man who ... who cares for you . I 'm an officer of the State sent out to bring in this man wanted for a crime . I 've got to take him in . " " But he saved my life , " she said gently , puzzled at his queer point of view . " He stayed with me when he could easily have escaped . You would n't ... take advantage of that , Jack ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to clear him , ' Mona . I 'll fight for him to a finish . But I 've got to take him to town an ' put him in jail . If I do n't I ca n't ever hold up my head again , " he told her desperately . " I thought you loved me , Jack , " she murmured , through gathering tears . " What kind of a man would I be for you to marry if I threw down on what was right just because you asked me to an ' I wanted to do it ? " he demanded . " He 's got his neck bowed , ' Mona . I told him how we felt , but he would n't believe me . I reckon he knows now , " her father said . " You 're not goin ' to throw me over because I 've got to do what I think right , ' Mona ? " asked Jack miserably . " I ... I 'm not throwing you over . It 's you . You 're throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to help Mr. Dinsmore because he did so much for me ? " " Certainly I see that . I 'll resign from the Rangers , and then we 'll all pull together for him , ' Mona . " " After you 've pulled on the rope that hangs him , " added Clint angrily . " Nothin ' to that , ' Mona . He 's for us or he 's against us . Let him say which right now . " The girl nodded , white to the lips . " Do you mean that you 'll give me up unless I let Dinsmore escape before we reach town ? " asked the young man . " I ... I 've got to save him as he did me . If you wo n't help , it 's because you do n't love me enough , " she faltered . " I ca n't , " the boy cried . " ' Nough said , " cut in Wadley . " You 've got yore answer , ' Mona , an ' he 's got his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored straight into those of his sweetheart . " Have I ? " he asked of her . The girl nodded and turned her head away with a weak , little gesture of despair . Her heart was bleeding woe . The Ranger wheeled on his horse and galloped back to his place beside Dinsmore . CHAPTER XLIII TEX RESIGNS Jack Roberts , spurs jingling , walked into the office of his chief . Ellison looked up , leaned back in his chair , and tugged at his goatee . " Well , Tex , you sure were thorough . Four men in the Dinsmore outfit , an ' inside o ' two days three of ' em dead an ' the fourth a prisoner . You hit quite a gait , son . " " I 've come to resign , " announced the younger man . " Well , I kinda thought you 'd be resignin ' about now , " said the Captain with a smile . " Weddin ' bells liable to ring right soon , I reckon . " " Not mine , " replied Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older man knew that the subject had been closed . " Goin ' to take that job Clint offered you ? " " No . " Jack snapped out the negative curtly , explosively . Another topic closed . " Just quittin ' . No reasons to offer , son ? " " Reasons a-plenty . I 've had man-huntin ' enough to last me a lifetime . I 'm goin ' to try law-breakin ' awhile for a change . " " Meanin ' ? " " You can guess what I mean , Captain , an ' if you 're lucky you 'll guess right . Point is , I 'm leavin ' the force to-day . " " Kinda sudden , ai n't it , Tex ? " " At six o'clock to-night . Make a note of the time , Captain . After that I 'm playin ' my own hand . Understand ? " " I understand you 're sore as a thumb with a bone felon . Take yore time , son . Do n't go off half-cocked . " The little Captain rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I reckon things have got in a sort of kink for you . Give ' em time to unravel , Tex . " The eyes of the Ranger softened . " I 've got nothin ' against you , Captain . You 're all there . We wo n't go into any whyfors , but just let it go as it stands . I want to quit my job -- right away . This round-up of the Dinsmores about cleans the Panhandle anyhow . " " You 're the doctor , Tex . But why not take yore time ? It costs nothin ' Tex to wait a day or two an ' look around you first . " " I 've got business -- to-night . I 'd rather quit when I said . " " What business ? " asked Ellison bluntly . " You mentioned law-breakin ' . Aimin ' to shoot up the town , are you ? " " At six to-night , Captain , my resignation takes effect . " The little man shrugged . " I hear you , Jack . You go off the pay-roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're goin ' to pull off some fool business . Do n't run on the rope too far , Jack . Everybody that breaks the law looks alike to my boys , son . " " I 'll remember . " " Good luck to you . " Ellison offered his hand . Roberts wrung it . " Same to you , Cap . So long . " The young man walked downtown , ate his dinner at the hotel , and from there strolled down to the largest general store in town . Here he bought supplies enough to last for a week -- flour , bacon , salt , sugar , tobacco , and shells for rifle and revolvers . These he carried to his room , where he lay down on the bed and read a month-old Trinidad paper . Presently the paper sagged . He began to nod , fell asleep . When he opened his eyes again it was late in the afternoon . His watch told him that it was just six o'clock . He got up , took off the buckskin suit that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeans and chaps he had worn as a line-rider . " Good-bye , Mr. Ranger , " he told himself . " I reckon you ca n't have much worse luck as a citizen than as an officer . " He buckled round his waist the belt that held his revolvers , and from the corner of the room where it stood took his rifle . Carrying the supplies he had that afternoon bought , he directed his steps to the Elephant Corral and saddled his horse . With motions of deft economy he packed the provisions for travel , then swung to the saddle and cantered down the street . At the post-office corner he swung to the left for a block and dismounted in front of a rather large dugout . A wrinkled little man with a puzzled , lost-puppy look on his face sat on a bench in front mending a set of broken harness . " ' Lo , Tex . How they comin ' ? " he asked . " ' Lo , Yorky . Hope I see you well , " drawled the horseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . He was swinging his lariat carelessly as cowboys do . " Jes ' tol'able . I got a misery in my left shoulder I 'm a-goin ' to try some yerbs I done had recommended . " Yorky was the kind of simple soul who always told you just how he was when you asked him . Roberts passed him and led the way into the house . " Come inside , Yorky , I want to talk with you , " he said . The room into which the cowboy had passed was a harness shop . It was littered with saddles and bridles and broken bits of traces . A workman 's bench and tools were in one corner of the shop . A door , bolted and padlocked , led to a rear room . Jack put down his rifle and his belt on a shelf and sat down on the bench . " Yore prisoner 's in there all right , " said the saddler with a jerk of his thumb over his left shoulder . Since no one else in town would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not like the job , but it gave him an official importance that flattered his vanity . " He 's not my prisoner any more , Yorky . He 's yours . I quit being a Ranger just twenty-five minutes ago . " " You do n't say ! Well , I reckon you done wise . A likely young fellow --  " " Where 's yore six-shooter ? " demanded Jack . Yorky was a trifle surprised . " You 're sittin ' on it , " he said , indicating the work bench . Roberts got up and stood aside . " Get it . " The lank jaw of the jailer hung dolefully . He rubbed its bristles with a hand very unsure of itself . " Now , you look a-hyer , Tex . I 'm jailer , I am . I do n't allow to go with you to bring in no bad-man . Nothin ' of that sort . It ai n't in the contract . " " I 'm not askin ' it . Get yore gat . " The little saddler got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean young man reseated himself on the bench . " I 've come here to get yore prisoner , " he explained . " Sure , " brightened the jailer . " Wait till I get my keys . " He put the revolver down on the table and moved toward the nail on which hung two large keys . " I 'm just through tellin ' you that I 'm no longer a Ranger , but only a private citizen . " Yorky was perplexed . He felt he was not getting the drift of this conversation . " Well , an ' I done said , fine , a young up ' n ' comin ' fellow like you --  " " You 've got no business to turn yore prisoner over to me , Yorky . I 'm not an officer . " " Oh , tha 's all right . Anything you say , Tex . " " I 'm goin ' to give him my horse an ' my guns an ' tell him to hit the trail . " The puzzled lost-dog look was uppermost on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his depth . But of course Jack Roberts , the best Ranger in the Panhandle , must know what he was about . " Suits me if it does you , Tex , " the saddler chirped . " No , sir . You 've got to make a fight to hold Dinsmore . He 's wanted for murder an ' attempted robbery . You 're here to see he does n't get away . " " Make a fight ! You mean ... fight you ? " " That 's just what I mean . I 'm out of reach of my gats . Unhook yore gun if I make a move toward you . " Yorky scratched his bewildered head . This certainly did beat the Dutch . He looked helplessly at this brown , lithe youth with the well-packed muscles . " I 'll be doggoned if I know what 's eatin ' you , Tex . I ai n't a-goin ' to fight you none a-tall . " " You bet you are ! I 've warned you because I do n't want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run of the place . But you 're jailer here . You 've got to fight -- or have everybody in town say you 're yellow . " A dull red burned into the cheeks of the little man . " I do n't aim for to let no man say that , Tex . " " That 's the way to talk , Yorky . I 've got no more right to take Dinsmore away than any other man . " Jack was playing with his lariat . He had made a small loop at one end and with it was swinging graceful ellipses in the air . " Do n't you let me do it . " Yorky was nervous , but decided . " I ai n't a-goin ' to , " he said , and the revolver came to a businesslike position , its nose pointed straight for Roberts . The gyrations of the rope became more active and the figures it formed more complex . " Quit yore foolin ' , Tex , an ' get down to cases . Dad-gum yore hide , a fellow never can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward over the revolver and settled on the wrist of the jailer . It tightened , quicker than the eye could follow . Jack jerked the lariat sideways and plunged forward . A bullet crashed into the wall of the dugout . The cowboy 's shoulder pinned the little man against the bolted door . One hand gave a quick wrench to the wrist of the right arm and the revolver clattered to the puncheon floor . The two hands of the jailer , under pressure , came together . Round them the rope wound swiftly . " I 've got you , Yorky . No use strugglin ' . I do n't want to start that misery in yore shoulder , " warned Jack . The little saddler , tears of mortification in his eyes , relaxed from his useless efforts . Jack had no intention of humiliating him and he proceeded casually to restore his self-respect . " You made a good fight , Yorky ,  - -  a blamed good fight . I won out by a trick , or I never could ' a ' done it . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick on you . Homer Dinsmore saved Miss Wadley from the ' Paches . He treated her like a white man an ' risked his life for her . She 's my friend . Do you reckon I 'd ought to let him hang ? " " Why n't you tell me all that ? " complained the manhandled jailer . " Because you 're such a tender-hearted old geezer , Yorky . Like as not you would ' a ' thrown open the door an ' told me to take him . You had to make a fight to keep him so they could n't say you were in cahoots with me . I 'm goin ' to jail for this an ' I do n't want comp'ny . " Jack trussed up his friend comfortably with the slack of the rope so that he could move neither hands nor feet . From the nail upon which the two keys hung the jail-breaker selected one . He shot back the bolts of the inner door and turned the key . CHAPTER XLIV DINSMORE GIVES INFORMATION The inner room was dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes accustomed themselves to the gloom . A voice growled a question at him . " What do you want now , Mr. Grandstander ? " " I want you . " " What for ? " " You 'll find out presently . Come along . " For a moment Dinsmore did not move . Then he slouched forward . He noticed that the Ranger was not armed . Another surprise met him when he stepped into the outer room . The jailer lay on the floor bound . The outlaw looked quickly at Roberts , a question in his eyes . Jack unlocked his handcuffs . They had been left on him because the jail was so flimsy . " My rifle an ' six-shooters are on the shelf there , Dinsmore . A horse packed with grub is waitin ' outside for you . Make for the short-grass country an ' cross the line about Deaf Smith County to the Staked Plains . I reckon you 'll find friends on the Pecos . " " Yes ? " asked Dinsmore , halfway between insolence and incredulity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it if you do n't want to . " " Oh , it listens good to me . I 'll take it all right , Mr. Ranger . There are parties in Mexico that can use me right now at a big figure . The Lincoln County War is still goin ' good . " The bad-man challenged Roberts with bold eyes . " But what I 'm wonderin ' is how much Clint Wadley paid you to throw down Cap Ellison . " The anger burned in Jack 's face . " Damn you , Dinsmore , I might ' a ' known you 'd think somethin ' like that . I 'll tell you this . I quit bein ' a Ranger at six o'clock this evenin ' , an ' I have n't seen or heard from Wadley since I quarreled with him about you . " " So you 're turnin ' me loose because you 're so fond of me . Is that it ? " sneered the outlaw . " I 'll tell you just why I 'm turnin ' you loose , Dinsmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life you were a white man . When I was sleepin ' on yore trail you turned to take Miss Wadley back to the A T O. When the ' Paches were burnin ' the wind after you an ' her , you turned to pick her up after she had fallen . When you might have lit out up the canon an ' left her alone , you stayed to almost certain death . You were there all the time to a fare-you-well . From that one good day that may take you to heaven yet , I dragged you in here with a rope around yore neck . I had to do it , because I was a Ranger . But Wadley was right when he said it was n't human . I 'm a private citizen now , an ' I 'm makin ' that wrong right . " " You 'd ought to go to Congress . You got the gift , " said Dinsmore with dry irony . Five minutes earlier he had been , as Roberts said , a man with a rope around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him over which to roam . He was touched , felt even a sneaking gratitude to this young fellow who was laying up trouble for himself on his account ; and he was ashamed of his own emotion . " I 'll go to jail ; that 's where I 'll go , " answered Jack grimly . " But that 's not the point . " " I 'll say one thing , Roberts . I did n't kill Hank . One of the other boys did . It ca n't do him any harm to say so now , " muttered Dinsmore awkwardly . " I know . Overstreet shot him . " " That was just luck . It might have been me . " Jack looked straight and hard at him . " Will you answer me one question ? Who killed Rutherford Wadley ? " " Why should I ? " demanded the bad-man , his eyes as hard and steady as those of the other man . " Because an innocent man is under a cloud . You know Tony did n't kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinsmore . " " As a favor to you , because of what you 're doin ' for me ? " " I 'm not doin ' this for you , but to satisfy myself . But if you want to put it that way --  " " Steve Gurley shot Ford because he could n't be trusted . The kid talked about betrayin ' us to Ellison . If Steve had n't shot him I would have done it . " " But not in the back , " said Jack . " No need o ' that . I could ' a ' gunned him any time in a fair fight . We followed him , an ' before I could stop him Gurley fired . " The line-rider turned to the jailer . " You heard what he said , Yorky . " " I ai n't deef , " replied the little saddler with sulky dignity . His shoulder was aching and he felt very much outraged . " Ford Wadley was a bad egg if you want to know . He deserved just what he got , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about that . Yore horse is waitin ' , Dinsmore . Some one might come along an ' ask inconvenient whyfors . Better be movin ' along . " Dinsmore buckled the belt round his waist and picked up the rifle . " Happy days , " he said , nodding toward Jack , then turned and slouched out of the door . A moment , and there came the swift clatter of hoofs . CHAPTER XLV RAMONA DESERTS HER FATHER Arthur Ridley , seated on the porch between Clint Wadley and Ramona , was annoying one and making himself popular with the other . For he was maintaining , very quietly but very steadily , that Jack Roberts had been wholly right in refusing to release Dinsmore . " Just as soon as you lads get to be Rangers you go crazy with the heat , " said the cattleman irritably . " Me , I do n't go down on my ham bones for the letter of the law . Justice ! That 's what I aim for to do . I do n't say you boys have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you get him . That 's yore duty . But out here in Texas we 'd ought to do things high , wide , an ' handsome . Roberts , by my way of it , should have shook Homer 's hand . ' Fine ! You saved ' Mona 's life . Light a shuck into a chaparral pronto . In twelve hours I 'm goin ' to hit the trail after you again . ' That 's what he had ought to have said . " " You 're asking him to be generous at the expense of the State , Mr. Wadley . Jack could n't do that . Dinsmore 's liberty was n't a gift of his to give . He was hired by the State -- sent out to bring in that particular man . He had n't any choice but to do it , " insisted Arthur . Ramona sat in the shadow of the honeysuckle vines . She did not say anything and Ridley could not see her face well . He did not know how grateful she was for his championship of his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly because of it . She wanted to feel that she and her father were wrong and had done an injustice to the man she loved . Captain Ellison came down the walk , his spurs jingling . In spite of his years the little officer carried himself jauntily , his wide hat tilted at a rakish angle . Just now he was worried . As soon as he knew the subject of conversation , he plunged in , a hot partisan , eager for battle . Inside of two minutes he and Wadley were engaged in one of their periodical semi-quarrels . " You 're wrong , Clint , " the Captain announced dogmatically . " You 're wrong , like you ' most always are . You 're that bullheaded you cay n't see it . But I 'm surprised at you , ' Mona . If Jack had been a private citizen , you would n't needed to ask him to turn loose Dinsmore . But he was n't . That 's the stuff my Rangers are made of . They play the hand out . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Jim . You drill these boys of yours till they ai n't hardly human . I 'm for law an ' order . You know that . But I do n't go out of my head about them the way you do . ' Mona an ' I have got some sense . We 're reasonable human bein 's . " To demonstrate his possession of this last quality Clint brought his fist down on the arm of the chair so hard that it cracked . From out of the darkness Ramona made her contribution in a voice not quite steady . " We 're wrong , Dad . We 've been wrong all the time . I did n't see it just at first , and then I did n't want to admit it even to myself . But I 'm glad now we are . " She turned to Captain Ellison a little tremulously . " Will you tell him , Uncle Jim , that I want to see him ? " " You 're a little gentleman , ' Mona . I always said you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll tell him when I see him . No tellin ' when that 'll be . Jack resigned to-day . He 's got some fool notion in his head . I 'm kinda worried about him . " The girl 's heart fluttered . " Worried ? What ... what do you think he 's going to do ? " The Captain shook his head . " Cay n't tell you , because I do n't know . But he 's up to somethin ' . He acted kinda hard an ' bitter . " A barefooted negro boy called in from the gate . " Cap'n Ellison there , sah ? " He brought a note in and handed it to the officer of Rangers . The Captain ripped open the envelope and handed the sheet inside to Ramona . " Run along in an ' read it for me , honey . It 's too dark to see here . " The girl ran into the house and lit a lamp . The color washed out of her face as she read the note . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I held up Yorky , took his keys , and freed Dinsmore . JACK ROBERTS Then , in jubilant waves , the blood beat back into her arteries . That was why he had resigned , to pay the debt he owed Homer Dinsmore on her account . He had put himself within reach of the law for her sake . Her heart went out to him in a rush . She must see him . She must see him at once . From the parlor she called to Captain Ellison . " You 'd better come in and read the note yourself , Uncle Jim . It 's important . " It was so important to her that before the Captain of Rangers was inside the house , she was out the back door running toward the hotel as fast as her lithe limbs could carry her . She wanted to see Jack before his chief did , to ask his forgiveness for having failed him at the first call that came upon her faith . She caught up with the colored boy as he went whistling up the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel while she waited in the darkness beside the post-office . To her there presently came Roberts . He hesitated a moment in front of the store and peered into the shadows . She had not sent her name , and it was possible that enemies had decoyed him there . " Jack , " she called in a voice that was almost a whisper . In half a dozen long strides he was beside her . She wasted no time in preliminaries . " We were wrong , Dad and I. I told Uncle Jim to tell you to come to me ... and then your note to him came . Jack , do you ... still like me ? " He answered her as lovers have from the beginning of time -- with kisses , with little joyous exclamations , with eyes that told more than words . He took her into his arms hungrily in an embrace of fire and passion . She wept happily , and he wiped away her tears . They forgot time in eternity , till Ellison brought them back to earth . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed they heard him sputtering . " Why did he send for me , then , if he meant to light out ? What in Sam Hill --  ? " Jack discovered himself to the Captain , and incidentally his sweetheart . " Well , I 'll be doggoned ! " exclaimed Ellison . " You youngsters sure beat my time . How did you get here , ' Mona ? " Clint made prompt apologies . " I was wrong , boy . I 'd ought to know it by this time , for they 've all been dinnin ' it at me . Shake , an ' let 's make a new start . " In words it was not much , but Jack knew by the way he said it that the cattleman meant a good deal more than he said . He shook hands gladly . " Looks to me like Jack would make that new start in jail , " snapped the Captain . " I do n't expect he can go around jail-breaking with my prisoners an ' get away with it . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried ' Mona quickly . " H'mp ! " The Ranger Captain softened . " It would n't be a prison if you were there , honey . " Jack slipped his hand over hers in the semi-darkness . " You 're whistlin ' , Captain . " " I reckon you ' n ' me will take a trip down to Austin to see the Governor , Jim , " Wadley said . " Do n't you worry any about that prison , ' Mona . " The girl looked up into the eyes of her lover . " We 're not worrying any , Dad , " she answered , smiling . CHAPTER XLVI LOOSE THREADS The Governor had been himself a cattleman . Before that he had known Ellison and Wadley during the war . Therefore he lent a friendly ear to the tale told him by his old-time friends . Clint did most of the talking , one leg thrown across the arm of a leather-bound chair in the library of the Governor 's house . The three men were smoking . A mint julep was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in the telling . Both of the Panhandle men were now partisans of his , and when the owner of the A T O missed a point the hawk-eyed little Captain was there to stress it . " That 's all right , boys , " the Governor at last broke in . " I do n't doubt he 's all you say he is , but I do n't see that I can do anything for him . If he 's in trouble because he deliberately helped a murderer to escape --  " " You do n't need to do a thing , Bob , " interrupted Wadley . " That 's just the point . He 's in no trouble unless you make it for him . All you 've got to do is shut yore eyes . I spent three hours with a pick makin ' a hole in the jail wall so as it would look like the prisoner escaped . I did a real thorough job . Yorky , the jailer , wo n't talk . We got that all fixed . There 'll be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What was the use of comin ' to me at all , then ? Why did n't you boys keep this under your hats ? " the Governor asked . Wadley grinned . " Because of Jim 's conscience . You see , Bob , he fills his boys up with talk about how the Texas Rangers are the best police force in the world . That morale stuff ! Go through an ' do yore duty . Play no favorites an ' have no friends when you 're on the trail of a criminal . Well , he cay n't ignore what young Roberts has done . So he passes the buck to you . " The Governor nodded appreciation of Ellison 's difficulty . " All right , Jim . You 've done your duty in reporting it . Now I 'll forget all about it . You boys go home and marry those young people soon as they 're ready . " The Panhandle cattleman gave a whoop . " That 'll be soon as I can draw up partnership papers for me ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mona. " * * * * * They were married at Clarendon . All the important people of the Panhandle attended the wedding , and it was generally agreed that no better-looking couple ever faced the firing line of a marriage ceremony . There was a difference of opinion as to whether the ex-line-rider deserved his good luck . Jumbo Wilkins was one of those who argued mightily that there was no luck about it . " That doggoned Tex wore his bronc to a shadow waitin ' on Miss ' Mona an ' rescuin ' her from trouble . She plumb had to marry him to git rid of him , " he explained . " I never saw the beat of that boy 's gall . Six months ago he was ridin ' the line with me . Now he 's the segundo of the whole outfit an ' has married the daughter of the boss to boot . " Jumbo was on hand with a sack of rice and an old shoe when the bride and groom climbed into the buckboard to drive to the ranch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses broke into a run : " Oh , you Tex ! Let ' em go , son ! " THE END
