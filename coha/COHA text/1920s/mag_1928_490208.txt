THIS is the neap-tide of the year , when the town is trying to effect a transition from the gridiron to the Yule log , and department stores do n't know whether to display a Princeton banner or a sprig of artificial holly . In their confused state , they display both . We saw our first artificial holly this week and were taken with our annual fit of cramps . Real holly to us means South Carolina  --  which is the state where we happened first to see it growing ; artificial holly , with its durable shine , somehow means nothing so much as a box of handkerchiefs tied up in tissue paper . Last year we made an extensive tour of Fifth Avenue to see which of our merchants had spirit and money enough to display the real article : if our memory is good , Cartier was the outstanding hero . Perhaps we are a little fanatical about this important matter  --  hut the fact is we find more Christmas spirit in a Tiffany bronze than in a sprig of artificial holly . IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town really do much to keep our heart up . They and the advertising writers . A week ago on a gray day we were walking , chilly and lunch ' , down a side street when a haberdasher 's sign stopped us in our tracks . There was a Manhattan shirt in the window and the sign said : " Test Your Shirt IVith Travel . " Not twenty-four hours later we were sunning ourself in Pinehurst , testing and testing our fine new poplin with collar attached . AN insurance man whose office ffi used to be in the vicinity of Madison Square recently moved to Fortyseventh Street . He was telling us that , during the first week in the new location , he greatly missed the Square , where it had been his wont to sit for half an hour every day after lunch smoking quietly and enjoying the air . For a week this great void in his life troubled him ; and then , he told us , he solved the thing quite easily . Now , when he 's through eating , he simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he can smoke for half an hour in the sunlight the same as always . He says he 's never had to walk back more than three blocks . FOR all its ruddy merits , health , it seems to us , can be carried to ridiculous extremes . A great craze for living in unheated houses has got hold of some of our best citizens , and as a result several of the better furnaces in town are not lit yet . We visited a healthy matron recently for dinner , and found her huddled around a wood fire with her two little Eskimos by her side . She explained that it was good to go along without a furnace fire , because it made the children less susceptible to colds . From that , the conversation turned to Byrd . All in all it was a miserable evening , and we left early , coughing and sneezing , to go directly to a Turkish bath . THE new era of Hoover prosperity was hardly a fortnight old when we received in the mail a brochure from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 417 , " in walnut , satinwood , and huhinga . From the illustration we took it that the cabinet was to hold liquor , for it was full of c-ck-a-1 sh-k-rs , w-ne gl-s-es , and b-t-les for wh-s-ey . The pamphlet explained that thirty-five years of unfaltering devotion to the highest ideals had placed the manufacturer in a position of leadership among makers of classical furniture . " Unsuspected secret compartment for bottles , so located and arranged as to he in itself an amusing and withal an interesting surprise to the hopeful guest ; the catch which controls the secret panel is sprung by the touch of a finger . " Here at last we had a clue to what Mr. Hoover meant in that memorable address  --  way hack in Indian summer  --  when he referred to a " noble experiment : " he must have meant pushing the secret button of a h-sp-t-l-ty c-h-n-t . Mezzotint IT was early afternoon . The galleries of a Fifth Avenue art shop were bathed in peace and good taste . From their refined niches , bronzes looked out patronizingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered through the mellow gloom . The door NOVEMBER Z 4 , 19 28 of the shop opened . Three ladies came in . One of the heads of the firm stepped forward . He too was Lathed in peace and good taste . " Good afternoon . " He was acquainted slightly with one of the ladies . The four people conversed , wandering about through the soft rooms , talking the soft language . After a hit the art man drew the lady of his acquaintance aside . " Tell me , " he said in an extra low voice , " is the white-haired lady anyone I should know  --  is she anyone impor-tant ? " " I do n't know how important she is , " replied his friend . " She is my mother . " Amateur Photographer p SPORT at first had it that Fred - 1- N-  Hanson , the pantryman on the Vestris who took the only photographs of the sinking ship , received but a pittance from the newspapers in return for his valuable negatives . It now appears that he did not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing enough at the start to dispose of the undeveloped films for fifty or a hundred dollars , and finally handed them over after some deVOICE E FROM NEXT ROOM : " Darling , play that piece over again , teill you ? " ? sultory talk about payment , on the mere assurance that , if the pictures proved good enough to use , it would be " made right " with him . This was at Quarantine , on board the American Shipper , the liner that picked him up . A representative of the Daily News was the first to locate him , gave the pantryman a card with the address of the newspaper on it in exchange for the negatives , and then hurried off in a tug . The pictures were developed and found to be remarkably good . Hanson did not show up at the News office until the next day . We understand that is was then agreed that he should receive royalties on the sale of the photographs from the news agency that handled them , and the arrangement is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also brought into touch with the Eastman Kodak Company , who , we were told , paid hint for a testimonial . Hanson used a five-dollar pocket Kodak and took two rolls of pictures which he managed to preserve from water in a pocket of his coat . Many sailors now take cameras on their voyages because they have found out that snapshots of incidents at sea  --  such as the rescue of the Antince , for example  --  have been readily sold in the past . Apparently they have no clear idea , however , of what prices newspapers may be expected to pay for extraordinary photographs . Prosperous Times WE have just been told of a salesman for soda crackers for the midtown district , who was late in getting around CO a certain restaurant one week . The manager , out of crackers and in an ill humor , demanded an explanation far the fellow 's tardiness , com-plaining that the cracker people used to be on time . The salesman 's explanation was that in the past two years his rounds have been complicated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the Forties and . Fifties . This supplements the figures of an amateur accountant who reports a count of thirty-nine quietly conducted saloons made in one block in the West Forties , as of November I. Flying Over AFAIRLY neat and painless way of flying over New York City is to take the bus which leaves Times Square at 2:30 on weekdays for the Newark Airport , where a big Ford plane awaits you . This plane holds fourteen passengers , and gives you a twenty-minute ride over Manhattan as far as Central Park . A company called the New York Skylines runs the tour ; the price is ten dollars for one , fifteen dollars for two . You are back before six o'clock . We had never ridden in a Ford plane before , and went out in a fit of dejection , hoping it would fall down and break our neck . This plane 's name was Miss Newark . A little delay was occasioned when someone counted noses and discovered that there were thirteen passengers , so one of the officials went along to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the alarming appearance of having been made by a precocious child out of old washboards . Once in the air , it proved comfortable and steady ? a good deal like the London-Paris machines but less elegant . Even in misty weather it 's fun to fly over New York : the three motors , stridulating , induce a dreamlike state , and you hang motionless over the Sherry-Netherland , like a dragon-fly on a hot day . It is , of course , easy to pick out landmarks ? the Library , the Pennsylvania Hotel , the New York Life , the White Star 's Olympic . Newark 's flying field , incidentally , is quite a place . Just exactly where it is we 'll never know , because Jersey after we emerge from the Holland Tunnel is as mysterious to us as the inside of a tannery . However , a new extension of the Lincoln Highway runs right past the field , so it 's going to be highly accessible in spring ( is now , in fact , to anyone with a pigeon 's judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spending five million dollars on the big tract of mud . Even now it 's quite a lusty young airport , with a big hangar and a long runway . Compared to the Long Island fields , it has a gloomy aspect because there 's almost no grass ; the general tone is that of a municipal dumping ground . Already it is the base for several air lines  --  planes run to Washington ; sightseeing planes are busy , three dollars for a hop in an open plane , five dollars in a Ford . Lady Heath 's little Moth was in the hangar when we were there , adding its mite to the glory of Newark . Biting the Morgan Quarter NE of the few men who has ever ON created a stir in the complacent counting-rooms of J. P. Morgan &; Company is a farmer who for many years has lived not more than twenty miles from the city . He was approached by one of the - Morgan partners not long ago with an offer of thirty thousand dollars for his land . Farmer Schuler , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend his doubts that the man was really good for such an amount . " Why , " cried the friend , " he is a partner of J. P. Morgan ! " The farmer turned that over in his mind and no bells rang . " So ? " he said , " but I nefer heard of J. B. Morgan . " " J. P. Morgan , " corrected the other . " I nefer heard of him , " insisted the good farmer . It was only after much persuasion that he finally went through with the transaction , which took him , for the signing of the deed , to the offices of J. P. Morgan &; Company . There he was paid the tribute of peerings around doors and of a silence strange and new to the place . For although he had never heard of J. P. Morgan &; Company , it seems they had heard of him . Breath of Home ON the way from Sorrento to Amalfi a couple , motoring in Europe , drove through the old town of Positana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last three hundred years . The spell of old lost centuries fell impressively upon the American motorists . They proceeded slowly , reverently  --  until an Italian in a silk shirt , standing at a stall by the side of the road , called at them , " Well-I-1 , get your fresh roasted Coney Island peanuts . " Alice and Calvin GROWN-UPS predominate in the little line of people which shuffles past the glass case , on the main floor of the Public Library , hold- ? ? " Come wit ' me , ho ! You wo n't get no Thanksgivin ' handout in that joint . " ing the original " Alice in Wonderland " manuscript . The day we were there , a grim-looking Japanese officer in uniform was one of the most absorbed watchers . What interested us most in relation to the exhibit , however , was a story a man gave us to add to our collection of Coolidge items . It seems that Dr. Rosenbach , the first American purchaser of the Lewis Carroll manuscript , was invited to luncheon at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President and also exhibited a copy of the rare 1865 edition which was recalled by its author shortly after it was printed , because he was not satisfied with the illustrations . " This , " said Dr. Rosenbach , holding it up , " is the famous suppressed issue of the book . " The President , who had been looking on silently , was moved to comment . " I did not know , " he said , " there was anything off-color about ' Alice in Wonderland . ' " The man who told us that sees quite a lot of Coolidge , and also gave NOVEMDER. 2.4 , 19 28 us a little word picture of the President 's well-known late-afternoon walks . It was only recently that Mr. Coolidge began to wear an overcoat . A staunch Vermonter , used to cold weather , he did n't put on a topcoat until the lack of one threatened to become conspicuous .

Protection LAD tidings have reached us of kJ-a new way to defeat the telephone  --  or at least to lessen its menace . When your phone rings , pick up the receiver and say , in a well-modulated falsetto : " This is Meridian 1212 , the time is six thirty-one . " Then , if the disgruntled voice at the other end sounds like a friend , hurriedly explain yourself . If it sounds like an enemy , hang up immediately and plug the bell with a wad of newspaper . Potter LAYMEN who visit the American Designers ' Gallery in Fiftyseventh Street are not surprised that Urban , who has made sets for the : " Follies , " should ask eighteen thousand dollars for his " repose room , " designed all in black . But they are puzzled when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed on the bottom with a scrawled " H. V. P. , " and find it priced at four or five hundred dollars . There are several shelves of these pieces of pottery , the work of Henry Varnum Poor , who designed the remarkable bathroom on exhibit there . Although he is not widely known , he is one of the few master potters of this country , and his story is interesting . Less than ten years ago he was a struggling painter , and he more or less stumbled into pottery as a lifework . He had studied art in London and Paris , later taught classes at Stanford University , and then came east to paint . To economize , he built a house near Haverstraw for which he did all the construction work himself , from hewing the logs to plastering . One day he carried off some clay from one of the beds near the place and  --  again in the interest of economy  --  made some kitchenware of it . Working with the clay absorbed him , and the next time he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook on " How to Be a Potter , " or something of the sort . He made a potter 's wheel and learned how to operate it , read all the books he could find on pottery , and began to develop ideas of his own . His experiments resulted in the brilliant ceramics which have established him as a great artist in clay . In his kiln at Haverstraw he has tried every process known in the various historical periods of pottery . One dealer who saw his work , in the days when he was hard pressed for funds , offered him a con siderable sum to " make antiques " which , the dealer said , could easily be sold for genuine . Mr. Poor thanked him and went away . The Poor pottery that carries a de-sign is made by the process known as " under-glazed " decoration , which re-quires three fir-ings and is too intricate for fac-tories to use . Mr. Poor gets his clays from various parts of the world , but oddly enough some of the best material was a batch turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm in Kansas . The potter has been taken up by collectors and museums , and some of his pieces sell for as much as twelve hundred dollars . The Metropolitan has some tiles from a set he made for the swimming pool of a Long Island estate . He receives a number of commissions of that sort ; the ceiling of the Union Dime Savings Bank is his work . He has always been quick and skillful with his hands  --  when he was a student at Stanford he won the fencing championship of the West Coast . Life Is So Complex ABACHELOR who lives alone bought a lampshade in one of the big department stores several weeks ago and asked to have it delivered . Failing to receive it , he visited the store a week later , complained bitterly to the bureau of adjustments , and in about ten days he received the lampshade . A few days later a deIiveryman called , with another lampshade , a replica of the first one . The buyer , tiring.of the game by this time , sent the second shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received his purchase . He now thought the affair was all straightened out . Next day , however , he received a letter from the bureau of adjustments . " Dear Madam , " it began , " we are enclosing a check for the lampshade which was apparently lost by our &liveryman.; Hoping that this settlement will he satisfactory , " etc. , etc . The gentleman promptly cashed the cheque  --  as partial compensation for his time and trouble . All 's Quiet ONLY about once a year is there any external excitement in Wall Street , and this is likely to be nothing more significant than the falling of a girder . Ordinarily the falling of a horse is as tremendous an event as you will encounter in a walk through the financial district . It is a well-ordered , tranquil place , without half the hurly-burly of , say , Twenty-third Street . The police have almost nothing to do . The billion-dollar deals and mergers , executed quietly indoors , communicate no fever to the streets outside . Thus visitors who go down there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sight of armored cars moving lazily about , guarded by lazily moving be starved for excitement . They divide their noon recess between a hasty lunch and an eager looking around for diversion . The streets are always crowded from curb to curb for an hour by these restless ones . A man who has looked into the matter tells us that Wall Street crowds are more easily diverted than those you encounter uptown , where people are cynics . The day we were down there , a negro playing a banjo drew a large following of well-groomed men and women anywhere he chose to lead them , like the Hamelin piper . Almost under the bronze right arm of Washington  --  o u t - stretched as if to command silence  --  a great gathering listened to a soapbox preacher berate bootleggers . " Nov you have all heard of Fran kie Yale  --  have n't you ? Have n't you ? " The speaker pointed at a curly-haired young man . " No , sir , " said the young man . " Well , this young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young lady shook her head . The preacher smiled gratefully . " I am glad , glad to see all this innocence , " he bawled . To satisfy the naive interests of the people who have their workaday being in these streets , there are more gimcrack and kickshaw shops in Nassau Street , a main thoroughfare cutting across Wall , than in any other street we can think of . Almost every other show window displays puzzles , dice , Thanksgiving favors , postcards , and cutlery ? bright steel attracts eager eyes . The biggest army of sandwich-men in town wanders along this street . We saw ten or twelve old men , who in a month or so will he Santa Clauses , advertising little novelties . A mini with an open sample case was shouting , from the middle of the road , " Poker , bridge , and pinochle decks . " We wandered the length of Wall Street from the Trinity clock to the docks of the Cuba mail steamers without encountering anything that surprised us except that  --  and this always surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it ends to the east , a hundred feet wide . Slip WITH the lecture season in full swing we are reminded of a certain lecturer who talks about explorations he has made into dangerous lands . Once he held an audience spellbound with the recital of a South Seas adventure he had had in a skiff . Into the craft dropped a large and agile python which encircled a native woman who was in the boat . Another native drew a long knife . " I saw him raise it , " said the lecturer . " There was a flash and off fell the python 's head . The native had severed it with one blow . " There was a momentary pause while the audience murmured its awe and its envy of the man who had witnessed scenes like this . " And they tell me , " resumed the lecturer a moment later , rather absently , " that could actually have happened . "
