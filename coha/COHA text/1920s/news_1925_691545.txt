txt Justice Holmes 's Statement . In your comment on the Oregon school law this morning ( a law which I deem as bad as you do ) appears the following : " It was Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court who said that he thought the country might get on even if the court ? erb deprived of the power to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional , but that he did not see how our Government could survive if the Supreme Court were not permitted to void acts of State Legislatures . " Perhaps some of your readers will be Interested to see the exact words of Mr. Justice Holmes , Inasmuch as his observation had a much more specific and restricted direction than is conveyed by your paraphrase . What he said will be found In his Collected Legal Papers , Pages 295-6 : " I do not think the United States would come to an end If we lost our power to declare an act of Congress void . I do think the Union would be Imperiled If we sould not make that declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in my place sees how often a local policy prevails with those who are not trained to national views , and how often action is taken that embodies what the commerce clause was meant to end .
