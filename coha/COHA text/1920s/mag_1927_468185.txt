I HAVE hung a large mirror in my open window , so that I can now see from my chair twice as much of the world outside . Past its rim my glance travels down across a tableland of black irregular roofs where queer tanks crouch on tripods and look like insect monsters . Clouds trail their shadows across this plateau which is riven not far away by a canyon at the foot of whose window-roughened walls flows a ceaseless traffic . This vista is closed by a gleam of water . Within the mirror the same tableland expands , then mounts , then is broken by the swift towering uprush of peaks whose form I have seen elsewhere only in the Dolomites . From their shoulders and crests white plumes of steam float and wave in the sunlight . I gaze at them , trying to decide whether it is their outline , or the knowledge I have that they are not natural objects but habitations of man ? in fact , a typical New York roofscape that makes them loom with such a veiled significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in ? All the things which I can see in the looking-glass have a queer extra vividness , depth , and grandeur which make the things seen directly appear trivial and almost unreal . Their color seems poorer , their countour flatter , their movement less spirited . They have a meager , desiccated , faded air , as though the life had been drained from them , but the mirror world beside them blooms with a mysterious and occult vitality . Anyone may verify this mirror-effect ; my mirror will give it , though the . : learer the mirror the more striking thechange . It is best seen when distant objects ? mountains , clouds , or remote horizons ? are within the reflected field of view . Many people , before and since Lewis Carroll , have brooded upon it without much result , for it is one of those facts of consciousness for which no full explanation has yet been found . Some would attempt to trace it to the " frame effect . " By putting a frame round any view we increase its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed through the windows of the train or from a closed car than when we are in the open with it . But here the direct view through the window is more solidly framed than the mirror view , which seems to demolish this explanation . Others endeavor to link it up with the fact that the landscape looks more spacious if we contemplate it with our heads upside down . But this last effect has a basis in the structure of the eye and in the " routine of sensation " which is lacking here . The two cases are not parallel . We shall have to dig deeper into the facts of consciousness if we are to reach even a conjectural account . These same excavations have a bearing upon our whole contemporary existence as conscious beings , upon the quality of our daily , hourly sentience , and upon the trend of civilization . For we must estimate this trend in terms of our consciousness , by the changes which are taking place not only in our intellectual outlook or in our emotional reactions but in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears . If the mind changes , everything alters with it . There is some reason to think that our minds are changing . They must have altered often in the past , and human circumstances have never been so rapidly transformed before . We change our minds in a sense , of course , every day and every year ; but I am not thinking of such changes as spring from hopes or fears , luck or failure , fashion , education , or new opinions , wars , strikes , or prosperity . These and a thousand other things vary the texture of our lives for us by weaving in this or that colored thread in new proportions and new patterns . I am thinking instead of changes in the colors of the threads themselves , changes at the dye-works , as it were , the dye-works being whatever it is which settles whether and in what degree and with what nuance we shall be conscious , which settles in short the quality and range of our feelings . The Universe , as we know it at present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about Consciousness is that we should know so little about it . We have lately found out far more about the physical world than we could reasonably have expected ever to discover . But the nearer we come to ourselves the less hopeful investigation seems to be . We know more about the Giant Stars than about the Sun ; we know more about beer than about our blood ; and we know far more about our bodies than about our minds , if indeed these are not , as seems likely , two names for the same thing. * But let us at least use whatever hints there are . Not all the many happenings in the mind are conscious . We can get some light upon the mystery by comparing those that are conscious with those that are not . Consider first : there is the wide contrast between the mental inflow and the mental outflow . Broadly speaking , the outward flowing tide of our impulses is not conscious ; but a good deal of the inward flowing tide is . At the gates of our senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through : those only which can engage such of our interests as are awake or can awaken a sleeping interest . It is the privilege of pains that they can nearly always waken some interest . Pains find these gateways easy to pass and normally they override all opposition . Even the strongest preoccupation goes down before them , and pains are ? and this is , a significant fact ? the most intense form of consciousness which normal people know . All other appeals to our attention have to adjust their claims to the simultaneous claims of numberless other appeals . Sometimes the adjustment is impossible . The pathway by which the appeal must be forwarded is already occupied , the line is busy . In these cases we ordinarily do not notice that any appeal has been made . We have been too much occupied to attend . But we may discover afterwards that we really did see or hear whatever it was that we passed by unnoticed . Those curious cases in which people dream of the whereabouts of lost objects illustrate clearly this curious fact of seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have become habitual , such as walking or writing , go through at the prompting of appeals from the sense-organs which are too smoothly adjusted to the claims of our other activities for consciousness to arise . The gradual lapse from consciousness of these activities as they become automatic suggests that consciousness may be compared to friction or to resistance . The best rough simile for describing consciousness is perhaps the electric light . If the current passed more easily through the filament no light would be given out . But the resistance in the case of consciousness is a complicated matter and seems to depend upon the difficulty of combining the activities which our sensations and ideas call for with the other activities which other sensations and ideas arc already investigating . Consciousness , in other words , arises through the mutual give and take by which the demands made upon us decide what our action shall be . The sight of a fly washing its face is in this sense a demand for action , if only for the action of watching it instead of getting on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added vividness and intensity such trivial spectacles often gain through the fact of conflicting with or being integrated with more important experiences . At the moment of the greatest moral crisis of his life Stavrogin became absorbed by the sight of a small green spider which seemed to him more vivid , more remarkable , and more " real " than anything he had ever seen ; and Dostoevski , who was far more conscious than most people and a very penetrating observer , put a great deal of his own experience into Stavrogin . Most people can parallel this observation from their own lives . This same formula ? that consciousness is an affair of integration under difficulties , covers also the emotional side of our existence . We become violently moved only when there is some conflict of tendencies within us . Think of the agitation in the timid lover 's breast , so much less intense when the timidity has vanished . When there is no conflict we act immediately and almost unwittingly ; and this holds good also of our most delicate and subtle motional experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lit , which after all do provide the best instances for studying this branch of ) sychology , is very strong . Literature and art have been too much neglected ) y the psychologists . They do per ) etuate , in the only way in which perpetration is possible , the very states of mind which he is concerned to examine . Lnd they provide a clue to the direction n which consciousness may be changing which we can not find elsewhere . We can now come back , via my miror to our main question . The secret probably of the heightened vividness of the mirror view is that it shares something of the picture 's appeal . If we did not know that it is a mirror-space , not an actual space , into which we were looking , would this effect of extra depth and significance be found ? The direct experiment is practically impossible for obvious reasons . The few glimpses which I have had into mirrors which I did not know to be mirrors have been inconclusive ; but in each case , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mirrors not by noticing that what I saw was too good to be true but by detecting the surface gleam or by discerning some familiar object , such as myself , in the field of view . Since experiment fails we are driven back upon the general argument . Vision through a looking-glass involves one thing more than ordinary direct vision , one additional factor to be reconciled with the appeals made by what we see ? the knowledge , namely , that we are looking into a mirror . This knowledge , I suggest , offers just that additional friction or resistance which makes the scenes we view appear to be dowered with extra vitality . And this remark about extra vitality is only another way of saying that our consciousness , that part of it which is concerned with what we see , is increased through this slight resistance . The same explanation applies , though less simply , to pictures ; the opinion that the less we realize that it is a picture ? not a man , some dustbins , or a tree ? which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an intellectual fallacy most favored by those who have least interest in pictures . The facts are the other way about . It is the way in which we have to combine the effects of the picture as a surface with the effects of the picture-space , the imaginary three-dimensional world we see within it , which gives the painter his opportunity to make us more conscious while we are looking into his picture-space than we normally are when looking at actual things . A similar combining activity partly explains our increased consciousness of what is said when this is given the artificial rhythm of verse , or the extra " reality " of the stage Hamlet which comes from our knowledge that he is only an actor . Taking then this general notion as a guide , that the acuteness and vividness of consciousness depend , among other things , upon the friction or mutual resistance of diverse combining impulses , what changes should we expect to be taking place in contemporary consciousness and what actual instances of such changes can we find ? The general impression which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , attempting for the first time to respond to the bewildering and intoxicating phantasmagoria of New York , is that here is the clue , the half-worked-out solution , to problems which he has hardly been able even to formulate on the other side of the Atlantic . Specifically , problems concerning the future . He will know before he comes that something very strange has befallen Western Civilization . He will be familiar with plenty of those cracks which indicate that a break with the past on a most enormous scale is taking place . He will have wondered , not perhaps without some degree of dread , what terrific new scene in the drama of humanity is about to be staged . The War will have prepared him for anything , if he is old enough to remember it , and the rapidity with which it is being forgotten and the completeness with which the younger generation now ignore it are among the disturbing symptoms above mentioned . He will have tried to define for his own satisfaction the general trend of the changes which seem to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feelings with which to greet them , only to be discouraged by his own obscurity . Then he comes to New York , to find himself within a few hours apparently right in the middle of the very state of affairs which he had been trying vainly to imagine . Above him soar buildings which have no counterpart in human history ; about him throng leisurely unworried people , varied enough to give an ethnologist a nightmare , dressed and groomed in their tens of thousands with a care and refinement only to be matched in small , very select European circles . Through them passes an armored car to halt at the door of a bank , but nobody seems surprised . On every hand immense hotels offer the hospitality of their luxurious lounges to all and sundry who seem to use them as public places , dropping in to listen to the band or to chat beneath a waving palm ? kept in motion by a well-placed fan . In the Public Library , even on a fine Saturday afternoon , hundreds of youthful readers sit working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the streets take on a new beauty from the colored fairy-lights borne by the myriad rushing cars , nobody seems to go to bed or even to look tired . Innumerable eating places are open and crowded till the morning . I despair of being able to indicate to an American how all this impresses the English visitor . After two A.11. in London the people to be seen eating in public are racing touts or similar flashy individuals , on whose faces is the stamp of weariness or dissipation . On the other hand , our bank messengers , as fai as I remember , wear top-hats to din ? Linguish their callin ? ? but for the resi are unprotected . That armored car is the fly in th ( ointment and the point from which the visitor 's speculations set out . 1/ ( soon learns facts , familiar enough - le every American , which account for it I have generalized some of his reflect tions ? about the new consciousnes which springs from new blends of im pulses ? taking my mirror for a parable THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western civilization a change is occurring , slowly in Europe , more rapidly in America , which may be described as the substitution of suggestion for tradition . Tradition , what some would call the instinct for law and order , never more clearly shown than in the General Strike , protects the bank messenger in England . The bandit has no hope of escaping , for public opinion is too solidly and effectively against him . Over here , suggestion , if it does not indeed help the bandit in some respects , has not yet stepped in to take the place of tradition . But tradition is also breaking down in England , as it must in all communities much exposed to diverse influences . When the living , as opposed to the imitation , art of a people becomes untraditional it is only a matter of time for the rest to follow suit . The living art of America , its vaudeville , its skyscrapers , and its poetry , reveal , as we should expect , a still bigger break with tradition . And suggestion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger . Witness the power of advertisement and publicity in America ? the really secluded English rural community gives a very poor response to a poster ; witness the suddenness and brevity of popular crazes ; witness the immense and ephemeral reputations of the most varied writers ? reputations which sometimes seem to have so little basis . An astonishing plasticity or adaptability , and an ? .. quaI suggestibility are the two ; mores3ions of American mentality which a visitor receives ? after the first effect of t masked heterogeneity has worked off . It is possible that this very susceptibility . o suggestion , explained in part by the ningling of traditions which is here ; oing on , is the greatest asset of the American and the one which holds out uost hope for the future of mankind . For only such a suggestibility will allow u increased fluidity to be held in conrol . Man has hitherto been too little plastic , too little able to meet new situations with a new and appropriate response , too bound down by his habits . I have known a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases as indicating too little power of variation . But too much adaptability is dangerous to society as well as to the individual . It is a most hopeful sign that the publicity expert has such power in all this one jot from my title , for the use of suggestion ( in this wide sense ) in place of tradition is virtually a making conscious of what was formerly unconscious . The traditional Englishman , now fast disappearing from the plowlands , had so many expectations so fast rooted in his mind , so many habitual responses to settled routines of experience , that he neither knew what they were nor , when they were by chance frustrated , knew what had happened . The Derbyshire man who grew " dizzy-like " if he were taken more than a mile from his home illustrates my point perfectly . By comparison the American has few settled expectations , but those he has he knows about , and he is markedly anxious to know more . It is no accident that Psychology is " that American subject " as they call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " poise " which his University career ought to give him to the desperate struggle of the modernist poet to render in full explicitness every apparently trivial detail and nuance of sensation and feeling , this transfiguration of the unconscious into consciousness is to the English visitor the dominant American characteristic , the feature which most links America with the future . It is this feature also which most misleads the European who is constantly embarrassed by the American 's zeal for elementary discussions . It takes some time to realize that this baffling enthusiasm over truisms ? over the fact that poetry is so beautiful , human nature so strange , or pleasure so attractive ? does not necessarily mean either defective education or vacuousness or infantility . It is due to the simple fact that what is obvious and inevitable , accepted and settled for the European ? taken for granted , almost unheard of and forgotten ? is often none of these things for the American . " What is concluded that we should conclude anything about it ? " asked Benjamin Paul Blood . A great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind which are as fresh and beguiling as spring in the American mind . The moral issues for example . Why do this or not do that , and why do anything ? To say that something is " not done " has a different meaning for the Englishman and for the American ; so different that neither can quite understand the other . To put the difference metaphorically , the veto comes from much deeper down in the English mind . The American nearly always knows why it is not done , the Englishman hardly ever . All of which makes the American seem as shallow , rootless , light , and transparent as the Englishman seems dense , secretive , stagnant , and instinctive . Both impressions are , of course , mistaken . For the American 's truism which bores the Englishman is not what the Englishman thinks it is , and the Englishman who seems so oddly uninterested and uninteresting may be responding in ways which the American knows nothing about . To quote from a volume recently published in London , under the title New World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself endowed with an unusually high degree of consciousness : At night as I lie in bed on the confines between sleeping and waking the thought of America opens vast and joyful before my straying mind , and I am unable to quell it . grit my teeth and strive to crush it or to master it but it overrides me like a dash of Polish cavalry charging on white horses with a riot of bells and drums -- I am lost in it like a rocket in the sky where stars shine white and blue upon me from all sides . It blooms like a Christmas tree lit with a thousand candles in a dark court-yard ? the houses just visible around it faintly reflecting the blaze and increasing its magic . It runs to my lips and I fall asleep with these words often upon them : " America America America America . " But this , being the attitude of an artist , is admittedly not a usual one ; and both English and Americans would be startled if the partial breakdown of communication were suddenly set right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interplay of his impulses has shifted so that they have to be adjusted to one another much more consciously , much nearer the surface . In comparison with the European he improvises his life , and in the fact that he can do this so successfully lies the great promise of American civilization . That there is another side to the matter , I know well . This deliquescence of what have so long been the rock-firm foundations of culture , our unquestioned , unconscious assumptions by which life is ruled and its goal set , is more a threat than a promise , unless conscious reflection and observation can provide better foundations . And the transition must inevitably involve casualties ? minds which are merely chaotic , or lopsided , minds which have failed and have returned to cling desperately to some incomplete and imperfectly realized tradition . For a true tradition is something which we hardly know we possess . The little talked about but universal custom of having ice-water on the breakfast table is much more a true tradition than , for example , " Mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the tradition has been pushed out of its proper place and become a superficial not a deep lying part of the structure of our minds . No genuine tradition was ever built up deliberately . The highly conscious status of most American traditions only another example of the changes which I have been discussing . Meanwhile this emergence into consciousness of problems and decisions which were once handled automatically brings with it , I believe , a general heightening of consciousness as well as an extension , a recoloration of the whole content of the mind analogous to that extra-vividness of the mirror view from which we set out . Together with this goes an eager interest in life and a passionate , if bewildered , desire to do something with it , " to have a good time , " which makes the visitor feel sluggish . Often this interest seems to concern itself unduly with trivialities , with the accidents not the essentials of existence . And if this were so it would not be surprising . But sometimes this appearance has a better explanation . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and could leave the rest securely to his readers ' imaginations . A modern American poet has to describe the beasts as though nothing resemblingthem had ever been seen before . One reason is that he can not count on his reader to the same degree ; another is that his own impulses toward a cow are much more mixed and , therefore , he is himself much more interested in how exactly she seems to him . IIe may not do what he sets out to do as well as Gray , but we should be clear that he set out to do something different , and why he can not as a serious artist set out to do the same old thing . And the poet is only the extreme instance ( though his compatriots may not always recognize him in his lifetime as such ) of what is happening in some degree to every mind in the community .
