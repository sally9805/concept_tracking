General Shen Hung-Ying , recently appointed military Governor of Kwang-Tung province by the Peking Government , attacked the Canton troops supporting Dr. Sun Yat-Sen . The attack was provoked by an entangling series of alliances between the Tuchuns ( war lords ) , and it is stated on reliable authority that the present conflict was principally due to the efforts of General Wu Pei-Fu who is the most powerful supporter of the Peking administration and the bitter enemy of Dr. Sun . <P> The present political position is that President Li is obliged to stand in with General Wu Presidency General Tsao- Kun . The Government party is , then , a tertuis quid , because the issue is between General Wu and his friends and Dr. Sun Yat-Sen and his supporters . <P> For some time a civil war has been in the course of preparation and it is considered that war on a large scale between the two camps is not improbable . Peace negotiations were inaugurated when it became evident that war would ensue between the North and the South ; these negotiations , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had virtually ordered the attack to be made on Dr. Sun . The delegates on both sides showed some surprise , for it was considered that a peaceable solution could be found to the problems of the two factions . Says Dr. Sun : " The other party lacks sincerity in its peace talk . Shen Hung-Ying attacked Canton upon receiving secret orders from the Northern Government . Fortunately , we defeated him and he is being pursued by our army . Falsely they talk peace to slacken our preparations , but in fact they dream of military conquest . "
