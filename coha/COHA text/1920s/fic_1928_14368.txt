It is late at night in Ollie 's little house . Sid Williams , Lettie 's father , is sitting slouched over near the fire with his hat on . Callie Williams , his wife , is tidying things around the fire . The lamp on the mantel has been turned down to let the sidk man rest , and teh objects in the room are barely discernible . The dim outline of a bed in the corner cab be seen . Mrs. Williams sets her broom by the fireplace and bende over the bed . SID How you think he is ? CALLIE I can hear his breath going softer now . SID Ai n't is a sight how he stays here ? CALLIE Pore fellow , he ca n't last much longer . SID Is Lettie asleep ? CALLIE ( Tiptoeing into a room at the rear and returning . ) The morphine stuff did the work . She 's dropped off at last . SID That'st the first nap she 's had in three nights . T thought if you'did n't hurry and git back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whipporwill . ( There is a tremor of the bed as the sick man groans . ) CALLIE ( Bending over the bed . ) What is it , Ollie ? p. 3 CALLIE Water , water . ( She brings a dipper of water and puts it to his lips as she holds his head up . Ollie 's haggard wild eyes are seen set deep within his sunken cheeks , and his hair is matted and tangled in a mane above his forehead . ) SID Drink it , you 'll feel better now . ( Ollie 's head drops back on the pillow with a snap . ) CALLIE ( Laying her hand on his forehead . ) He feels like he 's freezing . He 's got the shivers . ( She piles more quilts on him . ) SID Ah ! Out'n his head still . CALLIE His eyes look like a wild man , He ai n't got a ray of sense . SID Ah ! ( She sits in a chair beside him and for a long while they say nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fireplace . And the silence is unbroken save for the intermittent groans of the dying man . At length Sid rises and lays a piece of lightwood on the fire . ) CALLIE What time is it ? SID Going on ten o'clock . Ai n't the nights long . They ort to be shorter by Old Christmas . But Lord , they seem long . Last night I did n't sleep nary a wink . Sot here by the fire all the time . Thought Maggie and Stella would come with you . p. 4 CALLIE They ca n't stand the sight of it all , of it all . They love fun and they do n't like - ( gesturing. ) - this .

CALLIE It do n't do him ne good any more . He 's had four grains since dark . It do n't do him a speck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to be done , is they ? CALLIE Nothing more . It 's in God 's hands .

But they better come back to us . SID Yeh , that 's right . ( Again they sit in silence listening to the gasping breath of Ollie . Presently there is a sound outside as someone comes up on the porch . ) CALLIE ( Rising . ) I 'd begun to think they were n't no company coming . ( Aunt Margaret , Old Jacob Alford and his foolish boy , Sion , come in and sit down by the fire . ) SID How you , Aunt Marg'eet ? AUNT MARGARET Is he any better ?

Sence then he 's knowed nothing . OLD JACOB Lordy , ai n't they had trouble fer young folks . CALLIE Still , they got along mighty well , Jacob . OLD JACOB Yes , they have . ( Aunt Margaret goes ocer and gets down by the bed , praying silently . The others , including poor Sion , do likewise . They mumble broken and indistinct prayers - that God would be merciful to Ollie and to his children and to Lettie and to everybody everywhere . Ed Roberts comes in and stands with uncovered head . With the exception of Aunt Margaret they all resume their seats . She remains bowed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SID No better . ROBERTS ( Twisting his hat . ) How 's Lettie ? CALLIE She 's asleep .

He ai n't never complained . ( Aunt Margaret gets up from the bed and sits quietly by the fis . She rocks back and forth , the tears rolling down her cheeks . ) CALLIE I kin fix you a pallet in the back room , Aunt Marg'ret , and you kin lie down . AUNT MARGARET ( Twisting her hands nervously . ) They ai n't no better man than Ollie Weaver , but I 'm worried , worried . OLD JACOB God in his mercy will remember him .

He did n't go to church but he lived right . p. 9 AUNT MARGARET I 'd feel better if he was a member . Listen at him breathing . OLLIE ( Starting wildly up in bed , his voice breaking from him in a husky , agonised pleading . ) Lord a mercy ! Lord a mercy ! Lettie ! Lettie ! ( Then he topples over to one side with his hands caught across his stomach . ) OLD JACOB ( Coming over to the bed . ) Ollie 's dead . ( The men slowly take off their hats . Aunt Margaret bursts into tears and Callie stuffs her apron against her mouth . ) CALLIE We better wake Lettie . Better wake her right now . SID ( Catching her arm . ) Not yit , not yit awhile .

SID But he was suffering so , Aunt Marg'ret. p. 10 OLD JACOB That 's it . AUNT MARGARET Git me the Bible , Callie . ( Callie brings the Bible from the shelf and Aunt Margaret begins reading in her halting quavery voice . The others bow their heads and Old Jacob gets down in prayer by his chair. )
