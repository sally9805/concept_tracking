ETCHED IN MOONLIGHT-James Stephens-Macmillan ( $2.50 ) . Variety is color . Etched in moonlight there is no variety-only the alternating black and silver of sparse trees afar off , and the relentless greys of the vegetation underfoot . Striding through this spectral world they come , these three , to the deserted castle , where the jealous lover imprisoned his love and her betrothed . Fugitive , he roams the ends of the earth year after year , tormented by fear and remorse , until at last his cycle of self-recrimination brings him again to the silent castle and the " faces cut by the moon to a sternness of stone . " The punishment that awaits him has been molded of modern psychoanalysis , but cast in fairy tale . <P> James Stephens , Irish romancer , mystic , poet , writes seven new stories and never names a character . So universal are the loves , fears , hates and desires , that the generic term suffices : a man , a woman , he , they . He brings to them much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the happy charm of his Crock of Gold . No happiness at all about " Hunger " - grim story of a woman 's fortitude mocked by the inevitability of sheer want . First one child dies of starvation , then another , then the weary husband . And in the end there is nothing left but her crippled child , and bread lines . Again , in the mood of the Russians , a story called " Schoolfellows " recounts a good man accosted by his old schoolfellow who offers conversation in return for drink , more conversation in return for more drink . The good man evades , demurs , insults , but the other 's desire for drink is greater than these , and nothing avails the man but flight .
