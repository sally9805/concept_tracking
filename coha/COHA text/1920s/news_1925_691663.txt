txt A two-year contract beginning Sept. 1 next , an increase of 10 per cent , for contract miners and $1 a day for day men , the " check-off , " uniformity and equalization of all day rates , furnishing of pneumatic drills and compressed air to operate them by the operators and payment for certain " dead work " were the principal demands adopted , with scarce ly a dissenting vote , today at the final session of the tri-district convention of delegates representing 158,000 anthracite miners . The demands will be presented to the representatives of the anthracite operators a week from today at Atlantic City . A few minutes before the convention adjourned , Andrew Mattey , President of District 7 , predicted a suspension of mining operations on Sept. 1 on the ground that the coal operators would be interested in selling their accumulated stocks at higher prices and would hold off signing a new agreement for some time after the present contract expired . International President Lewis of the United Mine Workers warned that the coal ? operators , through their field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic City concerning the sentiment of the local unions and urged the delegates to impress on the rank and file the need of continuous support for the scale com mittee during the negotiations . Suspension 2a ? I ; xpeeted , Published reports from Swampscott that President ' Coolidge would take prompt action should it become evident that the public 's continuous coal supply was threatened were read ' with interest by the convention officials , but they had no comment to make . A. suspension of operation in the anthracite mines is almost being discounted , as persistent reports indicate that the operators will ask for a wage reduction of.between 17 and 20 per cent . Two years ago , when the present scale was signed , the principals were summoned to Harrisburg by Governor Pinchat , who awarded a 10 per cent . wage increase to the miners . The agreement was signed three weeks after the expiration of the contract , and in the meantime work was interrupted . This year the expectation is that , in view of the charges made against the bituminous operators by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft coal fields , Governor Pinchot will adopt a " hands off " policy and await Federal intervention . The only major demand which evoked much discussion today was that calling for complete recognition of the union , which means the check-off of union dues by the operators . Thomas Horn of Locustdale , Pa. , was booed when he said he opposed the check-off , President , ' C. J. Golden of District 0 declared that Horn never objected when his employers checked off other items of expense from his wages . He declared that it was the first time in the history of the union that a delegate opposed the check-off In the hard coal territory . Thomas Kennedy , International Secretary-Treasurer , charged that the anticheck-off talk was " propaganda of the operators , " and alleged that detectives Paid by the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company , of which Samuel D. Worthier Is President , had been sent to the Panther Creek district prior to the wage negotiations two years ago " to propagandize against the check-off . " When the vote was taken by a ahow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including complete union recognition In the demands . Accuses Operators of Plot , " You may think you 're not going to have a suspension . " said District President Mattey . " Let me say for the benefit of the public and the mine workers that a suspension will take place for this reason . The operators claim they have 10000,000 tons of coal . A suspension means $10,000,000 more in their pocketbooks . " When the agreement expires and another has not been made , the mines will he closed , not by you but by the operators . Two weeks later the coal will begin to move , but not for the same price. : Public clamor will send the price up $1 a ton . If the suspension continues , it may be that instead of paying $18 a ton the public will have to pay $23 a tonl for coal , The public and the press will blame the miners . and the operators will ge the dough . it has been told me that no agreement will be signed because the operators want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of the union de-mands : " 1 .
