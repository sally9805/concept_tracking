Last week , occupied mostly in organization and preparation for the fray , saw the crystallization of the first important elements of the campaign . These are simple , fundamental . They comprehend three distinct matters , each with a significance of its own . They are : <P> 1 ) This is a tripartate , not a dual combat . <P> 2 ) The leaders of all parties , in their several characters , and the issues of the parties , are peculiarly mixed . <P> 3 ) Campaign funds must , and will be gathered , which raises three questions : How much need be gathered ? How much can be gathered ? How much public odium will result from the gathering ? <P> The Three-Party Fight . The presence of a third party in the contest does not mean that there will be three contenders racing neck and neck . It means that LaFollette will try to take enough votes away from the two Reading tickets so that neither Coolidge nor Davis will have a majority in the Electoral College . In that event the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , the House of Representatives then chooses a President from the three highest candidates , the delegation of each state casting one vote . The result would be : 5 states tied and not voting ; 21 Democratic votes for Davis ; 22 delegations , nominally Republican ( should vote for Coolidge , but states like Wisconsin and Minnesota would probably vote for LaFollette ) . At any rate there would be no election , especially if Mr. LaFollette chose to prevent it . If by March 4 next , the House had made no choice , the Senate would then elect a Vice President from the two highest candidates for Vice Prsident . In the Senate the Republicans have 51 members , the Democrats 43 , the Farmer-Laborites 2 . Forty-nine votes are necessary to elect . Messrs . LaFollette and some of his insurgent colleagues , deserting from the Republican ranks , could easily deprive the Republicans of the necessary majority . Ergo , Mr. LaFollette would have the balance of power in choosing the next President . He might even have the opportunity of saying whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for President . He probably would choose the last under such circumstances . <P> What chances are there of his bringing this about ? Mr. LaFollette has a good chance of carrying five states : Wisconsin , Minnesota , the Dakotas , Montana . These states have 39 electoral votes . He may possibly carry seven or eight more , giving him a total of 80 electoral votes . With these votes , unless either Coolidge or Davis runs well ahead of the other , Mr. LaFollette may secure his aim . <P> Leaders and Issues . The Republican ticket and platform are easily and rather vaguely described as " Conservative . " <P> The Democratic ticket is a cause of questioning . Charles W. Bryan is the unknown quantity . He wears the progressive label . He has been doing the things in the Middle West that progressives admire . The country is frankly puzzled about this mixed team . Its inconsistency opens it to attack .
