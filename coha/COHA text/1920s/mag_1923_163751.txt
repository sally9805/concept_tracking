Vanities of 1923 . Earl Carroll has unveiled a first-rate second-class vaudeville show . With a single exception his notables are picked from the infinite rows of orchids , yams , and parsnips which burgeon beneath the glass frames of Mr. B. F. Keith . Inadvertently Mr. Carroll picked mostly yams and parsnips . Careful buttering of the latter with scenery and sirens rendered them barely palatable . Yet yams are yams . And yam actors should not be liberated on a stage facing 1,000 people who have paid $11.00 for the exercises . <P> The notable exception , aforementioned , was Mrs. Peggy Hopkins Joyce . Mrs. Joyce is not a vaudeville actress . Her stage is all the world . So many of her vagaries , nuptial and otherwise , have been chronicled in the daily bulletins that Mr. Carroll evinced an unerring flash of showmanship when he picked her for his orchid . He knew that she could neither sing nor dance . Yet the world derives a curious thrill from gazing at a woman of many marriages . <P> Mr. Carroll 's second best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook was what is known as a " wow . " Particularly was he famous for his involved absurdities relating to just why a man of his wealth and position should not be called upon to imitate four Hawaiians . Counting on the permanent wave of popular esteem to carry him through the Vanities , Mr. Carroll gave him infinite opportunity . Mr. Cook fell down . He fell down not once but many times . The first few times it was funny . <P> The third feature of the show is a flight of steps . The figure is literal and refers in no way to the dancers . Down in the clanking depths of some mechanical mind these steps were born . They pyramid , they stretch , they disappear , revolve and blunder grandly forth again in pyramids . The chorus drilled across them ceaselessly , results achieved were strikingly effective .
