Sally . Florenz Ziegfeld 's roseate musical comedy is almost literally dished up on the screen . The progress of the foundling waif who graduates from dish-washing in a cabaret to dancing and ultimately wins her Prince Charming with her tripping feet is punctuated by smashes of tableware . Leon Errol , staggering through his original role of the duke turned waiter , makes much of this china cataract undeniably funny . Colleen Moore by her sympathy and intelligence deflates much of the hokum from the title role . She dances with genuine talent and abandon- it is said she threw herself so completely into the part as to sprain her back . <P> Seven Chances . Buster Keaton has taken this Belasco stage success ; shuffled quickly through the seven proposals required for him to win a bride who will save his typically farcical inheritance by marrying him and devoted most of his impulsive gestures to a frantic cross-country chase . He is pursued by the feminine furies who answer his advertisement for a wife . A vast deal of cachinnation ensues at his various predicaments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Mail . This might be called a mechanically perfect story . Incidents are poured into the hopper to grind out exciting sequences . Still , the tale of an air mail pilot , beset by airplane bandits for his registered mail , has the genuine thrill of aerial explorations into pastures new . The scenes of parachute jumping and of one airplane deliberately crashing against another in sky-high warfare are consummately contrived and there is a picturesque battle between opposing bands of robbers in a deserted town . Warner Baxter , the postal Daedalus , has little to do but submit gracefully to being hit on the head . Billie Dove supplies the large-eyed element of romance , and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , refined parachute jumper , wears long hair like his father in The Thief of Bagdad . <P> Bad Company is more proof that all musical comedy actresses are good little devils at heart . The one depicted by the pallid but ingratiating Madge Kennedy even turns gun-woman and steals a will in order to save her sappy brother from a golddigger , and the early part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest is melodrama .
