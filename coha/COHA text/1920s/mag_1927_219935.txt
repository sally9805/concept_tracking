An actress is wary of picking a revival as vehicle for triumphant return to the stage . If the revival be a good play , it is sure to have been done within the memory of man by at least one of his favorite Thespians . Pauline Frederick returned to the legitimate stage last week , in London after a long absence during which she played in cinema . Her vehicle : the well-known Madame X , in which many a tragedienne had won favor before her . She had acted the role in movies , true . But many an actress had played the same role before London audiences in the same Lyceum Theatre . How would the U. S. actress compare ? <P> The drama reaches its peak in a courtroom scene . The brilliant young district attorney is prosecuting a woman , scorned by society , known only by the mysterious name , Madame X. He is on the point of vanquishing her when he discovers she is his own mother . The climax is heavily emotional . Since first seen 18 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , Miss Frederick came before her English audience . When the curtain was rung down , women were seen weeping-almost hysterically . Pauline Frederick has a low , beautiful voice , dark , tragic eyes , a well-proportioned figure , slightly more matronly than it was a few years ago when she was a symbol of beauty . In cinema she has recently been cast as the suffering mother . The English critics thought her at least equal to Mrs. Pat Crimpbell . Ellen Terry , in their most glorious days . She was recalled ten times-the greatest demonstration since Sarah Bernhardt 's appearance . She tried to make a speech but found herself choked with uncontrollable emotion . The audience continued to cheer , to wipe its eyes , to cheer Miss Frederick 's mother seated in a stall , to cheer the floral wreaths as they were offered .
