Boats of another sort-needle-sharp bodies with eight yellow legs apiece-measured speed , three of the outlandish creatures appearing on a river in Connecticut , two on a lake in New Jersey . <P> At Princeton . Coach Logg* of Princeton has shuffled the varsity boat this spring , wags have said , " like a man who is trying to cheat himself at solitaire . " But last Saturday he made no shifts ; it was Coach Stevens of Harvard who had to rearrange his boat when Barton , No. 3 , sprained three vertebrae in his neck in a boathouse accident . Harvard men were not so ready to bet on their crew after that , and indeed their caution seemed justified . The Princeton crew took the lead from the start and , moving beautifully over a lake like a wafer of aluminum , stood a length and a half ahead at the mile mark . The Harvard stroke got faster , the Harvard shell moved up , half a length behind , to even terms , and-at the finish-a quarter of a length ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would finish in that order , prophets said . The Yale crew of course has acquired , in the last three years , a legend of invincibility ; people thought that Penn had a good crew , but not good enough ; Columbia was not in it . In a wash of golden light that would have been sunset if daylight-saving had not turned it into midafternoon , the boats moved out ; Penn was in front , Yale next , Columbia last . A mile went by . Was a Yale crew going to be beaten ? The coxswain did not think so ; he put his hand in his pocket , produced a red handkerchief and waved it , once ; the Yale shell went up ; Yale men leaned shrieking out of observation cars , danced wildly on the float as the boats crossed the line-Yale , Penn , Columbia . The prophets had been right . <P> <P> * Appointed this season to succeed Dr. J. Duncan Spaeth.                    @
