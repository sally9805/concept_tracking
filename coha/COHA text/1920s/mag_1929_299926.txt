" Amen , Amen ! " cried the delegates and they clapped their hands . <P> " What Miss Rebman needs is a big brother-from now on I 'm going to be her big Christian brother , " said Cleveland 's Delegate E. A. Roberts . <P> " I refuse to be spit upon " said a Dean . <P> " These rumors are hellish " said the delegate from Austin , Minn . The delegates thereupon thundered more Amens and clapped louder than ever . . . . <P> There was little dignity or quietude at the convention in Buffalo last week of the Baptist Bible Union of North America . <P> The Baptists were angry . They shook their fists and shouted . Sometimes they nearly struck each other . Presiding over them was Dr. Thomas T. Shields , President of the Board of Trustees of Des Moines University from which , last fortnight , he had expelled the entire faculty . <P> Dr. Shields 's chins quivered with emotion when he addressed the delegates . The majority cheered him , inferentially hissing his enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose face is infinitely sad and who last week said : " If it were possible to banish Dr. Shields to some island under the sea . a great step would be taken in the interest of humanity but great injustice would be done to the fish of the sea . " The Shields-Wayman controversy which everybody discussed at the Buffalo convention had reached its high point the week prior in a student egg-and-rock riot at Des Moines University ( TIME , May 20 ) . Dr. Shields , as President of the Trustees , demanded from University President Wayman the expulsion of six members of the faculty . To Fundamentalist Shields these members looked like Modernists . But President Wayman would make no expulsions . Followed the Shields expulsion of the whole faculty , the riot , and then a court order restraining the Shields action and making possible last week resumption of recitations , lectures at the University . It was with these things that the irate Buffalo convention dealt . <P> President Wayman did not attend the convention . But Dean Earl C. Galloway of the College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Shields charge that Dr. Wayman mismanaged the University , that he claimed academic degrees which were not rightly his . But when he tried to answer the charges , Dr. Shields would not yield the floor . Finally the Dean was allowed to speak , and then he found that most of the delegates would not listen to him . He therefore left the convention and started another at the Hotel Tourraine . <P> To this convention came nearly 100 delegates . They heard the Dean repeat the anti-Shields accusations which Des Moines students had made last fortnight . These were that Dr. Shields and the University 's Secretary-Treasurer , Miss Edith Rebman , had been morally turpitudinous in Los Angeles , Cal. , and Waterloo , Iowa , that he and Miss Rebman , both Canadians , were unAmerican , favored Canadian students , that he and Miss Rebman spied on students and the faculty , caused mistrust , friction . <P> Meanwhile , the original convention closed by re-electing Dr. Shields president and Miss Rebman secretary-treasurer of the board of Des Moines trustees and of the Baptist Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother ' ' to Miss Rebman , was elected first vice president .
