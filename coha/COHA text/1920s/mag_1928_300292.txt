It is a fact-and no fault of aviation-that many a little boy of 1928 wants , some day . to be an engineer ( the pilot of a steam locomotive ) . Still great is the appeal of the whistle in the night , the glare of the boiler fire , the singing rails . <P> All the glamor of railroading is summed up in two words-Casey Jones . Mention these words to any engineer , fireman or roundhouse worker , and he will immediately be your friend . If he does n't start singing , he will tell you a pack of grand stories . <P> There was once an engineer named John Luther Jones , they called him Casey because he was born near Cayce , Kentucky . He piloted the Illinois Central 's Cannonball <P> No. 1 , crack passenger train between New Orleans and Chicago . On the midnight run of March 18 , 1900 , with Mardi Gras guests abroad . Casey Jones saw a crash coming with the rear-end of a freight train near Vaughns , Mississippi . He did all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw his engine into reverse . Then he yelled to the fireman : " jump if you want to save your neck . " But Casey Jones , no jumper , stayed with his locomotive and died instantly in the crash . <P> After they buried Casey Jones , an old roundhouse Negro worker , Wallace Saunders , began to chant a song about him . In the railroad yards between New Orleans and Chicago , whites and blacks added verse after verse to Casey 's epitaph . Soon there were some 50 verses and many a chorus . Eddie Newton and T. Lawrence Seibert converted them into a popular hit . Extracts : <P> <P> The caller called Casey at a half past jour , Kissed his wife at the station door , Mounted to the cabin with his orders in his hand , And took his farewell trip to the promised land . <P> Casey pulled up that Reno hill , He tooted for the crossing with an awful shrill , The switchman knew by the engine 's moans That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number four stared him right in the face , Turned to the fireman , said ; " Boys , you 'd better <P> jump , ' Cause there 's two locomotives that 's again ' to <P> bump . " <P> Casey said just before he died , " There 's two more roads that I 'd like to ride . " Fireman said , " What could that be ? " " The Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe . " Mrs. Jones sat on her bed asighing Just received a message that Casey was dying , Said , " Go to bed , children , and hush your crying , ' Cause you 've got another papa on the Salt Lake Line . " <P> <P> The wife whom Casey kissed at ' the station door is still alive . She lives in Clarksdale , Miss . Last week , she announced that she was filing suit for $150,000 against a California motion picture company for exploiting Casey 's name without her permission .                @ @ @ @ @
