Going . After celebrating Independence Day in Battle Harbor with cannon , rifle , shotgun , pistol , flashlight and races in rowboats , Commander Donald B. MacMillan , Arctic explorer of the <P> National Geographic Society ( TIME , June 29 et seq. ) , ordered his two ships on up the Labrador Coast . A stop was made at Domino to take on sealskin boots . Bucking a head wind into Hopedale Harbor , MacMillan learned that the ice had gone out of there only four days before ; yet the next day , the wind falling , ravenous clouds of mosquitoes filled the sultry air and fattened on the white men as they fished for trout and salmon , shot seals , took pictures , exhibited their two Navy seaplanes and their radio apparatus to curious Eskimos , visited with the Rev. W. W. Ferret , head of the Moravian mission of Hopedale . <P> The Peary and the Bowdoin steamed on again , picking their way cautiously through rock-strewn channels . They threaded Windy Tickle to lie in the lee of Cape Harrigan while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover supplies cached there by MacMillan on his last return from the Arctic . <P> Beyond Cape Harrigan , as far as a powerful telescope could take the eye to sea , vast ice floes stretched-the densest in years , according to local fishermen . At Cape Mugford , the Bowdoin 's propeller was damaged . . . . <P> Returned . For " excellent behavior " displayed in fishing his two companions , Lieutenant Dietrichsen and Mechanic Omdahl , out of polar pools into which they slipped while walking over floes from their crippled seaplane to rejoin Explorer Amundsen , the Cabinet Council of Norway last week conferred a gold medal on Pilot Lincoln Ellsworth , only U.S. member of the Amundsen polar flight which returned in safety a fortnight ago to Oslo ( TIME , July 13 ) . <P> Asked if they would ever again attempt flying to the Pole in heavier-than-air machines , Amundsen and Ellsworth said : " No . " Asked if they were interested in the project of Herr Hugo Eckener of trying for the Pole in a super-zeppelin , said they : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip was his first polar experience : " I have only just begun . . . Any project for a polar flight by dirigible should plan its route for a flight clear across the Pole , terminating in Japan . " <P> Eckener was known to be seeking their company for a flight next year ; was reported to have arranged for a conference this month somewhere in North Germany . <P> Planning . In Germany , plans were reported maturing for the construction of a polar zeppelin at the famed Friedrichshafen works . An estimated budget of seven million gold marks ( $1,750,000 ) for the whole trip was to be sought by the International Arctic Research &; Exploration Society in levies upon Labor organizations , community poll taxes , children 's pfennigs , taxes on theatre and cinema tickets .
