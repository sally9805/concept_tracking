Last week , virtually certain of the Democratic nomination to be President of the U. S. , Governor Alfred Emanuel Smith of New York became 54 years old and , with family &; friends about him , stood up at his dinner table to carve a 100-lb. , electric-lighted replica of the White House , fashioned in cake for the occasion by Ryoochi Hida , his chef . <P> Five days later , without for a moment stepping out of his role as Governor , Alfred Emanuel Smith addressed the U. S. electorate . Formally , he was addressing only the New York Legislature . But he well knew others were listening . He called his speech " the eighth and last annual message I shall present to your Honorable , Bodies . " He made it a history of government in New York State since he first governed there. * <P> The message took more than four hours to read aloud . So soon as they could obtain the text in print , politicians perused it closely . It is just possible that an issue between Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , issue or none , the Smith record must be the Democratic answer to the record of the Coolidge Administration . In his historical message last week , Governor Smith , using remarkably few phrases such as " all along I have stood for . . . etc. " and " as far back as 1920 I appointed . . . etc. , " outlined his record as follows : <P> Chaos . " At the beginning of this decade the Government of the State was more or less in chaos " - owing to martial preoccupations . <P> Reconstruction . In 1919 , Governor Smith appointed a Reconstruction Commission of private citizens from many a profession and rank of life . This Commission helped the Governor demobilize the state and deal with War-neglected problems , such as unemployment , housing , public health , transportation , food distribution , business and industrial unrest . The Commission also suggested that the government needed reorganization . The Commission perfected a plan , based on recommendations of a constitutional convention which had been held in 1915 . The plan was adopted in 1925 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaus ; distributed all state functions among 18 departments , of which the heads were responsible directly to the Governor . " I deem it significant to mention , " said Governor Smith , " that at the first meeting of the Governor 's Cabinet it was necessary to introduce some of the department heads to one another who had never met before , although all were engaged in a common effort . . . . <P> " It is already conceded that the reorganization is the most progressive and thorough reform in the structure of State government undertaken by any State in the Union . " <P> Budget . Fiscal reform accompanied administrative under the Smith regime . Governor Smith was presently to submit to the Legislature his state 's first Executive Budget , certifying the state 's needs " in the order of their importance " as determined by a special bureau . The Legislature had power to reduce , but not increase items , and to add items subject to the Governor 's veto .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
