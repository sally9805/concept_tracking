THE road presents a moving film on which many actors are immortalized . Such names as John Hancock , Paul Revere , Samuel Adams , Ralph Waldo Emerson , James Russell Lowell , Thoreau , Longfellow , Bronson Alcott and his illustrious daughter , Louisa May , of " Little Women " fame ? these and many others crowd the picture , impressing always the fact that this brief stretch of Massachusetts roadway has known not only the birth pangs but also the growing pains of a nation , as well as the first maturing of America 's literary genius . He would be sadly deficient in imagination who could travel its twenty miles without a swelling pride in the stirring scenes that they have witnessed . We took the road just recently , inspired , I suppose , by newspaper accounts of the annual celebration on April 19th , in which Paul Revere and William Dawes , ancestor of the present Vice President , ride out to warn sleeping farmers of the approaching British troops . And I suppose , too , that it was a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn our car deep into what is now Boston 's Italian quarter , to find the home of Paul Revere , a musty , low , oblong structure , whose diamond-shaped panes still look out upon the flagstone paving blocks of North Square . Here , with Boston 's oldest building , properly begins any true pilgrimage to Concord , for it was from this house that the illustrious midnight rider set out about ten o'clock on the night of April 18th , after having first directed his friend Newman to hang the signal lanterns in the tower of the Old North Church near by , to warn anxious watchers on the Charlestown side that the British were crossing the Back Bay in their boats to begin the march to Concord . Boston to-day is not the Boston of a century and a half ago , and though Paul Revere was ferried across the river to Charlestown where friends , warned by the beacons from the church , held in waiting the horse that was to carry him on his famous ride to Lexington , we found it easier to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section ? in Revere 's time open water or low mud flats ? across Harvard Bridge to Cambridge . In eighteenthcentury days the waters of the Back Bay lapped the lower edge of the Common , and it was from the southerly point of this historic green that the British soldiers entered their boats . Farther to the south lay Boston Neck , the city 's only connection with the mainland . Fortifications lined the approach to this narrow strip of land ,  | and it was through the kindly offices of a friendly British sentry that William Dawes , the other rider of that night , was allowed to pass out of the city . Once safely beyond the Neck he spurred his horse through Brookline , skirting Roxbury and gaining Cambridge by the one bridge that crossed the Charles , a good eight miles from Boston . Harvard Bridge spans the river at a point far below the site of the ancient bridge , and Massachusetts Avenue carried us into Cambridge past the red brick of Harvard Yard , upon which the first building was erected in 1636 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until two years ago , stood the great elm under which Washington took command of the Continental Armies . From there the road lay straight before us to Lexington , but we ruled that we should not leave the city without visiting some of the points of interest that lie within easy reach of the Common . A short detour to Brattle Street carried us by the Craigie-Longfellow house , the poet 's home from 1837 . Washington occupied the house in 1775 and 1776 ? reason enough for including it in our Lexington-Concord journey . The house where Longfellow first had rooms as a student was eighty years old when later he took it over , and little different then from what it is to-day or was in 1759 , when it was built . We made sure to have a glimpse of Elmwood , home of James Russell Lowell , withdrawn among beautiful trees , and then back to the Common and the road to Lexington . Massachusetts Avenue , until it reaches Arlington ? ancient Menotomy ? presents little to recall the past , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl Percy by land to aid those harried troops of the king whose every retreating step made them marks for farmer bullets . In Arlington a tablet fixed in our minds the site of the Black Horse Tavern , where three members of the Committee of Safety , that restless body of hardy patriots who directed Revolutionary activities , lay sleeping while the British marched from Charlestown . Cooper 's Tavern occupied our attention too , for here two Americans were killed by the British during the retreat , and just beyond the village we found another tablet marking the spot where the first grief came to Percy 's men . For here the old men of Menotomy set upon the supply train and  | captured it , killing or capturing the guards . But we were eager to get on , for now we were on the exact route of Paul Revere . Through Charlestown and Medford he galloped , warning the villagers of the latter hamlet before striking back for the main route . Just before reaching Lexington village we paused to mark the old Wright Tavern , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital when he met the straggling redcoats returning from Concord about the middle of the afternoon . Beyond there are the two spots where his field pieces were planted , and around a bend in the road lies Lexington Green , guarded by the bronze statue of the minuteman , hatless , sleeves rolled up to disclose two muscular arms , shirt open at the throat and in his hand the flintlock musket of Revolutionary days . Search through the world and you will find few spots more pleasing to the eye than the green of a New England village . And among them Lexington 's is unsurpassed . Shaded by great trees it is difficult to imagine the bloody scene that took place on that placid ground just at sunrise of an April morning . At its farther end still stands the house of Jonathan Harrington , unchanged from that memorable day , and before it is the doorstep to which the master dragged himself from the sorry business on the green to die at his wife 's feet , a British bullet in his breast . Facing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the minutemen gathered in the midnight chill , brought together by the meetinghouse bell . Paul Revere had brought the news . A few pulls on the bell rope and the farmers came from their houses , running across fields , to gather on the green . They were early , of course ? the British were hardly started on their march ? and there were hours of anxious waiting before drumbeats far down the road brought them pouring out of the tavern to form on the green . Eight of them fell on that peaceful spot before the drumbeats grew faint down the Concord road , but their deaths were avenged an hundredfold later on . We walked across the green to Pulpit Rock , site of the old meeting house , and the Revolutionary monument behind which the eight victims of that day are buried , before turning down Hancock Street to the residence of Rev. Jonas Clark , where John Hancock and Samuel Adams were aroused from their slumbers by Revere 's lusty voice informing the guard below their windows that the regulars were marching out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a peaceful countryside , until at Merriam 's Corner it joins the main trunk road between Boston and Albany . Just at this juncture occurred another of those bloody skirmishes which marked the British retreat , and not far beyond we came upon the tablet which marks the abrupt ending of the " midnight ride of Paul Revere " at the point of British pistols . Squads  | of English officers were out that night scouring the roads and taking all suspicious persons they encountered . Revere , with William Dawes , who had caught up with him at Lexington , and Dr. Prescott , whom the two had met farther on , must certainly have fulfilled that qualification . For , down the road , the British could not have failed to hear the clatter of their horses ' hoofs , halted intermittently , as the riders drew up before each house to shout a warning to the sleeping occupants . But if Revere was captured , Prescott and Dawes escaped , the former carrying the alarn to Concord . Not far from this point begins a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School " of philosophers , poets and authors First among them is the " Wayside House , " sur-mounted by its square cupola of a study , which was Hawthorne 's home from 1851 . Here wen written " Our Old Home , " " Doctor Grimshaw 's Secret " and others of his last works . But our interest in the " Wayside " was almost eclipsed moment later as we came in sight of Old Orcharc House , the Concord home of the Alcotts . Musing before the fence which borders the road across the front of the house , shaded by great trees , it is not difficult to brush aside seventy years anc imagine that the kindly , if stern , figure of Broil. son Alcott may emerge at any moment from the doorway of the house , surrounded by the eager faces of his " little women . " During the summer the place is opened as a treasure house of Alcott relics , each room restored as nearly as possible to the appearance it bore in Louisa May Alcott 's girlhood .  | We drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the sage of Concord " spent the later years of his life . Here another turn in the road brought us full into sight of Concord , and we were back again to the Revolution and April 19th , passing the house of the Antiquarian Society , which holds so many priceless relics . Behind , on rising ground , the militiamen took up their first position of defiance , only to retreat as discretion seemed the better part of valor . The North Bridge , where the first skirmish occurred that day , is , of course , the mecca of Concord visitors . Monument Street , the modern approach , turns off at right angles from the lower and of the square . But in the older day the main road ran obliquely from the square , crossed the North Bridge and continued on across the meadows beyond . It was this road that the militiamen wished to command , and their second position , behind Monument Street and near the old burying ground , fulfilled their object . As we turned down the road toward the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground to our right : The minutemen were in hurried consultation . Regulars had entered the town and the watchers had seen one company march off to take possession of the South Bridge . But now , as they scanned the square , six companies got under way , taking the old road to the North Bridge . Some of the provincials were for making a stand ; others counseled that it would be best to wait until reinforcements should have swelled their ranks , and the latter won . The whole body of about two hundred men retreated across the bridge and took  | up a position on the high ground beyond . Hardly had they quitted the span when the British came upon it ; three companies crossed and went off to Colonel Barrett 's farm in search of the stores hidden there ; the other three companies halted after crossing the bridge to hold this important entrance to the village against the Yankees . Driving slowly down Monument Street we passed the " Old Manse , " built not long before the Revolution by Rev. William Emerson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson watched the battle 's progress . At a later date " the sage of Concord " occupied the house , but it was Hawthorne who immortalized it during his occupancy with " Mosses from an Old Manse . " Just beyond the Old Manse a short byway carried us between rows of great trees to the bridge . There before us stood the old Revolutionary monument , erected in 1836 with a fitting ceremony for which Emerson composed the oft-quoted lines : By the rude bridge that arch 'd the flood , Their flag to April 's breeze unfurled , Here once the embattled f wnrerr stood And fired the shot heard roimd the world . At the edge of the road we read the inscription above the grave of the three British soldiers who fell victims to the Americans ' fire , and stopped at the edge of the bridge to read the brief story of the fight upon a tablet erected last year at the sesquicentennial of the battle . Across the modern cement bridge , constructed to resemble the old wooden structure that it replaced , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac Davis and Abner Hosmer , two American soldiers , fell . In the center is Daniel Chester French 's statue of the minuteman , one hand resting upon his plow , the other grasping the flintlock . In imagination we reconstructed the battle scene : Before us had idled the British soldiers , eyeing the Americans who occupied the high ground above , well out of gunshot . The provincials , for their part , were anxious , restless , wondering what course they should take . All might have gone well if the British in the town had not set fire to some of the militia 's stores . The Americans , seeing the rising curl of smoke , mistook its significance . " Will you let them burn the town down ? " demanded Joseph Hosmer , the adjutant . " I have n't a man that 's afraid to go , " said Isaac Davis , captain of the Action Company , as the column was hastily formed into line . The other captains could say the same . A final word of caution from Colonel Barrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British fired first and the march was begun , an effectual declaration of war against the Crown . Down the hill marched the men , now three to four hundred strong , and at their coming the British leaped to attention . Back across the bridge they retreated , some few of them remaining on the provincials ' side to take up the planks . Major John Buttrick , who marched beside the head of the column , ordered them to stop , and in reply a few desultory shots were fired into the river . The Americans quickened their pace and a single shot came from the British side which wounded two of themarchers . Immediately after , a volley came from the British , and the two Americans fell dead . The British had fired , and Major Buttrick turned to shout : " Fire , fellow soldiers ; for God 's sake , fire ! " The provincials needed no second word . A sharp volley answered the British , and the regulars , after a few more scattering shots , broke and fled , leaving three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees . Such a simple story , such a tiny skirmish to have had such terrific results ! We recrossed the bridge to find our car and took the road back to Boston , stirred by the memory of that day when every fence and every tree served as protection for a grim-eyed farmer with a ready flintlock . Those scenes and their memories can not fail to leave their mark . The Concord road ought to be traveled by everyone at not too great intervals , just for the inspiration of it . It serves as a stirring reminder of the sturdy , high-minded men who formed the background of our national life .  |
