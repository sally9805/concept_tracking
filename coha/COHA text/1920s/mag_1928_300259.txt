A Play Without a Name . Upon that familiar pattern , the triangle , Austin ( " Seventh-Heaven " ) Strong has superimposed a less readily recognizable , fourth-dimensional figure . It consists of a strong-interlusive plotting of the working of the human brain . <P> Kenneth MacKenna is a young husband , out to make good in the financial world . To him and to Peggy Wood , his ambitious wife , an appointment to the German office of his firm symbolizes success second only to an appointment to the Shanghai branch . On the day before the appointment is to be announced he resigns his position , feeling that he is not to get the coveted appointment . Next day he tells his wife , is still explaining away when in bursts an old flame . At this point Playwright Strong trephines the husband 's skull , lays open the human brain . Centers of nerve control are represented by figures at sets of levers much like those in a railroad switching tower . One normal voice speaks the words that the husband has spoken aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrifyingly mechanical , intones the husband 's unspoken thoughts . The " nerve centers ' ' also speak their reactions , crying " pain ! pain ! " when MacKenna stubs his toe . <P> The brain scene ends and the play continues conventionally up to the inevitable amorous scene between the husband and his old flame . Once again there is a flashback to the cerebral . With no subtlety at all the action of the brain during a complete seduction is described . <P> Remorsefully the unfaithful husband returns to his wife and upon learning that his firm has rewarded the ambition which she stirred , he penitently confesses and is given absolution . <P> Peggy Wood ( whose fame so transcends that of her own husband , John VanAlstyn Weaver , that he has been facetiously called Mister Peggy Wood ) makes a good wife ; Katherine Wilson is real as the seductress who " makes " a good husband ; Playwright Strong has made a good play . <P> Once an architect , the author has worked on the piece intermittently , since 1916 . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was the husband of Mr. Strong 's grandmother . <P> Major Barbara might more descriptively have been titled , " A spectacular demonstration of the theory that money makes morals-complete with characters , including : one Millionaire ; one Earl 's Daughter or Millionaire 's Wife ; their Son , an imbecile sample of Young England ; their two Daughters , one beautiful of face , one a Major in the Salvation Army , who tries to convert her father ; two Suitors , a noisy Nitwit and a Professor of Greek who becomes by the odd and engaging circumstances of the plot , heir presumptive to the Millionaire 's munition works and who , by the odd and engaging developments of the thesis , is not thereby deprived of the affections of the second daughter . " It is not so called , because George Bernard Shaw wrote it in 1905 , before he had become addicted to long titles , long whiskers , or the movietone ; and before his interest in abstractions had supplanted his excitement about people .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
