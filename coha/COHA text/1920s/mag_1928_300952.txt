( See front cover . ) <P> <P> Last month , an unmirthful man smiled mechanically for photographers , took off his hat and put it on again , glanced with interest at New Jersey 's Palisades , and walked down the gangplank of the Homeric to Manhattan . From beneath his drooping mustache , he mumbled that " only suffering came from the World War . " He then hastened to take a train for Toronto , where he knew that more newsgatherers , more photographers , would make progress difficult . For to no great city of the world could Alfred Moritz Mond , first Baron Melchett , come unobserved , unheralded . <P> Action follows in the wake of the Mond pilgrimages . As every Britisher knows . Father Ludwig Mond had come to England from Germany with 40,000 marks , a device for making and bottling soda-water , and infinite faith . That faith was somewhat tremulously shared by Fraulein Henrietta Herz , daughter of Father Ludwig 's German landlady , who had loaned him her small capital . As a speculative venture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fraulein Herz lived to be repaid 200% each year on her advance . Father Ludwig lived to see his British factory a spectacular success , to create the Brunner Mond Co. and the Mond Nickel Co. , to amass a large and surprisingly good collection of Italian Madonnas , and to beget Alfred Moritz Mond . <P> When Lord Melchett landed in Manhattan , last month , no sophisticated observer believed he would repeat Father Ludwig 's career and start building a factory to make soda-water . He had , in a manner of speaking , quite enough factories already . Less than two years ago , he had linked Brunner Mond Co. with Nobel Industries , Inc. ( explosives ) and British Dyestuffs , Ltd. , to create England 's largest holding company . As chairman of the board of Imperial Chemical Industries . Ltd . ( I. C. I. ) , he presides over a corporation with an authorized capital of nearly $325,000,000 . <P> But sophisticated observers , familiar with Tycoon Melchett 's known passion for consolidation , amalgamation , did believe he had come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. enterprise . To newsgatherers , he denied all reports of new I. C. I. deals with Allied Chemical in the U. S. , or with the mighty German I. G. Farbenindustrie . Most obvious of remaining possibilities , therefore , was a merger of Mond Nickel with the " biggest " International Nickel Co. , owning adjoining properties in the Froude Mines of Ontario . <P> Lord Melchett returned from Canada , conferred privately and lengthily in Manhattan . Speculators , scorning merger denials , made hasty calculations . Assets of International Nickel total $75,000,000 . Together with the Mond company 's assets of $40,000,000 , the new international nickel trust would be worth between $115,000,000 and $125,000,000 . It would control all but a small fraction of the nickel supply of the world . To close the deal , speculators foresaw a split-up of International Nickel common stock , followed by an exchange of both International and Mond stock for shares in the new trust . Trading in securities of both companies , the Toronto Stock Exchange went through the busiest day in its history . <P>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
