President George M. Eastman of the Eastman Kodak Co. , last week again assumed championship of calendar reform . <P> There are three principal defects in the present ( Gregorian ) calendar : 1 ) Three divisions of the year ( months , quarters and half years ) are of unequal length . Months vary from 28 to 31 days in length , quarters from 90 to 92 days , half years from 181 to 184 days . 2 ) The month is not an even multiple of the seven-day week . Except for February each month contains four weeks plus two or three days . For 1927 , January , April , July , October and December have five Saturdays , other months but four . Day names and dates change each month . 3 ) The calendar is not fixed ; it changes each year . Because the ordinary year has one day over 52 weeks , the date of the month falls each year on a different day of the week from the preceding year . <P> Methods of subdividing the year ( calendars ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using twelve 30-day months . The five extra days ( six in leap years ) they celebrated as holidays . Julius Caesar gave six odd months 31 days and February only 29 ( 30 in leap year ) . Emperor Augustus Caesar , jealous of his Uncle Julius ' month July , gave to August 31 days also , and shifted other months to the present reckoning . In 1582 Pope Gregory corrected the calendar , which had lagged ten days behind astronomical time because the actual year contains 365.242 days , while the calendar year accounts roughly for 365.25 . ( The extra quarter day is made up during leap years . U. S. presidential election years are leap years . ) <P> Mr. Eastman , businessman , has found the Gregorian division of years irksome . Statistics at present are never exactly comparable . Therefore Mr. Eastman has championed the International Fixed Calendar , devised by Moses B. Cotsworth of England , and considered well worth adoption by a committee of inquiry of the League of Nations . <P> This Cotsworth-Eastman calendar would divide the year into 13 equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named exactly the same . The 13th month would be called Sol and would go between June and July . The 365th day would be called " year-day " and be numbered December 29 . In leap year the 366th day would be numbered June 29 . <P> Mr. Eastman , in supporting the revised International Fixed calendar , distributed new documents last week and called attention to potent businessmen who already favored the idea : President H. Edson White of Armour &; Co. , Chairman E. M. Beatty of the Canadian Pacific Railway , President V. M. Cutter of United Fruit Co. , President George H. Wilcox of International Silver Co. , President C. M. Chester Jr . of Postum Cereal Co. , President S. L. Willson of American Writing Paper Co. , dozens of others .
