When he struts forth in a black shirt , his round eyes wide and straining to flame like II Duce 's , Signor Francesco Marini , Director General of the Milan Schools , is a terrific sight at which small Marias and Beppos quake . <P> Zealous , he has ordered that in school hours they must all wear shirts as black as his . Fanatic , he commanded last week that every day they shall recite three new commandments , brief , pagan and patriotic . <P> Little Eddas and Peppinos have been so used to rattling off : / am the Lord thy God . . . . Thou shalt have no other gods before me . . . . Honor thy father and thy mother . . . that last week their tongues tripped and stuttered as they repeated : <P> " I am Italy , thy mother , thy sovereign , thy goddess . <P> " Thou shalt have no other mother , sovereign or goddess above me . <P> " Thou shalt honor the Government and Fascismo . " <P> Puffed and prideful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commandments to II Duce at Rome , In reply came the silence of consent . Other school superintendents throughout Italy hastened to command little lips and tongues to drill as at Milan . . . . <P> Justly , His Holiness was perturbed . From the thin Papal lips came a rebuke austere and measured : " The principles of the Fascist party are being enforced and interpreted in many cases by men who , under new names and new banners , remain enemies to the state and to religion " <P> Even non-Catholics were conscious that the new " Commandments " of Signor Marini transcend in blasphemy any utterance ever ordered to be pronounced in the schools of an avowedly Christian country . Not in all the Soviet Revolution has the like been heard in Russia . <P> Recreation and social work carried on among the youth of Italy by the Knights of Columbus , the Y. M. C. A. and various Methodist organizations are coming rapidly to a halt as the new " Young Fascist " organizations , the Balilla and the Avanguardia , are forcibly superceding them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 and , if approved , the Fascist party at 18.
