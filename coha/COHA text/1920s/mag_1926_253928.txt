Sour Grapes . Vincent Lawrence has written another play around his favorite theme . A couple , hopelessly out of love with each other , rebel against the Divine Will that bids amorous romance vanish soon after marriage . They decide to live in the illusion that they are really in love . It may be only " throwing bean bags at the Gods " but it will be a righteous gesture against divine tyranny . In their common enthusiasm for the game , they find that the spark of their former love is rekindled . The sour grapes are within reach-and sweet . The trouble with the play is that so much of this is expressed in dialog , so little in incident . Still , the dialog is crisp , frequently eloquent ; the play intelligent . Alice Brady gives a splendid interpretation of the cynical , disillusioned wife . To John Halliday is due even greater credit for his performance as the perfectly uninterested husband , devoted to his emotional ideal of love . <P> Service For Two . Your Englishman on the U.

Every time hubby is on the point of explaining all , some one knocks at the door . Hugh Wakefield cleverly stutters , gasps , grimaces , after the established manner of approved farce-comedy spouses . Pretty Marion Coakley contributes a vivid piece of work as the unextinguished Hollywood flame in Room 1912 . All this is something of a disappointment to theatregoers who remember a previous play of Martin Flavin 's , Children Of The Moon . Yet it is as good as the average farce , and cleverly executed from the box-office point of view . <P> Queen High . Seldom has Manhattan been regaled with such diverting musical entertainment . Queen High deserves all the superlatives applicable to musical comedy . <P> The audience left the theatre whistling and humming snatches from at least three definite song hits contributed by Lewis Gensler : " Do n't Forget , " " Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best . " The plot is frankly based upon that old farce , A Pair of Sixes , in which a poker hand assigns one man to the position of servant , the other to the position of master , for a whole year . The antics of elephantine Frank Mclntyre and dapper Charles Ruggles as the incompatible parties to the poker contract are enough to carry any show to success , even without the added help of droll comedienne Luella Gear , acrobatic Edwin Michaels , super-dynamic Gaile Beverly , beauteous Mary Lawlor , and a host of others . Willy Pogany made the settings . <P> Number 7 . Another English thriller has visited tired Broadway . Number 7 is the address of a forsaken tenement building which , in the course of a chilling melodrama , houses Scotland Yard detectives , criminals , innocents , relief comedians , all bent upon recapturing the Duchess 's stolen jewels . Weird entrances and exits are effected through skylights , windows , doors . Eden Gray , as heroine , lends a touch of beauty . The play , though strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
