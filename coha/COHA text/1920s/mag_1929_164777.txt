S. activities have heretofore been in Philadelphia , began as conductor of the Philharmonic . <P> In Manhattan , Artur Bodansky and the Friends of Music gave intelligent performance to Haydn 's Seasons , a mellow , pastoral oratorio unheard in the U. S. for nearly 25 years . The evening before , the Conductorless Symphony ( including nine women ) , introduced its second season .
