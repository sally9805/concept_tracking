txt It is evident that limitation of naval armaments is not going to have smooth sailing , The great Powers profess a desire to halt or curtail construction and to cut down the cost of maintenance , but no plan yet presented has met with favor . Every proposal is hailed as a step in the right direction , but each nation concerned is slow to commit Itself . The discussion is confined to those not in authority . Senator ** s resolution calling for an Lgreement by the great sea Powers to reduce naval construction by one-half during . the next five years has a good deal of support in the United States ; but , judging from the objections advanced by ARCHIBALD HuRD , the British naval specialist , the Admiralty is cool toward IL Mr. Hunt ) is often " inspired " by Whitehall  --  that is to say , he reflects its views . In this instance he contends that " a naval holiday extending over five Years " would be equivalent " to the death knell of the British fleet . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not propose more than a naval half " holiday . " Mr. HURD , thinking of the abandonment of big ship construction by Great Britain since the armistice , sees her dockyards shut up , except for repairs , and her gun-making , armorplate and torpedo plants neglected . " At the end of five years , " he says , " we should not be in a position to " build either battleships , battle crui " seers or light cruisers * * and " we might awake at the end of the " holiday to discover we still needed a navy , but that we had bartered " away the capacity for creating one . " On the other hand , the United States and Japan , he observes , would not be greatly handicapped . It is true that if the United States and Japan halved their authorized construction they could still go on building capital ships . Mr. HURD does not refer directly to the Borah resolution , and he assumes that " a naval holiday extending ever five years " has been proposed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain can afford to give up capital ship building for the present and still be strong on the sea . Rut ho is haunted by the fear that if Great Britain does not enter upon a new program of construction the United States will soon take the trident away from her . In one of his recent articles he quoted the First Lord of the Admiralty as saying that the present Government would firmly adhere to the traditional policy that " our navy " should not be inferior in strength to " the navy of other Powers . " Would it not be fair ' to conclude that Great Britain reserves the right to start construction again of units that promised to strengthen the navy , and to conjecture that her . inventors may even now be at work upon a sensation like the dreadnought of 1906 ? Japanese statesmen profess a sincere interest in limitation of armaments , with the reservation ? that Japan must have an adequate navy to protect her interests . In this dilemma or deadlock , according to the point of view , Viscount GREY approves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit , that the United States , indisputably the most influential nation , take the lead In bringing about limitation . Since the League of Nations has taken no definite action , the opportunity arises to propose a plan that would not be open to the objections which the British see in a naval holiday or " half holiday " for five years , " The way to resume is to resume " was a short cut recommonded when Congress divided about the ways and means of resuming specie Payments . Similarly , the way to naval armaments Is to act , and hot engage In a long-drawn-out controversy abaft It :
