At Wesleyan University , for safekeeping , photographing and occasional exhibiting , arrived last week eight pages of cramped and cryptic handwriting . The bushywooled savant whose pen had scratched , squiggled , crossed out and corrected was no less a personage than Germany 's Albert Einstein . These pages were the original manuscript of his Zur Ein-heitlichen Feld-Theorie ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . <P> Donors of the manuscript were Trustees George Willets Davison ( Central Union Trust Co. , Manhattan ) and Albert W. Johnston . To procure it Trustee Davison had sent his bank 's Berlin representatives to Frau Einstein with an offer to buy . Frau and Dr. Einstein , having no other offers , sold ( sum unmentioned ) . They said they would use the money for welfare work among German university students . <P> The Einstein relativity manuscript is in the Zionist University in Jerusalem ; other recent Einstein manuscripts have been purchased by London 's Baron Rothschild , given to Berlin 's Einstein Institute .               @ @ @ @ @ @
