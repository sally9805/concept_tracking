" A national militia of boys and girls between the ages of seven and 20 years " - that was what Dictator-King Alexander of Jugoslavia created last week by a pen-scratch . In Italy a similar militia , for boys only , called Balilla* has been formed by the inventor of this apt scheme for bending twigs of youth , Signor Benito Mussolini . In Belgrade Dictator-King Alexander christened his balilla " The Hawks of Jugoslavia , " dubbed his bonny six-year-old eldest son , Crown Prince Peter , " The Eternal Chief of Hawks . " <P> *Named after an Italian boy , Balilla , who distinguished himself when Austrians besieged Genoa in 1800 , by hurling a rock at the enemy .
