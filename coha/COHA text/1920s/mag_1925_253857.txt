Mrs. Wharton 's Hothouse Produce Becomes Virile <P> The Story . If you marry into Fifth Avenue society at 21 , bear a daughter when you are still fond of dancing , choke on the resultant respectability , accept a dapper clubman 's advances ' and slide out of New York Harbor with him on his yacht , leave him in Europe , later have an idyll with a boy-artist , who in turn leaves you , then it is a natural thing to settle quietly on the French Riviera .

Her severest critics have never suggested that Mrs. Wharton is not the most finished U. S. novelist of the country . But they have regarded the fruits of her work as hothouse produce-glossy plums of culture , fat melons of class , clipped hedges of morality . The flavor of irony in this latest offering indicates that even hothouse produce can be kept fairly virile . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York ) , a vigorous lady of 63 , seldom leaves the cosmopolitan stream of charming and distinguished people constantly passing through her villa at Hyres on the Mediterranean and her house in Paris .
