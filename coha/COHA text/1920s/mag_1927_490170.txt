AFTER the flower comes the fruit , in the fullness of time . The other morning we were riding a commuters ' train into town and our mind was harking back to the early summer days when the front pages of newspapers were given over exclusively to the acts of the airmen . It all seemed remote , long ago . At Pelham , a small shy man got aboard and sat down beside us  --  by the looks of him a suburbanite who might have a little home and a backyard . We soon noticed that he was eagerly reading something in the Times . It was a two-column ad on page two . Finally we were able to see that it was an announcement of the Truscon Steel Company , and it offered " Airplane Hangars  --  All Types and Sizes . " WE have just read , with interest but not with optimism , the recommendations of the Automobile Club in regard to traffic . Unless the city does something far nobler and infinitely quicker than it has ever done to date , traffic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden , and a sour joke . Park Avenue is being widened , and the city says that is a fine idea . It may be , but ten minutes after the job is finished , Park Avenue will be choked . Moreover , a couple of Italians will start digging a hole in it somewhere to get at a pipe . Traffic is always at least fifteen years ahead of the city 's provision for it . Therefore our own recommendations are drastic . We suggest from two to six broad non-stop elevated highways the length of the Island , to be erected between now and Hallowe'en  --  which is about the time it takes to put through a private building operation in this town . If , after these highways are built , the city still clogs and backs up on itself , we recommend that the Island be shut down for a period of twenty years and allowed to simmer . We are so serious about this whole business that we are now on our way downtown to present the recommendations in person . We started last Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess is to go to the Pullman Company , to buy thick , soft , warm blankets for the berths on trains in New England . We came to this decision at five o'clock this morning somewhere south of Boston toward the end of an uncomfortable night . Two hours later , still suffering , we happened to note that the name of our car was Quivero . We considered this a good name and at once thought up others fitting for the Maine trains . Two of them are Shako and Shivero . THERE are ( we speak figuratively now ) two sides to the proposed New York Central building which will span Park Avenue and through whose arches traffic will flow , as a stream beneath a bridge . From the prospectus we see that the edifice will be a beautiful thing , another magnificent tower we are to learn to love . It quite definitely removes a sec tion of sky from a section of the Avenue , however , and adds another spadeful to Manhattan 's sel f-burial . Furthermore , it sets an example . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Avenue , can endure the ignominy of unspanned spaces ? Is n't it just a question of time before the Fifth Avenue Association , gazing at Washington Square Arch , will slyly throw up a building on either side to bring it up to date ? ' TWO A.m. is the deadline for sen-timent , according to an enter-tainer in one of the town 's most enter-taining night clubs . He advises us that from midnight until two they schedule their rowdy songs , and at two sharp they switch abruptly to mellow old heartbreakers . " It 's the liquor does it , " he said , weeping gently . Price XPANSIVELY Mr. Elmer Davis , the writer , entered a bookstore the other day and picking up one of his own novels from a counter slyly wrote his own name on the flyleaf . He thereupon called the saleslady and asked the price . " That 's a two-dollar book , " said the saleslady . " Only two dollars  --  with the author 's autograph in it ? " pursued the author . " Ah , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a dollar fifty . " Colloquy VOUNG Roger Wolfe Kahn con- tinues to attract public attention almost as frequently as his eminent and industrious father , having most recently , we noted , appeared in print with a decision ( to which something happened ) to join the air race to Spokane . It might interest our readers to know that the father both realizes that he is facing the parental inevitable and is tacitly quite proud of his young son 's energy and ability . Mr. Otto Kahn has never consented to make public his attitude toward the lad 's enterprise in establishing a famous orchestra over night , and the relationship of the two , as a result , has been variously reported . We are in a position , it so chances , to report precisely what occurred when the two met after Roger Wolfe 's plans had become known . Mrs. Kahn learned first of the young man 's intentions when her son ( then under seventeen ) was departing from the Kahn home one afternoon . She asked him where he was going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few musicians for his hand . " Band ! " exclaimed Mrs. Kahn . " Yes , mother , I thought you and father had heard . " Mrs. Kahn wired her husband , then in Palm Beach . To this Mr. Kahn replied : " Let him do what he wants . Will speak to him on my return . " What happened at that interview , when father and son met , was never learned , even by the boldest and most prying reporters , but we are able to report it here approximately as it happened . We can only assure our readers that it comes from one of the best possible sources : " Father , I should Iike to put to you a few questions . " " All right . Go ahead . " " Since I took up playing in public , have I neglected my school work ? Have you had any reason to complain of lack of diligence on my part ? Have I failed in any of my examinations ? " " Not that I know of . " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time or your influence in any way ? " " No . " " Have I asked you for any money except a small advance which I could easily have obtained from any Broadway manager , and which I shall very soon repay ? " " Again my answer is ' No . ' " " Is the band which I have selected  --  I have selected it myself , have I not ? ? an unusually band , or is it just an ordinary like dozens of others ? " " I admit it is a band of unusual merit . " " If a young man of unknown parents and without means had done this , enabled himself to make his own living independently , and yet at the same time not neglected his duties at school or college , would you not have approved his course of action , patted him on the back , so to speak , and told him , ' Go to it , youngster ' ? " " That probably would have been my attitude . " " Well , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unknown and poor parents ? " Sweet LADY advises us that she no longer believes prize-fighting brutalizes the men who engage in it . She was seated near jack Dempsey and Mrs. Dempsey the second night of George White 's " Manhattan Mary " and observed that they held hands during most of the show . Directly afterward , in a confectioner 's , she observed Mr. Tunney , standing at a counter with a gray-haired gentleman . Both were in evening dress and were enjoying chocolate ice-cream sodas . Bets 4AST week we printed a few facts I about the betting in Wall Street . A gentleman conversant with thepolitical phase of matter has given us some interesting addenda to this . Elections , it seems , bring the greatest turnover . The total wagered on a presidential campaign will exceed many times that of any sporting event . Such betting always includes sums offered at what the commissioners call fictitious odds by persons specially interested in a candidate 's campaign . These odds , of course , always favor the candidate upon whom the bet is placed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show of confidence will influence the voters . The public is wiser than it once was , and as a psychological trick these bets are n't as successful as they used to be . Reports in the press , however , about " the odds in Wall Street " are not without their influence . Last year a bet of $25,000 at seven to five that Wadsworth would defeat Wagner was classed as such a wager . In years gone by it was the custom for candidates to appear in person at the commissioners ' offices , looking confident , but this practice has passed . The cash for this class of bet comes out of the campaign funds and the name of the man actually making a wager is rarely revealed . Usually it is someone of secondary importance in the candidate 's entourage . Once , through the accidental adding of a cipher , the newspapers reported a bet of this kind at ten times what it really was . The opposing candidate , a distinguished poli- tician , indignantly stormed down to the betting house and demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances . An exception to the rules was made and he was shown the name of the bettor . This he recognized as one of his opponent 's henchmen . He then offered to cover the bet , but was told it had already been snapped up . The betting commissioners profess ignorance of who takes such bets , but they are generally covered quickly by a gentleman in league with the betting campaign manager , by the commissioners themselves , or by a keen-eyed outsider who is alert for easy money . National elections frequently bring heavy wagers that there will be a change of party administration . These are offered by eminent gentlemen in the Street to offset losses they would sustain if there really was a change in party power . Thus hundreds of thousands of dollars will be wagered on the 1928 Democratic candidate by financiers who wish to play safe . They regard their investment as insurance . The biggest single winner in Wall Street betting-house annals was a gentleman from Seattle who , looking undistinguished and far from prosperous , wandered into a commissioner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman answering the company 's ad for the sale of junked office equipment . He denied this in all good humor , produced a certified check for $5,000 and said he wished to bet on Mr. Smith to defeat Mr. Miller for governor by fifty thousand votes . It was weeks before that election and such a majority was considered highly improbable . He obtained long odds . Later he produced other checks amounting to $25,000 and he got even longer odds when he bet that Smith would win by more than eighty thousand . Some of his bets were placed at one to twenty . The Westerner took $400,000 in winnings back to Seattle . Customs T is not news that ladies with charm I often manage to bring a certain amount of intoxicating liquor into this country . One we hear of left a large bottle of Benedictine on top of everything else in one of her suitcases . " What , " asked the Customs man , " is this ? " The lady gave him her sweetest smile . " Oh , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened , was not to be outdone . He tossed a bit of finery about it , closed the bag and stuck on a customs seal . " 1 . VeIl , " he said , " I guess it 's the first time a woman ever kept a secret . " Professor WE took pretzels and tea the other day with the man who knows most about painting horses . He is Professor Ludwig Koch . It seems that some one thought it would be a good idea to transfer this most r productive ( and probably the greatest ) living painter of horses from Vienna , Austria , to Hempstead , Long Island , for the international polo . In perfectly prodigious fashion he has already completed no fewer than sixteen canvases , including a portrait of Louis F. Stoddard , president of the Polo Association , and equestrian pictures for W. Averell Harriman , J. Watson Webb , Carleton F. Burke and A. Charles Schwartz . The professor is an extraordinary figure . He looks like a Brownie  --  short , with shaved head , sharp-pointed nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by narrow trousers held down by elastics under his shoes . A wide cavalry belt covered his round stomach . He brought with him his wife , Frau Koch , and Remi Kwiatkowski , former Austrian Minister to Rome , who acts as interpreter . The walls of his studio were hung with paintings which he brought here hoping to astonish America  --  diverse themes , all the way from war pictures to pastoral studies , and a large , startling canvas of Lord Byron 's Mazeppa . Thus far , however , no one except a few persons in polo circles has paid him a visit  --  and America makes him mad , anyway . " Here , " he said , " everything is monumental , even the in-d olen ce . " He is still chuckling over his only experience with an American audience . The Polo Association sent out several hundred invitations to persons to visit his studio . Hempstead being where it is , only one person showed up . He stood for a moment before a magnificent painting of a cavalry horse caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cried " Boo ! " and rushed out of the room . ? ALTHOUGH the story got around a lot last week  --  and two people say they heard it years ago anyhow  --  we will report that two business men of the garment industry were overheard in animated conversation on a bus top . Finally one of them paused and demanded : " Well , what do you think of my proposition ? " " I 'll tell you in two words , " said his associate- . " Impossible . " Secret THOSE who know both Babe Ruth and Heywood Broun have told us that they have several traits in common ; one of them , we conclude , is an inability to keep secrets . From the Profile of Mr. Broun last week we learned that he has an inclination to discuss his salary with anyone who will listen , and this reminded us of an incident in Mr. Ruth 's life some years ago . It was at the time when lie had first been signed to play with the New York Yankees . The contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disclose the salary of the budding home-run king . The management , in fact , flatly refused to give it out , There were all sorts of rumors but no facts . Came the spring training season . Every baseball correspondent was instructed to learn , if possible , the amount of Ruth 's salary . It was , we think , Mr. W. 0 . McGeehan who , through a fortuitous accident , got the facts first and was enabled to make a scoop , dear to all newspapermen 's hearts . Mr. McGeehan , en route to Florida , was passing through Georgia when the Pullman porter fell into conversation withhim . " Is you a baseball man ? " the colored gentleman inquired , dusting the while around the seat . Mr. McGeehan admitted he was by way of being one . " On mah las ' trip , " continued the porter , " Ah had anothah baseball man  --  yassuh  --  a ve'y nice genmun name of Rufe , Mistah Babe Rufe . Mistah Rufe 's doin ' well at dis heah baseball . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contrack and he showed it to me . " Change those who insist that there 1 is nothing new , we recommend one of the recumbents of the hack stand before a Washington Square restaurant . He took two visitors from England on a drive through Greenwich Village last week and at its conclusion was handed two dollars for the bill , which was $1.25 . He made a piteous face , and slowly put a thick hand into his pocket and drew out a palm of  --  Canadian money . " All I got 's this foreign money , " he said . He got the seventy-five cents . Subsequentinvestigation disclosed that this driver is known to his confreres as " The Taxidermist " ? he skins ' em all . Hostelry THE nude lady in the fountain at Fifty-eighth Street is playing to a vast new audience this week , with people moving into the new Savoy-Plaza . The terraces and balconies provide a really fine view of her ablutions , and we were surprised to note how neat and continental the little Grand Army Park looks when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hotel went through some of the motions of opening its doors . This included a dinner of quite magnificent proportions and a speech by Adolph Ochs . In a sense the Savoy is an annex to the Plaza  --  and a very handsome one . It has no ballroom . Its dining-rooms are not enormous . Large functions will still be held across the way , where ceilings are high and traditions are more than a week old . Originally , we learn , the management had the notion that the new Savoy would be a fine place into which to move the permanent tenants of the old Plaza , thus freeing the latter for the transient trade . On delicately suggesting such a step to some of these grand old permanent customers , however , it was found that they had n't the slightest intention of leaving their citadel , and that the long hop from the west side of Fifth Avenue to the east side was not in their scheme of things . That , among other considerations , led to the subsequent decision that the Savoy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could as well be used partly for transients too . The new hotel is chaste and beautiful . In some respects it is almost severely plain . The attempt has apparently been toward dignity , serviceability , and genteel durability . The rooms are larger than the average hotel room . The thirty stories of white brick are formidable above the stirring Avenue , and , like the Plaza , the Savoy has a real roof  --  one of the largest in town . Guests with high rooms on the south side are almost within clucking distance of the Heckscher rooster , guests on the north come under the golden influence of the Sherry-Netherland spire , and here and there , from window and balcony , are caught stray and important glimpses of the rowboats in the small lake , the reservoir , at least two East River bridges , the Palisades , the tops of scores of Fifth Avenue busses , and the elk in the menagerie . Properly to absorb these views some people have already signed ten-year leases . VOR the benefit of those interested X ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building is the son of Stanford White and that the policeman who stood dozens of years on the corner in front of the building has been engaged as a house detective . As he stood there he saw the square almost entirely remade to become one of the most impressive in the world , and he will probably live until its fame equals that of such places as the Rue de la Paix and Piccadilly Circus . (  --  " REAT things have , in fact , been going on in the Plaza part of town . The art centre of the city has suddenly moved up near there . We have been vaguely aware of this , but it was not until last week that we met a gentleman familiar with the development , who supplied us with the facts . Fifty-seventh Street  --  ah , proud boast  --  now has more art dealers than any other street in the world . Twenty-one of the fifty-six regular dealers in New York are to be found there now , most of them east of Fifth Avenue , and twenty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The centre , not so well defined then , used to be several blocks farther south . It seems that the northward move began with Durand-Ruel . They went to Fifty-seventh Street in 1913 . The change was generally regarded as a mistake . Now the elder Dudensing , on Forty-fourth Street for twenty years , and the Arden and Babcock galleries , have gone uptown . Various seasons for the new grouping arc given . Durand-Ruel would have moved to Forty-second Street in 1913 but they could n't find space and , what with higher and higher buildings shutting out the light , went perforce to Fifty-seventh Street . A broad street , a good north light and the natural tendency in all industries for birds of a feather to flock together seem to be the principal causes . It was not until after the war that other dealers began to follow . Career MIDDLE-WESTERN parents in search of missing daughters who have cast longing eyes at New York will find many of them , we are told , not in the Messrs . Shuberts ' choruses nor yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , at least , in the apartments of the child-hearing residents of semi-fashionable streets . Full-time governesses and nurses being too expensive , these practical folk employ " baby tenders , " who go on duty at the cocktail hour and serve through theatre and night-club time . They are not required to understand modern theories of the care of children but merely to have clean hands and pure hearts . The profession is said to be a haven for girls of culture and refinement whose chosen careers in the arts have been a little less
