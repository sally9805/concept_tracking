<P> Fifty-nine years ago when ten-month-old Vittorio Emanuele , Prince of Naples , swung a royal rattle , and 13-year-old Achille Ratti declined irregular verbs in a Milan seminary , the troops of small Vittorio 's grandfather , Vittorio Emanuele II , King of Sardinia , recently proclaimed King of Italy , stormed and breached the walls of the Papal city of Rome . <P> " I give thanks to God , " wrote Pius IX . " who has permitted Your Majesty to fill the last days of my life with bitterness . I pray God to dispense to you his mercy , which you so much need . " <P> From that day no Pope left his self-imposed " imprisonment " within the comparatively narrow confines of the Vatican , no member of the Italian Royal Family set foot on Papal ground . At last came the Lateran Treaties , re-establishing the temporal power of the Pope ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . Last week the onetime Prince of Naples , now King of Italy , called on the onetime Achille Ratti , now Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Roman Catholics , it was a day of reconciliation never to be forgotten . <P> For safety 's sake , no advance news was given of the route that the King and Queen would take in their ride from Quirinal Palace to Vatican Palace . The huge oval of St. Peter 's Square was kept free of spectators . From dawn on the day appointed , crowds of pious , enthusiastic Romans jammed the sidewalks of every street through which the royal pair could possibly pass , whiled away the long hours playing lottery games . Enterprising peddlers did a rushing business selling envelopes containing numbers shrewdly dubbed the " favorites " of the Pope , the King , the Queen . Many a Roman policeman unbent to buy tickets himself and play with the crowd . <P> Motor horns honked , grey-green soldiers snapped to present arms , and a fleet of eight cars , preceded and followed by bicycle policemen , swept through the streets . To the disappointment of the crowds , the royal procession was quite as informal as the usual public appearances of Herbert Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than made up by pomp displayed by the Supreme Pontiff . At the technical frontier of the minuscule Vatican State the eight motor cars stopped . There , brilliant in the warm December sunshine stood Commendatore Serafini , Governor of Vatican City ; Prince Massimo , Papal Postmaster General , gorgeous in hose , doublet and a stiff medieval ruff , with a red-plumed morion on his head ; and Commendatore de Mandato , general of the Pope 's Armies . Out of his automobile stepped short-legged Vittorio Emanuele III , in the grey-green and silver dress uniform of a field marshal . From his hat sprouted a white aigrette , round his neck hung the flashing gold chain of the Collar of the Annunziata , on his breast blazed medals . Towering a good head and shoulders above him stood Queen Elena . <P> She was all in white , high-necked , long-sleeved , as Vatican etiquette demands . Half shrouded by a white lace mantilla , her regal head carried a proud coronet , and upon the black cordon of Malta across her bosom depended in eight strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls .
