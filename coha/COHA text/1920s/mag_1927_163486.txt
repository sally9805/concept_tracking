About 45% of men and women who studied modern languages in college have read no French since graduation ; 57% have read no German ; and 49% have read no Spanish . This the U. S. Bureau of Education learned last week from 20,000 questionnaires sent out on the subject . Apparently that means that more than half the students study modern languages as an academic chore and make no use of them ( except on European jamborees ) after they get their degrees .
