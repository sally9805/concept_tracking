They laid Frank Bartlette Willis to rest in Delaware , Ohio , the town he had set out to make as famed as Marion . Congressmen and captains of industry attended the funeral . A Willis memorial fund was begun . Messages of condolence continued pouring in on Mrs. Willis , especially long ones from her dead husband 's colleagues in the Senate . No message moved her more than a Senate message which came , not from a Senator , but from Richard L. ( " Deacon " ) Riedel , a religiously-inclined boy commonly recognized in the Senate wing of the Capitol as Senator Willis ' favorite Senate page . <P> Wrote Richard Riedel : <P> " I was lonely to-day at the Senate with the thought that I shall never again in this world see those liquid brown eyes , that radiant , pure and majestic face or hear the cheery voice of the Senator I loved . . . . <P> " How small a place the Presidency of the United States would have been compared to the exalted position he now occupies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
