THE dresses like a business man ; he looks like a Bedouin . In his letters he signs himself with a number . And if you were to tell him that this is a characteristic of the inhabitants of Sing Sing , he would say : " Well , why not ? Perhaps we have more than that in common . " In Europe , they know him perhaps more widely than here as Alfred Stieglitz , the first and supreme master of the photograph . He has been invited to live in Germany where , they assure him , " they can use him . " Last year a crony of Albert Einstein came over and begged him to join their little group since in spirit and in work he was one of them already . But Stieglitz will never leave America . He loves his land too bitterly and too well . Where else could he hope to receive such copious draughts of unrecognition ? Where else find such occasion to suffer creatively and loudly ? Of course , 291 was once the number of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years ago . Here , our good citizens and critics had their first chance to howl at Cezanne , sneer at Matisse , gasp at Picasso , turn away from Rodin . Here our native art patrons , faced by a gray-haired , exquisite-lipped seer who never was silent and who , talking wildly of himself , seemed miraculously to be revealing all the world , were made for the first time to feel that their purchases of Rembrandt and Reynolds were not so smart as they had thought . They were amazed at being forced to look at native atrocities signed Marin , Dove , Walkowitz , Weber , Hartley  --  which at the end they bought at European figures . Then came the war . In the deluge of general progress , the gallery at 291 dwindled and disappeared . Even the old building had to give way for a modern structure . Stieglitz recalled that he had been a photographer of parts before the times conspired to make him chief prophet to the Philistines and a furnisher of food , roofs and spiritual nurture to a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even among the Philistines . He began once more to turn his camera upon the faces of men , the bodies of women , upon the skies and the trees . He saw deep ; he made his camera see deep . Issued forth that procession of inscrutable records which artists and scientists agree to accept as unprecedented marvels : for they arc mere sincere , mechanical equivalents of natural scenes and stuffs and yet possess the plastic qualities , the compositional depth of works of art . These are phases of the man : his pictures , his marketing and boosting ( of course without a fee ) of the pictures of others , his perpetual personal care of the makers of pictures . But Stieglitz has another activity which is constant  --  and essential . He talks . He has talked for thirty years . His photographs are marvels ; his educational influence on the cultural milieu has been far greater than that of twenty preachers and professors . But all this is as naught compared to the prophetic and Homeric nature of his talk . Once , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Stieglitz was putting photography " on the map " , he went to London purposely to talk to Bernard Shaw who had said some silly things on the subject . He caught cold on the channel and when he arrived at his hotel , he had lost his voice . He was lunching with Shaw on the morrow . He wired , breaking his engagement and left England at once . Unable to talk to Shaw , he did not wish to see him : he did not wish to hear Shaw talk to him . This anecdote reveals much of Alfred Stieglitz , and of his ruthless self-direction . The most monomaniac money magnate is a loafer and wool gatherer in the business of earning , compared with the intensity of Stieglitz in his business of seeking . Quite literally this man is devoting all his life to a quest of the truth . Not a tithe of it , mind you : not what is left over after filling his belly , after getting on in the world , after serving his friends , after loving his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work and play have no reality for this man , save insofar as they serve him in his quest . He has helped more persons than is required by any church : but he does not care about persons . He has launched the art of a new century in a new world : but he does not care about art . He is hunting the truth . And like a vigilant bug whose antenna ' are forever vibrant before it , so the voice of Stieglitz , which never tires , never subsides  --  which is his instrument of contact with the raw materials of life -- the people whom he meets  --  from whom he extracts his spiritual food . You will see now why Stieglitz 's talk differs from that of other men ; and why , being unable to talk to Shaw , he did not rare to- see him . Stieglitz will talk to you for two hours . At the end whereof , you may be exhausted : but he knows you . His words have agglutinated you , digested you , swallowed you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have become wholly part of Stieglitz . You will now understand the true purpose of his exhibitions  --  the old ones at 291 Fifth Avenue or the more recent at the Anderson Galleries . It is true that when Stieglitz gives a Show , the best of America or Europe is likely to be on the walls . This is because the best is bait for the best people . And Stieglitz wants the best people to come to his shows , so that he can talk to the best people  --  so that he can stimulate the best people ; turn them into his own spiritual food . Innocent art lovers complain . " We come here to admire these things , " they say , " and the noisy old man talks so much we ca n't see the pictures . " They do not understand . Stieglitz does not care whether they see the pictures or no : he wants to see them . And his eyes are words , his digestive apparatus is words : with his words he " eats ' ern alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentimental gloss which for many years our young adventurers in the arts have been ? writing , about Stieglitz . It is true that he used to have a table at the old Holland House where any hungry artist was sure at least of a lunch ; it is true that Arthur Dove , John Marin , Abraham Walkowitz , Georgia O'Keeffe , Max Weber , Marsden Hartley , etc. , etc. , were fathered by this man ; and it is true that he will show to any visitor at any hour his own photographs a true Diving Con-media , ranging from the Inferno of his early pictures of the city , through the Purgatory of his portraits of friends , to the Paradise  --  the latest set of studies of cloud , sun , mist , etherial space that hold a divinity and an infinity of vision , But all of these Ore means to the Stieglitzian end . He is hunting , feeling , for the truth . His friends and the art of all the ages are to him what mice and monkeys are to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of Life itself , trying to find out what Life is . Can you imagine God moving a finger over His own Body in an effort of self-understanding ? That slightly metaphysical image is the closest symbol I can get for Stieglitz. himself is such a finger . Not his mind , not his will  --  his very physical life is Search . And that unfaltering voice which has worn out so many of his friends is his essential feature : moving forever forward into the Mystery , seeking , testing , enveloping , passing .
