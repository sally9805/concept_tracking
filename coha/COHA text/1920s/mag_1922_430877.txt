 | THE IRON MAN AND THE MIND I MEN go to machines under the same compulsions which have sent them into field and forest , ocean-lane , and battlefield , since ever the world began ? their needs and their instincts . Continuing attempts by the innovating animal , Man , to feed , clothe , and satisfy himself with the least effort , brought forth naturally , and in process , the application of machinery to production , at first haltingly , but latterly with a rush which finds this generation well on its way to as complete automatization as human nature is capable of sustaining . The limiting force resides , not so much in the ability of our most enterprising selectmen to mechanize the planet , as in their seemingly more restricted ability to make the job appear worth while to those who come to grips with machinery in action ? the common folk . Economic Man is an abstraction essential to scientific enquiry , though nowhere found in the flesh , and , where approximated , not pleasant to have as a neighbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , as well as Economic Man . He loves , mates , breeds , fights for and labors for his wife , his home , his children . And presently he dies , in the hope of an extension of life beyond the grave , and is buried with honor by his kind , In his life he has many governors ; among them the state is sovereign and the shop parvenu . This composite mystery enters the shop and takes his place beside the machine , to use a small but definite fraction of his powers in assisting it to produce and distribute-goods . Call him Number 3141 if you choose ; nevertheless , he differs from Number 3140 and 3142 and all other men living or dead . No one , from this time forward to eternity , ever will be cast in exactly the same mould as he . Labor is more than labor ; each labor unit is also an individual , immeasurably dear to himself even in despair . What the shop precisely wants , it can not hire . It may want , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not exist detached from lusts , faiths , superstitions . It may want eyes , sensitive fingers , or specialized knowledge ; they are not to be divorced from nerves and prejudices . Instead , the labor market presents men and women in infinite variety ; but in each is incorporated something , he it little or much , which the shop can not use . The shop picks and chooses , combs and examines , consults records ; nevertheless , the chosen ones carry inside the gates that which may result in an appeal from its regimen to the anarchy of force , or to the authority of the state ? the appeal to Demos or to Caesar . This mental luggage , largely superfluous from the standpoint of immediate industrial need , may be catalogued for analysis ; but the catalogue , however extended , remains a convenient lie , since each element merges with all  | the others and affects all the others . With this attainder established , the mental luggage of the man going to the machine may be listed briefly as instincts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct ? those qualities of mind and spirit which , in their interplay , not only establish the individuality of their possessor , but also govern his reactions to authority and to the responsibilities involved in home and social relationships . These primary qualities of the mind have their roots in the dawn of life on this planet : in Creation , if you deny Darwin ; in intertidal scum , if you accept Wells . But , whatever their origin , they are the fruits of race-experience through many generations ; and under the lash of sex we shall pass them on , perhaps with minor changes , to our successors , Our contribution to the subconscious mind is not likely to be as rich and important as the press-agents of our braggart era declare . Indeed , we may influence the subconscious more than any preceding generation , and yet add but a mite to its store , so ancient is its origin and so vital its accumulations . The subconscious mind may be reckoned the reservoir of human experience ; here is the cause of Man 's rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his social and political institutions ; here the explanation , perhaps never to be unraveled , of his greeds , wars , sins , as well as of his virtues , loyalties , and visions . Subtract the subconscious from high intelligence ? the residue is not Man , with his hates and loves , urges and repressions ; but a monstrosity of greed and reason . Subtract it from a person of low intelligence ; and the result is a semblance of the bestial . Both asocial : the one , a menace through his efficiency ; the other , a menace through his deficiency . Therefore , it is of the subconscious mind that one may say : This is the reality of human existence . truth about human affairs is not to found altogether in what is written ' the bond and certified to in the reco You must consult the instincts ; ' cm must go back to the wells of life . into those misty , uncertain depths diligently enough , and you may get some hint , however faint , of the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comes now this heavy-laden , complex Ego to the machine . Pleasant . indeed , for both parties , if the management could separate the workman from such mental luggage as is superfluous inside , and check it at the door , to le reassumed upon return . How simple if the mental man could shuck his cravings as the physical man doffs his coat ! Yet , until we know more of the meaning of life , it is perhaps just as well that Man is indivisible , and that the shop must take the useless with the useful . the bitter with the sweet . For it is the unknown and unassayable which gives life its zest , labor its hope , and industry its adventure . No doubt , those mental traits and prepossessions which we group and label under the convenient title , subconscious , ' at one time had clearer economic significance than they possess at present . However men compete for their livings , those attributes which make for survival tend to be passed on . while those less utilitarian are eliminated under the stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern carries to the machine must at some time have been of conscious value to enough of his ancestors to fix that trait for survival . Else it must have been sunk without trace in the laborious business of keeping alive . Labor is the price of life . The tree labors in growth ; the field-mouse labors in each search for grain . Man differ , from other animals in that he is con-pl81 scious of his labors and articulate concerning them . Labor-pain stirs him to thought and expression ; but he may be even more distressed by , though less conscious of , his indirect labor-strains . Industrial labor-pain , being easily recognized for what it is , can be alleviated or compensated for inside the shop ; labor-strain , on the other hand , less simple of diagnosis , has a way of eluding direct action and spreading out and down , until , massed and complicated , it presents itself , not to the principals in their principal relation , but to society and the state ? to the principals , that is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by and large , gives us labor-problems into which the state injects itself only as a last resort ; while broad and continued labor-strain begets social and political problems , powerful cross-currents of opinion , which first agitate the homes of the humble , and in due course agitate the parliaments of the world . With this distinction between laborpain and labor-strain established , but remembering always that the twain are more easily separated on paper than in the flesh , let us examine the effect of automatic and semi-automatic machinery upon the minds of its attendants ? the mill operatives . Such machines make relatively small demands upon the wits of their companions ; the operative 's job is more passive , mentally , than active . Once his limited function is learned , once the man knows how to place standardized material in proper , predetermined fashion , he can earn his pay without further mental effort . He must be attentive , dot and carry one exactly so , because the machine is valuable , and failure to move when and as directed may cost his employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man is not driven , so much as paced ; his usefulness depends upon his never failing the strident call of the Iron Man . He nurses his charge , feeds it , relieves it of produce , and perhaps makes slight repairs in a jam . But , if the case is serious , he calls a machinist , just as an infant 's nurse calls for the physician in emergency . I watched a man shove metal rings across six inches of space , to a guide from which they were taken automatically through the machine , emerging slotted some seconds later , without more human ado . That was his job from morning until night , his pay depending upon how many slotted rings passed inspection . Eyes concentrated on his little platform , one hand moving thus , the other so , in unending repetition , he missed not one revolution of the wheels , which were grinding out his life even as they ground out the goods . Economically he was part of the machine ? an automatic feeder who chanced to be flesh-and-blood-andmind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that particular job by a mechanical extension of that particular Iron Man , since the human was doing nothing that could not be done better , by metal in motion . Assembling of interchangeable machined parts proceeds , in efficient plants , with almost equally minute division of function . Your automobile frame , let us say , is hoisted so that it may acquire axles . Then it moves along a conveyer , before gangs of men , each of whom performs thereon a certain specified task for which just so much time is allowed , because the conveyer moves at a fixed rate of speed , and each gang is allotted a space alongside , and moves forward and back in that space as the conveyer works . One attaches the right front-wheel ; another the left rear-wheel ; a third tightens certain screws with a pneumatic wrench . Let a single human fail in his assignment , and rather than permit that delay to clog 18t THE IRON ICI AN  | the whole line of cars in process , the lagging unit is pulled out of line to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time a naked frame starts down the assembly line , a shrewd and swiftly moving division of labor has completed thereon a finished motorcar , capable of moving to the loading docks under its own power . Its powerplant has been both painted and dried within the hour . To it have been given a body highly polished , curtains , cushions , tools , and , finally , a tag setting it apart for someone near or far ? Doe Kennicott of Gopher Prairie , or the Gaekwar of Baroda . In that swift progress hundreds of men have worked upon each car , combining into effectiveness the work of other thousands , whose produce is brought up by truck from storerooms and source-factories , and rushed into assigned positions . Each man performs the same task over and over : tightens identical nuts , lifts identical parts off a rack , and applies each one of them precisely to something like its predecessor to the thousandth of an inch . This accurate , monotonous toil goes on swiftly , amid hissing air-valves and paintstreams , roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving and departing . As evidence of the organizing faculty in master minds , as a study in unity and synchronized power over divers beings and things , the action is impressive , in totality almost beautiful ; but for its individual contributors it leaves something to be desired as an expression of the art of life . Not altogether for this , surely , is Man made . Some of these operations involve much muscular effort , others little ; but , whether little or much , each operative uses the same set of muscles for approximately the same length of time in each repetition of his assigned operation . Roustabouts enjoy far more of the lux- ury of variety in toil than mach ' tenders in automatized factories . I The operating of automatic and automatic machinery evolves evid tending to show that fatigue , instead being simply weariness from m stretched too much or too often . rather a pathological condition , due the poisoning of the system th over-secretion of the endocrinal gla Whatever the theorizing as to en crinal glands , it is probably true t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort is longed beyond the normal fatigue Ii which outpouring causes patholog ' fatigue , indicated by preternat u activity . This theory , held by competent investigators , and advanced them with reservations proper in matter where exactness is difficu seems to explain , as well as receive su port from , many of the reactions of industrial operatives to their labors . In general , machine-production d goods involves less muscular and sensory strain than that put forward under the handicraft system . Fatigue in industrial workers must be ascribed more to monotony in movement and problem than to foot-pounds of energy expended . One may use merely his finger-tips feeding metal discs into a machine , and yet be as weary in the evening as if he had been swinging an axe . The lumberjack 's weariness is an all-round fatigue , and he is ready for bed at sundown ; while industrial workers seem moved to abnormal activity after working hours . My fellow citizens , most of whom work in factories where the industrial function is minutely divided , and where machines set the pace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men reestablish their equilibrium by gardening prodigiously , and tinkering furiously around their homes = a socially satisfactory adjustTHE IRON &IAN; AND THE MIND 188 ment . The homeless rush hither and thither by motor when they are flush ; or wander aimlessly around the streets when they are broke . Books and quiet conversation are a bit too tame for men who feel that , while they get their living in the shop , they must live their Gres outside the shop . This may be explained as Nature 's effort to correct a nerve-distortion resulting from the exercise of certain muscles and faculties while all others are held out of use . Glandular secretions , roused by an over-stressed fraction of the anatomy , spread beyond that fraction to stimulate the rest of the man into heightened activity . These men are in a condition parallel to that in which many a business man finds himself after prolonged concentration upon a problem which defies satisfactory solution . He becomes too tired to sleep ; works feverishly ; and , unless he lets down , breaks down . Either type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave thrills temporarily blotting out the discontent that overlays their lives . II At the root of this discontent lies the difficulty of adjusting human beings to modern industry . Race-inheritance fits us for other , simpler pursuits . For unnumbered generations we white folks have been building up resistance to , and recovering from , the fatigue which follows muscle-labor . Except for the comparatively small fraction of our ancestors who went in for learning , trade , or the handicrafts , ( the life of the masses , until the Industrial Revolution began in England , about 1765 , had been the slow life of soil and water ? agriculture , hunting and fishing , with occasional relapses into war ; occupations requiring intense physical exertion through short periods , and allowing frequent let-ups . Until so recently Man worked by the sun and the seasons instead of by the calendar and the clock . Even the villein ploughing his lord 's glebe could stop for a chat with his neighbor passing on the highway . Thrills a-plenty filled common lives ; there were the touch-and-go of the chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look in through the servant 's door upon the festivities of the manor house ; and always a close , if servile , relation with his boss . Bond the villein was , but his bond held both ways ? upon master no less than upon man . The worker at least had the blessing of security in his job , now so uncertain : he could not be fired , even as he could not hire himself away . That simple existence seems to be the kind of life for which the common man is constituted . Physically , he goes his best gait for a hundred yards , fells his third tree more accurately than he fells his thirtieth , ploughs his straightest furrow toward the rising sun . He needs a measure of monotony in toil ; shifting at quick-step from this job to that bothers him but the work which gives him most satisfaction , and which , all things considered , he does best , is that furnishing variety in detail with sameness in essentials . ) Were every tree placed exactly like every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . one direction , with no nice problem of adjustment presenting itself to the common sense and skill of the axe-man , then our lumberjack would return to his shack , not only more fatigued in body than usual , but infinitely more weary in his mind . If a high-grade carpenter faced the prospect of building identical houses all the rest of his life , with never a chance to revel in a bit of improvisation , would he relish that prospect ? Hardly . What he wants ? what every man above the grade of moron craves in toil ? is a chance to express his personality within the limits of a specialty in which he knows him184 THE IRON MAN  | self proficient . Even the scavenger is not without his craft-pride . Your carpenter desires no other trade ; he would rather build a hen-coop than paint his own dwelling ; but inside his trade he wants a bit of leeway to devise ways and means , and a living hope of quiet adventure . Not enough variety to upset him , but enough to stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the common man 's ideal job . Variety in minors compensates for the major monotony . In the beginning , and for aeons thereafter , when Man , in an environment niggardly in food and crowded with dangers , was getting set ' in build and character , labor ? the price of life ? must have been a constant succession of adventures . Merely keeping alive involved prowling and stalking , sally , pounce , battle , flight . Power to put all into a single effort determined whether one returned to the home-lair or died miserably on the heath . Little by little , to satisfy accumulating economic wants and social ambitions , Man tied himself down to occupations more prosaic ? to agriculture , to the tedious shaping of tools from stone , and the application of manual skill and fire to earth-materials . Ability to withstand monotony then acquired survival value ; but there continued that zest for variety inside the frame of monotony , that zest for projecting his unique self upon his environment . From the projection of these individualities upon matter through toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simple tools , now standardized , must have measured the individuality of their originators and adapters , just as innovations in modern mechanics publish to a critical world the personal triumphs of those who dare to originate . The more play we allow this instinct for variation , the swifter economic evolution must be ; and , con- versely , when it has no play , in tion ceases . Civilization , on its mat side , has been built little by lit through trial and error rather t design ? by the personal energies the world 's artificers and organi rather than by the plans of its statement . Monotony in labor , then , is the price ! men pay for living together in order and security ? one of the returns that society exacts from the individual is exchange for safety , comfort , and opportunity for advancement within the group . But monotony intensifies laborstrain ; and unless the laborer can find release therefrom , through variations of physical and mental effort in the minutiae of the job , his weariness si upon him like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that : let him use what ingenuity he has ; and his Ego , somewhat different from all others under the sun , is compensated in a degree for the surrender of his freedom in the larger concerns of groupliving , which surrender society demands and enforces through law and custom . But , lacking this compensation of variety in toil , human nature finds the social order oppressive . This seems to me at least as definite a cause of the present resentment against the established order as those more frequently cited ) and the situation is not altogether relieved by reflecting that , as long as the instinct toward variation is repressed by the machines themselves . its consequences will continue in some measure as long as machines are operated , no matter whether they are owned by private persons or by the state . How long may a person 's innovating tendencies be repressed without dulling his mind ? Suppose our first-rate carpenter undertook a two-year stint laying identical floors in identical onestory houses . Would he be as good an  | all-round craftsman , as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind ? Obviously not . He might =row more deft in what he had to do ; but surely he would grow more clumsy in what he has no c ) ance to do . He would emerge from that job less efficient for the all-round work of the community , less sure of himself , less secure in his home and his living , less interesting as a personality and less valuable a , a neighbor and citizen . To what extent this decline in the individual might affect his descendants , and through them the race , is an interesting question reserved for future discussion . This devolution of the individual is what Secretary Hoover notes when he says : ( The vast , repetitive processes are dulling the human mind . ' And againWe must take account of the tendencies of our present repetitive industries to eliminate the creative instinct in their workers , to narrow their fields of craftsmanship , to discard entirely the contributions that could be had from their minds as well as from their hands . Indeed , if we are to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulling of these sensibilities . ' So far as the great majority of the workers are concerned , modern industry presents this phenomenon ? the dulling of the mind ? on a scale unequaled in extent , and to a degree unequaled in intensity , by anything on record in history . Slavery of the galley was not more uninspiring , per se . Military orders may be more imperious than those of industry ; but at least the military life provides change of scene and problem from time to time , some release from routine on pay , much companionship , and occasional thrills ? all appealing to the common man because they fit in so neatly with the inherited memories lying at the back of his mind . Industrial efficiency calls for the elimination of many of these boons ? for close concentration upon the unvarying task , for suppression of variations in toil , for rigid control of the work-environment , for elimination of distracting excitements , for subordination of personalities , for the reduction of the common man to the status of automaton . III Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ranks of the army as examined for the draft ? an adult male , with an intelligence by test of from fourteen to sixteen years . He is a dependable being on the average , capable of taking care of himself and his family in ordinary times and not too complicated situations ; fairly adaptable ; amenable to law and social usages ; requiring and accepting leadership in all pursuits calling for special knowledge or quick decision ; fundamentally loyal to his country and its institutions ; inherently conservative and provincial ; shaking down after the first flush of youth into a steady , plodding citizen , more prone to excitement over little things than to thought over fundamentals ; strongly sexed , but controlling his sex-calls more or less successfully with the aid of church and state , of which institutions he is ever the pillar and support . Not a complete portrait , but ' t will serve ! This is he who , in the main , mans industry ; and upon whom modern industry grinds . It grinds less upon those definitely above or below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen in devising , sage in planning , and strong in pushing men and materials into action ? these find in industry broad and lucrative outlets for their relatively stronger instincts toward dominance . Men of this sort find capital , invent machines , improve processes , route materials , organize shops , 186 THE IRON MAN  | produce goods in quantity , and sell them to the ends of the earth . No danger of repetitive processes and automatic machinery dulling these highpowered minds ; on the contrary , these are as manna to their hungry souls . By reducing room for error in operations , by contracting the play of human fallibility in toil , by increasing man-power , the Iron Man has freed business of important limitations , relieving enterprises of what were once serious difficulties . But the slack so gained is more apparent than real . Competition , never resting , drives them on ever and ever to more refined machines , better coordination of effort ; and presently they find in social unrest , plant obsolescence , high labor-turnover , and lowered morale , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . In the old days of more skill and less machines , the executive problem was to master materials ; now the executive problem is to a much greater degree the handling of men . Neither does the Iron Man get on the nerves of those below the average mentality . He is a consistent friend of the defective . Just as deafness is an advantage in certain industrial occupations , ? our shops employ many mutes with satisfaction both ways , ? so mental lacks may become assets for certain industrial purposes . Given enough sense to master simple routine occupations , and enough appreciation of duty or fear of relatives to come to the shop regularly , the below-average person can soon be adjusted industrially . And , when adjusted , the moron will be found immune to many of the pricks which irritate the normal man into seeing red , less fretted by monotony , less worn by rhythmic clatter . The less mind one has , the less it resents that invasion of personality which is inseparable from large-scale and mechanized enterprises . I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is working out in our day . puts a premium on mental deficiency . Men who take more to the machines than do the morons are subjected to a rigid selective process by the Iron Man . The law of use or lose ' begins its inexorable operation upon their minds as well as upon their muscles and nerves . Just as muscle or nerve , unused , refuses to yield its utility without a struggle . causing its possessor pain and incon- venience , so those mental qualities un- used in toil continue to struggle for existence to the limit of their strength . It is easy to find in any industrial town the shop-sick man ? upset , out of sorts . doubtful if he can stick it out . The man is out of harmony with himself ; his mind is divided against itself . The weaker the Ego at the start , the short- er the struggle , and the more quickly does the individual become shop-broke . ' Some refuse to wait so long , and get out , either fired for insubordination , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or going out voluntarily to search for jobs more to their liking . Sometimes they merely shift from one shop to another ; every factory town has its disappointed rainbow-chasers , who never stay put , and who never learn that the Iron Man is about the same everywhere . Many , however , drift back to the farm and other less mechanized occupations . Labor-turnover is heavy ; that is where this labor-strain shows in the shop records . The workman and his boss may adjust , in one way or another , disputes on wages and shop-conditions ; but of necessity they have difficulty in treating this intangible , indefinite , not always recognized or recognizable , work- neurosis arising from the cleavage be-tween old and new , between the inno-vation ? the Iron Man ? and that ancient inheritance of the human ?  | the mind . So one man goes , and another , and another ; their several departures , listed together , become evidence of so many loss-items to the shop . The expense of breaking in a single novice may be small ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with in quantity , and a definite economic back-lash . Let a key machine be idle even a few hours , and bang goes far more than sixpence ! So the leaders of industry are forced , from strictly economic motives , to consider the psychological aspects of toil . The remedies they apply are of infinite variety ? shifting men from one job to another as an antidote for monotony and a cure for maladjustments ; more rigid selection in employment , with growing emphasis on the mental as well as physical fitness of the novices for the jobs open ; welfare-work in all its phases : housing-developments , grievance committees , shop-councils , employee representation , bonus and profit-sharing plans ? all aimed at relieving in one way or another , either directly or by distraction of interest , the nerve-tension under which the average man suffers when he is brought into double harness with the Iron Man . However , the best friend of both man and master , in this connection , is habit ? simple , old-fashioned habit . If one does the same thing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be trained through use even to the point where the tender of the machine may do his work accurately without undue strain , while his mind busies itself elsewhere . The strain increases , of course , as the work is prolonged ; but given reasonable timelimits , there is ground to believe that a man thoroughly shop-broken and well adjusted to his job may get a good deal of pleasure from this autistic thinking while at work . But autistic thinking may be painful as well as pleasurable . The day-dreaming of a well-balanced , not too highly organized mind , at peace with itself and with the world , is one thing ; the fretting of a mind under worry or injustice is quite another . If we conceive . habit to be a barrier behind which the mind may shelter itself against fatigue , then we may say that the assaulting force must succeed if the workperiod be stretched unduly ; and , moreover , that it will carry the habit-barrier much sooner than that , if the mental forces behind the barrier are discordant and undisciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mental health must take a threefold path : first , to select individuals carefully for given jobs ; second , to adjust both pace and hours to the individual 's powers of resisting fatigue ; and , third , to hasten such changes in the shop , home , and community as will tend to content the common man with his lot , reduce his worry and envy , and increase his delight in life . At the automatic machine a man must stew , mentally , in his own juice ; in so far as he thinks at all , his thought must range away from his task . If he fears dismissal , if he thinks of himself as bested by unknown forces or cheated by individuals , if he finds himself and his home the playthings of tragedy or the butts of injustice , then his autistic thought is bound to be subversive . One sort of man becomes melancholy ; another rages against things as they are . On the other hand , he whose life is even and sustained by faith , he whose memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task to plan his holiday , turn over again the delights of last week , and settle the small but inspiring problems of his home and garden . To put the machine operative into this frame of mind , where he is insulated more or less against the early corn188 THE IRON MAN  | ing and more devastating inroads of pathological fatigue , must ever be a first concern of industrial society , as well as of the shop which profits by his content . The state must do its bit by seeing that he gets full measure of justice ; the community by providing facilities for mental and physical recreation ; and the shop by internal adjustments calculated to increase the worker 's confidence in the security of his job and his sense of cooperation in the enterprise . All-important , also , is the cultivation of self-discipline. in the individual . Much restlessness arises from envy , lack of disposition to make the best of things until better appears , and failure to train the emotions toward cheerfulness . Mental hygiene in home and school is a positive need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines and cooperate in large-scale enterprises . How the emotions may be schooled is set forth briefly in Dr. C. B. Burr 's trenchant book , Practical Psychology and Psychiatry , now in its fifth edition ? and a mine of wisdom . The relation of emotion in the abstract to muscular expression is profitable for study , ' says Dr. Burr , not only because of its psychological interest , but because of its practical bearing upon human conduct . Clench the fist and shut the teeth firmly , and there immediately arises in consciousness a sense of resentment , of pugnacity . Draw down the corners of the mouth , and the emotional tone takes on a shade of depression . This has an important relation to mental development . To cultivate the muscular play that accompanies pleasurable states of feeling must inevitably affect the disposition of the individual in a favorable manner . ' Thus he who does the necessary with a show of willingness finds , before the task is done , that the is truly willing its accomplishment . Be good and you 'll be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or you 'll be miserable , ' is a precept of business which seems to have crowded the older ideal out of public education , and to have jostled it sadly even in the home . An educational s% tern over-emphasizing efficiency must needs wreck itself in time , because th can never be quite enough of the good things of life at hand to satisfy all . A homely philosophy of give-and-take. a gospel of endurance as contrasted with acquisition , the truth that life 's best values are spiritual rather than economic ? these the school should teach . no less than the home , to young folk who presently shall take their places beside the machines in industrial routine . Yet such preparation will not be sufficient of itself . As those once more potent ideals of contentment in toil have been pushed aside so strenuously by industrialism , so also they can not be rehabilitated in any compelling measure until the industrial status quo is modified by state , community , and shop in such wise that training for contentment may withstand the attrition of work-relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises made to youth that joy , honor , and abundance shall reward toil , sobriety , and loyalty . it is idle to expect any generation of American factory-hands to bear stoically their participation in industry .

This . spread as it is over the mass , filters down upon home and state , generating social problems which , in a democracy . shortly become political . In our average man , the will to survive is more potent than the will to power ; security means more to him than opportunity ; he is static rather than dynamic ; and the state is the highest expression of THE IRON MAN AND THE MIND 189  | his dominant ideal ? to live comfortably under conditions in which he can be true to his not-too-demanding nature . To the state , therefore , the man of the masses gives , as clearly as he can , his mandate .

The politician with his ear to the ground serves this function , at least ? he gets the case of the plebs before the state . Ensues then a new phase of the old , old duel between the state and the captains , going forward in our day as the State versus its legal children , the Corporations , in which the captains , for greater power and profit , group themselves . One finds in the current phase of this contest small promise that the state , by legal processes , can relieve the common man from the labor-strains incident to automatic production . It may relieve his feelings temporarily , with restrictions that are more noise than substance ; he may draw some comfort from seeing the state crack its long whip over the boss ; but political coercion has its limits , both economic and constitutional .

Because mind must be cured by mind , or stay sick ; because human maladjustments yield only to the human touch , the mental phase of the problem of automatization in industry challenges particularly the community and the shop ; to them we must look for the chief ameliorating influences which shall permit the common man to withstand , without deterioration of mind , association with the Iron Man . And because the man at the desk moves more swiftly than the folk in the town meeting , the shop may well become the more effective of the two . Once management grasps clearly the situation created by the grinding of the automatic machine upon the mind of the worker , the challenge to proximate service and ultimate interest can not but inspire the directing intelligences of American industry . Their hegemony , indeed , depends upon their leaping into this breach without delay . 186 THE IRON MAN produce goods in quantity , and sell them to the ends of the earth .

Competition , never resting , drives them on ever and ever to more refined machines , better coordination of effort ; and presently they find in social unrest , plant obsolescence , high labor-turnover , and lowered morale , that they have merely substituted one sort of executive vexation for another . In the old days of more skill and less machines , the executive problem was to master materials ; now the executive problem is to a much greater degree the handling of men . Neither does the Iron Man get on the nerves of those below the average mentality . He is a consistent friend of the defective . Just as deafness is an advantage in certain industrial occupations , ? our shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental lacks may become assets for certain industrial purposes . Given enough sense to master simple routine occupations , and enough appreciation of duty or fear of relatives to come to the shop regularly , the below-average person can soon be adjusted industrially . And , when adjusted , the moron will be found immune to many of the pricks which irritate the normal man into seeing red , less fretted by monotony , less worn by rhythmic clatter . The less mind one has , the less it resents that invasion of personality which is inseparable from large-scale anc mechanized enterprises .
