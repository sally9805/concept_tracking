August in Washington , the nine Justices of the U. S. Supreme Court put on their black robes , convened , took up business where they left it off in June . Their docket was in most satisfactory shape : only 283 cases carried over from the 1926 term ; only 279 new cases so far . Five of the 283 old cases were already under advisement . For the first day 's sitting , the clerk of the Court called up 34 others for argument . Of the 279 new cases , some 250 were merely requests for review which could be quickly disposed of . The Supreme Court does not rush at its work with its sleeves rolled up , even figuratively speaking . Before beginning a long session of dignified hearing , conning , analyzing and resolving of arguments , the nine Justices presented themselves to the President to show him , in effect , that the ultimate wisdom of the nation was again ready to have perplexed people " draw near and give their attention . " <P> The President shook their hands : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotund , genial , with an earthquake chuckle and an eye that twinkles even in sternness . He dictates , revamps and redictates his opinions , guarding his strength from the rigors of writing . He walks for a half-hour every day . He has installed an elevator in his house to save walking upstairs to his study . Of all the Justices , he truly is least classifiable as " liberal " or " conservative . " Radicals view with alarm his $10,000 income from steel bonds . Rock-ribbed bankers wonder at his large humanity . <P> Oliver Wendell Holmes , 86 , whose mustache and sympathies flow even more freely than Mr. Chief Justice Taft 's . Son and namesake of the poet , wounded in chest and foot as a Civil War volunteer , Mr. Associate Justice Holmes represents all that is spirited , liberal and scholarly in New England . <P> Willis Van Devanter , 68 , from mountainous Wyoming , as conservative as a Dutch canal , and as calm . <P> James Clark McReynolds , 65 , who served President Roosevelt as Assistant Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high bench in 1914 . He is a Kentucky-born bachelor , standing beside Mr. Associate Justice Van Devanter for a conservatism more intellectual than innate . <P> Louis Dembitz Brandies , 71 , who might , were it not disrespectful , be called the Supreme Court 's Seidlitz powder , so swiftly does he fume and sparkle when he senses that the rights of man are being infringed by right of might . He was another of President Wilson 's appointees , and a much discussed . His wife takes active interest in liberal movements , even in the Sacco-Vanzetti affair-and he approves . Quick , subtle , his steps of mind and foot have a resilience that is unexpected in the old round room of grave decisions .
