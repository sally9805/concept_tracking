IT must be wonderful , simply fascinating to teach art to Italian children . I should think you would revel in it , for they are born artists . The Italians were great masters of art , were n't they ? " She beamed approvingly , but her approval was mainly for her own penetration rather than for my new task . " Yes , " I faltered . From my experience of that first week I felt it likely that the Italian children would become masters of an art teacher , rather than of art . It was an ironical fulfillment of my earliest aspirations to study with Italian masters . Another friend gave me quite a different godspeed on my new labors . " Teach art ? art in that district to those children ? How absurd ! They need something infinitely more practical . A course in hygiene , morals , besides the three R 's . But art ! It is a sinful waste of your energies and training , to say nothing of the valuable materials , and the time which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd ! " At first , and perhaps during a greater part of the time , I have agreed with the latter . Just because some four hundred years ago the Italians of central and northern Italy made a glorious and eternal name for themselves is no reason why the immigrant of to-day , from southern Italy and Sicily , should be horn artists . It did seem " absurd ' " to give them art when they had such a crying need of so many other things ? " hygiene " and " morals , " for example . But now I am deeply convinced that my work and my position as a teacher of industrial art are justified far more than I ever dared hope . The school in which I teach is modeled after what is known as a " Gary School . " Each child has an hour and a half a day of a " special activity . " The " special activities " include industrial art , manual training , sewing , cooking , and printing . Every three months the " activity " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for in my room they were " specially active . " Every year I have the same set of children for one period , so that I may he encouraged by progress or thrown into the depth of despair by the reverse . The school is situated in the midst of a typical " Little Italy . " I shall never forget , the sinking feeling in my heart that first day as left American buildings and homes behind and found myself walking deeper and deeper into a strange and wholly foreign land . The narrow , crooked streets fringed with refuse , the forlorn and ramshackle tenements , and the faces of the inhabitants ? all were foreign . Swarms of children screamed shrilly at their play or quarreled furiously over their games . Every corner was decorated with a group of young loafers of about the age of seventeen . These stared at me with a bold insolence , due to their proud contempt for work and a feeling of superiority toward the weaker and subordinate sex . A question was thrown at me . I ignored it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Saloon doors were wide open and fat men in their undershirts sat around tables playing cards . I must admit I stared , for I had never seen a saloon so exposed to public view . All of the shop signs were in Italian . passed several bakeries against whose grimy- windows huge rings of bread devoid of any wrapping were pressed . Small boys carried these big loaves home , clutching them firmly against their soiled clothing . The florist and undertaking stores displayed elaborate " set pieces " of artificial flowers . These were hired , I learned later on , for the grand occasion of a funeral . A brass band and a gorgeous collection of flowers were a vital part of an important funeral cortege . My eyes sought everything in bewilderment and curiosity . The cellar ways were dark and odoriferous . One , I noticed , had long poles stretched beneath its ceiling from which hung yards of " marcaronies . " This , I discovered , was a " macaroni factory . " As I turned into the narrow street , almost an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign of death over a door bell . The large bunch of artificial flowers was not all , for the entire doorway of the tenement was draped with a black-silk curtain , heavily fringed with gold . In that school of nearly three thousand pupils there were only eight who were not Italian , and I never met one of the eight . My first day was , and remains , a nightmare . I came out of it exhausted and dazed . On my homeward journey an acquaintance said to me : " All Italians ? How very interesting ! I hear they are very bright . " " Yes , " I answered , somewhat dryly . " Very bright . There is nothing that they ca n't think of to do . " She smiled . " They have been so brave in the war . Such courage ! " " Yes , they have been , " I agreed again , but now I realized that I was speaking of the whole Italian nation , our ally in a great cause . However , I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , man , nor devil ! " I had met and faced that day about ? grabbed . As her hand shot by Patsy in the act he struck at her knuckles with his scissors . Angelina let out a piteous wail . As I walked toward her she gazed up into my face with two big eyes dumb with pain . She held out her bleeding finger and moved her white lips faintly . " Come , dear " ? and I gently lifted her from her seat ? " we will go to the nurse . Class , " I said , quietly , " go on with your work . " And they went ? on ? with ? their ? work . I gave Patsy a look which , if it had been effective , would have meant within three days a band preceding him up the middle of the road . Patsy shrank down in his seat , livid with horror and fear . Little Angelina was very still as we administered to her . She kept her eyes on my face with that expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb animal that has been hurt and trusts his deliverer . " He did n't do it on purpose , " I explained , horrified at the idea ; " he did n't mean to . " " No , teacher , he don'ts wants to be mean , " she agreed with me in a patient tone . It was an ugly cut , and for months , Iong after her time in my class , she would run up to me on the street and shyly show me the scar . She loved and reveled in the words of commiseration I always gave her . My supervisor praised my calmness under the circumstances . Calm ? I had felt bereft of my tongue and wits . In all my training as an art teacher I had been taught no method of proceeding after such an experience . My subject is loosely termed " drawing . " Drawing is a means , not an end , in industrial art . Industrial art includes poster work , applied design , costume design , and interior decoration . Color work runs through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good lesson to begin with , as probably it would be the most familiar and appealing . " Class , " I began , " what can a man do to increase his business ? " " Sell eberyt'ing he 's got , " a boy yelled . " Do n't yell ; raise your hands , " admonished . " How do people know he has something to self ? " " Put it on a paper an ' throw it in a doorway . " " Yes , " I faltered , " but have you seen the signs in the trolley cars ? " " Yes , teacher ? do n't spit on the floor . " ' " No , " I gasped ; " not that . " " Don'ts stick your head outer the winder . " " Children , I do n't mean those signs , I mean pictures . " " Spearmint Gum " and a brewery sign were the only pictures they had seen . " That . children , is called advertising . There are lots of ways of advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we all know about . Now , those posters were drawn by some man . " A general din of noisy excitement . Everyone wanted to tell one proudly of some acquaintance who drew or painted ? an artist , for instance , who painted roses over the kitchen wall , and still another who could draw Charlie Chaplin in two minutes . " Well , " I persisted , " you have all seen the posters or advertisements for the Dart collars ? " I felt that they might have all seen and remembered this popular one . They had ! They had ! I hurried on , with a spark of hope warming my soul . They are not just pictures of a collar , but of men . Men doing different things , men playing golf , tennis , or billiards . Why did the artist show these men doing different things ? " The first profound silence I had encountered fell upon the room . I had floored them . A tall , lanky boy with a mop of hair arose from his seat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To show no matter what you does in a Dart collar you never gets sweaty . " " That 's right , teacher ; he 's right ! " Romeo , like the rest of the class , was completely satisfied . The matter was settled . They burst . into their orgy of restlessness again . One morning , some time later , I came into my " drawing room " ( the children 's name for it ) to find it in wild disorder . The movable desks were pushed helterskelter or overturned completely . Down at my feet two boys were fighting furiously . " Boys ! " I cried in horror . " Boys ! " They scrambled to their feet after a few parting blows . I was dismayed , for my two dependabIes were facing each other like a pair of fighting cocks . " Gerardo ! " I gasped . " What does this mean ? " " Who did you let be monitor , me or him ? " Gerardo blazed . " You , Gerardo . " Gerardo 's eyes snapped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says because you made him a monitor , he 's even a liar . I said we began the fight in the drawing room and we 'd settle it in the drawing room . " Tony stared sulkily at the floor . " Boys , do n't you know you have no right in this room before the bell rings ? Fighting like this in a classroom is a very serious offense . There can be no excuse for it . I shall stop and see your fathers at noon . Hereafter , do n't begin a fight nor settle it in my room . " So at noon I made good my threat . The teachers had told me that the parents always " back you up , " for , to them , a teacher is an altogether superior being . I sought out Mr. Tortorelli , father of Gerardo , and Mr. Lemongelli , sire of Tony . ( The last name is pronounced like that anaemic dessert . ) My classroom , which was to be the cultural center of the neighborhood , was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they were affairs of honor . One look at Tortorelli 's tenement and I decided that there must be a better CXLI/1. ? No. 855. - 57and wiser way than the one I had chosen . But I climbed the rickety stairs in that ill-smelling hall to the second floor , groped in the darkness for the nearest door , and knocked loudly . A man 's form loomed out of the blackness somewhere near me on the landing . A door opened and a faint light fell on us both . " Mr. Tortorelli ? " I was shaky and a bit nervous . There was so little room on the landing for this big man and myself . He nodded , and I could see his expression was kindly . " Maestro . " I pointed to myself . That was my all in Italian , but at that it was more than he knew in English . He ushered me with an elaborate gesture and bows down the stairs to the hallway below and to daylight , " Guglielmo , " he called to a boy loitering near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and then to himself . He said a few words in Italian and then motioned for me to unburden myself of my troubles to the small boy . " Tell him , " I began , " that Gerardo had a fight in my room this morning . He knocked all of the desks over the room . It was a very bad fight . " I watched for Mr. Tortorelli 's expression as the interpreter reported his son 's iniquity . His brow was deeply furrowed . He appeared to answer with such words as " horrible , outrageous . " The boy turned to me with , " He wants to know who got hurt ? " - Mr. Tortorelli was informed that Gerardo was still intact . His brow cleared , he smiled radiantly upon me . " Tell him , " I persisted , decidedly exasperated , " that a classroom is not a place for a fight ; they must keep that for the street . " Mr. Tortorelli nodded good naturedly when this was conveyed to him and made a gesture with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the legs . The interview was over and I was bowed into the street . Mrs. Lemongelli was the possessor of a small number of teeth , three , to be exact , and a large number of children , fourteen or so . Her coloring was suggestive of a mummy . Mr. Lemongelli looked as Captain Kidd might have done before he achieved financial success . They suggested , or rather he did , tying Tony to a stove all night , or , better still , " putting him on the stove and allowing him to burn like a piece of wood . " I protested vigorously against the former . The latter I felt to be another colorful figure of speech . These were my first and last visits of complaint to the homes of my pupils . I met the parents , as it was wisest and best in the office of the school principal . But a few weeks later I had another interview with a parent , although the setting was different . It was Mrs. Morano , mother of Rocco . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truancy . But he was never absent from my classroom . He usually enjoyed art , and he loved my room . There were more possibilities for fun in it than in any other in the school . He reveled in paint ? it splashed so brightly on another boy 's nearly finished paper , Putting daubs of paste on a seat was a worthy substitute for the old-fashioned tacks . Two rulers clamped together made a good pair of bones . Lest there be any misunderstanding , Rocco 's mischief was not excusable innocence and youthful exuberance . He was a bully , a sneak ? and how he could swear ! His language was unrepeatable . Every teacher in the school was worn and weary trying to reform him . This particular afternoon he had taken a sudden fancy to work . We were doing some lettering which was to be painted in later . I watched over him hopefully , ready to give him help , start him on his way . Suddenly he slammed his pencil down and it hopped off to the floor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don'ts wants to write . " I gave him another and sighed a bit . His expression warranted it ? the sigh . " This lousy ' A ' don'ts wants to come good . " " Rocco , that is n't a nice word vou used . Do n't say it again . Here , I 'll make an ' A ' for you . Watch me . " He watched me rather sulkily . He lost all desire for work . I tried to tempt him , but it was hopeless . I left him , convinced that art could not be forced upon a human soul . From my vantage point I could see that he was painting an automobile . A roar of rage broke the silence of the room . " Rocco puts paint on my ear . " Joe held his ear , but not his temper . He was poised for revenge . " Yeah , you big ? ? , the next time you shove my arm , I 'll put paint on your eye . " Rocco was savage . Joe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long smear across the automobile . Our principal was at an important meeting outside the school . Once again I tried settling a case without him . The session was almost over ; there were only twenty minutes more . " Go to the cloakroom ; I 'll see you after school , " I commanded . Rocco lurched into my large cloakroom , used for a stockroom as well . He was muttering dire threats to some one as he went . Rosie was to be excused earlier than the others ; she had to take care of " her baby " while the mother went to the clinic . She burst out of the cloakroom and came up to me , quivering with passionate grievance . " Rocco says like this , if you don'ts make him come out , he 'll throw ebery thing on the floor . He 's going to throw hats and coats and the paint , and he says to me he wants to knock hell out of me . " She burst into a storm of tears . " Rocco ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room . His mouth had an ugly curl to it . One.look at the weeping Rosie and he snarled : " She ai n't got no right to call me a Chinaman . I 'll git her and knock the block off her . " " Rocco , where do you live ? near ? " " A ' right , a ' right , git my mudder ; I do n't care . I ai n't afraid . Git her . " He twisted his mouth in utter contempt . A dozen or more were only too anxious to bring Mrs. Morano to my assistance . I selected Salvatore ; he looked so quietly shocked at Rocco 's conduct . Mrs. Morano appeared in my doorway . There was no doorway left , only Mrs. Morano , of amazon porportions . Her eyes were moist , her lips tremulous . " She says like this , " began the interpreter ; " you should make Rocco get hit . He 's a bad boy . " " Yes ; that is what I want . He needs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed her hand upon her heaving bosom . " You do it , " Salvatore suggested , cheerfully . I will not . " I was indignant . " Tell her to look at him and then at me . He is bigger than I. She must do it . " This ultimatum took Mrs. Morano off her feet . She flopped into a chair . " She 's got a heart , " Salvatore explained as Mrs. Morano continued to moan and hold her side . She 's got more than I 'd have if I had Rocco for a son , " I said to myself . The woman acted so strangely that I was afraid she might have some kind of an attack . All through this conversation Rocco was leaning against a window sill and was eying us with amusement and contempt . Mrs. Morano saw Rocco and ? red . She screamed at him in Italian . He stormed back . Then she began to whimper , and turned her hands toward me in a pleading fashion . She blubbered something to our small interpreter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . She don'ts feel good . She wants to go home . She wants you to let Rocco give her the key . " What had I brought upon myself ? I get the key from Rocco ? " She might die , " Salvatore suggested , pleasantly . " Rocco , " I gritted my teeth and said between them , savagely , " give your mother that key . " Rocco sulked , but did not move . His mother tottered , to her feet and made a lurch at her son , faltered and groaned . Moral suasion was in order , I suppose . There were lots of beautiful things I could have said about mothers , but did n't . I picked up a fat ruler and held it in a rather suggestive way . The law could n't forbid that . " Rocco , " I said , " give your mother that key . " He looked at me and then at the fat ruler . He hesitated and then slouched and jerked his head irritably ? signs indicative of defeat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said some appropriate things about mothers , especially sick mothers . Mrs. Morano bowed and smiled and bowed again . The interview had evidently been a source of gratification to her . She was plainly showering me with many blessings and thanks . I had helped her in her hour of need . For a few minutes I forgot that I had expected a different ending to her visit . These incidents may serve to make you understand something of the strange and perplexing situations which American-trained teachers meet in an alien community . I can only hint at what lies behind these casual episodes ? the curses , blows , profanity , and obscenity ? all deeply rooted in the mire of ignorance . It is not " fascinating " and " charming " ? afternoon-tea expressions ? teach these children art or anything else . It is hard work , full of disillusionment , disappointment , and discouragement . The teacher who takes it otherwise is the rare exception which proves the rule . She is the subject of much admiring and widespread comment . Of tour e there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their success should be crowned with laurels . It is a success which has called into action every ounce of energy , tested every natural resource . Would that I could meet again a young woman I. once heard conversing delightfully about " her class " at the settlement . It all sounded so pretty and appealing ? I was charmed by her picture ? the problem of dealing with the foreign element . She merely used " love " and " kindness , " and the whole overrated problem melted away into a seraphic state of bliss . I could weep now when I think of it . I hear myself saying firmly on the occasion of a second meeting : " Of course those children loved your kindness ? they always do love kindness , but ? " And here I should be tempted to wail : " Ca n't you understand ? you only had those little girls two days a week , and they did n't have to come to your class , and they only came because they liked sewing ? and a change of scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked . They could have left you promptly if you had been strict and stern . But when they have to come day after day and learn things which the state has determined it is best they should know , it is different . " My definite problem is to make industrial art of some very practical use to these children . Costume designing , interior decoration , applied design are not absurd " modern frills . " They are definitely related to everyday life . For instance , costume designing ? a people 's mode of dress is more an integral part of national life and development than it would seem at first thought . Dress is not merely a vain show . A man or woman in Oriental dress can not think or feel American . An Italian immigrant woman with her head uncov ered , her shawl , her earrings , and her jewelry of all kinds on top of her soiled dress can not be expected to feel like an American . When the native costume is discarded something deeper than externals has been touched . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material one . My children have come to shiver visibly ? and dramatically ? at the mere idea of jewelry on dirty fingers or over unkempt clothes . Laces and " diamonds " may be reserved for the ball , wedding , or block dance , but they can not be tolerated at work . Good color , simplicity , and suitability ? these are my watchwords . Where are they to receive new standards and ideals in house furnishings but in a course at school ? They could easily go through their lives content with a filthy , cluttered kitchen , fancy grimy lace curtains , grotesque pieces of bric-a-brac , and bathtubs filled with the left overs and the broken scraps . Their bathtubs and their cupboards get the rubbish until they are jammed , then they begin filling up the back yard . Certainly lessons on the House Beautiful can not but be an inspiration . Recently we designed a kitchen , a blue-and-white kitchen . The wealth of things we discussed in that lesson ! There were more things about a kitchen than they ever dreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " came one in hygiene , even as my friend had demanded . The children felt the clean , sunny fragrance of the mother 's workroom which they had designed . One bright-eyed girl named " Mary " rose during the lesson and said , in-dignantly : " Carmine told a big lie . He says , poor people eat in the kitchen and rich people eat in a dining room . Poor people eat in a dining room as well as rich people , " she choked . Her eyes snapped , but she was plainly hurt . respected her wounded pride . The others did not understand nor share her feelings . Mary longed for the new , something different from what they had known . Lucy recalled last year 's problem in " interior decoration . " Pbor Lucy ! bad to tell her that the " stove " which had adorned a " parlor " had been a " fireplace " in a sitting room . Lucy was one of those who found the old ways easier . She was content . Probably on a Sunday Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable wagon and went on a grand outing to the country . The whole family would be with her , from the black-shawled old grandmother to Lucy 's baby brother . American and Italian flags decorated both the horse and the wagon . Lucy , I am sure , would feel a joyous glow of pride , as those on the pavements stared . She probably read admiration and envy in their glances . Mary , on a like occasion , would have been miserable and self-conscious . She would have wished that her mother had worn a hat or that America and Tony did n't laugh so noisily ; she would have hated the flags gaily flying She would have burned painfully as those who walked by stared . In their glances she would have read ridicule and mocking ests . The people of this Little Italy are in the melting pot . But a melting pot , unattended , uncared for is of no use , the ingredients will remain the same as they were in the beginning . A. melting pot on a dead fire , or too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Alfred turned his back and dreamed ? and we know what happened . Since we like to speak of the melting pot let us not turn our backs upon it and sit and dream and plan . Charred cakes are nothing to charred lives . My children love to hear the story of Michelangelo and I love to read it to them . It is good for them and good r me . A quiet falls upon the room as I begin to read . They stare at me solemnly and a little proudly as I give the title . They are very , very good . Every Michel , every Angelo , every relation of a Michel or an Angelo basks in a wonderful feeling of kinship with the great master . They feel he belongs exclusively to them ? that he is one of them . I can feel that I am quite an outsider . As I watch their expressions I know that I am gazing upon heroes . Although their light is only reflected , they are distinctly shining forth as heroes . The name " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they love that . They smile as I slur over Italian names , as indulgently they softly correct me . I feel self-conscious as I try to give the liquid pronunciation to the Italian names . Four hundred years lie between us and the great master and over three thousand miles between the scene of his exploits and my classroom of young " heroes . " But what does it matter ? And what does it matter that four hundred years ago the living Michelangelo was an austere and solitary aristocrat , who held himself severely above his compatriots , demanding of them nothing but veneration and infinite respect , caring nothing for their love ? But my warm-hearted , emotional young peasants are not concerned with this distinction . He was an Italian ? and his name was Michel ? and Angelo . He was very , very great . Books are written about him . Even their American teacher gives him homage . They are proud , so proud ! As the story ends I ask to have it repeated to me . They tell it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelangelo was born in Italy . His father don'ts wants him to be a drawer ? so he ebery time . " Mario , " I interrupt , " I think it would sound better to say , Michelangelo 's father did n't want him to become an artist . People would not know quite what you meant if you spoke of a man 's trying to be a drawer . " I smiled encouragingly to take the edge off my criticism . " See , Mario , this is one kind of drawer . Michelangelo 's father never feared that he would become part of a desk ? or table . " The others were delighted at such a ridiculous thought ; they laughed joyously . Yesterday , they might have been noisy with their laughter ? but not to-day with the spirit of Michelangelo upon them . Our particular version makes the point that the dome of the Capitol in Washington is a copy of Michelangelo 's dome on St. Peter 's . Mario quotes and finishes with a gusto and a flourish : " Michelangelo made David and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just the same like Michelangelo . Of every artist Michelangelo is the best between them all . " He scratches his head , shuffles his feet , twists about in perplexity , and sits down with one eye squinted up . Then he is at peace . His recital pleases him as he thinks it over . After a few minutes of perplexity on my own part I at last decipher some of the forceful conclusion . I can not permit Mario to speak of the White House having a " nome , " even if he is like Michelangelo . I pride myself upon reading distinctly ? but " dome " was an unknown word to them . I hastened to explain " domes . " Of course Mario had left out many details ? hands . waving frantically , protested the omissions . " Yes , Attilio , Michelangelo did work very hard , very hard . Do you remember just how long he worked each day ? " " Yes , teacher " ? his eyes lighted up with excitement ? " eight hours . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , smiled in appreciation of what they had no comprehension of and no interest in . They were with me in every thought this day as I read of Michelangelo . " Michelangelo did not belong to the union . They did not have any tmion in those days . . . . " They laughed , and Attilio grinned good naturedly and a little sheepishly . But they had not forgotten that it was distinctly stated that Michelangelo worked until darkness made it impossible . I like to watch their eyes shine with happy pride and passionate devotion as they recall each detail of Michelangelo 's life . Poor youngsters ! Life is n't very gentle with them . I wonder at their being capable of so much ardor . I should think it would be chilled and crushed by their struggles . They make life hard for others ? but their own is not made easy for them . Who is to blame ? Why is it all so hard ? I think , after all , the question should be , " What is to blame ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks and ignorance upon the next . But it is going to be different from now on ? the schools are mercifully , bit by bit , repairing the damage of the past . But I rejoice in the emphasis placed upon the rigorous simplicity and the remarkable industry of Michelangelo 's life . Since they crave to feel him their hero , I can use him to serve my ends . I can call upon him to stand in judgment upon them . Only the other day as I read the description of Michelangelo painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel my eyes fell upon Michael Abate lying flat on the floor , painting with a ruler on an imaginary ceiling . He was doing it with great care . He would stop now and then to get the right perspective on his work . Finally he quietly took his seat . At the close of the reading Michael burst out : " Gee , how hard , teacher ! Michelangelo was a smart guy . " " Very , Michael . But do you suppose , children , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh no , teacher ! Oh no ! " They shook their heads in holy horror at Michelangelo 's failing at anything . Of all the old Italian masters , I love him best , for he has lent me a helping hand in bringing art to Little Italy .
