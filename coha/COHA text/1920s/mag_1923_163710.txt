Almost five months before the next Congress assembles , some indication is given of what action will be asked of it in military affairs . Chairman Martin B. Madden of the House Appropriations Committee has been touring the country inspecting army posts ( TIME , June 25 ) . <P> Recently he sailed for Europe , but before doing so he gave an interview telling what recommendations he would make to the next Congress . <P> He proposed to cut the number of army posts in this country from 240 to 60 . Among the posts slated to go is the Presidio on the Pacific Coast , valued at $20,000,000 . It is certain that there will be no little opposition to these economies by pork-barrel politicians . Mr. Madden 's argument is that most of these posts were created during war time , are now practically useless and the cause of great expense . He declared that Secretary Weeks agreed that these economies should be made .
