The members of the new Cabinet who had arrived before their chief also met with a great reception . notably Winston Churchill , who received an ovation from the representatives of the CitY ? Which would have gladdened the heart of any Chancellor of the Exchequer . When Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin appeared and the fanfare of trumpets was heard every person in the hall seemed to join in the cheering . The enthusiasm was equally . , earty ' when a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " His Majesty 's Ministers . " Government to Be National One . The Prime Minister , after some humorous introductory remarks . made a reference to the significance of the re cent election . " We l-now. " he said . " it is a testimony or our fellow-countrymen in favor Of progress and not of stagnation . We know that it is a decisive ' vote against minority government and we know that ' we have received support . from many of those who at ordinary times might I have given their support to other parties . They have attempted to put into Power a national government , and It is in the exercise of that trust that we shall endeavor to deserve their confidence . " In conclusion the Prime Minister referred to domestic problems , such as housing and insurance . The Government he said , would do its utmost , but the real redemption of the people must come from themselves . The Government would not attempt to control the country 's industries , and they would do all they could to prevent others from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies along the lines which this - country has hitherto pursued , " he said , " and that by changing the basis of our system we should fall into a pit of poverty and misery hardly to be visualized by our workers , and certainly never yet experienced by them . " In view of the fact that he ancr his colleagues had only just taken over office , Mr. Baldwin begged to be excused from making that comprehensive survey of political conditions at home and abroad customary at the Lord Mayor 's banquet He could , however , say that in regard to foreign policy the one Object of the Government would be stability and continuity . Will . Stand by Peace Treaties . " We stand by . peace treaties , and " we will cultivate good relations with foreign countries on the basis of those treaties , " he said . " Thal this policy is not a policy of stagnation is shown by the action taken by the last Unionist Administration that led directly to the Dawes report and the London Conference , which under the able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only was the London Conference valuable in itself , but it had special ' significance in that it marked the reentry of the United States into European politics . The Government , while fully understanding the peculiar circumstances which rendered difficult the continuous cooperation of that country in European affairs , can not but express its appreciation and gratitude for the leading part America played in the negotiations which culminated in the London protocol . " That protocol is now in a fair way , toward execution . Theo various organizations contemplated by the Dawes report have been set up and are functioning . The administration of various pledges has been handed back to Germany and various mixed commissions have been set up to settle disputes to which the transfer of authority might give rise . The Reparation Commission - declared on Oct. 28 that fiscal and economic unity had been restored within the meaning of the London agreement . " This very satisfactory result which encourages such good hopes for the fu. tare would not have been attained but for the statesmanlike attitude of the French Government . M. Herriot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he may rest assured that His Majesty 's Government will continue to furnish him with the most friendly and consistent support in the execution of the policy which he himself has so largely facilitated . " His Majesty 's Government is fully confident that the London agreement will enable Germany to become a factor for peace and stability in Europe . Realisation of this hope , - however , rests with the German people . A new Opportunity is opening before them if they will scrupulously observe their obligations  --  and resist all temptations of evasion . After a reference to the difficult problems in India the Prime Minister mentioned the " large questions of policy affecting the British Dominions , such as Preference and defense , which will have to be reviewed by the ' present Government . and others ( such as the Geneva Protocol , which the Government is pledged to examine in consultation with the Dominions . " Finally Mr. Baldwin made an announcement regarding the Wembley exhibition which aroused enthusiasm . He contended that the exhibition had been a great success and declared that his Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untimely end . Practically the whole of the capital expenditure had been incurred and the cost of reopening it next year would not be great . ' but in this matter the Government-could not stand alone . If the Dominions and the great industries of this country were preparedi to do their part the Government would ; do its share and ask Parliament to provide a sufficient guarantee ha addition to that which already had been Provided . Mr. Baldwin said he regarded the assumption of this potential liability as fully justified even in a time when the strictest economy was indispensable in the . public service . He added that not only in the matter of the British Empire Exhibition but in all matters appertaining to their common heritage the Government purposed to seek the cooperation and support of the Dominions . Among the earlier speakers was Austen Chamberlain , Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , who said in part : " The aim of every statesman in the British Empire is and must ever be to preserve peace . As we expect others to respect our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hope from them for sympathetic understanding and regard for our special interests and feelings , so we will endeavor to bring the same sympathy and understanding to the consideration of their peculiar position and profit . " In this spirit we will deal with all nations ; but for those of our allies and associates by whose side we fought in the great war we have a partial and deeper feeling and with them we desire more intimate friendship . " We rejoice that with the invaluable cooperation of the United States some of the difficulties that have-recently vexed us have been removed from our path , and we trust that that cooperation in whatever form that may appear fitting to the President and Senate a ( the United States may not be withheld from us in the difficulties we have still to face . " Nor do we forget the great service already rendered to humanity by the League of Nations or the immense possibilities of good which it holds if wisely and prudently directed .
