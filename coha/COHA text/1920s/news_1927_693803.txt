txt Of Vital Importance . I desire to express my appreciation of Dr. Butler 's letter which appeared la THE TIRES of April 25 , concerning the proposal of M. Briand In which he formally proposes a treaty between this country and France that would definitely outlaw war . I also wish to thank you for your editorial on the subject . The proposal received scant notice in the press throughout the country generally , and I find that the majority of people with whom I come In contact have hardly given it a thought , if they know anything at all about it . Yet this is a matter of vital and far-reaching importance to this country as well as to the rest of the world . As a worker for the League of Nations and for international good-will and comity , the ignorance concerning our foreign relations and the smug self-complacency that I encounter ea every hand often make me heartsick . JOHN THAXTER . Kittery Point , Me. , May 2 , 1927.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
