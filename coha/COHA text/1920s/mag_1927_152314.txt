When the clamor on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange had been stilled to permit President Edward Henry Harriman Simmons to announce in hard , sharp accents that a member , found guilty of unethical conduct of his brokerage business , was expelled , the member in question , Herman W. Booth , was nowhere to be found ( TIME , Oct. 3 ) . The incident was soon drowned by the roar of hundreds of brokers resuming the hawking of securities about the 29 posts of the floor . No active trader had Mr. Booth been , with hundreds of clients to represent . Apparently his misconduct had been technical . But the penalty was heavy disgrace . He had vanished from his hotel , leaving no clue , only a note disposing of a nebulous estate in favor of his sister and brother ; had written in a letter " in case anything should happen to me through accident or otherwise . . . . " Wall Street veterans shook their heads . It was not the first time a ruined broker had thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insistently in the office which Edwards Herrick Childs , appointed receiver in charge of Mr. Booth 's affairs , had taken over . The inactive broker 's clients , who bobbed up to an amazing total of 100 , were sending in claims for over $1,000,000 worth of securities &; cash . No wonder Mr. Booth had planned to end it all . All day long frantic creditors surged into the office at No. 120 Broadway . <P> Then , one shining afternoon , a kindly , pink-cheeked gentleman strolled into the office , faultlessly dressed except for a coat pocket that broke the contour of his well tailored person by sticking out in unsightly bulge . Forthwith a sheriff , stationed in the office , pounced upon this benevolent oldster , searched him thoroughly . The bulge turned out to be a large , red apple . The kindly gentleman turned out to be Herman W. Booth . Straightway he was marched to gaol . <P> There he spoke with mild wonder of a short visit to Atlantic City calculated to lengthen , not abbreviate , his life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard " on him , assured everyone that the embezzlement charges brought by a Mrs. Jennie C. H. Denton , who claimed $150,000 , need not have been pushed so vigorously ; promised : " If I can only get time to do it , I can make these debts good ! "
