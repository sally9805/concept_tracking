Two old men sat solemnly playing backgammon , last week , in the warm sitting room of a small house at Louveciennes . Several correspondents hovered irritably around the placid players , not quite daring to interrupt . From the bottom of profane hearts they cursed Old Dr. Turner for the maddening deliberation of his moves . Why did n't he lose , or win ? A pox on backgammon ! They wanted to interview the other venerable player , the grizzled yet roly-poly one , the man with the shrewd smiling eyes , the Marshal of France , Joseph Joffre , 76 , famed hero of the Battle of the Marne . <P> " Ha , Tuffier ! " cried the Marshal at last . <P> " Hmmm-mm-mp ! " hummed Old Dr. Tuffier , admitting defeat . <P> Then at last the correspondents could interview Good " Papa " Joffre , could ask him a cruel , embarrassing question-the kind that even newsmen hate to put . <P> Someone , in short , had to ask the old Marshal whether he knew that a local celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meaux , without allusion of any kind to Joseph Joffre . The celebrants , all too obviously , were of that school which has grown to consider " Papa " Joffre an amiable old dunderhead who squandered his men 's blood as a housewife squanders dishwater . Someone-a little ashamed of himself-put the question . <P> While the old Marshal pondered Mme. Joffre , sitting beside him in a rocking chair , was observed to rock more vigorously . Her husband , with half closed eyes perhaps fixed on things far away , seemed to reflect as ponderously as had Old Dr. Tuffier over backgammon . Suddenly Mme. Joffre stopped her quick rocking , sat up bristling , spoke : " I wonder-I just wonder-how many people would claim they lost the Battle of Marne , if he had lost it ! " <P> " No matter , my dear ! " said " Papa " Joffre , " No matter-Frenchmen won the Battle of the Marne . It is enough that the French Army saved France . The individual part need not be considered . " <P> Almost timidly someone changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I have finished them , " said " Papa " Joffre contentedly , " Only the other day I finished signing-initialing-the last of the 800 pages . I have signed each one . So there can be no mistake when I am dead , and they are published . I give the documents , the facts . Others may form their own opinions from them . " <P> " Have you written anything in it about the American army ? " <P> " Mais certainment ! But nothing controversial , " with a smile , " And now , gentlemen , please , no more questions . I do not excite myself . I take precautions . I find at seventy-six that I must be careful . So I play backgammon. . . . "
