50X3,000=150,000 <P> So did figures play around in the pate of Marion Talley last week as she sped from Buffalo , N. Y. , to Quincy , Ill . Fifty ( that stood for the number of concerts scheduled ) , * by $3,000 ( the approximate fee ) multiply and subtract expenses . . . . The figuring held no terrors for her . She had excelled in arithmetic back home in the Kansas City school-in arithmetic , deportment and singing . Singing had made her a Metropolitan Opera star at 19 . Arithmetic broadened into a good business sense which enables her to make her own contracts to her own good advantage . In deportment there has been little change . <P> Lack of change , probably more than any single factor , has spoiled Marion Talley for Manhattan 's most musical . When she made her debut at the Metropolitan in 1926 , it was in the full glare of blazing publicity . Critics realized that the fuss was none of her making , that presses all over the U. S. were starved at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part kind . She had a pleasant voice . She might some day become an artist . And for three years they waited . <P> The voice has in some ways improved . She sang well as the mechanical bird in Stravinsky 's Le Rossignol . She piped prettily through Mignon . But her big music has been little , the real art of singing something she has never seemed to grasp . <P> " Talley trouble , " meanwhile , has come to mean lack of temperament . The life she leads has been as much to blame . In it there have been vocal gymnastics , new languages for new operas , right living . There have been few books , few friends , no beaus . There have been the rigid standards bred by the First Christian Church of Kansas City , a public to be a little suspicious of , and a handful of haughty prima donna ways which have not helped her popularity . <P> Last spring the rumor circulated that the Metropolitan was through with her . The rumor was false . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be a concert tour through Illinois , Iowa , Missouri , Kansas , Mississippi , Wisconsin , Louisiana , Texas , Oklahoma . In February she begins again in Lancaster , Pa. , goes through the South as far as Havana . It took just one hysterical evening in Manhattan to make the Talley name . The harvest , reaped largely on the road , mounts well toward the million mark . <P> <P> * The first was in Burlington , Vt. , then Buffalo , N. Y. , Ames , Iowa , Cedar Falls , Iowa , etc.
