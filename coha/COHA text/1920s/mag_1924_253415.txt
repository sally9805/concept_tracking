Poincare sent his soldiers to the Ruhr and stuffed wool into his ears . <P> The fashion has been revived and the world is anxiously waiting for its political leaders to cut their coats according to their cloth and not indulges themselves in luxuries . Fred I. Kent , Vice President of the Bankers ' Trust Co. , one of the greatest financial authorities of the U.

Said he : " Without unity there can be no security ; without security there can be no peace . " <P> Return speeches were heard from all the representatives .
