txt America needs new clothes . Thus says the huge crowd of buyers which is filling new York hotels , coming from every town in the country . " America is still the best dressed country in the world , " said one of the mosttraveled buyers in New York , " but she is a bit down'at the heel and it has been many a year since America was on such a replacement basis-for garments . " The orgy of buying during 1918-1919 which culminated with Christmas , 1919 , which had meant a billion dollars worth of silk on our people 's backs durintg that year was followed by declines in textile prices as result of thrift wave on the part of a dissatisfied public . According to clothing people , the clothing purchased by the public during 1919 and early in 1920 was not of the lasting sort . In most cases it has already worn out . As one leading retailer put it " silk shirts for working people , perishable amarttlothing and furs for their women ( for there areturs which hardly last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serviceable clothes . " Then the pendulum swung the other way and today these same people are threadbare in their silks and satins and must come into the market for the sort of clothing they should have purchased . Furthermore the ' middle class and even the wealthy have been holding off for lower prices and it is not unusual to see men who were smartly dressed a couple of years ago wearing faded suits , overcoast worn to the woof and shoes much the worse for wear . " There arc potential buyers for millions of dollars worth of clothes and shoes throughout the land , " said one manufacturer , " and it is on this basis that many of us are reopening our mills and getting ready for a new dressed United ' States . " " The coming Easter should see the United States once more clothed as it was before the war , smartly and at the same time with an eye to service " , said the president of a chain of dry goods stores . If these opinions are borne out it would appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get nearer to a normal basis during 1921 than at any time since the war began .
