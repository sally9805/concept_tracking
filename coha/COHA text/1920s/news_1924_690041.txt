txt The President 's Vacation . President Coolidge , in his recently expressed determination to remain In Washington this Summer and to do without a vacation , appears to be making h. mistake in more ways than one . The climate of Washington In the Summer season , to a man accustomed to the air of Vermont or Massachusetts , would be likely to prove anything but beneficial to his health . The President has had a strenuous period since he assumed the reins of government . The investigations in connection with the oil scandal must have proved a nerve-racking experience for him . And , in the second place , he is setting a bad example for the average American business man . Any man engaged in active business life requires a suspension of his daily work ; in other words , a vacation . Our President sets in most respects a remarkable example to the men of our nation . We would like him to add to this excellent example one more  --  the advisability of taking a vacation . MARY A. W. BROWER . Montclair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
