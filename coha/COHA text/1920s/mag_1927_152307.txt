Of German , Dutch , Bohemian glass , made in the Middle Ages , blown into the tiny translucence of spray bubbles , wreathed into frail , florent cornucopias , drawn into the cruel delicacy of icicles , chiseled into the sunny symmetrical angles of molecular bodies , the collection of Dr. H. W. Muehsam of Berlin was the finest private collection in the world . Last week , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , in Manhattan , and the Chicago Art Institute announced that they had jointly purchased Dr. Muehsam 's collection . When German experts have impartially divided the pieces into two equal parts , all will be shipped to the U. S.
