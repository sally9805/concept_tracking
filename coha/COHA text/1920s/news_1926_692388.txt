txt Following closely on the heels of his suit to void the pension of former Police Commissioner Enright , William J. Schicffelin of the Citizens Union obtained a temporary injunction yesterday holding up former Mayor HyIan 's city pension . Upon his application , Supreme Court Justice Proskauer signed a restraining order against Controller Berry and Peter J. , Secretary of the Board of Estimate , named , with Mr. Hylan , as defendants , and directed them and the former Mayor to show cause on Feb. 15 why payments at the rate of $4,215 a year to Mr. Hylan , and in the event of his death , to , his widow , should not cease . Justice Proskauer acted on the complaint in the case and on an affidavit of Leo J. , associated with Leonard M. Wallstein as counsel for Mr. Schieffelin , asserting that the two laws passed by the Municipal Assembly , which changed the pension laws to include the former Mayor as a beneficiary under the City Employes ' Retirement System and to increase the sum to which he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfair to the taxpayer and to the other city employes entitled to a share in the fund . The preliminary injunction was served on Controller Berry and Secretary and will be mailed to Mr. Hylan at Palm Beach . Cases May Be Tried Together . The argument in the Enright case is on the calendar for Feb. 16 , the day after the Hylan case is returnable . Because of the similarity of the questions of law involved , it is not unlikely that the cases eventually will be heard together . Explaining the action brought by Mr. Schieffelin as a taxpayer , a statement yesterday by Mr. Walistein said ; " This action is brought primarily as part of the policy of the Citizens Union to obtain judicial construction of all doubtful questions arising in connection with the Home Rule amendment , the adoption of which the Union advocated for many years . " The papers in the action allege that the pension to former Mayor Hylan depends for its validity on two local leas passed by the Municipal Assembly under purported authority of the Home Rule amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local laws undertook to reduce from sixty to fifty-five the retirement age of the group of city officials in which the former Mayor was classified . The other undertook to fix the amount of the allowance by the average salary of the last five instead of the last ten years of service . " The complaint charges that these two local laws are invalid and void , because beyond  --  the power of the local legislature as conferred by the Home Rule amendment and the City Home Rule law . " The precise point of the plaintiff 's position is that the legislative authority of the local officials is confined to matters affecting the property , affairs or Government of the City of New York . as distinguished from affairs of the State and counties embraced within the city 's geographical boundaries .

" The City Employes Retirement System , on the other hand , by express terms of the statute governing it , includes not only city officers and employes , but also all State , county and court officers or employes , who are paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contends , the local Legislature has no power to amend or supersede the statutes governing the retirement system . as do the local laws in question , because to do so is to go beyond the scope of city . affairs and to legislate in the field of county and State affairs . " The complaint recites the various steps taken to make Mayor Hylan a city pensioner on the basis of his salary for five years rather than for ten , as a result of which he receives $700 or $800 more annually than he would get otherwise . It says that the budget appropriations for the retirement system have increased from $500,000 in 1921 to $4,202,566 in 1926 , during ? ch time the total has been $16,521,704 . Because Mr. Hylan was 57 years old when he retired , he would not have been eligible to a pension under the former law .

Because of the danger that such payment may be made immediately , a temporary restraining order is also requested . " TO SWELL PENSION FUNDS . Commission Will Invest in City Securities to increase Interest Return . A plan to increase the earnings of the funds of city pension systems , which , it is asserted , was persistently blocked during the last Administration by City Chamberlain Philip Berolzheimer , was put through yesterday by the Sinking Fund Commission .
