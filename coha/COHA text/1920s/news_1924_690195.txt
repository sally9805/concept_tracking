txt Remington Typewriter Co. in first quarter- Of 1924 earned approximately . $47.5.000 after taxes , bond'interest and depreciation , or substantially the same amount as in first quarter of . 1923 . This is equivalent to approxiAately $7.75 a share for the quarter on 49,940 shares of second preferred and $2.85. share on 99,960 shares of common stock . As regular first and second preferred dividends come to $764,710 for the year , 60% of the full year 's preferred requirement was earned in the first quarter ' Underwood earned the same in first quarter of 1924 as in 1923 , while Royal earnings are understood to show increase this year , indicating good business for the industry as a whole . Indications are that typewriter buy-fug , while no doubt shoiving usual summer slump , will be more evenly spread throughout the year than in 1923 . This will be due partly to the uncertainty now restricting domestic buying that will result in hand-tomouth buying at a good rate throughout the rest of 1924. paitly to improvement in foreign buying during last half of year that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation generally , especially with adoption of a business-like solution of the reparations and Ruhr tangle , and the effect such improvement will have upon general world trade . 1924 EARNINGS In 1923 Remington earned $1,602,817 after all charges . It is believed that earnings for 1924 , because of improvement in foreign buying , which usually helps Remington more than other companies , and because of the increasing demand for portable machines for home use , will be between $1,750,000 and $2,000,000 . The management no doubt will be highly pleased with earnings of $1,600,000 as in 1923 . The good business reported by all the typewriter companies makes earnings as good as in 1923 fairly wrtain unless home crops tail or chaos develops abroad . Remington-Noiseless should do somewhat better than break even its first year despite large number of machines that must go into stock throughout the world , and other expansion contemplated in Noiseless activities since Remington took control .

Should they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial payment on the $20 a share accumulated back dividends can be expected in the last quarter . The reason why only regular disbursements on sec- , ond preferred share can be expected until November or December is that , unlike the case of the first preferred , not only first preferred but also second ' preferred dividends must be kept up . Regular payments require , as pointed out , $765,000 a year . In addition $493,000 of bonds mature ; January 1 , 1925 , provision for payment of which has to ' be made out of 1924 earnings . Company , - therefore , has in addition to interest on bonds $1,258,000 to charge out of 1924 earnings before it can consider back payments on the second preferred , for the management believes that the company should keep about $2,000,000 in cash and cash equivalent on hand to guard against untoward developments that might crop up in the industry such as happened from 1913 to 1915 . After payment of first preferred dividend January 1 and bonds maturing on that date , Remington had approximately $2,050,000 on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen that not until well along in the fall will Remington 's earnings , unless there is unprecedented activity in the trade during the summer , be sufficient to justify consideration of extra payments on the second preferred .
