txt " I have two prejudices , almost superstitions , " Roscoe Conkling confided to a brother Wall Street attorney . " One is that I . can not wholly trust any man 's judgment , nor perhaps his morals , if he has n't a memory for good oldfashioned poetry . " One of the pleasurable fads of the Republican statesman of ' the Hyperion curl was to have on his desk a collection of the portraits of his chosen friends , and one political foe . in that group ' was W. W. ( " Good Old Bill " ) Eaton of Connecticut , that fraternity . based on reasons uniquely non political  --  the Yankee Democrat sharing with Conkling 's elder friend , Tom Corwin of Ohio , " the - glory " ( so Conkling called it ) of a memory that made him " an anthological miracle . " Conkling , Corwin , ? Eaton , could sit up all night competitively reciting poetry . Conklihg 's own feats in literary memorization were more than among his prides , they had assessable. value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? first engaged the attention of William Cullen Bryant at an evening function . Bryant courtesy became a Conkling asset . Second of his " two prejudices " was what he described as " abhorrence , of newspaper notoriety : " In his New York city career Mr. Conkling maintaindd this attitude militantly . Few others than correspondents like Amos J. Cummings , whom he had known well in Washington could find him patient of even conventional approach . Chauncey M. Depew rallied Senator Conkling once upon what he quizzically called his bashfulness ; and the response was : " I do n't like to see my name in print  --  it actually nauseates me . " " But , " baited the smiling Depew , " you owe something to the public  --  why not cash in with a few fond words occasionally ? " " I am too old to learn new tricks , " he answered . " I just simply do not believe in newspaper coddling . ? I never have had use for it . My present attitude has always been my attitude . How I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never done me favors  --  I never sought one . " Mr. Conkling 's memory did not go quite back to the first nomination he gained for Congress in his native Utica district , when about the first thing he did was to write to his friend . John Austir ; Stevens of the New York Chamber of Commerce : " The Evening Post had a most friendly and handsome paragraph the other day , which was of service . Knowing your intimate and influential relationship with that paper , and elsewhere all around you , I venture to ask that you give me any aid you can by press or suggestion . I shall be very greatly indebted if you will give me a lift . " Subsequently , when Mr. Conkling , after the Civil War , was still calling his party " the Union party , " and campaigning to he United States Senator nominee , he wrote happily : " By-the-bye , letters reached New York yesterday from Air . Bryant in Paris asking his editorial friends to make every effort for me . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what in deep sense of personal loss he wrote from No. 2 Wall Street when , another ten years later , death claimed his Utica neighbor , Lewis Lawrence , whose fortune had been invested in a daily paper founded explicitly and exclusively to crusade for Conkling  --  all staked , lost all .
