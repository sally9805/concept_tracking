We are gazing into some strange incomprehensible painting of Piero di Cosimo  --  a world of pale blues and greens , of abrupt peaks in agate and of walled cities , of flying red stags with hounds at their throats , and of lions in tears beside their crowns . On the roads are seen traveling companies , in no haste and often lost in contemplation of the sky . A boy sits on a rock in the foreground . He is listening to the words of a woman dressed in a chlamys that takes on the color of the objects about her . THE WOMAN IN THE CHLAMYS In a far valley , boy , sit those who in their lifetime have possessed some special gift of eye or ear or finger . There they sit apart , choosing their successors . And when on the winds toward birth the souls of those about to live are borne past them , they choose the brighter spirits that cry along that wind . And you were chosen . THE BOY For what gift , lady , did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or paint ? Shall I sing or mime , lady ? What choice fell on me and from what master ? THE WOMAN IN THE CHLAMYS It is enough to know that you were chosen . THE BOY What further remains to be done ? You have poured on my eyes and ears and mouth the divine ointment ; you have laid on my tongue the burning ember . Why do we delay ? p. 3 THE WOMAN IN THE CHLAMYS Be not so eager for life . Too soon you will be shaken by breath ; too soon and too long you will be tossed in the tumult of the senses . THE BOY I am not afraid of life . I will astonish it .  --  Why are we delaying ? THE WOMAN IN THE CHLAMYS My sister is coming now . Listen to her . ( The Woman in the Chlamys withdraws and gives place to her sister , whose feet stir not the shells upon the path . She wears a robe of deep and noble red and bears in her hands a long golden chain hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compassion , like the face of one taking part in a sacrifice of great moment . ) THE BOY All is ready . What do you come to do ? THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED My sister has given you the gifts of pride and of joy . But those are not all . THE BOY What gifts remain ? I have been chosen . I am ready . THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED Those gifts are vain without these . He who carries much gold stumbles . I bring the dark and necessary gifts . This golden chain THE BOY ( With mounting fear : ) Your face is shadowed . Draw back ; take back all the gifts , if I must accept these also . p. 4 THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED Too late . Too late . You had no choice in this . You must bow your head . THE BOY I am trembling . My knees are hot with my tears . THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED Since only tears can give sight to the eyes . ( She drops the chain about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of these pendants ? THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED This is a tongue of fire . It feeds upon the brain . It is a madness that in a better country has a better name . THE BOY These are mysteries . Give them no names . THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED This is a leaf of laurel from a tree not often plucked . You shall know pride and the shining of the eyes  --  of that I do not speak now . THE BOY And this , lady ? THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED That is a staff and signifies the journey that awaits you your life long ; for you are homeless . THE BOY And this this is of crystal THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED That is yours alone , and you shall smart for it . It is wonderful and terrible . Others shall know a certain peace , and shall live well enough in the limits of the life they know ; but you shall be forever hindered . For you there shall be ever beyond the present a lost meaning and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain . Take back your gifts . Take back life . For at its end what can there be that is worth such pain ? THE WOMAN IN DEEP RED ( Slowly drawing back into the shadow of the wood : ) Farewell , child of the muses , play-fellow in the bird-haunted groves . The life of man awaits you , the light laughter and the misery in the same day , in the selfsame hour the trivial and the divine . You are to give it a voice . Among the bewildered and the stammering thousands you are to give it a voice and to mark its meaning . Farewell , child of the muses , playfellow in the bird-haunted ( The Woman in the Chlamys returns . ) THE WOMAN IN THE CHLAMYS You must go now . Listen to that wind . It is the great fan of time that whirls on the soul for a season . THE BOY Stay a moment . I am not yet brave .
