The signatures of three presidents , two emperors and a king were modestly but insistently besought , last week , by U. S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg . <P> The Secretary is not selfishly collecting autographs . He wants to see the six potent signatures affixed to a multilateral treaty " renouncing war " among the U. S. , France , Germany , Great Britain , Japan , Italy . Last week he transmitted his concept of what such a treaty should be to the foreign Powers named , and asked whether they would be willing to sign it , perhaps with modifications . <P> By so doing Mr. Kellogg at last gave a definite and constructive turn to the tedious correspondence which he has kept up on the subject of such a treaty with French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand ( TIME , July 4 , et seq , ) . Copies of the Briand-Kellogg correspondence were tactfully enclosed as background material by Secretary Kellogg in his notes to the Powers of last week . The whole point of the notes , however , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essentially Mr. Kellogg 's own conception . Brief , this treaty text contains only three articles : <P> Article I <P> " The high contracting parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies , and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another . <P> Article II <P> " The high contracting parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts , of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be , which may arise among them , shall never be sought except by pacific means . <P> Article III <P> " . . . This treaty shall , when it has come into effect . . . remain open as long as may be necessary for adherence by all the other powers of the world . . . . " <P> The remainder of Article III is of a routine character , providing for the depositing of ratifications , etc . <P> Significance . In essence the Kellogg treaty text is simply a joint pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if anything , is to be done if one of the parties breaks faith . But it would prove useful in mobilizing public opinion against a faithless Power . <P> Quite ostentatiously the Kellogg text ignores the recent observation of M. Briand ( TIME , April 9 ) that France will find it difficult if not impossible to sign a treaty which might conflict with her " previous obligations contained in international instruments , such as the Covenant of the League of Nations , the Locarno agreements or treaties guaranteeing neutrality . " Mr. Kellogg now rather cleverly asks other powers whether they hold this view . Any reply which tends to indicate that the Powers are already committed to warlike sanctions in certain instances will be a feather in the Kellogg peace cap . <P> That France will have a great deal to say in defense of her position was made clear , last week , when Foreign Minister Briand announced that he too will shortly submit a tentative multilateral treaty text to the Powers concerned . Should the fashion for drafting and bandying such texts spread to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth , the ensuing negotiations may well become a diplomatic cross word puzzle , titanic and inextricable . In an effort to scotch such confusion , Secretary Kellogg said in all his notes , last week :
