txt Prohibition leaders showed plainly yesterday that They intended to make political capital out of Governor Smith 's action in signing the Mullan-Gage law repealer . William H. Anderson , State Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League , issued a statement in which he predicted that Governor Smith would not have one chance in a hundred to get the Democratic nomination for President and not one chance in a thousand to win the election , if nominated . Mr. Anderson bitterly denounced the Republicans who helped put over the repealer . He warned Republican leaders that the rank and file of the party was dry , and that they could not hope to compete with Tammany Hall ror the wet vote . Governor Smitn was attacked ' also by Republican leaders who had favored a veto of the repeal bill . He was charged with having made up his mind to sign the bill long before he held the hearing at Albany last Thursday , and with having misled the public into thinking that he might veto it . Colonel William Hayward . United States Attorney for the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed at the Governor 's action , especially because of the futile hearing , at which Colonel Hayward was one of the chief speakers on the dry side . Jacob A. Livingston , Chairman of the Republican Executive Committee in Kings County , declared that it was " an insult to the intelligence " of the people of the State for the Governor to have held the hearing , ostensibly with an ' open mind , but actually having already decided . The Federal authorities prepared to handle all liquor prosecutions from now on in the Federal courts , which will be flooded if the police co-operate with the prohibition officers to any such extent as they did under the Mullan-Gage law . Colonel Hayward and Palmer Canfield , Federal Prohibition Director for the State of New York , insisted that the police must do their part to enforce the Volstead raw , despite the repeal . They also said .. , at they would do everything in their power to keep New York dry . Assignment of additional dry agents to New York is expected . Enright Revokes Orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telephoned to all precincts in the city , revoking pre- .. loas police orders for the enforcement of the Mullan-Gage law . The  --  ordors revoked were designated General Orders 11 to 18 , and were issued in 1921 , after the passage of the State enforcement law . They held the police responsible for all liquor violations in the city and instructed officers how to make searches and seizures , how to operate without search warrants , how to arraign prisoners for prohibition violations , and so on . The rescinding order issued last night relieved the police of most of their work of enforcing prohibition . From now on they will have no State liquor law to enforce , although they are supposed to co-operate with the Federal authorities in enforcing the Volstead law . They are responsible for making arrests whenever violations of the Federal law come under their attention . It was announced at Police Headquarters yesterday afternoon that policemen making liquor arrests had been instructed to arraign their prisoners in the Federal Courts instead of the municipal or State courts , or to turn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement said that the police would I return to the methods they used in the period before the Mullan-Gage law was epssed , but after the Volstead law was passed . Mr. Enright put it up . ' to Corporation Counsel George P. Nicholson to define exactly what the city should do in co-operating with the national Government . Mr. Nicholson could not be reached yesterday to give his opinion . He is expected to be pres- eat at a conference of city . State and federal authorities which Commissioner Enright announced he would call early in the week . Prisoners arrested for liquor viola/done subsequent to the time that the Governor signed the repealer , which was about 6 o'clock Friday night , were turned out of the local Magistrates ' courts when they were arraigned yesterday . The Magistrates told the policemen who made charges of violating the Mullen-Gage law against prisoners that they would have to arraign them before United States Commissioners on the charge of violating the Volstead law . The wide open liquor traffic which both wets and drys prophesied for New York as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as could be seen yesterday . Despite the great jubilation of the wets , there did not seem to be any greater supply of liquor , any heavier drinking or any lower prices than . before . The opinion in drinking circles , however , was that such consequences would come after the rum smugglers and bootleggers had had more time to take advantage of the lowering of the bars formerly put up by the local marine police along the water front and by the State police along the Canadian . border . Wini only a comparative handful of Federal men to keep liquor out at the State and to keep an eye on its storage and transportation Inside Mee State . It was predicted New York will soon be very , very wet . Wet Celebrator Arrested . Widespread lawlessness. ' which the drys promised would follow the repeal , was not in evidence yesterday . Only one case of disorderly conduct was reported . and this was the ease of a man who was beaten while " celebrating " the Governor 's action . The statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " One of the things that bulks large in the Anti-Saloon League 's satisfaction over the enforcement repeal situation that has been created by the wets is the jam in which the reactionary young so-called leaders of the Republican Party , including such eminent beer-wets tee Speaker Idacbold , United States Senator Wadsworth , Theodore Roosevelt the Little and Ogden L. Mills , find themselves caught . Governor Smith has bound the wets to him by hoops of steel . He has destroyed all possible national prospects In order to jolly the local wets and preserve political patronage for the faithful from the ' sidewalks of New York . ' No Republican can be wet enough to compete successfully with the Governor for wet votes in New York State . " On the other hand , President Harding has burned his bridges behind him , and the Republican Party nationally is today as clearly committed to honest . earnest , effective prohibition enforcement as though the platform plank had been ado ted . Just where this leaves SpeakerMachold , ? without Whose connivance the Governor would have had no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other Republican wets is a subject for the political ? coroner 's inquests cued post reorterne . " Governor Smith is done , so far as the Presidency is concerned . He has not a chance in a hundred of nomination , nor one in a thousand of election if nominated . But In a race for Governor of New York State today or hi the Fall of 1924 he would defeat any wet Republican eo badly as to be Pathetic . Governor Smith at least has the consistency to stand with the wet Tammany rank and file In the gutters adjoining ' the sidewalks of New York . ' But these wet Republicans have tanked the common decency to represent the rank and file of the Republican Party of the State or else get out and openly join Tammany , with which their hearts and stomachs have already established allegiance . " Barren Deplores Signing . " Governor Smith is true to his record , and so is the Democratic Party , " said the Rev. David James Burrell , President of the Anti-Saloon League of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet platform in this State . and it is up to all good citizen* to pass upon it . From now on prohibition is not the question . The question before all . good citizens is how to get New York back into the Union . Lincoln said , ' You can trust the people . ' The next election will tell . " Samuel Wilson , Assistant Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of New Jersey , declared that Near ' York State was preaching nullification of Constitution . He said : The action of New ' York State in rieggsaling the Mullen-Gage law is several t that are despicable and nothing that la Commendable . New ' York proclaims herself to be a shirker . She ratified the Eighteenth Amendment . By so doing she notified her sister States in. the Union that she approved and . promised to share loyally in its support . Her officials solemnly swore to do so . " Now , she says to other States , " We are not in sympathy with your blankety blank constitutional amendment , so , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' In sporting parlance , New York is a ' welcher ' as well as a ' slacker . ' New ' York by word and example preaches nullification . By the terms of section 2 of the Eighteenth Amendment she was under the same obligation as was the Congress to enact legislation for its enforcement . She did her duty loyally , but now she repudiates her own voluntary action and fouls her own nest . By one stroke of a Pen Governor Smith has said to the 266 judges and the army of police and other officials , ' Bootlegging - is not a crime . Let the rum runners smuggle . ' " Women to Protest Repeal . A special meeting of the Brooklyn Women 's Constitutional Committee . representing 110.000 clubwomen , was called ? yesterday to protest the repeal . The call was sent out by Mrs. Ida B. Sammis-Woodruff , chairman . and Mrs. James B. Anner , secretary . Mrs. Sammis-Woodruff headed the ' di7 delegation at the Albany hearing . Mae tailed attention yesterday to a resolution adopted by the committee on May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The New York State League of Women Voters , in a statement issued over the signature of Mrs. F. Louis Slade , State Chairman , called on Governor Smith to take steps to insure the enforcement of the Volstead law in New York State . It asked him to make good his pledge to uphold the law of the land in the Eighteenth Amendment , despite the discarding of the State enforcement law . The Law and Order Union of New ' York State , of which Dwight Braman is President . wrote to President Harding yesterday , saying that the people of New York State , regardless of the Governor 's action , would stand by the Federal Government in enforcing the law . The letter read in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of this great State will support the Government of the United States and you as Chief Executive in the enforcement of the Constitution . " It was disclosed in the debate that the repeal of this law will cost the people of this State In taxes $1,400,000 in addition to the burdens under which they now labor . " Our friend Governor Smith has been so advised by this organization , which eighteen years ago found a saloon to every 300 in our population , and that , two-thirds of the inmates of our county Viz were there from drunkenness and 8.4 tier cent . of the inmates in our State insane asylums were there from the abuse of alcohol . " The Jails in many counties throughout the State during the last three ' years since the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment have been Closed for lack of inmates . " Hay-wand Disappointed . United States Attorney Hayward in his statement said : " I was greatly disappointed when I heard that the Governor had signed the repeal bill .

Despite this repeal of the State law , howeverou can say tor me G that the Federal Government will proceed es before in the edict enforcement of the law , and will make every effort to keep New York a law-abiding city . " The statement of Republican Committeeman Livingston read as follows : " The hearing held by Governor Smith was a direct insult to the Intelligence of the people of the State . He held a hearing ostensibly with an open mind . Immediately thereafter he signed the measure repealing the Mullen-Gage act , and filed a memorandum which took his counsel . Parsons , a week to prepare . Governor Smith ought to read the story of the ostrich . " Almost all of the clergy who discussed the Governor 's action yesterday denounced It . An outstanding exception was the Rev. Father John L. Belford of the ' Roman Catholic Church of the Nativity . Brooklyn , - Who said : " I am delighted that Governor Smith signed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to his convictions . It was no surprise to those Who knew bine He was not Influenced in what he did by his political future . " Leaders in the wet fight , - who expressed their pleasure at the Governor 's action on Friday night , refrained from adding any further comment yesterda-7 . Prominent lawyers who had urged the argument of State rights on the Govesnor , and had characterized President niandftrg 's action in writing- a letter to a Newburgh prohibitionist as a Federal interference in State affairs . were pleased with the Governor's. decision , but had nothing further to say . When Willard Bartlett , former Judge of the State Court of Appeals , was asked to comment yesterday at his borne . 21 Plerrepont Street , Brooklyn . he replied : " There is nothing I care to say at this time . My opinion on the Mullaa-Gage act was given to Governor Smith before he signed the repealer . " V. S. Agents Expected Here .
