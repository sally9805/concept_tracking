After her marriage Ellen Graham Bassell became Mrs. John W. Davis . Twelve years later she became the wife of a nominee . As such she now figures . <P> Like her husband , or perhaps because of her husband , she has not abstained from politics . But the politics of which she partakes is not the kind of politics which her husband pursues . John W. Davis is the son of the late John J. Davis , who was for long a political leader in West Virginia . The son marched into politics along the practical path followed by his father . He marched into the House of Representatives . <P> It was at this point that Ellen Graham Bassell appeared on the scene , to become the second Mrs. Davis . Said Town Topics : " In entertaining small talk she is the equal of John William himself , certainly of Robert Lansing , and is entirely comparable to the second Mrs. Woodrow Wilson . " Besides , she had the reputation of patronizing the best dressmakers in Washington . What is more , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her husband did with Mrs. Lansing 's husband . The Lansings introduced the Davis 's to Washington 's inner circle . Then Mr. Lansing spoke well of Mr. Davis to Woodrow Wilson . From then on , Mr. Davis 's rise was steady and only semipolitical in character . <P> Now the Davis star has turned purely political once more . No longer can Mr. Davis be advanced by a well-pleased leader . To win this Fall , he must please a crowd of , say , 15,000,000 people not all of whom can belong to the socially elite . So politicians are beginning to question : " Is the nominee 's wife a political asset ? " <P> She indulges in politics as a member of the Women 's Democratic Union . Some of her co-members include Mrs. John Blair , Mrs. Charles Dana Gibson , Mrs. James W. Gerard , Mrs. Norman H. Davis , Mrs. Abram I. Elkus , Mrs. Montgomery Hare , Mrs. David F. Houston , Mrs. Pierre Jay , Miss Amey Aldrich , and Mrs. Frank L. Polk . These are the very aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game because of wealth or husbands . These are quite a different set from the gang of women who go out and get votes and bring them home to the Party . <P> The woman who was Vice Chairman of the Democratic Convention , Miss May Kennedy , was not one of Mrs. Davis 's intimates ; she was a little worker who had gone into the Bronx and brought out votes for Tammany . During the same period , Mrs. Davis was on a committee which showed up the iniquities of the Republican tariff by an " exhibit . " In the exhibit , mannequins ambled about dressed in imported gowns ( or their equivalent ) with jewels , silk stockings , slippers-a complete costume and everything price-marked . By contrast , another part of the exhibit showed what the same articles would cost under a Democratic tariff . Mrs. Davis was not one of the mannequins . <P> A woman politician was reported as remarking : " Mr. Davis is a diplomat . Nothing in the whole political problem facing him will need more skill than the handling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends on the one hand , Tammany Hall and its numerous voters on the other . When the women 's campaign committees for New York City are appointed the world will see how good a politician Mr. Davis is. "
