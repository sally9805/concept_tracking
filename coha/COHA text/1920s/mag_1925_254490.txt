Puppets . Frances Lightner has concocted a ragged play about rag dolls , human and otherwise . Into a rather unusual setting of a marionette theater on Mulberry Street , Manhattan , the playwright plucks somewhat forcibly at a snatch of the Pagliacci motif . <P> The proprietor of the puppet show , an Italian with a heart as big as an ox , and perhaps a head of the same quality , marries an elfin , wistful sprite of a wife a few minutes before charging off to war . On his return , he is deaf from the conflict , enabling his wife to carry on her languishing conversations with her ad interim lover . <P> The manipulation of the manikins is made to suggest at one point a parallel to the sub-rosa and subauricular romance of the wife and her sweetheart . Ultimately , the husband discovers the liaison , offers his breast to the dagger of the other man . But the affair is hushed up without unnecessary stabbing . <P> Interwoven in this uneven melodrama is the suggestion , to be expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passion . But sometimes , as in the actual marionette show put upon the stage , the strings are made too evident by the dramatist . Effects of huge shadows and splashes of vivid color sometimes divert attention from the fact that the characters themselves are pulled about in jerks . Miriam Hopkins , erstwhile of musical comedy , and Fredric March as the lover have several plangent scenes together , and C. Henry Gordon pitches about energetically as the husband . But the trail of the sawdust is over the play . <P> Alexander Woollcott - " Much effective material thrown to the wind in the writing and to a certain extent in the acting . " <P> Stark Young - " A little melodrama , brightened with the happy gaucheries of puppets in their wires and plumes and shields of brass , but delayed with a loosely threaded tale and vaguish manner of telling . " <P> The Fall Guy . A pleasant game might be played at guessing just which parts of this comedy the spectator had viewed before . It has bright echoes of Clarence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the unheroic young hero of The First Year fallen among thieves . <P> Ernest Truex plays , in that softly purring , neatly whimpering style of his , a little drug clerk out of a job , who succumbs in a moment of weakness to harboring a fearsome suitcase , crammed with bootleg liquor . Unknown to him , it also contains illicit narcotics and , when these are discovered , the little clerk naturally goes into the toils . Eventually he turns the tables , captures the head of the dope gang , is awarded by the authors a berth on the detective force out of gratitude for his ingenious acting . <P> Truex 's acting gives vitality to the play , but the authors , James Gleason and George Abbott , have also flecked it with amusing slang and bedecked it with gaudy , entertaining characters . Ralph Sipperly , as a wilful saxophone player , and Beatrice Noyes work themselves into the skin of their parts . The play is notable as the second success of the season on which Gleason has exercised his pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-author of Is Zat So ? <P> Percy Hammond - " As amusing a fable as if it had been written by Frank Craven . " <P> Stark Young - " Safe and sound and tried and trusty . "
