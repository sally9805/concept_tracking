The announcement that the historic Mills Building on Broad Street , lower Manhattan , abutting the Morgan office building , will be torn down , has caused more widespread interest than usually attends such an operation . <P> The leasehold on the property , acquired by J. P. Morgan &; Co. in 1920 , runs until A.D. 2004 . Across the street , the New York Stock Exchange , centre of the Wall Street securities market , recently completed a 22-story addition-at peak construction prices . Up the street , the New York Federal Reserve Bank , centre of the Wall Street money market , at about the same time finished its magnificent new headquarters-also at practically peak building prices . But until recently , J. P. Morgan &; Co. merely put some inexpensive iron fire-escapes on the Mills Building and waited for lower building costs . Evidently those have come into sight , for J. P. Morgan &; Co. have now transferred the leasehold to the Equitable Trust Co. , which intends to erect on the Mills Building site a 34-story office building . Construction will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the spring of 1928 . <P> When the Mills Building is torn down , the operation will be watched with interest . A Wall Street rumor widely believed , is to the effect that there is a secret entrance into the Morgan offices through the Mills Building , of great usefulness in balking overcurious reporters . Partners in the firm , and famed customers , too , are said to have been seen leaving the Morgan threshold , but not entering it , and vice versa . When the present Morgan building , was erected , the firm was for a time housed in the Mills Building . Wall Street will spare some hours from speculating in securities , to speculate on the truth of this " secret passage story " when the Mills Building comes down .
