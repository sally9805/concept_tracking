IT is a pity that some of the most sig- i nificant phrases which the Christian religion has brought into our language should have been so conventionalized by overwork as to have lost much of their freshness of meaning . Repentance ! Forgiveness ! Redemption ! Revelation ! Atonement ! Salvation ! By our peculiar Anglo-Saxon use of words like these , often pietistic , oftener still sanctimonious , we have infused them with suggestions of cant which make commonsense people shy of them . Our habit of indiscriminate and v ulgar evangelism heightens this distaste . Where the custom of the country permits any tinker or peddler who thinks himself a messenger from God to stand at a street corner and pelt his audience with great words distorted out of their true meaning , the spiritual language soon becomes debased . To a considerable degree it is debased in English . It has lost not only the sharpness of its point but some of its claim to have a point at all . Among the phrases which have suffered most is that which forms the heading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . Most Christians , nominal or actual , are willing to admit that the Bible is the Word of God , but when they have done so they are vague as to what , it is they have admitted . It is probable that to the majority of English-speaking Christians the Bible as the Word of God is a venerable figure of speech to be treated with that pseudopietism which passes among us for reverence , but not a term with a definite , practical application , such as we find in " radio , " " carburetor , " or " stock exchange . " This is the more to be regretted since the words bring down to us one of the most ancient traditions in the world . It is more than a tradition in that it is the unfolding of man 's deepest spiritual experiences till they culminate in a marvelous fulfillment . Of the several great ideas whose development throughout the Old Testament and into the New is persistent , this of the Word of God is perhaps the oldest , and certainly one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures , growing larger and more comprehensive until the great event to which it has strained forward justifies all its forecasts . If we seek a strong and simple meaning for the phrase we shall find that the strongest and simplest lies right on the surface of the syllables . For a word is that which conveys the thought in one mind to the understanding of another mind . Search as we will , he as scholarly or as theological as we like , we shall find no more natural or exhaustive explanation of the Word of God to man . God 's thought is conveyed to man 's understanding , and conveyed in the way in which , as we have already seen , His thoughts are always conveyed ? through the struggles of individuals to reach higher levels , deeper insights , and a more advanced knowledge of Himself . I suppose that the most decisive of all steps in human progress was made on that far-off , prehistoric day when between two human beings a word was pronounced , was understood , and was repeated . The minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms which could be modified or enlarged , man truly became a living soul . All the potentialities latent in his nature were then opened up to an apparently endless development . A word implies self-expression , and self-expression implies self-revelation . Here we have the essentials of what we mean by the Word of God . God 's Expression of Himself ; God 's Revelation of Himself . They come through the story of human progress , through the drama of human experience , through the hold advances into truth made here by a poet and there by a prophet who return with their spiritual spoils ; but the main fact is that they come . If a ruling purpose of the Bible is to help us to know God , it is also a ruling purpose to show us that we can know God only because God reveals Himself . God being God , He can not do other than reveal Himself . At the same time we do well to remember that God 's Self-Expression is wider than can be contained in any book . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God 's Revelation of Himself is so often understood narrowly . By nine religionists out of ten , perhaps by more , it is presented in terms of a " scheme " by which we can be kept from committing sins , or relieved of their consequences if we have committed them . Undoubtedly some such purpose must lie within the scope of Revelation ; but God 's Self-Expression can not be limited to a single strain , even if that strain be Redemption . For the only confines we can put to God 's Manifestation of Himself are those which we put to the Universe . The Universe expresses Him in general ; the details of the Universe express Him in particular . While this may seem a platitude , it is one of those platitudes so persistently ignored that it needs persistent repetition . From my point of view it is our tendency to sec God as expressed only in a book , and not in everything that is ; which is at the back of all the wranglings between religion and science , between Modernist and Fundamentalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our grasp of measurement which we understand as the Universe is the immensity of God ; the infinite detail by which the Universe brings its dynamic power down to us is the detail of God . This God is always visible . We talk of a world in which God is riot seen , and of another world in which He will he seen . I know only of a world in which we see Him . As I write 1 look out on a windy May day when the maples , elms , and chestnuts are tossing their branches in unimaginable beauty . In the gardens and on the lawns the irises are following on the tulips , as the tulips followed on the hyacinths , while lilacs , white and purple , line the street . Within a few hundred yards stands a great university in whose laboratories men are investigating the force of gases and the power of animalcube . A walk of five minutes would take me to an observatory in which some of the most important discoveries in the heavens have been made . Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur man 's benefit . Everywhere there are homes with at least the average of love , kindness , and neighborly good-will . This , in the myriad forms of its application , stands to me for the broad outlines of God 's Revelation of Himself . Wherever there is beauty , power , good , or love , there must be His manifestation . One age develops it in one way , another in another way ; but each is the complement to each . Abraham , Moses , Isaiah make certain discoveries ; and Galileo , Newton , and Thomas Edison certain others ; but they co-operate to one end . The epoch of Moses built a Tabernacle and an Ark ; that of Pericles the Parthenon ; that of Europe and America in the twentieth century an airplane , a motor car , or a tower of giant beauty which , as we say in our picturesque lingo , " scrapes the sky " ; but all are expressions of the power which is God . We never travel by a steamboat or speak through a telephone without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may use it clumsily as yet , we may even use it injuriously ; but our hope is some day to use it advantageously . Just as there are cutworms in our gardens , mosquitoes in our swamps , shrikes in our woods , lions in our jungles , and a vast system of apparent cruelty by which one creature preys on another and man on them all ? so man preys on his fellowman and turns God 's forces against him . But that all conscious life is still unreconciled to God was seen as long ago as by Isaiah . Man is not the only being who misunderstands His will . Wherever there is a spark of intelligence there is also a spark of aggression . To all the lower orders of mind , life is the enemy of life . To kill is instinctive . It was so with man in his earlier stages , and in large measure is so to-day . But man 's progress beyond killing is now a topic for all the magazines and newspapers . It was the contention of Isaiah , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge of the God who is Life , he would draw the humbler orders after him . " The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , and the leopard shall lie down with the kid ; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together ; and a little child shall lead them . . . . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " That not merely man but all Creation is subject to the law of progress is to my mind a large part of the right understanding of God . Revelation being a universal process , in which all history , all science , all philosophy , all art , all religion are cooperative agencies , the written Word of God would be a single strand in it . The mission of that Word must he definite and particular . The Universe is general ; but it is of the very nature of a Word that it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mind tothe understanding of another mind . It proceeds from intelligence to intelligence . It has purpose and significance . It has limitations . In as far as it can express the Infinite it must be by details , an aspect at a time , a phase in the course of generations . But when we have grouped these phases , these aspects , as recorded in the Bible , there emerges a Being who transcends both time and space . In other words , God 's Self-Expression as revealed through Creation would probably have remained vague had not some definite message told us what to look for and where to look . Natural religion , as it is called , always tends toward the fantastic or the grotesque . A glance at the religions of Egypt , Greece , and Rome , or at the nobler philosophies of the Far East , will , for most Europeans and Americans , be a sufficient proof of that . The Bible , on the other hand , is sane . The essence of the Word it brings from God to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Natural religion suggests readily enough that the Universe expresses Him ; but the Bible goes a long step farther in telling us how it expresses Him . It is the how that makes the difference . Through the three thousand years of the Bible 's development it keeps this objective steadily , if not consciously , in mind . How God becomes God ; why we may reasonably accept and trust Him as God this is the fabulous prehistoric ; it goes on without a break ; and it never ends . Even when Jesus of Nazareth , in His presentation of God as Father , lifts us to what is perhaps the highest pinnacle of spiritual knowledge which in this stage of existence we shall ever reach , new pioneers are needed to make the meaning clear . For it has to be admitted that the hooks which we call the Bible puzzle us by their complexity . If they bring the Word of God to man , the thought in one mind to the understanding of another , then the scroll is enclosed in a casket which provokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place its workmanship is exquisite , in another barbaric , in another crude , in another distorted , in another alien to all our conceptions of Truth and natural law . We are often so astounded at these strange external patterns that we forget to look within . There , I think , is the secret of most of the difficulties which beset the reader . He does not remember , or is unaware , that this Word of God is a sword in a scabbard , a jewel in a shrine . The sword , not the scabbard , is the weapon ; the jewel , not the shrine , is the thing of great price . And yet the shrine , the scabbard , the casket so dominate the eye that one thinks of little else . Scholars , preachers , private readers spend most of their efforts on that . We look for the Bible 's infallihilit.y not in its spiritual message but in its outside husk . If the outside husk can he shown to have a crack in it , the essential truth is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of Christians , and possibly of Jews , the outside husk is everything . The main part of the conflict being waged so bitterly to-day between the schools known as Modernist and Fundamentalist is a conflict over the husk . It rarely if ever gets further than the letter of the Word . Regardless of the Master 's saying that the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life , " it spends all its attention on the wrappings in which the spirit is conveyed . Both contestants might easily give the impression that exactitude of temporal statement is all there is to the Bible . Its fallibility and infallibility are made to turn on such questions as whether or not there ever was a deluge , a Noah , and an Ark of gopher wood ; whether or not the Red Sea divided for the passage of the Israelites ; whether or not the Ten Commandments were actually engraved on stone by the Finger of God ? a digitlike that on a human hand ? as a man might write on a slab of dough , or given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to he denied . Nor can it be denied that the work done by critics , scholars , and excavators within the last hundred years is of value beyond estimation . My point is merely that to form schools for and against their conclusions can only be misleading to simple folk looking for common-sense guidance . When a reverend divine thunders from his pulpit that he does n't believe the story of the Tower of Babel ; when an equally reverend divine thunders back that you must believe the story of the Tower of Babel or he damned ; when the newspapers make capital of this difference of opinion , with headlines even more sensational than the sermons they report , the man in the street can hardly be other than bewildered . If he cares at all he is disgusted rather than profited by these disputes . If he does n't care he is as likely as not to brush the whole Bible aside as a collection of old wives ' tales . Peace would come to many minds , it seems to me , if we understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literal and a spiritual . The literal is difficult , requiring many kinds of knowledge , open to widely differing interpretations . The spiritual , on the other hand , is relatively easy , and when seen it commends itself to our common sense with an almost unanimous acceptance . It could hardly he otherwise with what we understand to be the Word of God . In conveying the thought in His Mind to our minds it can not be His purpose to perplex us . Simplicity and clarity are qualities which on His part we are entitled to expect . I think it will be found that most of the doctrines which create schisms between churches are drawn from the Biblical externals and not from the truths that lie within . Much that is ecclesiastical goes no deeper than that which is Modernist or Fundamentalist . It roams on the surface among the divergencies raised by changes in age , in taste , in nationality , in racial development . The whole history of the rise of sects can be read in the lifting to the rank of eternal truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a temporal significance . Where there is such wide disagreement as there is between the many Christian schools , it seems to me extremely doubtful that the spiritual Word of God enters as a factor . Where God truly speaks there cannot. he much room for human disagreement . The battles of the schools , like those of the Modernist and the Fundamentalist , are fought about the brisk . And if there is this difference between the literal and spiritual reading of the Bible , perhaps it will make it clearer if I take a concrete example . It will be only an example , a specimen of what can be applied from one end to the other of the Scriptures . My object will he , with a certain short book of the Old Testament , to make obvious , first , the simple and straightforward spiritual import of the book , and then the comparative unimportance of the vehicle in which the great truth is conveyed . For this purpose I choose the Book of Jonah . I choose it partly on the ground that a cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful readers of the Bible , a serio-comic thing , hard to approach reverently . But I choose it chiefly because to my mind , and to many other minds , it stands for the spiritual high-water mark of the Old Testament . I have no hesitation in saying that , spiritually read , it is one of the most tender , most noble , and most enlightened bits of writing ever set down with a pen . Even in the New Testament there is nothing which , in the special truth being placed before us , can be taken as its parallel . There is nothing in the accumulated literature of the Christian Church which gives this truth its due consideration . Not till we come to our own time do we find it entertained at all , and then for the most part onlywith a trembling , half-apologetic hope that these things might be so . Only one group of Christians , so far as I know , openly stresses the advanced and beautiful teaching of the Book of Jonah , though I should be glad to learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going any farther I say a word as to its literary form . Here I fall back on my reading of the best modern scholars ? I have no scholarship of my own but in doing that of course I can be justified . It is a well-known Hebrew literary form , and is called the Midrash . A Midrash was , according to Professor Driver , the English scholar , " an imaginative development of a thought or theme suggested by Scripture . " It could also be " art edifying religious story . " It was not precisely fictional in that it was founded on something already written , on something that had happened , or at least on some holy legend or tradition . It was an extension , an embellishment . It took what had perhaps been only hinted at elsewhere and gave to the idea the first rank in importance . Though the purpose of the Midrash was instructive , the form was very free . So long as the author was true to his main intention he could invent , adorn , invoke wonders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two other Midrashim more or less well known to us , the stories of Susanna and of Tobit , both among the Apocryphal Books of the Old Testament , are examples of this latitude . The story of Susanna is a matter-of-fact narrative not unlike the episodic tale of our modern magazines . In the story of Tobit there is a wider appeal to the supernatural . In that of Jonah the touch is more distinctly Oriental , suggesting the same kind of imaginative freedom which we see in the Arabian Nights . Frankly a vehicle for truths and not for everyday facts , it is at no more pains to keep close to the incidents of life as it is lived than is Pilgrim 's Progress . Now let me try to tell the tale of Jonah with the spiritual meaning uppermost . It is the story of a man who did his best to escape the will of God , but found that what a modern poet calls the " hound of heaven " followed after him and would not let him go . More than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart within a narrow sectarian view of God , in which only he and his kind were favored by divine protection , yet lived to see that not only were the heathen the objects of God 's care but that children and even animals had their own place in the universal love . He was not to suppose that religion was to be found only in Israel . The Phoenician sailors with their prayers and their good-will would teach him better than that . In his stringent orthodoxy he learned slowly . Indeed , we are left in doubt as to whether he learned at all . But we have no doubt of the Father 's patience with this fanatical , headstrong son , nor of the Divine Heart 's yearning over everything It has created . There was a man named Jonah the son of Amittai to whom the word of the Lord came , saying , " Arise , go to Nineveh , that great city , and cry against it ; for their wickedness is come up before me . " To the true believer this opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved was extremely displeasing . Jonah rejected the mission , rising up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord . In Italy and Spain he would be out of the Lord 's jurisdiction , which was confined to Israel . " Jonah rose up . . and went down to Joppa ; and he found a ship going to Tarshish : so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto Tarshish . " Yet he found that the Lord 's jurisdiction extended farther than he had thought . " But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea , and there was a mighty tempest in the sea , so that the ship was like to he broken . Then the mariners were afraid , and cried everyman unto his god , and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea , to tighten it of these . But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship ; and he lay , and was fast asleep . So the shipmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou , 0 sleeper ? arise , call upon thy God , if so be that God will think upon us , that we perish not . " With sailors ' superstition , they saw the storm as punishment for some one 's crime , and drew lots for the detection of the criminal . The lot fell on Jonah . " Then said they unto him , Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us ? What is thine occupation ? Whence comest thou ? . " And he said unto them , I am an Hebrew ; and I fear the Lord , the God of heaven , which hath made the sea and the dry land . . . . " Then said they unto him , What . shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? . . " And he said unto them , Take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you ! " The kindly sailors refused at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men rowed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not . " Even when they seemed to have no choice but to act on Jonah 's advice , they were torn between justice to themselves and duty by their passenger . " Wherefore they cried unto the Lord , and said , We beseech thee , 0 Lord , we beseech thee , let us not perish for this man 's life , and lay not upon us innocent blood . " When they had taken up Jonah and cast him into the sea , and the sea had ceased from her raging , " Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly , and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord , and made vows . " Humanity and piety are ascribed to Phoenicians , who were not only far from the true faith but worshipers of other gods . The inference seems to be that when every man cries unto his god , the cry must of necessity reach the Infinite and Universal , however little the individual knows about Him . It could not be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion even of these sailors should be thrown away . Then the author , in the free , inventive spirit of the Midrash , invokes the marvelous . And yet it is not the marvelous , since his point is simply that , however hard we may try to escape Him , God has all the means of His Almightiness to outwit us and bring us back . " Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights . " It is important to notice here that there is no question of a whale or of any other natural species . God prepared the great fish . In other words , in God there are wonders of safety for those who trust in Him , or for those whose work is not yet done . Iu the spiritual history of men and women there are thousands of instances of deliverance from peril , not without their parallel with this one , and to which we apply the word " miraculous " for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its origin in the inventive resources of a writer who had not the same sense of humor which we have to-day ; but it is a pity to let the outward form stand in the way of a great truth . The principle of God 's protective care extended to the uttermost is one which the spiritually minded have as yet tested only partially ; but it is at least a challenging thought to keep before the world . It was perhaps to show protective care extended to the uttermost that the " great fish " was imagined . The message is to those whose circumstances are desperate . Desperate as they are , the Lord has His resources . The question as to how the individual is to bring those resources into play on his own behalf is too large to deal with here ; but this Book of Jonah raises it . Out of his living pit Jonah prays to the Lord . " And the Lord spake unto the fish , and it vomited out Jonah uponthe dry land . " That is to say , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen , and do happen frequently . The active career of Jonah is again taken up , with a view to bringing out God 's love of all His creatures in contrast with man 's contempt for them . " And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time , saying , Arise , go unto Nineveh , that great city , and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee . " At the time of this writing Nineveh had long been in ruins , and the common knowledge of it was traditional . The Book of Jonah is one of the latest in time of all those in the Old Testament , perhaps the latest of all with the exception of that of Daniel , which also has certain Mid-rash qualities . Nineveh must therefore be explained . " Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days ' journey . " That is , it would take a man three days to cross it on foot . " And Jonah began to enter the city a day 's journey , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nineveh shall be overthrown . " What happened next would strike us as improbable if historical accuracy were the aim of the Midrash . But it was not . It sweeps probability aside in order to get swiftly to its spiritual point . After one day 's preaching by this unknown foreigner the whole population of the city , estimated as something like twelve hundred thousand , believed and repented . The king came of his throne and proclaimed a fast . In this fast the animals as well as men were to share , and they as well as men were exhorted to put up , in their dumb , undeveloped way , their prayer for mercy . It is significant that the name of the king is not given , nor is anything mentioned that could fix a date for so remarkable an occurrence . There is no reference to the splendor of the city ? a wonder in the world ? or to its commerce or its conquests . The author ignores all this because he sees nothing but God 's relation to his creatures ? men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they have His gift of Life . To get the force of the Midrash it must also be pointed out that the people of Nineveh , like the sailors of Joppa , bad a religion which was not that of Israel . To the Hebrew they were cursed of Jehovah , and therefore of Jehovah 's followers . The terms of the true Word of God are all the more , then , a rebuke to sectarian intolerance . " So the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even unto the least of them . For word came unto the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes . And he caused it to be proclaimed . . saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste any thing : let them not feed , nor drink water : But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathen should pray and receive grace was as incredible to the Hebrew as that the dim-hearted beasts should join in with them . Furthermore , that those outside the one true fold should be the recipients of mercy was distasteful to the orthodox monopoly of God . " And God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God I repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto them ; and he did it not . But it displeased Jonah exceedingly , and he was very angry . " He had hoped to see the threatened evil come , and the city overthrown . Though he knew that its people were fasting and praying , he was sure that . a heathen repentance could not do any good . But here was the city spared and an enemy of the true faith allowed to go on flourishing . His prayer of protest will be familiar to all devotees of any religion obliged to look on and see other religions blessed and prosperous . " And he prayed unto the Lord , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not this my saying , when I was yet in my country ? Therefore I fled before unto Tar-shish : " . . . He knew the Lord would be too kind . He would think too much of man as man , and not exclusively enough of Israel . The very fact of His calling a prophet to go to Nineveh suggested an indifference to heresy which the loyal Israelite could not but condemn . " For I knew that thou art a gracious God , and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repentest thee of the evil . Therefore now , 0 Lord , take , I beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live . " Even then Jonah could not believe that the Jehovah whom he had trusted as the tribal deity of the Hebrew could really mean to befriend those who called God by another name and worshiped Him with other rites . He would retire and look on , waiting to see if his narrow faith would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . . . and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , that he might see what would become of the city . " What follows between God and him approaches in compassion and tenderness the parable of the Prodigal Son . The Father does not punish this rebellious child , iu whom creedal arrogance has killed genuine humanity , as well as the love that was afterward known as charity . On the contrary , He understands him , He deals with him gently , He gives him a further lesson , He appeals to his sense of fairness . He first prepared ? Lhe word is the same as that used of the " great fish " ? a plant of the gourd family to come up over the booth , and Jonah was " exceeding glad " because of it . Apparently he loved it , doubtless for its shade and possibly for its beauty . But the next day , just . as Jonah is rejoicing in his gourd , God prepared a worm which smote the plant that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun arose , that God prepared a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah , that he fainted . " Again he requested for himself that he might die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live . " On Jonah 's disappointment over the loss of his plant the Father bases His appeal . It is a genuine appeal , like that of the father to the elder son in our Lord 's parable . Jonah is not rebuked for his intolerance toward God and men ; he is only asked to use his sense of justice . " Then said the Lord , Thou bast had pity on the gourd , for that which thou ' last not laboured , neither mutest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night : And should not spare Nineveh , that great city , wherein are more than a hundred and twenty thousand little children and also a great many animals ? " That is all . The tale concludes with striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fate is not the subject of the MidraA . In setting forth the broad , un-national , unsectarian nature of the love of God , the essential truth has been expressed . The conclusion , with its emphasis on little children and the lowly beasts ? " six score thousand persons that can not discern between their right hand and their left , and also much cattle " is the version of our English Old Testament ? has a beauty of its own . If I have been prolix over this analysis it is to draw the contrast between the outer vehicle of the Word of God and the Word itself . The vehicle belongs to its time . What was the natural expression of one generation is perplexing to another . The " great fish , " and the gourd which sprang in one night and withered on the next , have so puzzled millions of readers that they have neverlifted their eves from the casket to look at the scroll within . The Word of God , on the other hand , presents no difficulties . Once we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While there might be , andqloubtless have been , thousands of theories as to the gourd and the " great fish , " there can not , I think , be two opinions concerning the all-inclusiveness of God 's love , set forth here with such artless picturesqueness . The same thing , I venture to believe , will be found true all through the Bible . It is an infallible Bible , but infallible in that purpose which it is designed to serve . Where the question is of the relations of God to man and of man to God , I am convinced that it never errs . All other questions , historical or scientific , are outside the scope of the Word of God . Their answers are given elsewhere . This spiritual reading will be found more or less independent of both Modernist and Fundamentalist . I have given an interpretation of the Book of Jonah which might be called Modernist for the reason that it is guided by modern scholarship . But should anyone prefer to read the little work as a narrative of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The universality of God 's care can be as apparent to the man who sees in the " great fish " a cachalot whale as it is to him who understands it as an invention for the uses of a Mittrash . This , 1 think , is true of all the vexed passages in Scripture . The spiritual meaning , simple and convincing , can be seen as detached from all extraneous circumstance . The extraneous circumstance can be matter of the most intense historic or antiquarian interest ; but the Word of God is an eternal quality which frees itself from all that is the mere accident of Time , coming straight from Mind to mind .
