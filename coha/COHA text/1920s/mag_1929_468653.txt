ONE cool morning in California my breakfast was interrupted by a great clatter and some shrill whistles from the front of the house . When I went out I found two young men of my acquaintance in the most disreputable Ford roadster I had ever seen . They were off , they informed me , to New York ? " where all good young newspaper men go eventually . " " But you do n't expect to get there in that ? " I protested . " Sure , we 'll get there . Just look at our equipment . " They lifted the cover of the rear compartment and I looked in . I saw a portable phonograph , a roll of brown army blankets acting as a buffer for a half dozen bottles of white wine , and a row of books , containing at least six titles of modern poetry . I have little doubt that the display was arranged in just that fashion to impress stay-at-homes like myself with the limitless courage of young adventurers and that a practical kit of tools lay concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cynicism on any feeble flame of romance left flickering for this post-war generation , I looked properly awed and asked them in for coffee . When pressed for the reason of their sudden decision to trek eastward , they were somewhat inarticulate . When I reminded them that New York was already overcrowded with bright young men out of college with equipment and ambitions similar to their own , they readily admitted the fact . They ad-mitted , also , that they would have only money enough to keep them for two weeks after they arrived . But something would turn up . They would n't write home for help anyway . Look at all the people they knew who had gone and got by somehow . A lot of them had succeeded too , and were making reputations and money . New York was the only place left where their sort ? fellows who did n't want to go into business , who had some talent , but no special professional training ? could get anywhere . They did n't care so much about the money end of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! And to make a living while doing so . All the interesting people in the country went to New York , and all the interesting jobs were there . " Look at our newspapers , " one of them said . " A little local news and a. lot of boiler-plate sent out by the New York syndicates . Canned features by New York columnists about New York events . Why , even our book reviews are syndicated now , and when I was in high school I used to dream I 'd be book editor of the Tribune some day ! There 's not a decent magazine published in the whole West ? no books published here . There are probably a lot of people interested in the things that interest us , but we never get together . We do n't know one another . We 're spread over too much territory . Oh , I know a few arty fools on the Hill hold poetry readings and moon about their souls ; but that 's not what I mean . " " If you think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs you imagine so interesting are n't dull to the people who hold them , you 're romancing , " I said . " Here , at least , you have a certain physical freedom ? " " Freedom ! " scoffed the other boy . " More space to move around in , yes ; but not freedom to live as you please . Why , last week I went down to the office carrying a cane . I 'd always had a sneaking desire to , but could n't get up the nerve before . I was nearly kidded to death . The fellows kept calling me Oscar . If I 'd worn spats , they would have mobbed me . Only visiting English lecturers can get away with that sort of thing here . That would n't happen in New York . People are too busy to care what you do , and you can do as you please because you 're so anonymous . We 're too far from Europe out here to be civilized . " And then , Iike a true native son , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad as the Middle West , at that . " It was after these two young men and their machine had disappeared down the hill , accompanied by a cacophony of loose fenders , that I realized that if I had been living in the 1850s or ' 60s , in the Southeast , New England , or the Ohio Valley , I might have received a farewell visit in that distant day from young Americans very much akin in spirit to these boys . The young men of the ' , 50s , it is true , would have employed a different idiom . Instead of climbing into a " flivver " and shouting , " So long ! " they undoubtedly would have bowed a graceful farewell and might even have gone down to the harbor and the clipper ship , or out to their covered wagon on the sun-baked road , singing , " Good-Night , Ladies . " But like my young friends , they , too , would have been seeking romance , adventure , and a wider freedom ; and they would have concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The family histories of my friends were typical of those of so many young Westerners . They were both descendants of pioneer settlers . Both had heard much of their picturesque , gun-toting forebears , of the roaring , free-booting West of the Bonanza Kings . But they had seen their fathers turn to golf and " Service " ; and not to be deluded by the grandeur that was , they saw clearly that theirs was a West conquered and regimented . Fresh from college , with a. distaste for business , vague literary ambitions , and the moral compulsion of earning their livings , they cast about for an opportunity to follow their particular bent , but found that this West had little to offer them . Like thousands of similar youths throughout the country , their eyes turned inevitably to New York . For if the West spelled opportunity for the ambitious Eastern youth of sixty and seventy years ago , there can be no doubt that New York spells opportunity for the Western youth of to-day . Together with their brothers and sisters from the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as prepared as were their forefathers to face the dangers and undergo the hardships of a frontier . Like their forefathers , they , too , have no illusions about the immediate sacrifices demanded of them , but are inclined to underestimate the length of time they will be called upon to make them . Often they have left comfortable , spacious homes , loving families , an easy existence . They know that life in New York may be cramped , difficult , ugly , precarious , unhealthful . They know that competition for jobs and honors will be keen because they arc only part of a host with similar aims and desires . Yet they pour into New York by the trainloads from North , South , and West ? these adventurers who , like my two young friends , want to Iive interesting lives among interesting people and in whose hands , in the main , the cultural and artistic future of America rests . I do not mean to imply , of course , that all the restless souls who flock by the thousands to Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual companionship . Along with those who come to write , paint , act , study , or to make a living in a fairly congenial fashion until Opportunity knocks ; along with the newspaperman who expects to become a columnist , the " ad " writer or commercial artist who hopes some day to land a big account and a little leisure , the girl who has always loved books and wants a job in a publishing house where she thinks she can commune with kindred spirits ? along with all these comes the young engineer , the young man with an eye on Wall Street , the farm boy and shop girl seeking for thrills and a brighter life . But it is the first group which is more significant , both as regards its acquisition by New York and its alienation from its native heath . For it is the steady influx of such young men and women which gives New York its intellectual buoyancy ; and it is with the departure of such as these that hope wanes in the hinterland for an indigenous culture , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealistic or aesthetic the aims of the newcomer may be , he knows when he leaves home that the immediate problem ahead of him is that of survival . Life in New York is going to be interesting , exciting , and satisfying , he is sure , and some day he 's going to get somewhere ; but in the meantime he must meet the city on its own terms and compete for a livelihood with thousands of like-minded adventurers as well as with the more formidable natives . The hardness of New York and the " brass " of the New Yorker is a legend which he has heard repeated again and again when his elders have been eager to stress the greater geniality of the West . So he comes prepared to perpetuate this legend . Long before his train arrives at Pennsylvania Station or Grand Central he has steeled himself for his first meeting with the " typical hard-boiled New Yorker , " little realizing that when he encounters him , he is likely to discover that this flinty-souled gentleman preceded him by only a few trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home . These " typical New Yorkers " from Kansas , Iowa , California , Rhode Island , and Georgia have come to New York , like our newcomer , with a purpose ; and they know that one ca n't afford to be soft here . Some day , when they have " arrived " and made names for themselves , they will go back home to live quietly and comfortably , or on to Europe . Meanwhile they must be ruthless and , if necessary , indulge in social and personal gaucheries and jesuitical practices which would have shocked their souls back home . Victory , they feel sure , is reserved for the swiftest , the shrewdest , the most intelligent , or even for the best bluffer . The meek inherit a ticket back home and a stodgy life with the old folk , If they have misgivings , they hide them in their furnished rooms in the Fifties , in their attic studios in Greenwich Village , or in their boarding houses near Columbia . When they sally forth it is to make brave faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattanites from the hinterlands are able to adjust themselves so readily to their new environment , of course . The " hard-boiled " attitude or its simulation is constitutionally impossible to some . Many of these have come with no other purpose than to live obscurely in the shadow of great events and high excitements . If they can make an adequate living in some not too uncongenial occupation , see the plays which interest them , read good hooks , meet like-minded people , and feel that they . are living at the heart of things , they are content . While still in the West , I received a letter from such an unambitious youngster who had turned down a promising position in the oil business for a thirty-five dollar a week job on a New York magazine . " I 've been eating in the Automat and stalling the landlady for a week , " he wrote , " but on Saturday be affluent . You should sec The Enormous Room ? just big enough for me , the couch , and a chair ? on the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue ' L. ' The keeps me awake until one or two , and then at six the Street Cleaning Department begins bumping the 16th Street garbage cans around the sidewalk . I 'll get used to the noise soon ; and later , perhaps , to the dirt and the subway smell . New York is a dirty , noisy hole , choked with coal dust . " But what do you think ? Yesterday I discovered that Edgar Lee Masters lives in the parlor suite two floors below me , and Dreiser lives around the corner . I saw Willa Cather in Washington Square last evening , and on Sunday a chap on our sheet is taking me to tea to meet Robinson . On cut-rate tickets , I 've seen the three big plays of the season ? plays that will never get West because they 're too good to be successful . New York is n't comfortable , but it gives you a feeling of living with your finger on the pulse of the world . " There are other unadjusted New Yorkers , talented and ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout their wares in the marketplace . Occasionally one of them " arrives " ? usually through the efforts of some influential well-wisher . Most of them , however , just hang on , trying to cultivate their nerve or waiting philosophically for the chance that may never come . Among these , the unambitious and the unaggressive , may be found some of the most charming people in New York . But a typical arritriste is my young friend Max . When I knew Max and Sue in the West , they lived in a charming house that rambled up a steep flower-covered hillside and overlooked a sparkling blue bay . The site and view were such as American millionaires look for but seldom find along the Riviera . Halfan hour away was the city where they both worked , one as " ad " writer and the other as commercial artist for the same agency . Then one day the agency transferred them East to the home office . When I visited them in New York they were living in a two-room-and-bath apartment . Sue cooked their breakfasts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathroom . They were making much more money , but it cost them much more to live , and they cursed their " sublimated tenement life . " " Why not go home and he comfortable ? " I asked them . Max shook his head . " New York 's the only market for my kind of wares . I 'm going to put one book across before I go home if it means working day and night . The day it comes out I 'll kick the dust of this damned , dirty , pseudo-sophisticated hick town from my shoes and go home and live like a gentleman . " That was five years ago . During the last two years they have both been quite successful . Max finally published his novel . Not the one he wanted to write , of course ; but one that is sure to be talked about and which , because of its scenario angles , will probably get into the movies . He attends literary teas , cultivates the columnists and critics , and gets tight with his publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , he will protest loudly that all this literary " hokum " makes him sick , but the next minute he will forget himself and wax jubilant over a sensational feature story about the book which a friendly newspaper man has been able to get syndicated for him . Return home now ? Good Lord , no ! He 's rushed to death working up publicity on the book , but he intends to start another and better one soon and he has to be in New York where things are happening . He guesses he 'll sell the house on the hill . Some day when he 's made more money , he 'll buy a farm up in Westchester or Connecticut or maybe go to Europe to live . Paris would n't be so bad . One can not blame all the sins against the human spirit for which the metropolis is infamous upon the ambitious newcomer and completely absolve the native New Yorker . This would be as foolish as to credit the latter with all the city 's brilliance , beauty , tolerance , friendliness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The native New Yorker is usually the child of some American or European adventurer who came here for spoils as well as freedom , and much of the competitive and predatory blood of his fathers still flows in his veins . But he has become tempered by a certain sophistication and disillusionment . He knows that New York is not the Promised Land ; that the citadels of fame and fortune are not so vulnerable as they appear to the na ? ve newcomer , and he has fewer illusions about their grandeur . Because the New York of the present has become the cultural , as well as the financial center of the country , it is attracting a new type of American adventurer to-day . A few decades ago the eyes of . the more intellectual and artistic fraternity turned to Boston . To-day they focus on Manhattan . But like the earlier ambitious settlers of a generation or two ago , these later pioneers from the provinces have come to New York , not because it is a pleasant place in which to live pleasantly for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the European invader New York is also a battleground and a marketplace ? a frontier spelling material opportunity for himself and cultural opportunity for his children . He , too , must struggle first for survival and then for advantage ; and because of the handicaps which he suffers as an alien , he usually goes the American invader one better in the single-minded pursuit of his aims . But it is the country 's young careerists jockeying for position , as well as the new aliens struggling for a foothold , who give New York its reputation for cold-bloodedness , its aspect of a granite jungle swarming with predatory humanity . ' H The careerists are not continuously ruthless , of course , any more than they are always rushing about bent upon achieving some practical end . Some of them are kindly , unselfish , and gracious . The time they spend over their luncheons would bring tears of anguish to the eyes of the Western go-getter . But in the main , it seems to me , the current New Yorker lives with his eye cocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home . It is more likely to be a full-time job with him . He has made , and is making , sacrifices to be in line for opportunity when it comes . It is only human that he does not want these sacrifices to be in vain . He is not hypocritical in regard to this attitude . He makes little or no effort to bide his purposefulness . He is out after the " right contacts " and he seeks them in his social as well as his business connections . It is this latter attitude which is so likely to shock the disinterested stranger . Friendships in the West ( the section I know best ) , and probably in the South and New England , are more rarely cultivated for the sake of their practical ends . To the newcomer New York seems to present a swarm of eager climbers after " contacts " ? business , social , literary , and artistic ; and he is naturally revolted . When he looks closer , of course , he finds that a large proportion of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a year or two . New York has acted upon them , to be sure ; but how violently they in turn are reacting on New York ! Except during such moments when he yearns for his old friends back home , our New Yorker does not shed any tears over the fact that the people with whom he associates are inclined to place as obvious an emphasis upon self-interest as he does himself . Such people fit into his new scheme of life . He does not want any " lame ducks " on his hands . He has n't , he feels , time for them . Once he himself is established , however , he is perfectly willing to help his friends and acquaintances . On the slightest provocation he will boost them to the skies and go to almost any length to advance their interests . A friend tells me that a New York woman whom she chanced to meet at tea and with whom she exchanged a few commonplaces promised to help her achieve a much-sought-after position in which she had heard she was interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of this woman whom she had never seen before , it was accomplished . On my own first evening in New York , a prominent magazine writer and former Westerner whom I had met casually for the first time , on learning that I was looking for a job , sat down at our host 's typewriter and wrote for me three letters of introduction to as many New York editors , referring to me as " a friend from home , " and giving a highly colored and somewhat fictitious account of my talents and abilities . I doubt if I could have such an experience in the West . If I were a stranger from the East with a few letters of introduction , the people to whom they were addressed would invite me to dinner and would introduce me to their closest friends . I should be taken for long motor rides to see the country . I might be asked to make my home with them until I could get settled . A party might be staged in my honor and every gracious kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to earn my living would not be mentioned . If I were so rude as to mention it myself and ask about possibilities for work , my new friends might look thoughtful , or say that they would make inquiries , that they would " keep it in mind , " etc. if they knew of a definite opening they might even go so far as to hint ( oh ! so indirectly ) to the employer , that they knew someone who might he interested . That they would actually lie in my behalf would be inconceivable . Their attitude would not imply that they are more heartless or more honest than the New Yorker . They simply do n't ? me their friends and acquaintances in the New York sense , either for themselves or for anyone else . The " arrived " New Yorker on the other hand , who has come on from San Francisco , Des Moines , New Orleans , or Boston , has been through the mill himself and he knows what it means . He has known loneliness , discouragement , disillusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not obtained here unless one knows someone . You may be a complete " dud " or one of those promising youngsters who achieve the electric lights or the front page eventually . Anyway , you need help and he is willing to take a chance on you . If you fail , the man to whom he has given you an introduction wo n't remember it a month hence anyway . If you succeed , he knows that you are likely to " play ball " with a person who has treated you so well . He may want to ask a favor from you some day and he wo n't hesitate if he does . The notorious " log-rolling " of New York cliques , about which the outsider complains so bitterly , undoubtedly has its origin in such obligations . The New Yorker 's greatest sin is disloyalty to his circle . The intense group-loyalties of the New Yorker grow out of the physical conditions of New York life , which are , in a modern sense , akin to those of the old frontier . In no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness be so acute and overwhelming . The city 's immensity , the height of its buildings , its intense mechanization and hurrying millions . all tend to lessen the human stature and make the newcomer feel like a child lost in an unfriendly world . His few friendships assume gigantic importance . Even after he has become a seasoned Manhattanite and complains bitterly about the horde of uninteresting people he is forced to meet , he clings tenaciously to the small group of people whom he knows fairly well and who live usually within walking distance of his own abode . A close friendship between a man who lives on 160th Street and one who lives on 12th is practically out of the question . No one here has time to travel that distance after a fatiguing day . The new arrival usually settles in the section inhabited by his few friends . They introduce him to their friends , and he becomes one of a little group of people who have similar interests and habits . The members keep one another informed of chances and opportunities and zealously guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of a New York publication made up entirely of close personal friends . Every hint of a vacancy is carried home to some friend who is ready to apply for the place before the managing editor knows he has a place to dispose of . But even after one is drawn into some such circle , I doubt if there is any other place which gives the sense of complete personal freedom that New York offers . The stranger may feel free in any large city , but as soon as he is drawn into the current of its life , takes a job , makes friends , and establishes a residence , he finds that in his private life and opinions he is expected to conform to the norm of his class . But New York offers a minimum of social impingement upon the individual conscience . Perhaps this is because the New Yorker cares too much for results to care very much by whom or how they are accomplished . Whatever the reason , the fact makes New York the most comfortable abode for the nonconformist , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live his life in his own way . As a rule , the security of one 's job is not influenced by what one does after five o'clock . Nor is one 's social position so dependent upon lip-service to the tribal mores . The newcomer finds that so long as he is effective the average employer is not concerned with his personal idiosyncrasies ; and the New Yorkers with whom he comes in contact are more concerned that he be interesting and amusing than that he subscribe to any particular social dogma . I do not mean that the Bolshevist is likely to find a berth with the National Security League , or that the professed atheist would be joyously received by the communicants of John Roach Stratum I do know of a man , however , who went fresh from the city editorship of the leading Communist daily to a similar position on New York 's most conservative journal . The new arrival finds that opinions for which he may have been branded a " freak " back home pass unnoticed here . The misfit of the provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This sense of freedom from neighborly curiosity and social pressure does not spring entirely , I am sure , from the mere size of the metropolis , because to me the comparatively small city of San Francisco most closely approximates New York in this respect . It is due , no doubt , to the cosmopolitan and shifting character of the New York population and to the steady influx of Youth . To the average young person who comes here this quality is likely to outweigh the personal discomforts of crowded living , bad climate , and nervous strain . Iv In that friendly book New York Is Not America , Ford Madox Ford has written : " Well , one hears eternally that New York is not America . It is obviously not Europe ? the Atlantic lies between . Is it , then , the outer fringe of America ? or the end of Europe ? Perhaps the one overlapping the other . . . " It is just that ? an area where one overlaps the other ; and it is this which accounts for the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sophisticated , as well as the crudest and most blatant of American cities . It is the first of these qualities which attracts to it the sensitive , talented youth of the land ; and it is the latter which so often thwarts them spiritually while it rewards them materially . It is a trading post that deals in European refinements and philosophies and , at the same time , with the raw materials of American life . While it may not be America , I venture to say that it is fast becoming the most American , as well as the most European , of all our cities . All other American cities are imitating it , as they are bound to imitate what is biggest , swiftest , and most mechanized . It is in tune with the spirit of the age and the nation . Where it leads , New Orleans , Minneapolis , Duluth , Los Angeles , and Boston will follow . To-morrow every American metropolis will go in for that air of slightly bored sophistication and cosmopolitanism of which New York is so proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European . That can hardly be expected of people so few generations removed from the backwoodsman . With the European , sophistication means merely an urbane acceptance of life . With the Manhattanite , it is likely to mean a conscious hardening to it . New York is crowded with Europeans , of course , but the bulk of these are not of the class that goes in for undue refinement in feeling and expression . Most of them , particularly of the younger generation , are too busy making themselves over into what they imagine is American to perpetuate the more gracious European traditions . The New Yorker wears his sophistication as the new arrival from the hinterlands wears his first derby . He is not quite comfortable in it and wonders what the folk on Main Street would think if they could see him now . Nor is he ? our New Yorker ? quite comfortable in many other respects . He has known a life that is duller , perhaps , but free from dirt , noise , nervous wear-and-tear . He has lived where living costs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space in which to relax , and where one can get away from people . Consequently , he is always turning back to that life for the moment , rushing off for a week-end in Connecticut , a week 's vacation in Maine , a fortnight in Florida , or a summer in Europe . No one vacations as frequently or as seriously as the New Yorker . He is always talking of " a little farm somewhere " where he 's going to live some day ? a non-productive farm , to be sure , with all the latest conveniences . He has a permanent and sentimental nostalgia for the open spaces . In Manhattan he may be gaining everything he had longed for , but it is not quite enough . Whatever his city 's deficiencies , however , he will never quite emancipate himself from it . Once the Manhattan tempo is in his veins , he will not stay far or long away from it . The little farm will be within commuting distance . He will go abroad for a year or two , perhaps ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to return . One thing he practically never does , and that is , go home to stay . After a few years in Manhattan , the Pacific Coast , Denver , Chicago even , seem the end of the world . One may run over to Paris , but a similar distance to San Francisco seems an insuperable barrier . He came East with the idea of making his mark and then returning home . But the West has lost him and its other bright young boys and girls forever . This is , I think , the West 's misfortune , as it is the misfortune of Maine , Ohio , and Kentucky . it is more serious for the former than for the latter , because the West is farther from the metropolis , and the expenses of trans-continental travel make frequent going back and forth , with consequent exchange of values , impractical . A similar situation exists , of course , in Europe . Ambitious and talented young Frenchmen and Englishmen are constantly pouring into Paris and London . But to the great mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a matter of hours . Young people from Provence and Normandy , or from Devon and Lancashire , may visit their capitals for intellectual stimulation . The Parisian or Londoner , also , can make frequent excursions into the home provinces and keep in touch with the simple verities of rural and small-town life . His national life is homogeneous and closely knit . But when the American Westerner goes to Manhattan he is likely to leave home and family behind him for years , or perhaps forever . He is completely cut off from his sources . It is probable that nothing can be done to remedy this . Restless youth will always seek frontiers , whether they promise physical or intellectual adventure . And the lure of Manhattan has its national compensations . Life here tends to counteract a narrow provincialism , and whatever European flavor the city possesses is a grateful complement to our national naivete . If I were an all-powerful , benevolent despot , I should make at least one year in New York a required part of each promising youth 's education .

Shortly after the Armistice we had an atrocious popular song which began , " How 're you goin ' to keep ' em down on the farm after they 've seen Farce ? " The country 's problem at the present moment may well be ? How are you going to keep them from staying away after they 've seen Manhattan ? We can not so long as Manhattan remains the answer to their economic needs as well as to their intellectual unrest . So long as Western ( and Northern and Southern ) universities continue to graduate thousands of boys and girls who can find no place for themselves in the business and professional life of their communities , those boys and girls will turn to New York , which , in some miraculous fashion I have never been able to fathom , manages to absorb them into its newspaper , magazine and advertising offices ; its publishing houses , theaters , studios , social agencies , decorating and antique shops , and to render them some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist is unable to maintain himself at home until he is able to command recognition , he , too , will turn to New York , where such institutions as the part-time or occasionalfree-lance job enable him to " get by " while he plies his brush or typewriter . I am quite aware that the young artist of obvious talents in the West often achieves a local patron . The West is generous to the local talent it recognizes ? too generous at times to too slight a talent . But the Western patron does not , as a rule , take chances on the less obvious talent that may require years for maturing . This is largely because he is uncertain . He is in the habit of looking to the East for artistic and literary dicta . The less obvious artist is left to work out his own salvation and , unless he has money , he must find some occupation which will take only a part of his time and energy . There are not enough of these occupations in the West . A common lament from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York point of view . This generalization is not true , of course ; otherwise we should never have had , in the realm of literature alone , a Sherwood Anderson , a Carl Sandburg , or a Willa Cather . But it is true that practically all American art is passed upon by people with this point of view , and that the folk back home look to the New York critic to tell them what is good and bad . A small New York group can tell our country what 's what , because ? as a nation ? we seek from it arbitrary dicta about the arts . Most of us have not developed a personal sense of values . We do n't trust ourselves . We are too afraid of being " taken in . " This has happened so often to our Innocents , at home and abroad , that we are particularly sensitive on that score .

" All this is easier said than done , of course ; and I am not implying that any American community ever will , or can , compete with New York in the diversity of its intellectual and artistic opportunities . But if it can not manufacture opportunities , it can check somewhat the present stampede toward Manhattan by a more intelligent and critical cultivation of an indigenous culture . If some of the concern which goes into preserving and enhancing its natural beauties and physical advantages were turned to fostering its latent art life , some progress might be made in this direction . Public golf courses and swimming pools donated by kind-hearted millionaires and memorials erected by public subscription undoubtedly have their value ; but if some Portland , Denver , or Los Angeles philanthropists were to subsidize for a few years a hundred talented young men and women in each locality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an occasional genius might emerge . I am inclined to think that one virile , first-rate magazine in each large American city ? a magazine that is literary , artistic , critical , catholic in its policy ( and not devoted to local boosting ) , would do more to serve as a rallying point for intellectual interests and as an outlet for local talent than could any othersingle agency . I am aware that a dozen American cities have their feeble imitations of the facetious New Yorker devoted largely to Society , sports , and the more respectable Bohemianism ; that half a dozen others boast precious and esoteric little journals in the manner of the Paris Tran8ition , but neither of these is what is needed . The Westerner who has lived in Manhattan is not eager that his home town should take over wholesale the manners and methods , the point of view and tempo of the metropolis . But he really would like a good reason to go home . He is not anxious to leave the three-ring circus that is New York for a one-ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spaciousness and vigor of his West might be leavened with some of that intellectual freedom and stimulating companionship that New York offers . Perhaps it is asking too much of the West ? and of the South and North ? that it should develop the outstanding virtues , without the corresponding vices , of New York life . But unless this can be done , in some degree , the highways leading Manhattanward will continue to be crowded with bright young pioneers who feel , with my two young friend s in the disreputable roadster , that " New York 's the only place left where fellows of our sort can get anywhere . "
