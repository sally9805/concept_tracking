Coast Guard boat Algonquin splintered the deck of the Federalship , a Canadian rumrunner flying the flag of the Republic of Panama . When the smoke cleared , Captain Stewart S. Stone of the Federalship stood upon her bridge with his hands up , signifying surrender . His ship was towed into San Francisco . On board were 12,500 cases of Scotch whiskey valued at $1,000,000 and 19 young adventurers . <P> " It was an act of war for the U. S. to fire on my Panama ship , " said Captain Stone . Perhaps he did not know that Panama had approved an agreement with the U. S. whereby any ship " guilty of habitual smuggling or piracy against a friendly nation " automatically forfeits its registry . However , a long battle in the Federal courts remains to be fought over the Federalship and its clinking cargo . <P> Meanwhile , in Washington , D. C. , last week the French Embassy permitted itself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin , wines and champagne had arrived with all the diplomatic seals broken and with one-fourth of the consignment missing .
