The House of Lords did not send the Irish Bill ( TIME , Sept. 29 et seq. ) back to the Commons . An amendment was proposed by Lord Carson ; but , reminded by Lord Salisbury that it would be unfortunate to enter into conflict with " another place " ( stock phrase of the Lords for the House of Commons ) , he withdrew the motion and the bill was passed . <P> The Speaker of the House of Commons was thereupon summoned to the House of Lords to hear the Royal Assent given to the bill , the full title of which is the Irish Free State ( Confirmation of Agreement ) Bill . The measure became a law of the land , a law by which the Government at London is empowered to appoint a commissioner for Northern Ireland on the Boundary Commission . <P> At Belfast , Sir James Craig , Premier of Northern Ireland , sounded an ominous note when he declared , in a speech , that , if the decision of the Boundary Commission were unacceptable to the Ulster Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would resign , place himself at the head of the people as their chosen leader to defend any territory which the Boundary Commission might wish to filch from them .
