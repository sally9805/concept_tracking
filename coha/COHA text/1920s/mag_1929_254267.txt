The State Department had no sooner smoothed over one international liquor problem last week , than it found itself confronted with another , more serious one . <P> Temporary seizure of diplomatic liquor en route from Baltimore to the Siamese legation had created an Incident that put the foreign corps in Washington on edge ( TIME , March 25 ) . Anxious to quiet ambassadorial nerves , the State Department obtained from the Treasury Department a red-taped but definite ruling that embassy liquor could be transported by private U.S. trucks and drivers without Federal molestation , provided an accredited diplomat was actually aboard the vehicle . <P> Then , the U.S. Coast Guard sank the British auxiliary schooner I 'm Alone , and killed one of her crew , an indefinite distance off the Louisiana coast near " Sixty Deep . " Sir Esme Howard , British Ambassador , called at the State Department for information , predicted this Incident might become " serious . " Rear Admiral Frederick C. Billard , Coast Guard Commandant , called the I 'm Alone a " notorious rumrunner " and explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt for inspection off Trinity Shoals . The Walcott had fired a three-pounder through the I 'm Alone 's rigging but instead of stopping she had turned and fled , her powerful Diesel engines boosting her out of reach . <P> Cornered by other U.S. craft 24 hours later on the high seas , the I 'm Alone was sent down by gunfire from the cutter Dexter . The man killed was a Negro seaman . The rest of the crew , in irons , were carried to New Orleans aboard the Dexter . Admiral Billard was positive the pursuit began within the twelve-mile limit and therefore within the terms of the British Rum Treaty . But the British embassy was not so sure . <P> The thing remained an Incident , if only because it was the first British vessel ever sunk by U.S. rumchasers . <P> The British penny press blazed with headlines : BRITISH CREW IN IRONS - BRITISH SKIPPER CHALLENGES U.S. CUTTER ! -I 'LL NOT SURRENDER ! - 100 SHOTS SINK BRITISH SHIP . <P> The I 'm Alone 's , skipper , Captain John T. Randell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans . Loaded with 2,800 cases of " assorted liquor , " his schooner , he said , was " anchored 14 to 15 miles offshore " when approached by the Walcott . He did not heave to because he did not think the U.S. had jurisdiction . His ship , he figured , went down 225 miles offshore in a heavy sea under 120 U.S. shots . The drowned negro , one Leon Mainjoy , was a French citizen . <P> Article 2 of the Anglo-American rum treaty declares that the U.S. rights of search and seizure of British vessels " shall not be exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the U.S. . . . than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected . ' ' Common practice has made this treaty-line twelve miles offshore .
