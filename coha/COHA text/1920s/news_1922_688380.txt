txt The appeal of President HARDING for observance of Education Week is " properly motivated , " to use a phrase which modern pedagogy hag given us , but of which he doubtless never heard in his schooldays . It is motivated by a conception of public education as preparing youth to do their public duty , to " envisage the ' problems of a greatly distraught world " and to " contemplate . with open , unprejudiced mind the issues of the times . " This rather spacious and idealizing generalization is the goal toward which the whole creation of public education moves , or would move if the motivation could get itself expressed effectively . Comparing our present position with the mass of knowledge and ignorance a century ago , one can see that there has been progress . Yet when one reads the instances of pupil shortcomings , as reported in The New York Tribune by Mr. RACUSIN , who has spent three weeks in the schools of New York City , one feels that we have yet a long , long way to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually disclose , as he says , what " is happening to a great " proportion of the 931,000 children " who attend the city schools , " or even only to those who are on part time or in congested classes , an Education Week once a year is n't going to be enough . It is probable that the child who thought that " alike " and " different " had the same meaning mist have been thinking of distinctions without differences ; that the child who thought " sharp " and " dull " were identical was merely courteous , and that the one who could not distinguish between " calm " and " stormy . " had so far found " always fair weather . " - Moreover , children are often frightened into ignorance . A schoolgirl , according to the late Dr. MAXWELL , once said In answer- to the question , " What le a marsupial ? ** Ain ** " with a pouch upon its stomach into " which it could jump when ' it was " frightened . " So children frequently jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child and for the patient teacher , it yet is sadly , disgracefully - true that by reason of overcrowding , part time and inadequate provision , there are avoidable shortcomings in our schools . Superintendent ETTINGER in his address at the beginning of the year on " Facing the Facts , " said ; that ( de- , spite a perfunctory Moving ? up to make way for new pupils of which Mr. RACUSIN speaks ) 83,000 out of 716,000 failed of promotion . To this is to be added that out of every .100 pupils 31 were over age for their grades or were " laggards " ; some of them us many as three years be- ? hind . The consequence is that many reach . the age of 16 before they reach the TA grade . So there is " retardation . " Every consideration , economic and pedagogical , as Dr. ETTINGER said , " makes homogeneity of tho class group desirable , " but , as he added : " We are still far from " the attainment of that happy con " dition . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This allows the hope that , with differentiated curricula , varied modes of instruction and " flexible promotion schemes , " the " crying need of our children " will be met . But it can not be unless there is first of all physical room for all the children and unless the teacher is given freedom and time to do the vital work Which belongs to the teacher in a democracy . Education Week should be prolonged till this is accomplished in this city . It will not ' ' be till the Legislature makes the Board of Education independent of political control and directly responsible to the people of this great community .
