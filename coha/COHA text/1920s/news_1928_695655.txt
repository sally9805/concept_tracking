Mr. Hastings submitted to the court five affidavits , signed by the District Attorney , headed " the State of New York in the case against Jane Doe , John Doe and Richard Roe , " in connection with the murder of Arnold Rothstein . The five witnesses had been taken into custody a few minutes before by detectives at the conclusion of the Grand Jury session . All five witnesses previously had made statements to the District Attorney in the presence of a stenographer , in which they denied they knew the identity of the person who shot Rothstein , or of a motive for the killing , although Raymond , Thomas and Meehan had admitted participation in the card game in which Rothstein lost $300 , - 000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost $51,000 .

Raymond , Thomas and Meehan had not been called before the grand jury , while Bowe had testified and Stajer was in the midst of his testimony , when the session ended for the day . In asking that Raymond , Thomas , Meehan and Stajer be held in $100,000 bail each , and Bowe 's bail be placed at $10,000 , the District Attomey 's affidavit applying to each of the five men declared that he was " a necessary and material witness " who , the prosecutor was afraid , would not appear to testify when needed ; that he was a friend of persons implicated in the murder and " therefore hostile to the investigation . " The affidavits added that " material and necessary witnesses in the murder investigation already have been tampered with , that documentary evidence , material to the investigation , has been destroyed and stolen , " and from the attitude of the five men " it is apparent that they will not be available " to the District Attorney when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands of the District Attorney , and the five witnesses were led out of court in two groups .

Bowe and Stajer were that he could not furnish the required bail , while Bowe said that he was certain he could obtain the $10,000 bail in his case . Bowe and Stajer were fingerprinted at the station , after which Stajer was taken to the House of Detention , while Bowe was returned to the District Attorney 's office , where he was released on a. bond furnished by a surety company . The police , in denying a report that the five witnesses also had been photographed , refused to reveal the purpose of taking their fingerprints , but it was learned that the motive for this was to compare their finger impressions with impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in 's room at the Park Central after Rothstein was alleged to have been mortally shot there . Stajer is under bail in the Federal court in connection with his arrest - with two other men several weeks ago at the Prisament Hotel by Federal narcotic agents ? in an alleged drug smuggling offense . Before the three men were taken from the hotel that night , Rothstein appeared and subsequently furnished bail for them . Stajer had been questioned by Assistant Federal District Attorneys Blake and Sylvestra soon after the murder in an effort to obtain through him definite proof of the gambler 's connection with the smuggling ring . Subsequently he was questioned in the- murder investigation by Chief Assistant District Attorney Pecora , but , according to Mr. Pecora , while admitting that he had ? been a close friend of Rothstein for twenty years , Stajer denied that he had been Rothstein 's bodyguard , that be knew anything about the murder or its motive . He admitted , however , that about a ? week before the shooting Rothstein had told him about losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for payment by the winners and adding " now they have brought tough guys into the matter . " Stajer was permitted to go that day , but it was reported yesterday that a check-up by detectives of some of the statements he had made to Mr. Pecora had developed discrepancies and . that it was because of these and other evidence Mr. Banton had obtained that Stajer was considered a very important witness in the murder case and should be held in high bail . Soon after Raymond , Thomas , Meehan and Stajer had been placed in the House of Detention , Isaiah Leebove , counsel for Raymond , Meehan and Stajer , appeared before Supreme Court Justice Tierney and obtained writs of habeas corpus calling for the arraignment of his three clients in the Supreme Court at 11 o'clock this morning on his motion . to discharge them from custody .

Before the grand jury assembled shortly before 11. o'clock yesterday forenoon , the ' most elaborate precautions to ? prevent spying on witnesses and possible interference with the progress of the Rothstein investigation had been taken by District Attorney Banton and the police. - The grand jury chamber is on the third ' floor of the Criminal Courts building , and is connected by a bridge over White Street on . the north with the building occupied by the prosecutor at 137 Centre Street . At 9 o'clock in the morning , Captain Barry of the Elizabeth Street station and fifteen of his uniformed policemen appeared at the prosecutor 's office and were assigned to special posts with imperative orders that they were not to permit anybody to enter or leave the grand jury quarters or the District Attorney 's building , without special permission of the prosecutor 's secretary , John P. Donlin . The grand jury investigation , with Mrs. Keyes as the first witness , had been in progress a short time when Maurice Block , Democratic majority leader of the Assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber to the bridge leading to the District Attorney 's office . He was stopped by one of the policemen stationed there , and , although he insisted that as counsel for a defendant in another case he had a right to go to the prosecutor 's office , he was told that he would have to go down to the street and to to the main entrance of the prosecutor 's office . He got in there only after running a gauntlet of policemen and detectives . In the late afternoon , when telling of the inclusion of the woman as one of the murder suspects , Mr. Banton said that he Wand his aides had laid out in detail all the evidence that was to be presented to the grand jury . The manner of calling witnesses in accordance with how their testimony would dovetail with the evidence the prosecutor and the police had obtained had all been arranged , he said , and everything possible was done for its presentation with a smoothness and a clarity which would expedite the work of the grand jury in arriving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other indictments which may result from the investigation . It developed that when Stajer 's arrest was ordered , the District Attorney also placed in the hands of a detective ? a subpoena for William McCabe , another gambler , who had made a statement to the prosecutor the week before . his subpoena had not been served , it was understood , up to a late hour last night . He had told the prosecutor that he was on the steamship City of Chattanooga , returning to this city from Savannah , Ga . on the day Rothstein was shot , and arrived a few hours after the death of the gambler in Polyclinic Hospital . Mr. Banton refused to reveal whether a check-up of McCabe 's statement had brought about his decision to issue a subpoena for h1m . There was a report in the midtown district that detectives last night were seeking a man named Gill as a new witness in the Grand Jury investigation . It was said that the police had obtained information that Gill visited in the Park Central room a short time after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes before Rothstein was shot . Gill also was described as 's former " pay-off man " in gambling enterprises . District Attorney Banton denied having ordered the arrest in Philadelphia the night before of Frank Corbo , alias Frank Tucker , in connection with the Rothstein case . He said that the names of Corbo , or Tucker , and two of his alleged associates not under arrest , John ( Chickie ) Clark and " No-nose " Burke " mean nothing to me in the Rothstein investigation . " HIGH BAIL HOLDS 5 IN ROTHSTEIN CASE // ago and the possible bribing of the police and other officials in attempts to free ' or obtain light punishment for gangsters in acts of sabotage , shootings and blackjackings in those strikes . Mr. Banton refused to reveal the identity of the woman who had been named as a participant in the shooting of Rothstein . He explained that it was possible that wnen information obtained by the grand jury front witnesses yesterday had been run down she would be cleared of the murder charge . " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the fact that she has been named as an actual participant in the murder does n't mean anything just now , although it may mean much later as we progress with the presentation of the evidence to the grand jurors . I ca n't discuss the identity of this woman because that would interfere with the investigation . The public will have to wait for the end of this grand jury investigation before anything can be revealed as to the known central figures in this murder . " A further effort to obtain information from the prosecutor whether the woman was the person suspected of having first telephoned to Rothstein at Lindy 's restaurant before he was called to the hotel by met with the response that everything would be done to hide her identity . " There are some witnesses in this case who are very timid , " continued the District Attorney . " They have been afraid to tell what - they know , lest they suffer personal violence .

Seventy Witnesses to Be Called . " We developed ten more witnesses today , bringing the total of witnesses to be called before the grand jury thus far up to nearly seventy . We have gotten information about these new witnesses , whom we did not know existed in this case , through some of the testimony given today . " It may be that in investigating the other branches of the Rothstein case  --  the threats and interference with witnesses , the stolen Rothstein documents and the conspiracy on the part of Rothstein and others in the strikes  --  the evidence which we already have brought to light may be found to be invaluable in connection with the murder . " " Why was Mrs. Keyes secretly taken out of the city after her appearance today before the Grand Jury  --  were , you afraid she might be kidnapped ? " the prosecutor was asked . " Well , I do n't know anything about any possible plan to kidnap her . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing our best to see that no such thing takes place . " " Is it a fact that you have received information about the recent hiding place of and his wife ? " was another question . " It is not , " was the reply . " I have n't heard anything since the start of this investigation about the whereabouts of or his wife . " Soon after it became known that the Grand Jury had impounded the Rothstein secret files , Assistant Federal Attorney Blake , who had been conducting an investigation before the Federal Grand Jury in connection with Rothstein 's alleged leadership in an international ring which had smuggled millions of dollars in drugs into this country in recent years , called up Mr. Banton and arranged for a conference with him this morning .

Criticizes Moving of Files . Later , in telling of an agreement with District Attorney Banton 's office in connection with the Rothstein files , Mr. Blake several times used the term " Tammany influence . " " When the papers were at Rothstein 's home , " he said , " a cabinet containing the files INT . ' S removed to the Bank of America branch at Broadway and Forty-first Street . We got after that and looked through it , but we were not told later that it had been removed to the District Attorney 's office by Mr. Burkan or any of those from whom we might have cf. ; . pected such information . " Assistant District Attorney Unger agreed , while the files were being gone over last week at Mr. Burkan 's office , that they were not to be taken possession of by the State or the United States without due notice . Yet Saturday afternoon , when we knew nothing about such a project , they were removed from Mr. Burkan 's office . " Coincident with this possible interruption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustee in bankruptcy for Edward N. Fuller and William J. , the former brokers , made a motion in the Federal court to make the temporary administrators of the Rothstein estate defendants in an old suit against the dead gambler for the recovery of $366,768 , which it was contended Rothstein won from the two brokers in gambling before the failure of their firm and their conviction and Sentence to Sing Sing . Other legal moves were the signing of two orders by . Surrogate O'Brien in connection with Rothstein 's estate . One order called on the representatives of 's pawn shop at 1,330 Broadway , the Provident Loan Society , Simpson 's and other pawnbrokers in the city to appear before the Surrogate . today for questioning regarding jewelry and other property Rothstein may have pledged at their establishments before the shooting .
