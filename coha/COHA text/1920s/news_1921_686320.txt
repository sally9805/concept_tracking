Volpe with the Stadium concerts . Permit me to say that Mr. Volpe had nothing to do with the conception or execution of the project , except running away with what I ( with a capital " I " ) conceived , worked for , arranged and pointed out . It was I who conferred with Professor Story of the City College concerning the use of the Stadium for concerts every evening . ' It was I who met Mr. Volpe and his annexes. and who sent Mr. and Mrs. Volpe to Professor Story , advising them to take an option with me on the Stadium along the lines submitted by me to Professor Story and to the Volpe family . For three months I prepared the plans for the concerts in the Stadium  --  and suddenly announcements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Stadium by Arnold Volpe , &c.; : that some one else with bigger " I " than myself , with more power to lose money , I presume ) than I , was the manager of the concerts arranged by me and conceived by me .
