Some sort of greeting , some sort of banquet , had to be tendered by Britons , last week , to Ambassador Alanson Bigelow Houghton who had just returned from New York to his post in London . <P> Undeniably the situation was awkward . Nearly every British newspaper and review had said , last month , what a shame it was that Mr. Houghton had resigned as Ambassador ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) and sailed for New York , to stand for one of the Senatorial seats from that state as a Republican . When the Republican candidate was elected President of the U. S. , casual Britons supposed that Mr. Houghton must have been elected too , and that they had seen the diplomatic last of him . But instead he was defeated , and so he was back in London last week as Ambassador-and so a banquet really had to be arranged . By some Briton 's happy thought the banquet was tendered to Alanson Bigelow Houghton by the London Newsvendors Benevolent Association . <P> Anxious to put their distinguished guest at ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fareham , who is just now ferreting into corruption at Scotland Yard as Chairman of the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure . The prominence of the chairman 's police activities probably disarmed any suspicion on Ambassador Houghton 's part that Viscount Lee , who used to be First Lord of the Admiralty , would try to draw him out on the delicate subject of Anglo-U . S. naval rivalry . Lord Lee did just that . Worse , he raised a preliminary laugh at the Guest of Honor 's expense . Turning to big , tortoise-spectacled Mr. Houghton and then to the newsvendors , Lord Lee cheerily remarked : <P> " I trust the American Ambassador is bearing a sprig of olive branch in his mouth , and has come back to us in the guise of a dove rather than that of an eagle . " <P> Seemingly the newsvendors thought this pleasantry excruciating . When decorum was at last restored . Lord Lee said , in dead earnest : " It would be foolish to pretend that at this moment all is as well as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . But as one who has been in charge of the British Admiralty 's policy and a member of the Cabinet , it seems to me that there is much that is unreal , even absurd , in this naval controversy . <P> " What 's the use of quibbling about the relative strength of the two fleets when , in any future contingency , the American and British fleets will almost certainly be found alongside each other ? It is very significant that President Coolidge is holding the door open for British suggestions regarding naval disarmament . <P> " The best method of arriving at agreement as to the relative strength of our navies would be , I think , to delegate the matter to a commission of two , one American and one Englishman . Naval experts should not be permitted to embarrass the deliberations of these two statesmen . . . . I feel that Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Hoover or the Earl of Balfour and Mr. Hughes would agree where no conference of admirals or experts could . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
