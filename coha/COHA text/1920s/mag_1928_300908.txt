The hamlets of Athens , Tenn. , and Gilmer , West Va. , got into the nation 's news last week , because of two spiders . The Gilmer spider , a bright gold creature three inches in diameter , was discovered in the barn of one Arch Hefner , brother of County Clerk E. W. Hefner . Beneath this spider 's dwelling nook , plainly spun in sheerest spiderweb. the Brothers Hefner said they could read the name " Smith . " <P> At Athens , Tenn. , the spider-finder was one Lee Moses . More venturesome or perhaps more literate than the Gilmer spider , the Athenian spider had written " Smith-8-Y . " Spiderman Moses* interpreted this to mean , " Smith , eight years " and placed his bets accordingly . <P> <P> *No relation to cynical Senator George Higgins Moses of New Hampshire , Hooverizer of the East .
