I ASK to be taken as writing the pages that follow with sonic diffidence . When it is a matter of prose I know what I want ; I know what I want to say ; and I know that I can say what I want to say with some exactness . Prose is for me an instrument ? like a tool of precision . But the moment I come to want to write about verse I feel ? possibly doubts , possibly misgivings ; certainly some of the diffidence of the novice . For I suppose I never really devoted to the problem of verse any of the close and sedulous thought that gives a man a real right to demand to be listened to . I began to think about verse desultorily about 1912 ; it was not until 1915 or 1916 , during the enforced waitings of a life sometimes of rather frenzied action , that I devoted really the whole of my aesthetic mind to the practical side of verse-writing . I made , that is to say , a great number of metrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices that had been adopted by the writers of works that had given me that high , fine pleasure that poems alone can give . And , since that troubled time , I have continued in the same habits . I should like to make a confession of faith : I believe the conception ? and if possible the writing ? of poetry to be the only pursuit worthy of a serious man , unless the vicissitudes of his time call on him to be also a soldier . I have always held this belief ; I have never changed in it ; I trust that I never shall . I do not mean to say that there are no other pursuits , professions , callings , or avocations that Destiny may not force upon a proper man and he endure them with dignity , honour , and an unbent head . . . . But even then , if he does not follow them in the spirit of a poet ? and with the self-sacrifice of a soldier ? he is not a proper man and I hope I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier date that I have given above , although I never faltered in this belief , the only writings , at any rate of my own day , that I could call poetry had been in the form of prose , not f of verse . When ? so very occasionally ! ? in some of the writings of the poet laureate , of Mr Walter de la Mare , of Christina Rossetti , of Robert Browning , I came across passages that stirred me with an unmistakable call , it was the prose quality of those passages , not the metrical values , to which I attached importance . It was the beauty of the wording ; it was the beauty of the image evoked by the cont tact of simple words one beside the other . Of that earlier time I remember images called up by the two living poets . The one rendered distant ships , like silver-points on a grey horizon : that was Mr de la Mare ; the other made visible the depths of still fresh water , beside the piles of a boating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was in a poem by Mr Robert Bridges . I do not mean to say that I can not remember other passages of these two poets : I can . I believe I could recite several poems by each of them , with possibly a verbal error here and there . And just , as far as I am concerned , as it is with these two living poets so it is with the two dead ones . Christina Rossetti was an infinitely great master of words , but the emotions her work always gave me were those of reading prose ? and so it was with Browning . . . . I have seldom received a greater stirring of enthusiasm than on the day when ? quite late in life ? I first came upon the words , at the end of the first paragraph of the Flight of the Duchess : " And all this is our Duke 's Country ! " And that is certainly a prose effect and a prose rhythm . But is n't it glorious ' ? . . . So that , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Pound , the words coming out from some subconscious depths where I did not know that the opinion lay : " After all ? the only English poet that matters twopence is Browning ! " I do n't know what Mr Pound answered ; I very seldom do know what Mr Pound answers ; but he neither knocked me down nor screamed , so that I daresay he was substantially in agreement with myself . . . .  | I will try to make clear how this progression of effect has taken place in my thoughts . I was unconscious that it had taken place , as I have said ; but the idea having , as it were , reported itself for duty , I can trace its genesis . I trust I may be allowed to repeat myself ? I mean to repeat ideas that I have already put into print . I never came across any trace that any human soul had ever read any of my former critical writings ; by certain reverberations I can now tell that I have some readers , so I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I could not read " poetry . " I wanted to ; but I could not . I used to put that down to the fact that rhymes , accents , stresses , assonances , alliterations , vowel colourings , and the other devices of poets , embarrassed me . But this was not the case . . . . The real fact is that ? the dog it was that died . I have discovered this for myself from my own practice in verse . I found that as soon as I came to write a " poem " I automatically reduced my intelligence to the level of one nearly imbecile . And , looking one day through the Collected Edition of my own poems that some misguided publisher issued some years ago and that no soul appeared to purchase or read ? looking them through again , then , I was appalled to observe that in the whole affair there were not twenty lines that , had I been writing prose , I should not have supressed . . . Everything ; every single group of words was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not so much that the stuff was rhetorical ; it had not the marmoreal quality of true rhetoric ? the kind that one finds on tombstones . It was just silly ? with the silliness of a child of a bad type . ' Heaven knows I can not read my own prose with anything but mortification ? but it is a mortification proceeding rather from the eternal sense of failure that every conscious artist must feel all his life unless he has a good bottle of wine beneath his waistcoat . . . . One has had ideals and has fallen short . That is gloomy enough . But when I read my own verse I know that I have tried to write like a brandified sentimentalist . And I have succeeded every time . . . . Now , why is this ? I can assure the reader that alcoholism has very little to do with it . And I think I can give the answer . It is 1 Having lived in the world of men I am aware that this confession makes easy quarry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to make my point clear without being too uncivil to named colleagues , predecessors , or Classics ; and I do not much care , so long as I make my point , who scores off me.  | simply that every poet ? until lately every poet ? the moment he takes pen in hand in order to write , say , a sonnet or a triolet or decasyllables , rhymed or unrhymed , at once begins to " write " down . This was the case originally , simply because rhyme and metre were difficult things and an indulgent , primitive public made allowances . Nowadays the writing down has become a habit , a fashion , a necessity ? and a less primitive , less indulgent public can no longer be got to listen to Verse at all . At any rate there is hardly a poet of to-day or yesterday who ever , in his matter , his ideas , and his verbal texture , attempts to soar above the level of the intellect of scarcely adolescent pupils in your ladies ' seminaries ? hardly ever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher type of mentality than that to be found in a Grimm 's Fairy Tale . . . . Or it might be more just to say Hans Andersen ; for as far as I can remember Andersen was more of a snob than Grimm . Poets , in fact , once they put on their laurel crowns divest themselves of every shred of humour , irony , or incisive knowledge of life as it is lived . I can hardly think of any save Heinrich Heine , Browning ? and sometimes Christina Rossetti ? who were born since 1790 and did not consider verse-writing as something aloof from life , art , form , and language . I will put the matter as a parable : the facts that follow are not exactly what happened . One must slightly obscure facts when one is writing of one 's contemporaries . But the truth of this parable to the Spirit of the Age is irrefutable . There are in the City of London , then , two eminent litterateurs . . . . Let us call them Messrs X and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sufficient adroitness to have made for themselves comfortable careers ? this last being no easy task and one which must have made them acquainted with a considerable surface of such life as is lived in what Henry James used to call the has fonds of journalism . . . . A pretty mean life . . . . But , in an evil hour , each of these gentlemen conceived the idea of writing Verse on a large scale . One ? Mr X ? produced a play in rhyme ? a play of singular imbecility . Mr Y replied with a slice of an epic based on ideas that must have been Joe Millerisms to Macaulay 's ? or was it Mrs Barbauld 's ? ? New Zealander . Each was a Reviewer ! Mr Y reviewed his colleague 's verse drama , writing a sort of paraphrase of Sheridan 's Critic ? the  | Spanish Fleet Mr X 's heroine could not have seen because it was not yet in sight , and so on . Mr X reviewed the instalment of the epic , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that it is contrary to natural principles to write " Thus to its goal the aspiring soul doth mount As streams meander level with their fount , " or words to that effect . We were , in fact , presented with the inspiring spectacle of a controversy in the good old style of The Edinburgh versus The Quarterly Review . That of course is nothing . Some one in England is always trying to drag literature back to those days and that tone . The point was that Mr X concluded his review by saying that , though he had , regretfully , pointed out some of the innumerable absurdities contained in Mr Y 's epic , nevertheless Mr Y was to be congratulated on revealing his real personality in his work ? an exhibition of courage rare in the poets of to-day : Mr Y , at the end of his review , stated that though he had regretfully pointed out some of the innumerable imbecilities contained in his confrere 's poetic drama , Mr X was to be congratulated on his rare courage in revealing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since each gentleman had called the other 's work a product of an imbecile mind , that was hitting below the belt ! As I read the portents of our moonlit heavens , these two ? quite imaginary ? gentlemen will be united on one point ? they desire to drive out of Literature , Mr Pound , Mr Flint , and most of my favourite poets . And I beg the reader to believe that nothing would have dragged me back into the Literary Life from which I had taken a quite sincere farewell but the desire to prevent this infamy and this disaster . I should like to be taken as being entirely sincere in making this statement , and I should like to say that I have written the last three words , advisedly , after due thought and selecting exactly the words that express my meaning . . . . II I concluded the first part of this series of articles by lightly and , I trust , good-humouredly , grazing the subject of Les Jeu/2es who were quite young in the Season of 1914 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others who welcomed these then eccentric creatures was one of gentle bewilderment as to their products combined with an absolute confidence in the genius of the various young men whom we backed . I may point out that I come of a family that , for generations , has impoverished itself in combating Academicism and in trying to help ? geniuses . . . . So I may claim to have in the blood the tic of combating Academicism and the hope of discovering genius ? and I trust , the faculty of absolute indifference to my personal fate or the fate of my own work . Thus I profess to a certain inherited flair for ? and a certain sense that it is a duty to forward ? the recognition of young men with ? to change the idiom ? individualities , practising one or other of the arts . And towards the end of Marwood 's and my career in control of the English Review , he and I and the few friends who were interested in a real revival of Literature , began to feet that life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene ? I place them in the order of their appearance , as far as I can remember ? Mr Pound , Mr D. H. Lawrence , Mr Tomlinson , Mr Lewis , H. D. , Mr Flint ? and afterwards some Americans ? Mr Frost , Mr T. S. Eliot , Mr Edgar Lee Masters . And of course there were Gaudier-Brzeska and Mr Epstein . It was ? truly ? like an opening world . . . . It was like an opening world . . . . For , if you have worried your poor dear old brain for at least a quarter of a century , over the hopelessness of finding , in Anglo-Saxondom , any traces of the operation of a conscious art ? it was amazing to find these young creatures not only evolving theories of writing and of the plastic arts , but receiving in addition an immense amount of what is called " public support . " . . . I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that , at any rate for the London season of 1914 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the horribly wearisome ! ? Academics out of the field , the market , and the forum : they created for themselves also a " public " that had never looked at a book otherwise than to be bored with it ; or considered the idea that an Art was an interesting , inspiring , or amusing appearance . That was extraordinarily valuable . And I believe that their influence at that date extended across the Atlantic itself and that there it still obtains . We Anglo-Saxons are the mock of the world : there is no nation  | that does not despise us for our commercial ideals , our incredible foreign politics ? and the complete absence of any art as a national characteristic . . . . The Dutch have their painters ; the Flemings have their down-to-the-ground poets of mysticism ; the Germans have their romantic music ; their Grimmish lyrics . The French have everything . The Siamese have their beautiful pots ; the Russians ? again , possibly everything . The Poles have immense rhetorical gifts ; the Zulus their folk-song ; the Irish their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing , and there is no race in the world that does not point the finger of scorn at us . That is the lamentable fact . But in 1914 Les Jeunes had succeeded in interesting a usually unmoved but very large section of the public ? and had forced that public to take an interest not in the stuff but the methods of an Art . The Cubists , Vorticists , and the others proclaimed that the plastic arts must be non-representational ; the Imagistes , Symbolistes , who joined up , I think , with Vorticism , proclaimed the immense importance of the " live " word ? the word that should strike you as the end of a live wire will , if you touch it . Actually , I fancy that the main point of their sympathy and contact was their desire to impress on the world their own personalities . Or , let us put it that the first point of their doctrine would be that the artist should express by his work his own personality . Let us consider this canon with some seriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vorticists , Cubists , Imagistes , and the rest were seeking to wipe out ? the Impressionists in the plastic or written arts had been the leaders of the Movement that came immediately before these young fellows . And the main canon of the doctrine of Impressionism had been this : the artist must aim at the absolute suppression of himself in his rendering of his Subject . You were to see as little as possible of the image of M Courbet in a Courbet ; you were to see nothing at all of Flaubert when you read Trois Contes . To look at a painting of willow trees under a grey sky ; to read Coeur Simple , or Le Rouge et le Noir , What Maisie Knew , or Fathers and Children , was merely to live in the lives and the minds of Felicite , Mrs Wicks whose constant dread was that she might be " spoken to , " or of Lavretsky . . . . Above all the reader was to receive no idea of the figures of Stendhal or his followers . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Impressionism is probably unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxon reader ? repeat this formula in another image . That is bad Art ; but I hope to be pardoned by the shades of my Masters . Is the reader then conversant with the Theory of Podmore 's Brother ' ? . . . Podmore 's Brother was accustomed to perform certain tricks on members of the public whilst so holding their attentions that they were quite unconscious of his actions . He talked so brilliantly that whilst his tongue moved his hands attracted no attention . It is not a very difficult trick to perform . . . . If the Reader will give a box of matches to a friend and then begin to talk really enthrallingly , he will be able to take the box of matches from his friend 's hands without his friend being in the least conscious that the matches have gone . Closing his discourse , he will be able to say to his friend : " Where are the matches ? " ? and the friend will not have any idea of their whereabouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tongue deceiving the eye . . . . It is a trick worth performing ? because it is the trick of Impressionism ? the Impressionist writer or painter telling his story with such impressiveness that the Reader or the Observer will forget that the Impressionist is using pen or brush ; just as our suppositious Reader 's Friend , lost in your conversation , forgets that you can take the matches from his hands . . . . The Cubists , Vorticists , Imagistes , Vers Libristes , who in 1914 seemed about to wash out us Impressionists , said simply : all this attempt to hypnotize the public is ? mere waste of time . An Artist attracts ; gets a public or royalties from sales because he is a clever fellow . Let him begin by saying , " I am a clever fellow . . . . " And let him go on saying : " What a fellow I am ! " Conspuez the Subject ! A bas all conventions of tale-telling ! We , the Vorticists , Cubists , Imagistes , Symbolistes , Vers Libristes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walk ! We and we only are the Playboys of the Western World . We and we only shall be heard . . . . They came very near it . I remember very well a walk I took once with one of my young geniuses on one side of me and Mr Pound on the other . . . . Of what Mr Pound talked , I have no idea . He was expressing himself , in low tones , in some Trans-Atlantic dialect . This Genius however was plain to hear :  | " What is the sense , " he said , " of all this justification of a subject that Maupassant and you and Conrad indulge in . . . . You try to trick the reader into believing that he is hearing true stories . . . . But you ca n't . . . . Maupassant takes three hundred words out of a two thousand word conte to describe a dinner party with a doctor at it . . . . And the doctor tells a story . . . . Or Conrad takes twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public house on the river at Greenwich . . . . In order to justifier his story . . . . It is a waste of time . . . . What the public wants is Me . . . . Because I am not an imbecile , like the component members of the public ! . . . " I daresay he was right . . . . At any rate our public took Mr Lewis and Blast ; Signor Marinetti and his immense noises , his lungs of brass ; Mr Epstein and his Rock Drill , with great seriousness and unparalleled avidity . . . . And I was so much a member of the public that I determined ? very willingly , for I always detested writing ? to shut up shop . I said to myself : " I will write one more book ! " ? a book I had been hatching for twelve years . " And then no more at all ! " . . . So the Vorticists and the others proceeded on their clamorous ways . . . . They abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subject itself . . . . They gave you dashes and whirls of pure colour ; words washed down till they were just Mr Pound 's " Petals on a wet black bough ! " Signor Marinetti shouted incredibly in the Dore Gallery and a sanguinary war was declared at the Cafe Royal between those youths who wore trousers of green billiard cloth and whiskers and those who did not . . . . The Cabaret Club was raided by the Police and found to be full of the wives and aged mothers of Cabinet Ministers . . . . The Academic writers of the Athenaeum , with their incredibly dull snufflings about the placket-holes of Shelley 's mistresses , paled till they had the aspect of the posters of yesterday on the walls of the year before last . . . . Alas , that was in 1914 . . . . To-day they are all back again in the saddle and the gobbling noises about the tuberculous lungs of Keats ? a bautiful user of words who , you might have thought , would have escaped the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs of Keats , the immense , long articles about the orthography of Shakespeare 's Fourth Folios ; the voluminous disquisitions on the poetasters from whom Scott derived his chapter headings ? all these incredibly uninteresting matters have once more killed the interest of the public in the Arts . . . . For what is the public to Fanny Brawne ? I will put the matter in another parable , the facts being this time true . . . . The wife of my headmaster once said to me ? I was revisiting my school and she was looking at a Literary Journal that I had brought down ? once said , looking musingly over the top of the paper : " Love letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne , edited by Buxton Forman . " She was reading the title of a review . And she went on to ask : " Who was Keats ? " I said : " A thing of beauty is a joy for ever . . . . " And immediately she continued : " Its loveliness increaseth , it shall never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , that is to say , that the lady was closed to or ignorant of the beauty of Keats ? it was simply that the Literary Journal was so intolerably wearisome that she knew nothing of the sort of ana . . . . But perhaps I am saying too much .  |
