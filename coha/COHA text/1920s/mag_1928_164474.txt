One day last week , the Mayor of Chicago entered his office at the City Hall and sat down at his desk . That is all there is to the story . That in itself was a newsful event because since taking office one year ago , Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill " ) Thompson of Chicago had , up to last week , gone to his office only three times : once to be sworn in , once to handshake Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden , once to be photographed at his desk . Mayor Thompson spends most of his time , in short-sleeved shirt , with cigar in mouth , surrounded by spittoons , henchmen and pictures of himself , in a " suit " of rooms at Chicago 's Hotel Sherman .
