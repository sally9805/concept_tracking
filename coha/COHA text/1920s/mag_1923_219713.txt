According to The Chicago Daily News , Rear Admiral Edwin A. Anderson , commander of the American Asiatic squadron , was not accorded an audience by the Prince Regent , although such courtesy was shown to members of the French economic mission and to Admiral Sir Arthur Leveson , commander of the British China squadron . The News says : " While the Prince Regent is departing for Formosa southermost island of the Empire , and this may account for his inability to receive the American naval commander , courtesy would require that at least the Empress act , in view of the fact that the Emperor is unable to do so on account of prolonged illness . "
