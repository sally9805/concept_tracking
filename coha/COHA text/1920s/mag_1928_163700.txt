THE GANGS OF NEW YORK-An Informal History of the Underworld-Herbert Asbury-Knopf ( $4.00 ) . <P> That five gangsters have recently threatened the life of Author Asbury , who also wrote Up From Methodism , indicates the deadly accuracy of his exhaustive history . Fortunately for Mr. Asbury , he knows the gangs of today have lost their former prowess , that their reputation is falsely bolstered by the sporadic brawls and killings of quite another species-the bootlegger and dope-dealer . <P> With the first great wave of immigration , a century ago , the gangster appeared in Manhattan 's congested " Five Points " and " Paradise Square , " near the Tombs of today .

Amused and contemptuous , the gangs whirled merrily on down the broad way that leadeth to destruction , their activities culminating in the wholesale looting and burning and carnage known as the 1863 Draft Riots ( Lincoln 's conscription decree ) . <P> This vivid expose of gambling dens and brothels , with their picaresque inmates , falls short of melodrama without losing excitement . The faithful account of all the greatest gang leaders sometimes runs to a monotony of horrors , but is soon varied with naive tong wars , and prosperous " fences " - fat women who bought and sold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
