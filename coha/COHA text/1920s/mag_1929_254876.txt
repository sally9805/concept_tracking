The mission of the First Brigade , Marine Corps , in Haiti has undergone no change . Intercourse with the Haitian people becomes increasingly cordial and very little friction manifests itself . <P> So wrote Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams last month in preparing his department 's annual report . On the day his report was published last week sufficient Haitian friction had developed to warrant the dispatch of extra U. S. forces to the trouble-stricken black republic of the West Indies . <P> Riot and bloodshed had occurred in what Secretary of State Stimson characterized as " an exceedingly serious situation . " President Hoover , alarmed , sent a special message to Congress , asked for another commission of investigation . Since 1915 when President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam was publicly butchered* and revolution and carnage reigned , the U. S. has exercised a virtual protectorate over Haiti . Under a 1916 treaty , U. S. armed forces are in the republic for three purposes : 1 ) to protect U. S. lives and property ; 2 ) to help support a stable government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administering the Haitian customs , European creditor nations from interfering in Haiti 's affairs . In 1919 occurred an uprising against the U. S. which Haitians claimed cost 3,500 lives . In 1922 Louis Borno became President ; in 1927 the Haitian Parliament dissolved . <P> Last week 's troubles originated with a strike in October of students at Damien Agricultural School , whose " bonus " allowances the government had reduced . Anti-Borno politicos seized upon this strike to spread the gospel of unrest through the canebrake country . A general strike began to gather momentum . At the Port-au-Prince customs house , under U. S. control , native employes rioted , broke office furniture and equipment , manhandled U. S. agents . A mob gathered before the National City Bank branch , jeered , threw rocks . Promptly the U. S. High Commissioner , Brig . General John Henry Russell of the Marine Corps , declared martial law , stationed Marines with machine guns on President Borno 's palace lawn . President Borno announced that he would not seek a third term . <P> Without warning blood was spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred natives marched to the town out of the wild back country to join the strike . They were met by a detachment of 20 Marines who told them the strike was over , warned them to disperse . Instead , the Haitians , armed only with machetes , clubs , field tools , attempted to rush the town . The Marines volleyed over the mob 's head , then scattered them with 250 rounds of direct fire . Five Haitians were killed , 20 wounded . One Marine was bitten in the hand . <P> President Hoover was deeply disturbed by these events . At the request of High Commissioner Russell , he gave terse orders to Secretary of the Navy Adams . Quickly out of Hampton Roads sailed the U. S. S. Wright bearing a detachment of 500 Marines to supplement the force of 700 already in Haiti . From Guantanamo Bay steamed away the cruiser Galveston , bound for Jacmel where an arms smuggling plot was supposed to have been uncovered . <P> With the approach of these forces , a hush fell over Haiti and quiet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as critics of U. S. policy in the Caribbean gathered for a new attack . <P>
