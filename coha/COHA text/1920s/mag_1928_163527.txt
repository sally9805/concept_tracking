One of the most important and rational pronouncements ever made by Signor Mussolini was delivered by him , last week , to the Chamber of Deputies , in presenting the new electoral law ( TIME , March 5 ) . <P> This measure has been denounced as abrogating democratic suffrage and placing the nomination of candidates in the hands of a Fascist oligarchy topped by Il Duce . He met these charges last week , thus : <P> " The masses are quite incapable of forming their own minds , much less of choosing men . . . . Where 100 persons gather , they are fatally led astray by two or three demagogues . . . . <P> " To leave the choice of candidates to our electorate . . . really means to abandon choice to a few intriguers . . . . " <P> The alternative presented by Il Duce is , of course , to replace the " intriguers " and " demagogues " by his own " disciplined " Fascisti . Once the premise is admitted that the latter are preferable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical matter of course . <P> By postulating his premise , publicly once and for all , Il Duce stood forth , last week , as the world 's one supremely courageous enemy of democracy . He enlarged upon his thesis crisply and smashingly , thus : " All existing electoral systems neglect the reality of life which is that , isolated , individuals do not exist or have negligible value . Society is not merely a conglomeration of men . . . . Fascismo wishes to create a regime of authority with a strong Government possessing ample powers but founded on the masses and keeping close to the masses . . . . All who have Fascismo at heart wish to create a regime whose ruling class can always draw from the people the men necessary to its constant renewal . . . . The problem of government can not be solved by trusting in the illusory dogma of popular sovereignty , but it can be solved by the wise choice of a few leading statesmen . " <P> The Chamber of Deputies continued , of course , too overawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
