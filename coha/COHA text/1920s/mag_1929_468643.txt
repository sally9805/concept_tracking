This article has been written in collaboration with Mr. James W. Mulroy , of the Chicago Daiiy News , one of the best-informed authorities on crime and racketeering in the Middle West . Mr. Muiroy shared in both the Pulitzer Prize and the Chicago Civic Award for his editorial assistance in the solving of the Leopold-Loeb mystery. ? The Editors . I HAVE lived in Chicago off and on for twenty years , and I have never seen a murder . But if anyone wanted to have me murdered , the job could probably be done for as low as one thousand dollars . Thousands of good Chicagoans have never seen a robbery or a " stick-up " ; but if any determined criminal wanted to bomb any house of these thousands , he could arrange the business almost as easily as I punch a typewriter key . Hundreds of thousands of law-abiding citizens imagine that their lives are quite untouched by crime in any form . But they are wrong . I am not referring to direct physical contact . The ordinary citizen in Chicago is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent bystander in the Chicago gang wars has ever been killed . The citizen is , it is true , rather more subject to the risk of robbery and hold-up than thecitizen of most other cities ; for instance , there are almost four thousand robberies in Chicago every year . But in these fields Chicago differs from other cities not in kind but merely in degree . Nor do I mean to discuss the psychological effects of Chicago crime , considerable as they are . It would be a nice point to determine whether crime is caused by civic callousness , or civic callousness by crime , and certainly this literally vicious circle does exist . The shocking prevalence of crime , the known interrelation of crime , graft , and politics , the immunity of notorious criminals , the corruption of some police officials , laxity in law enforcement ? all these in the mind of the ordinary citizen are connected ? and the ordinary citizen does n't do a thing about it . Crime in Chicago has been so psychologically successful , one might say , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine 's Day Copyright , 1929 , by Harper &; Brothers . All Rights Reserved . massacre to stir the citizen at all . But , important as are these facts in moral callousness and carelessness , they are not part of my immediate story . Nor do I mean to elaborate on the larger political issues . Certainly they affect the ordinary citizen . They affect the catastrophic pavements on his streets and the taxes he pays to keep them perpetually in repair ; but graft and corruption are not peculiar to Chicago . Most big cities have similar tales to tell . What I am after is something newer , more intimate , and more definite . I mean racketeering . Crime is affecting the Chicago citizen in a new fashion . A system of criminal exploitation , based on extortion , controlled by hoodlums , and decorated with icy-cold murder , has arisen in the past five or six years , to seize the ordinary Chicagoan , you and me and the man across the street , by the pocket-book if not the throat . Crime is costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took me to the office this morning , the elevator boy who lifted me ten stories through the steel stratifications of a great skyscraper , the waiter who served me my luncheon , the suburban business man who sat at the next table . Very few persons , in Chicago or out of it , realize how this criminal system works . Very few persons , in Chicago or out of it , realize that the ordinary citizen is paying literal tribute to racketeers . This tribute is levied in many ways . The ordinary citizen pays it , like as not , whenever he has a suit pressed and every time he gets a haircut ; he may pay it in the plumbing in his house and the garaging of his car ; the very garbage behind his back door may perhaps mean spoils for someone . A racket may be defined as any scheme of exploitation by which criminal conspirators live upon the industry of others , maintaining their hold by intimidation , terrorism , or political favoritism . The word " racket " has cometo be loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for making easy money , whether illegal or not on the other , as a blanket definition of organized crime . All gangsters , without discrimination , have come to be called racketeers . Beer and alcohol running or , for that matter , bank robbery and white slavery , are rackets from this point of view . But in this article I hope to avoid stereotyped discussion of the beer wars and the booze gangs , and confine myself to the less-known activities of business racketeers . What , in a paragraph , does a racketeer do ? How does a racket work ? Suppose I happen to be a hoodlum , and suppose I want some easy money . I have friends among crooked labor leaders and perhaps among politicians . I am in a position to hire thugs and gunmen . I form an organization and I choose a field . Suppose I choose pretzels as a field . I then " invite " the pretzel dealers in Chicago to " join " me . From each of them I demand , say , one hundred dollars per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " them from competition , since they must raise their prices to pay my one hundred dollars . If any pretzel man refuses to join me I bomb him . I slug his drivers . I cut off his supply . Meantime I delimit the pretzel market among my dealers , and make anyone who wants to enter the pretzel business pay me handsomely first . I extend my pretzel monopoly in one direction to the big wholesalers ( since I control the dealers ) , and in another direction to the small shopkeepers ( since I control the jobbers ) . And from all of them I exact tribute . The price of pretzels meantime goes up . Simply because I say so , the pretzel people pay a levy to me , and the consumer pays the Levy . This is the essence of racketeering ? simple extortion based on simple threat . The word " racket " originated in Chicago six or seven years ago . In the neighborhood of 12th and Halsted Streets , in the district of " alky " pedTHE HIGH COST OF HOODLUMS 531 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellites grew up , hanging on the outskirts of the great " mobs " ? the O'Banion " mob , " the Genna " mob , " the Capone " mob . " These satellites were not often actual killers . They were parasites . With gangster protection , they went into " business . " At first the word describing them was " racketer . " In newspaper stories during 19e3 and 19l4 the word grew to " racketeer . " Probably it first referred to the hullabaloo in the " joints " where gangsters assembled . " How 's the racket ? " became " What 's your racket ? " Rackets are , of course , old as the hills . This decade holds no monopoly on extortion . But extortion has rarely reached such a point of development as distinguishes the Chicago rackets to-day . It would be difficult to trace the exact causes of this efflorescence . Prohibition was certainly one cause . Traffic in beer and whisky enormously increased the amount of easy money in circulation among hoodlums . Gangsters became elaborate spendthrifts . Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booze traffic increased the number of professional criminals at large , and their power , ruthlessness , and immunity to law . So the rackets began , out of criminality begat by alcohol and easy money . The success of racketeering was immense . It existed through contempt of law and , as success increased , contempt increased , to give way to more success . Gangsters saw that there was almost as much money in coats and suits as there was in alcohol ; gangsters " muscled in " to various rackets . Politicians saw the enormous sums being made and took their share of this citizens ' tribute . Since racketeering is based on business , it came into early contact with labor . Racketeering sucked into labor , living like a leech on its own wound . The argument of the racketeer to the business man was simple : " Look here . We 'll stabilize prices . To-day you get $1.00 a bundle for your ( for example ) laundry . We 'll organize the laundry business and raise the price to $1.50 . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And if a thousand laundrymen joined the " association , " the racket was worth , at the outset , $0,000 per month . If anyone withstood the racket arson was his lot or bombs . Now , in most businesses associations already existed , namely , labor unions ; so it saved a good deal of trouble to the racketeer to organize his racket directly through the union . The American Federation of Labor has , of course , fought racketeering bitterly ; not two per cent of legitimate union men are racketeers . But the A. F. of L. is an enormously widespread organization , and racketeers did get control of some unions , by criminal subversion of unscrupulous labor leaders . There are 91 rackets in Chicago today , according to the state 's attorney 's office , all but 25 of them active . Some few are " dormant , " it being a characteristic of rackets that they lie low periodically ; often when a racket " disappears " the leader has simply shifted his activity to another racket . So the number is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 odd rackets are in fairly active operation . The cost of these 60 to the people of Chicago is estimated by the Employer 's Association of Chicago , an anti-racketeer organization , at $136,000,000 per year , or approximately $45 for every man , woman , and child in the city . This is direct cost . It is a levy , a tribute ? no less . The indirect cost may be as much again . Some progress has been made in the fight against racketeers . The " pineapple primary " of April , 1928 , was a forward step of great importance ; the citizenry of Chicago rose indignantly and turned out of office most of the Thompson ticket . The appointment of Special Prosecutor Frank J. Loesch pointed a movement which was in effect a crusade . It was n't a real crusade ? quite . But it did much good . Within the last year , for instance , 29 rackets have been put out of business . Federal action frightened or crippled others . And a few months ago a Racket Court , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chicago Municipal Court to deal exclusively with racket affairs . The cost of racketeering is not preeminently financial . The racketeer 's method of action is so direct , and his operation so purely extra-legal , that its inevitable concomitant is demoralization . Either because of callousness , timidity , or stupidity , a group of almost 3,000,000 citizens is being led by the nose by perhaps 600 gangsters ? and the fact that the gangsters know that the citizen knows this adds considerably to their power . Let us trace a very simple instance of personal racketeering , and note the sense of utter demoralization in every detail in the story which should answer the question often asked , " Why does the victim submit ? Why do n't the racketeers get punished ? Why does n't someone do something about it ? " Simon P. Angelo has a little jewelry shop on Orleans Street . In his window are a few old watches , brought perhaps from Europe ; next to them are brassy alarm clocks and paper racks of trinkets . Angelo sits behind the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism of watches ; his wife sells the trinkets or gossips at the front door . The shop is in the Italian quarter on the near north side . Angelo is no millionaire , but he has a pretty little business , enough to send his children to school , and his family to Citro 's for dinner once a month or so ; and Angelo has worked all his life to develop this business . A big fellow with a bluish jaw and slanting eyes comes into the shop one morning . " Gim me twenty-five bucks ? quick . " " What for ? " " Defense fund , " the stranger replies briefly . Angelo knows . He protests , but he pays . A month passes , and the stranger comes in again . This time he asks for $50 . Angelo protests , but he has to pay . He does not know who the stranger is . He does not know who the murderer is for whose defense he is " contributing , " or if indeed there is a murderer , or a defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . Several months pass , and the stranger , or perhaps another stranger , slips quickly into the shop again . He looks around , growls , and takes off his coat . Angelo stares at him . Angelo 's wife comes running . They can do nothing . The stranger hangs up his coat , and sits down behind the counter . " I 'm in , " he says . And henceforward half of Angelo 's profits go to him . This is the simplest form of " muscling in " racket . Crudely stated , it expresses the first stage of every racket ; perhaps a trifle dramatized , it denotes the essential psychological relation , based on extortion plus threat , between racketeer and racketee . What could Angelo have done ? If he refused payment of any of the " collections " his windows might have been smashed or his shop bombed . A cheap powder bomb costs only $50 . The first bomb would have been a light one , a sort of valentine . If Angelo still refused payment the next bomb might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose Angelo had said , " I will go to the state 's attorney 's office and ask protection . " He might have gone to the state 's attorney 's office ( in the old days ) and he might have got protection ? provided Angelo 's enemy had n't happened to be rather a good friend of someone in the old state 's attorney 's office . Suppose Angelo had said , " I will report you to the police . " THE HIGH COST OF HOODLUMS 537 I do not wish to seem to exaggerate ; I know that in many of these businesses racketeering has only been attempted , and has not been successful . And I know , and have pointed out , that many rackets ? almost thirty , I believe , within the last year ? have been wiped out . The state 's attorney 's office is at work at the moment in the glaziers racket , amongthe garage men and the excavators , in bootblacks ( three officials of this racket are serving time ) , in fish peddling , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about sixty rackets still survive . The list is , I think , instructive . VIII believe a word should be said here about Chicago as a city . It is still , if I may paraphrase Carl Sandburg , the young giant among cities , the stalwart , heady , and undisciplined play-child of the cities . It has slight tradition to steady its growth , for not until 1933 will it reach even its hundredth birthday ; and an immense surplus of energy exists to warp , deflect , and subvert its development . Chicago can be compared to a locomotive running down hill . It accumulates energy as it runs . And often as not , it is out of the control of its engineers ? and sometimes it jumps the rails . Racketeering is a by-product of Chicago 's general energy . If Chicago leads the world in racketeering , it leads the world in other things too . It has more parks , I believe , than any other American city ; it has a greater length of boulevard and stretch of playground ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant ; its newspapers are amusing . In other words , Chicago is a city just learning how to play . Some of the play is fantastic . And some is criminal . Chicago leads the world , Chicagoans boast , in hog-sticking , grain marketing , steel distributing , railroads , piers , freight yards , stock yards . And racketeering too . But who cares ? Chicago does n't ? much . Chicago is inclined to laugh about its racketeers . Tell a Chicagoan about the rackets , and he 'll tell you about business , playgrounds , lakeside boulevards , river development , cattle , air-rights . Tell him that rackets cost him $45 per year , and he 'll laugh , saying that he made twice as much in the last ten minutes on the grain exchange .
