The chemist 's pride , in switching world commerce around by his inventions of synthetics for natural products , swelled last week when he read the news bulletin just published by the National Geographic Society . That bulletin was specific . From coal tar , * air-nitrogen , cotton , corn &; wood , chemists have been making things from fertilizers to rayon cloth , from paint to pearls . <P> Their coal tar red wrecked the business of Levant farmers who had been raising madder plants for madder red . A similar misfortune befell the indigo plant cultivators of India . In New Zealand kauri gum diggers are becoming impoverished . Chile , once boastful of its natural nitrate monopoly is humble . Synthetic rubber is a fact , although heretofore more expensive than Malaya and Sumatra natural rubber . <P> Brooklyn , N. Y. , makes attar of roses ; Bulgaria suffers . Flushing , N.Y. , makes citronella ; to Java 's detriment . Newark , N. J. , makes vanillin against vanilla from Seychelle , Mexico and Reunion. + New Jersey ivroid harms African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes amber ( East Prussian commodity ) substitute . <P> Some international good comes from the wide U. S. selling of certain products . The U. S. , England , France , Italy and Belgium make rayon . For a while this hurt China 's and Japan 's silk trade . Japan now makes some rayon herself . But rayon has taught U. S. women and men to desire more real silk . This is also true of pearls . The U. S. and France sell the artificial ones . Thus people learn the beauty of the real ones and buy-from Mexico , Ceylon , Arabia . Into this double pearl demand Japan has insinuated itself . Work people drop a grain of irritant into an oyster 's shell . A kind of hard felon develops in the oyster . It is a cultured pearl . <P> * From coking , a ton of coal gives 12 gals , of gummy coal tar . From coal tar , chemists have fractioned off more than 300 intermediates ( esters , ethers , alcohols , etc. ) , from these intermediates about 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines , resins ) . William Perkin , London chemist , made the first coal tar dye ( Perkin violet ) in 1856 , by accident . <P> + But vanillin lacks vanilla 's fine bouquet . The two are sold mixed for bakers and housewives .
