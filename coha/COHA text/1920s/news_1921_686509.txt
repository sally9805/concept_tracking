txt LATIN AMERICA AT GENEVA Princeton , N. J .. April 1:7 , ' 1921. - Any one who followed at Geneva the meetings of the League must realize that South American good-will toward the United States would mean much for World reorganization  --  how much can only be guessed at , but hardly exaggerated . What Mr. Hershey says , therefore , in his letter to TUE Trams as to his satisfaction in the Harding policy , ? must meet- with lively approval from every American observer at Geneva , and in particular what he says of the Colombia treaty . One might indeed go a get ) further and say that the Colombia treaty is a matter to be jumped at as an opportunity . When it comes to details , however . about Geneva'and South ? America , there is more than one aspect to the matter . air . Hershey is a far more experienced observer than the writer of this letter . No doubt he is correct in saying that anti-American feeling among our Latin-American neighbors was glaringly manifest . Come to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " derogatory " made by the modest and intelligent representative of Haiti , and probably there was Something which might have struck Mr. Hershay , even as swagger or insolence , of a snapping of fingers at us . But the writer listened with attention to every Latin-American speech made on the floor of the Assembly or in the open committees . as well as to many private speeches , and he reached a very different general conclusion  --  that is , that , while there was such feeling by individuals and on occasions when a matter of disagreement was up , the settled trend of feeling was strongly toward the United States . There was antiAmerican . feeling " among " delegates , but it was not " the feeling of the delegates " as a body . On the contrary , there was a settled desire and will to believe in us and to hope  --  that we were , in fact , disposed neither to rebuff , to injure nor to patronize them . The grounds for this observation are - not impressions , but very definite memoranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place , the fact of the very positive reaction of the South American States against the very natural effort of Spain to lead the Spanish-speaking nations . With all affection toward Spain , they definitely resented leadership from the Continent of Europe and anything like the resumption of Spanish mother country guardianship , much as we old-time Yankee Americans , with all our affection for England , resent Anglomaniac attempts to re-establish English guardianship . The agitation of this matter threw the Spanish-American delegates toward a. real wish for association with the United States and leadership even by us , provided we do not fail to recognize that all nations are created free and equal . Developments showed them that their problems are one with ours . and the problems of both are American problems , detached from European concern . In the second place , It came out very clearly that nearly all af these delegates not only recognized the altruism of the United States in the war , but felt that ft had shown them as nothing else ever had that the ' United States might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and might really mean to be fair . This feeling by-.the Latin-American delegates of detachment from European concerns and their realization of a class of problems common to North and South America grew steadily as the days went by and became a sort of a Monroe Doctrine : " America for the Americans : hands off , Europe ! Let us attend to our businessaand you attend to yours . Do this and we shall be very glad to do our share in the common world problems ! " All this suggested that a working League of Nations would be one which recognized that principle of local self- , government which is involved in. the Monroe Doctrine . Human experience has shown pretty clearly that a central Government which meddles with all the local affairs of remotest provinces is not effective , while one which leaves so far as possible local problems for those who have a direct interest in and competent knowledge of them is the only effective organization . This suggests that what is needed is perhaps a Monroe Doctrine for each of - several localities , e. g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in short , that what is needed is not so much a League of Nations as leagues and a league of leagues . As for the Latin nations " snapping their fingers at our , authority , " of course they did . We have no authority over them . If we assume it or seem to assume it we are insulting and oppressing them . Who would n't snap ? As for what is " given ' credence to by European diplomats and journalists , " there is nothing wild that they will not give credence to . and nothing obvious that they will see . It is the despair of American travelers . Happening to sail . a couple of days after the Maine was sunk , and being therefore in Europe during the Spanish-American War . we followed the journals with close interest and found that the things solemnly believed about us were beyond belief and beyond remedy . The same thing was true all through those years which preceded the great war up to the very point of the outbreak  --  and they have already now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on European soil and have established the definite tradition that this was for the selfish and far-sighted purpose of saving our own skins ! The South Americans did not believe this tradition , they believed in our altruism in this matter , and it reality did lead most of them , if with a little latent skepticism , toward a position at least of watchful waiting and of real longing to have us show ourselves what we might be and what we have said we intended to be . It is up to us to make rood . ERNEST CUSHING RICHARDSON . Burnet Hershey took issue in today 's TIMES with the attitude of several Latin-American delegates to the Geneva Conference in regard to the United States . As it happens , Mr. Hershey gives the best reason in the world for the feeling of estrangement he detects among our people , by speaking of the group of distinguished Latin-American diplomatists as obscure men and by urging the paternal policy of this country upon the countries to the ? south . Why obscure ? Because they represent small nationalities ? Better-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , undoubtedly not as extensive as here . is correspondiongly high , and that , man for man , all repre4 sentative citizens of this continent are entitled to an equal degree of respect . It is precisely this attitude , sometimes represented by men in places of prominence and responsibility , as publishers and even as diplomatists , that tends to create tips feeling of resentment to which some individual Latin American may give expression in reference to North American policies . But the wise person is the one who does not : Alt all the blame on the other fellow for this ill-feeling , and instead , as Washington is doing now , turns to remove the causes that may give occasion- for it from his own side of the fence . By distorting and exaggerating the purposes of the North American Government , those advocates of a " strong policy ' ' are the ones to mar the good impression created by such moves as the serene and cordial utterances of the Washington Administration . Speaking as a Chilean , I most emphatically deny the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of the Chilean delegates at Geneva . As a matter of fact , Chile was the first country to enter the League conditionally , furthering that principle of national independence to which Argentina added its protest , and which was the same that so overwhelmingly triumphed in this country . The last thing my country could be charged with will be the duplicity of playing one country to another , since the directing principle of our foreign policy has been one of perfect equality of treatment  --  that is , one of cordial relations with all the world . As for the United states , I must say that never was in Chile such a feeling of friendship and rapprochement , commercial , educational and otherwise . Only yesterday President Alesandri of Chile came out of the way fixed by our protocol to address himself personally to Ambassador Shea on the occasion of a farewell dinner given to him . And what he said amounts to a national pledge to do the utmost to " remove in accordance with justice and historical precedents the causes lying on the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the moral authority of the United States and the other American nations who are with us in the furtherance of the Pan-American spirit . " I think I can not add anything more authoritative to my exposure of Mr. Hershey 's version of the attitude of the Chilean delegates at the Geneva Conference . ERNESTO AIONTENEGRO , United States Representative El Mercurio of Chile . New York , April 27 , 1921 . Princeton , N. J. , May 3 , 1021 . BACK TO HOME BREW To the Editor of The New York Times : A few months ago , in California , Iswas enjoying if comfortable after-luncheon cigarette in the lobby of a small hotel . I had just completed five hours of the most intensive work ? I was finishing a short story  --  and I thought I was entitled to a smoke and a rest . I had forgotten that it was America . An old lady , who had been watching . me with a red , henlike eye , cackled into conversation with her companion , a younger woman . The old lady repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective in planting a hatred of tobacco In the breasts of her pupils . It went something like this : " Crick , crack , smash the cigarette , &c."; It was neither good verse nor good sense . One imagined the charming little creatures her influence was molding . She finished her discourse by saying , " My dear , it is so nice when you reach my age-80 ? to feel that you have done a little good in the world . Elderly people as a rule have so little to think about . " Yes , actually ! Think of it , eighty years in which to sift out some of the mellowness and graciousness and good temper that can be found in life aild her ultimatum was that " elderly people had so little to think about . " Would n't George Meredith have been amused ! If I had done what I wanted to do , I would have arisen and gone over to the elderly lady and said something like this : " Madam , you are most objectionable to me . From your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your conversation I can tell that you are dangerously nonsensical . Worst of all , you are a danger to the rising generation . Altogether , you are nonsocial and I would like to have you and your kind prohibited by law ; but since I have been taught to live and let live , I wo n't try to get an amendment against you passed . Only I wish , for heaven 's sake , you 'd be equally kind to me . " Of course I could n't do this , for , unlike the elderly lady , I had a lot of business to mind , while she , like other reformers , had only other people 's . And that Is the trouble . The reformer is neither reticent , decent , nor kind . He has no shame , and , therefore , the first round of almost every contest ends in his favor . But time works marvels , and the quiet people eventually lose their tempers . There has never been a case in history where the quiet pepple in the end did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the statement that in my humble opinion you have never published a more sardonically amusing article than the article by Pro , hibition Commissioner Kramer in your last Sunday 's edition . The reader balances between laughter and dismay that this nai:ve , blinded man should have found himself at the head of the enforcement bureau of an/act as far-reaching as the Eighteenth Amendment . Yet it should be no cause for surprise . The truth that on the whole only the ignorant , misinformed man ( I am leaving out the bootlegger , the moonshiner , and the crooked lb olitician ) thinks that prohibition is possible , is certainly provable and by no other means than casual conversation . It is merely perpetually amazing that any man could live In the world and be so innocent of the simplest laws of psythology . I live in Wyoming and spend my Winters in New Jersey , and , for various reasons , travel a great deal throughout the country . Recently I have been in North Carolina , a State that has been dry ten years or so ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being a writer , it is more or less my job to be an amateur historian ; of the present , anyway . Now here are some facts . Everywhere there is drinking arid drunkenness , and if eye witness observation is worth anything and the testimony of such conservative men as doctors ; &c.,; there is more drinking than there was two years ago . As somebody has said , America was just learning to drink decently when it was forcedto drink behind the barn , out of a bottle again . Everywhere I have been the supply of illicit liquor , of smuggled liquor and of hqme brew is on the increase . And this is merely repeating the history of all prohibition States , as all honest , unprejudiced men know , who have had an opportunity to watch them . I except Kansas : Kansas is and always has been a law to itself . It was settled by people unlike any other people in the world  --  personally , 1 am not sorry . But does any sane person think that Oregon , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Prohibitionist regard police-court statistics , or any kind of statistics , as being reliable ? Was n't it Bismarck who said there " were lies , damned lies , and statistics " ? Besides . for every statistic that can nowadays be quoted by the Prohibitionist there is another ( recently there have been two or three ) that can be quoted in return . I would suggest looking up the criminal record of Los Angeles for Jan. , ' 1923 , and Jan. , 1920 , especially in regard to the increase in drunkenness . Much better than police-court records , however , are home records . And how are you going to get them ? It would be a curious sort of wife who would give her husband away . The maker of home brew and the drinker of illicit whisky does n't get drunk where he can be arrested . Why should he ? Let a community once settle down to the fact that prohibition is a law , and within a year or two the machinery for bootlegging , illicit making , and home-brewing is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop it . But what does the Prohibitionist care for facts ? He is the greatest whitewash artist the world has ever known . He imagines he can cure a cancer with new-skin . Commissioner Kramer says that illicit distilling has proved a thorn in his side . I should - think so . I wish he would gc down and see it function in the South . He says he thinks home-brewing is a fad and will soon die out . Why ? Homemade beer is the easiest thing In the world to make , and since many people like beer , what possible reason is there to suppose that they will stop making it ? This is childishness , not logic . Ask Washington and Oregon and Idaho and so on , they know . Fairly soon people will learn how to make their own rum and spirits as well . They already are making wine . In Colonial days the hearty drinkers got along very well without breweries and distilleries . They will again . Alcohol is as common as the air- we breathe . Even Spring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kramer intimates that some clay New York and New Jersey and the , other great towns and States will be onverted to prohibition . He Is evidently basing his hopes on the history of Kansas and some other strictly rural communities . I refer him to Dr. Pearce Bailey 's article in The North American Review touching upon this subject ; I dare say it has never occurred to him that heretofore those W110 did n't like Kansas could move out . And they did . The country is full of them . Now the only way you can get rid of Kansas is by breaking the law . If he wishes to see how well prohibition is working with the younger generation . let him study conditions in our universities . But it is waste of time to go on . The Prohibitionist Is unconvertible ; if he were convertible he would n't be a Prohibitionist , he would be a temperance advocate . Meanwhile , the fairly enlightened citizen , the citizen who does desire temperance and who hates a drunken man , can only bow his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance and fanaticism and false testimony is- going to keep up . Let us hope not long enough to really seriously injure the nation . The historical sense tells us that such things have been tried before and have always in the end been abandoned . Meanwhile , prohibition is accomplishing the masterly end of preventing tho decent man from getting a glass of beer or wine decently , while the Indecent man is getting along about as usual . AIATCWED-L STRUTHERS BURT . CIVIL WAR TRUTH . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your critic in this morning 's review of the revival of " The Birth of a Nation " makes the statement that the picture " comes closest to historical truth when it is furthest from Thomas Dixon . " As every historical truth in " The Birth a Nation " was taken directly from " The Leopard 's Spots " or " The Clansman. " my two novels of the South and reconstruction , I must challenge the accuracy of this remark . Moreover , I would ask in the friendliest spirit where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except In these two books ? I had to spend ten years in the preparation of the material for them , master the contents of more than 6,000 volumes , and read the daily newspapers of the period  - -  both of the war and reconstruction -- before I began the writing . Their historical accuracy has been tested in the courts of three States , when the Management , in fighting the opposition ' of a certain negro society , submitted the very question for judgment , and In each case the court granted an injunction against any interference with its exhibition on the ground that . the whole ' subject-matter of the play was the veritable record of our historic life . THOMAS DIXON , New York , May 2. 1021 . FOR A HALF  --  CENT COIN . To the Editor of The New York Times : After reading your editorial article In yesterday 's paper on the half cents , I feel I must say that while it its possible no one does want a two and one-half cent coin there are many who would appreciate a onehalf cent coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times do you see in the wine dow of a grocery or other store some article priced at so and so and one-half. cant ( 221/2 cents for instance ) , articles used most " ly by poor people ; yet when they go to buy . one they have to pay 23 cents for It because there Is no one-half cent otiln , and they can not afford to buy two , therefore they am obliged to spend one-half cent more than necessary . Even half-cent counts for Much In some poor families , and If the Government Issued a one-half cent coin It would le doing something really useful and needed . I do n't think we do need two and one-half cent coins , but do think a one-halt cent coin would fill a long-felt want . FRANK B. MARTIN , Brooklyn , N. Y. , April 30 , 11121 . THE PRICE OF TREES Savannah , Ga. , April 18 , 1921 . To the Editor of The Neu . York Times : In your issue of the 17th I read with g great deal of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which gives some idea of the difficulty encountered in planting trees and the efforts of Samuel Parsons to beautify and enhance the value of the street upon which he lives . Only those who have been engaged in the planting of trees can appreciate the amount of effort and energy required to make them a success , and then when their growth has been accomplished , what delightful contrast there is between the planted and unpianted streets . Then , too , just think what a wonderful help they are in helping to keep the humidity down . While it is true that many persons do not take care of trees , and this tends very much to discourage those who are constantly trying - to do something worthwhile for mankind , still we must continue our efforts , and perhaps conditions will change and a more appreciative people arise . and they in turn lend a helping hand to make our streets more beautiful . With pardonable pride I call attention to the fact that our city , Savannah , Ga. , is known as the " Forest City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planting of trees each year , and only those who have to traverse unshaded streets know what the value of trees is to us , so that each year we plant and plant , some years as many as 2,000 trees , and still a cry for more . I can appreciate fully how hard it is to get trees started off , because we , too , have our troubles , in that so many thoughtless persons cut , mutilate and destroy the trees and shrubs on our streets and in our parks , but we must not stop . else we would soon have denuded streets and parks . I glory in the grit of Mr. Parsons and wish for him every success in his undertaking , and trust that there will soon develop considerable rivalry between him and other citizens . P. D. DAFFIN , Chairman Park and Tree Commission .
