Premier Nikola Pashitch tendered his resignation and that of his Cabinet to King Alexander , advising His Majesty to call for a new election . Thus , a laconic despatch from Belgrade . <P> Why is the Government resigning at this time ? The despatch was silent . In March , 1923 ( TIME , March 31 , 1923 ) , the last general election was held for the Narodna Skupshtina ( National Assembly ) and no further election is constitutionally due until 1927 . But the patriarchal Premier has been experiencing much opposition both within and without Parliament . Ever since the 70 Croatian Agrarians consented to sit in the Assembly , in April of this year , the old Premier 's position has become more and more difficult , and it is not surprising that he has decided to refer the issues to the country , albeit reluctantly . <P> The chief matter to be settled is whether or not Croatia is to have " autonomy . " Under the able leadership of Raditch , " Stormy petrel of the Balkans , " the Croatians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistence denied it to them . In the last election the Croatians secured 70 seats in the Skupshtina ; this year they may do better . If they should win , another section of Yugo-Slavia ( South Slavia ) must be granted its freedom . <P> ... <P> But elections are somewhat of a farce in the Balkans , and they are probably conducted with more dishonesty in Yugo-Slavia than in any other part of that unhappy peninsula . <P> ... <P> Nikola Pashitch , who is part Bulgarian , recently celebrated his 80th birthday . For some 55 years he has devoted himself to the service of his country . In 1881 he conceived the idea of a Greater Serbia , became co-founder with the Greek leader , Eleutherios Venizelos , of the Balkan League , and with him hatched many a scheme for extending the frontiers of Serbia and Greece . With the signing of peace in 1918 his dreams were realized . Serbia grew into the Kingdom of the Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kraljevina Srba , Hrvata , i Slovenaca ) , but he found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected to this arbitrary disposition , to some extent upon religious grounds . Old Serbia is preponderantly Orthodox Catholic ; Croatia and Montenegro preponderantly Roman Catholic . <P> With all his faults and ambitions Pashitch is a picturesque old man and has earned for himself by his labors the title : " Grand Old Man of Serbia . " He hopes to live to see prosperity brought to the Balkans . He seems to have a good chance , for his father lived to the grand old age of 103 . <P> Last year a young Serbian bank clerk tried to assassinate him ( TIME , July 9 , 1923 ) . To make a repetition of this act more difficult , he now rides about Belgrade , capital of Yugo-Slavia , in an automobile with opaque glass windows .
