The inimitable , irrepressible , M. Lon Daudet , editor of the Parisian Royalist newspaper L'Action Franaise , escaped last week from the Prison Sant . He went there only after 3,000 policemen , firemen , soldiers , had overawed a band of his Royalists numbering 980 , and forced him to submit to arrest ( TIME , June 13 et seq . ) . It was a group of these keen-witted , although sometimes foppishly clad , Royalists who filched M. Daudet deftly out of jail last week and spirited him into hiding . <P> Their plan was simple , shrewd . At noontime , while Minister of Interior Albert Sarraut was lunching , a young Royalist entered a telephone booth in the Ministry of Interior . He called the Prison Sant , asked for its Director , M. Catry , and mimicking the voice of an assistant of Minister Sarraut , ordered that M. Lon Daudet and two other prisoners should be instantly released from jail . <P> Director Catry , no fool , suspected trickery . After hanging up he waited a few moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Royalists had called all the Ministry 's telephones except that in the booth . Therefore the call of Director Catry was switched to the only available phone , that at which stood the mimicker , who , for a second time , ordered M. Daudet 's release , rebuked M. Catry . <P> He , no longer suspicious , went to Editor Daudet 's cell and released him . M. Daudet burst into tears , kissed M. le Directeur Catry , wrung his hand , and rushed out into the street to mount a taxi . Even the taxi driver was a Royalist in disguise . <P> Not until two hours later did Paris learn the news . . . . Even dyspeptics chuckled , and men of spirit openly roared at one another over caf tables : " Vive Daudet ! Vive l'Audace ! " <P> Premier Raymond Poincar hastily convened the Cabinet which promptly suspended Director Catry of the Prison Sant.
