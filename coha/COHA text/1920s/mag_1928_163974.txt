The Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee loomed twice in the news last week-once when five Rockefeller millions were bestowed upon them to help make them a national park ( see p. 12 ) , and again when White House whispers said that President Coolidge might spend his summer vacation on a southern eminence with the Great Smokies for his western horizon . Philip S. Henry of Asheville , N. C. , had offered President Coolidge the use of " Zealandia , " the Henry mansion on Beaucatcher Mountain . <P> Apparently indifferent to the nationwide suspicion that had just attached itself to one of the guests , President Coolidge attended a dinner-last of its kind this season-given for him by Secretary of Labor James John Davis &; Mrs. Davis . Among the guests were Senator Capper of Kansas , Mr. &; Mrs. Haley Fiske ( Metropolitan Life Insurance ) , Mr. &; Mrs. Edward Hines ( Evanston , Ill. , lumber ) , Alexander Pollock Moore and Will H. Hays ( see p. 11 ) . <P> Peru having raised no objection , President Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles Poindexter of Seattle as U. S. Ambassador at Lima ( see p. 29 ) . <P> Many a bill received President Coolidge 's signature during the week-including the Alien Property Bill and the measures to allow Col. Lindbergh to receive foreign decorations , and to authorize the Postmaster-General in letting contracts for air mail to foreign countries . <P> Mrs. Coolidge returned to Washington from Northampton , Mass. , where her mother , Mrs. Lemira Goodhue , was stronger but not fully recovered from protracted influenza . <P> Whang ! Crack ! Crash ! Crumple ! At 4 o'clock one morning , an automobile driven by one Abe Schnider , Washington nighthawk , careened into and through the iron entrance gate at the southwest corner of the White House grounds . Abe Schnider 's girl friends , terrified but unhurt , crept out to squeak and whisper over the damage . Rueful , Mr. Schnider rubbed his head . Watchmen soon haled the gatecrashers to court . Later in the morning Abe Schnider called at the White House . He was told that the White House 's occupant and custodian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bent gate . Grateful , fatigued , Mr. Schnider deposited $100 with the Director of Public Works , then retired .
