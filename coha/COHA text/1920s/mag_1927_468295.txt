I WAS sitting the night before last ? this is the Mediterranean port in which , when Fate permits , I spend my working months ? listening to some young fellows with open collars , displaying dark blue jumpers , and wearing queer white convict hats ; at least in England those hats would have been worn by one class of convict and would not have been white . They were discussing the tenets of Confucius . Moreover they were discussing the tenets of Confucius at the top of their voices in order ? or at any rate so as to drown the balalaikas of the Russian orchestra that was playing a Hindu melody . The elderly French bourgeoisie were meanwhile hissing , that cafe being the evening haunt of the quiet , elderly French of the town who come to listen to the music . At any rate they sometimes listen to the music --  or on that occasion they wanted to listen to that music . Or they certainly did not want to hear an incomprehensible discussion as to the tenets of Confucius . Usually , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , the balalaikas being very powerful , we can hear what is played or not as we like . .. . But , you see , a shiver of apprehension had gone through the town in the morning at beholding two white ? or so light gray as to make no difference ? war vessels glide into the pellucid blue waters of the inner harbor and come to moorings displaying a rather dreaded , bright flag on the staffs at their sterns . That that flag is dreaded when displayed behind warships in these ports is due to usually nocturnal feats performed by the bluejackets , and still more by the warrant officers of those ships when they happen to visit these shores . .. to the appalling obscenity of their language and to the exceedingly loud nature of their voices . Now I hate manifestations of dislike between nations or between individuals of nations , and this was a semi-organized display of international dislike . An enormous number ? a whole fleet 's crew ? of our own bluejackets had been turned loose for a whole week just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those same tables talking in one another 's ears in low tones , or had climbed up on to the music platform and played the balalaikas and the saxophones for the Russians , and had been received like the modest , rather rustic heroes that indeed they are . But for the bluejackets of this other power ? let her remain nameless ! ? the native population was doing what we call laying out . They had decided , I think , that this particular brand of hero was to be excluded from their quieter caf ? s . . . . Well , I leaned across to the nearest of those young fellows and said that the French people wanted to listen to that particular piece of music , so would they be quiet . They became instantly as quiet as a pondful of frogs over which there has fallen the shadow of an owl . And , indeed , I found , having entered into conversation with several of them after the song was over , that they were in fact every whit as gentle , modest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that trade could have been . And infinitely better instructed ! For I can not imagine any British tar who should have heard of Confucius , let alone flinging extracts from the Literary Digest at his shipmates ' heads in deafening tones . Yet that was what these fellows had been doing . Ships , I suppose , are like regiments ? and in this port most of the mischief for the ships of that unnamednation has been caused by one particular cruiser that I do not name , for I see that she is now engaged in popping off shells into the continent of Asia . She was too long in these waters ; her men ? and particularly her warrant officers ? were too old to have any shynesses left , so her scars are to be found in many , many places on the gentle bosom of France from Paris outwards . It is a pity , for as a rule seaports are the most international of places , refuges where the common amity of the sea unites men of all races in the cordiality of shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be gentler , less obtrusive , or more conciliatory than our present visitors . They hardly bulk more , except for their queer hats , than the other , smaller fellows who , with little red pompoms on their hats glide along the streets beneath the plane trees with the grace of gazelles and the voicelessness of shadows . Curiously enough , two of those last this afternoon passed me talking rather loudly . . . in German . They were Alsatians : it seemed to me queer to find Alsatians in the Navy ; you might as well expect to find Swiss . And then immediately afterwards there passed me three fellows with the white head-coverings talking rather loudly in German . They were Pennsylvania Dutch . One of them had told me so the night before . It seemed almost as queer to me to find Pennsylvania Dutch following the sea . But I suppose it is n't . At any rate it is very agreeable to me , for I begin more and more to lose all sense of the difference between nations and to hope more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , the differences betweennations are all mostly as negligible as the differences between the queer white head-pieces of the one set of sailors , and the silly little red pompoms of the others . Consider either of them , indeed , as set against the dignified and appropriate ? but upon my soul I can not remember what sort of hats the British tars were wearing the other day ! . Anyhow , if I wanted to go to war with anyone ? and I am not in the least a pacifist ? I would rather do it about that than about any other thing . For what is the sense of wearing the correctly idiotic , little boy 's collar ; the correct mourning for Nelson ? though the French do not wear that ; the correct , little boy 's jerkin , the correct bags ? if on the top of all you put that white pork-pie ! It is against all decency ! Let us , by all means , go to war ? I am now speaking as a Briton ? with both those nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe , we force the one to abolish the red pompom and ? yes , to wear the black silk kerchief that indicates grief for the death of the victor of Trafalgar . And the others shall wear ? oh , whatever the correct little boy 's sailor hat is . And that is what I am really getting at . I was asked the other day by a publisher ? American ? to write a book explaining why the United States has for the European almost exactly the same aspect that Prussia had before the war ; the aspect of a Power so menacing that European activities are all as it were under a shadow . And not merely financially menacing ! After a good deal of reflection I did not write that book . It seemed to me that , if I could impress on the inhabitant of the United States the aspect that his publicists and politicians have contrived to give to the features of his nation , the inhabitant of the United States might be induced to . . . oh , to pay some attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I considered that I might do more harm than good . I might contrive to influence a few hundred Americans in the direction that I desired ; on the other hand , I might provide millions of Europeans with material for flouts and jeers . It is perhaps a fact ? I at least read it this morning , as you shall see , in an American daily ? it is thus perhaps a fact that the United States has Europe pretty generally , if in varying degrees , arrayed against her ? together with a slice of the Western Hemisphere , and a good deal of Asia . But that is to be cured by other means than pointing out the fact and , of necessity , pointing the fact with illustrations .. I will illustrate as concretely as I can what I mean , with two instances . Let me begin with the morals first . I have never , then , since the war heard any English person discuss Americans , as politically such , either in terms of favor or disfavor . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien , or even a foreigner , when I was in the United States ; and I have never met an Englishman there who did not feel more or less strongly the same emotions . And I have heard a great many Americans express exactly the same sentiments when in England ; and I have felt unthinkingly outraged that in England the police should apply the same restrictions to Americans as to other aliens . I am bound to add that once when coming up the Thames on an American bottom I felt a certain pleasurable amusement at the consternation which struck my American fellow-passengers at discovering that they and no longer I were -- aliens . They expressed , indeed , loud indignation when not they but I , exclaiming , " Do I look like an American ! " walked past the Alien Immigration officer and stood unimpeded on the dock . That , of course , is a touch of the old Adam . I have so often had to stand that sort of thing myself , in the inverse sense , that it may be permitted me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and did not expect to be so treated . And indeed I agreed . They were going to the country of Dickens , and Carlyle and Matthew Arnold , The OM Curiosity Shop ? Poet 's Corner ? all so much more real to them than to me . For what do we care about such matters ? ( I do not by the bye make the mistake of thinking that all Americans consider what we mostly regard as old junk as their national birthright . But there are enough to make a beginning ? and to make us ashamed . ) But let me get to my illustration in the contrary sense . I was then , until lately , puzzled at one recurrent accusation that I have heard uttered against Americans in Europe . It used to crop up oddly , usually as a conclusion to a tirade . " What , " the utterer would exclaim , " can you say for a people whose theaters smell of offal ! " And this used to puzzle me until lately I went to Chicago and was asked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had really smelled the stockyards in their opera house . You see , they ? I mean those sensitive individuals , not all the inhabitants of the city of the Fire and Loop ? had been seriously hurt by some sort of foreigner who , coming to visit them , had gone away declaring that so sensitive was he that he had actually performed that olfactory feat . Even that person ? I do not remember who he was : some sort of minor poet or major journalist ? had only meant to display his own poetic intensity ; he had meant to say that he had not been able to forget the stockyards when in the foyer of the opera house . That , I daresay , is true . I have had a good deal to do with slaughtering beasts ? mostly pigs ? and I daresay , if I were really a poet , I might remember them , now and then , with regret ; though I never do . But that fellow had to put that record of his emotions picturesquely ; and he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I daresay , all the papers in America , quoted that passage , with the results which I have already adumbrated . Every American is , therefore , by certain Europeans regarded as the sort of insensible individual who can sit in a theater reeking of putrid meat . That does not help the cause of peace . Nay , more : it is the sort of thing that causes wars . I suppose myself to be the most determined foe to the ideal of Big Business that can be found ; but it is necessary at times to look some facts in the face , and if the World is to make war on the United States it had better be because of , say , the shape of its bluejackets ' hats , whatever that may be , than because of the smell in the Chicago Opera House . I have been in theaters in the country of the gentleman who said that Americans were barbarians because they sat in theaters that smelled ? in theaters in comparison with which the Chicago Opera House is a scent laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such allegations that cause , if not declarations , yet at least the cheerful prosecutions of wars . Obviously the boodlers , big business men , discount houses , and political caucuses that rule all our nations with practically no reference to the desires or ideals of our peoples ( I am speaking of the comity of the nations that border on the North Atlantic ) ? obviously those suspect , deviously skilled personalities can at any moment involve any of our nations in war with any other of our nations , and by aid of our more venal journals , might even get up an enthusiasm for that war . But that last can only be assured by careful preparation of the ground . By careful preparation of the ground by gentlemen of the kidney of our friend who smelled the stockyards in the opera house ! Wars are declared for all sorts of reasons ? because of fear more often than not . But they are not cheerfully prosecuted unless the peoples engaged are convinced that the individuals of the enemy nations are too brutish to be accorded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been established against the Enemy , we shall fight to the bitter end . We shall fight to the bitter end because if we are vanquished we shall have to endure the forcing on ourselves of the brutish habits of the conqueror . We shall have to eat black bread , rotten cabbage , and sausages . . . or sit in theaters that smell of putrid meat . Our theaters may smell already and our food be so badly cooked that we are a land of eternally depressed dyspeptics ; that will make no odds ; we desire to go to the grave by our own lack of sanitation , not the other fellow 's ! These are , of course , homely illustrations ; the profound truths they adumbrate may be put more pompously. will proceed to put them more pompously , since there are people who will not look at any truth unless poly-phonetically proclaimed . The fact is , then , that if we human beings fight we fight more willingly to preserve our civilizations than for any other reason . If , then , a politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or in the alternative , that you are ? the less civilized of the two , I will fight you or you me . I will fight against your Prohibition because you are of so low an order of humanity that you can not be kept from making a beast of yourself without Federal en- actments ; moreover you sit in theaters that smell of offal and , fur all we know , your bluejackets wear the wrong sort of little boys ' hats . Possibly even white-linen ones . We , on the other hand , regard ourselves as God 's chosen . We have nostrils so sensitive ! Ours is God 's Own Country , Eng . I assure you that my countrymen look at their country like that ! You , on the other hand ? I am presuming you to belong to God 's Own Country , U. S. A. ? you then , the chosen of the Almighty , will fight me because I , the slave of tyrants , would force alcoholic liquors on your wives and children , not to mention yourself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutishness that distinguishes me ; I would force you to wear teeth five inches long , to ventilate your living rooms , drink tea , suppress your divorce reports . . . Who knows what ? It is in that way that populations regard each other , really . And it is time they gave it up . I am not a pacifist ? at any rate I am not a professional pacifist . If anyone gets up a first-class war I should hope to be in it in one capacity or another , and of course on the right side . I mean that if there is any fun going I should like my share of it ; but I do not mean that I want anyone to declare war on anyone else . The fun I want is that of seeing the arts and abstract thought knocking Big Business off the earth ; with that any sort of war , anywhere , would seriously interfere . I should hate to see all Europe , half South America , half Asia , and all the rest of the world setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love New York , and New York would be the first to get it in the neck . Yet that is what the politicians ' publicists ' United States is asking for . The rest of the nation probably does not know that it is what it is asking for ? any more than those sailors in my caf ? knew that they risked getting that place of repose put out of bounds for them by talking during the performance of Rimsky-Korsakoff 's " Chant Hindou . " But they did . I do not mean to say that the war-risk is very imminent . It is about as imminent as the war of 1014 was in 1870 ? but that is near enough . And that is a nasty state of affairs which has been brought about not merely by American politicians and the smart Alecks that write for the American press , but by all the politicians and all the smart Alecks the world over . It is time our peoples turned their attentions to what is being done for us . You may say that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , for instance , yesterday an editorial in an Americanpaper circulating largely in this country ? a leading article that said complacently just what I have been saying above . ( You have been thinking that I exaggerated . ) But that editorial stated quite complacently that the United States was detested and feared by Europe , by nearly all the South American Republics , by at least one great Asiatic Empire . It dwelt on that fact with complacency and then concluded , " Let them hate as long as they fear . " . .. Do you know what Bismarck said in 1888 when someone told him that the whole world hated and feared the nation of which he was Chancellor ? He said , " Oderint dun metuant . Let them hate as long as they fear ! " Now I do not know much about the Ku Klux Klan . I have heard it very soundly abused in Europe . There is one English journal which has seriously advocated that we should take steps against the United States because she shelters that organization , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken against the British Empire because she does not adopt Prohibition . On the other hand I have heard the Klan quite seriously commended in the United States by nice , old-fashioned , educated people . So no doubt it has its good points ; if , then , it would extend its services to the extent of taking the writer and the commissioner of that leading article and putting them in honorary positions on the staff of a deaf , dumb , and blind asylum in the middle of the western alkali plains , it would deserve as well of the rest of Christendom as of the rural districts of the United States . For that really was a very atrocious performance . It would have been bad enough if that editorial had decorated the columns of a small-town weekly lost somewhere in the Middle West . But here was a journal enjoying the hospitality of the power which it treated with the greatest contempt in that editorial ; it addressed itself to enormous bodies of its own nationals who were just then pouring into that contemned country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not immensely well-instructed crowd that , already not over-endowed with modesty , was about to pour itself abroad on a country not so friendly as all that ? . . . I heard lately a boy of seventeen from one of your principal Eastern universities address the waiter in a European transcontinental dining car . The waiter said that they did not there serve eau nature but they had several kinds of mineral waters . Said that boy , " If you do n't give me ordinary drinking water I will take myself and my money out of your pauper country and where will you be then ? " He had shortly before pointed out to me the report of one of Mr. Mellon 's speeches on international matters . But what would he have done if he had just been reading that editorial ? IV I do not mean that American papers are any worse than French ones and , though the papers of my own country are in this respect better , it is rather because our journalists either can not , or are not encouraged to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English newspapers are very much larger affairs as regards circulation ? or at any rate as regards sales in proportion to population ? than are either American or French papers . They have thus a greater sense of responsibility . They really have . A newspaper proprietor who knows that his paper will be read by three and a half million families will , however venal or irresponsible , think at least twice before commissioning the sort of pinpricking stuff that is really what embitters nation against nation . I remember some years ago being in the proprietorial room of a great English paper , paying a call on the proprietor . A new leader-writer came in and asked for his day 's instructions . At that moment a deputation of the journalists of a Power with whom wewere none too friendly was visiting London . The newspaperproprietor told his leader-writer to write about this visit of the foreign journalists . He started by resenting the visit and telling his henchman to resent it . But then he said , " No . Be polite , but not too polite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of his journal . . . . We were , nevertheless , shortly afterwards at war with the country those journalists represented . Now I do not suppose that the editor of a small-town journal of the Middle West would feel the same hesitation if he thought that by writing an inflammatory article of the lion's-tail-twisting order he could increase his circulation from two thousand daily to two thousand two hundred ; nor would the editor of , say , the Ripublicain Varois with a circulation of two or three hundred feel any hesitation in recommending a pogrom of all the Anglo-Saxon visitors to his department if he thought it would be fun to do it . I remember sitting under the plane trees of a very remote , very ancient city far to the west of where I am writing and reading a Royalist journal . Its circulation could not have been more than two or three thousand weekly and it was edited and financed , though its appearance was very irregular , by a perfectly irresponsible Royalist marquis who wrote quite brilliantly ? about as brilliantly as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether international or domestic , were of a kind that would have made both Torquemada and Bird o ' Freedom Sawin rub their eyes . And well written . So well written that as I sat in that old Place and read I thought I was mad . Well , I happened to get into conversation with that newspaper-proprietor a little later . He was a very cultivated , good-humored , and indeed humorous sort of cosmopolitan . And when I remonstrated with him over his publication he asked me what it mattered . He said he had about three hundred readers a day . What would they do in a population of thirty millions or so ? ? whereas they might turn a municipal election in that city ! And , indeed , I have had much the same thing said tome by representatives of small journals in various parts of the Middle West ? and once by a member of the staff of a very influential Boston paper . They all said they were writing only for home consumption , so what did it matter ? I daresay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounded similarly with his conscience . But it does matter terribly ; in the first place because it is beastly , and then beastly , and then again beastly . And then still more , because each of those imbecile articles is the potential spark that may ignite all the arsenals in the world . For each of them has a potential , who knows how many , million readers ? It suffices for any big News Agency , or any mischievous journalist of a widespread journal to get hold of the R ? publieain Varois or the Dayton ( not necessarily Ohio ) Republican and to reproduce its opinions as representing the settled convictions of France or the United States , and infinite mischief may be done , since there is no end to the possible reverberations . And there is no end to the possible variations on this theme . Thus America suffers more , I think , than any other country from its organs that represent Uplift , whether of the hundred-per-cent brand or the , let us say , Bohemian variety . I may be mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever side of the blanket they may prefer to lie , are less able than the inhabitants of other countries to let one another alone . They interfere with one another 's morals , drains , pursuits , beliefs , dances , clothes , and all the other things that go to color and make up the life of man , far more than the inhabitants of most other countries ? and they do it far more in public and by communications to public organs . There are so many more of these in the United States than other nations are inclined to support . In England , France , Germany , Italy ? where you will in Europe ? one lady in a village street on seeing another pass her by will remark , " 0o , ' er ! She 's got a new feather in ' er ' at . She ai n't no better than she should be , " with the natural variations for the respective dialect . It will , however , end there . It seems to me , however , that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the papers lamenting the decay of the times , but that she would find a journal to print her opinions , a preacher to thunder in her sense from the pulpit , a kleagle to organize the tarring and feathering of the offender , a political boss to make the matter a plank in a program , and immense and unreasonably wealthy organizations to see that new feathers are not worn otherwise than in tar . And the press comments and the press anticomments will cause reverberations that shall penetrate into the center of China , giving the strangest views of the barbarian nature of Occidental civilizations . Nor , on the whole , can one be certain that the proceedings of what I will call the hundred-per-cent press and organizations are not less deleterious from an international point of view than what again I will call the Bohemian factions and their activities . Each side aims at interfering with their fellow men , which is for me the most abhorrent of crimes . But the hundred-per-cent uplift people have for the foreigner at least the aspect of aiming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocrisies , weaknesses , bad English , and savageries of their opponents without much attempt at a constructive policy of liberation . The process is , I believe , called debunking ; but the debunker is seldom more than the old presbyter inverted . And , as I have said , the harm done abroad by these organs and publicists is very considerable since they supply in tabloid form ammunition for every enemy of the United States . We are by now so used to the lively fare supplied us by American journalists through their News Agencies that we find it hard to be much interested in their projections of American life . If gunmen seized the President of the United States and held him for ransom we should say that it was merely what we had been led to anticipate ? or if bootleggers seized all the Federal buildings and executives in New York . But when widespread debunking magazines expose the hypocrisies of the American clergy of all denominations , the brazen-lunged mental corruption of all the American great from Washington to P. T. Barnum , the imbecility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the American press from Wyoming to Arkansas , the insularity of Rhodes scholars , the fact that , according to the figures of the Woolworth and Kresge fivecent chain stores , the American people prefers bright colors to dull ones ( and I am looking through only one copy of one such organ ) ? when widespread debunking magazines do that , not only are they displaying Pharisaism ( which is a matter between themselves and their God ) , but they are supplying to the enemies of the United States exactly the materials which the enemies of the United States want . I have been following with attention the leaders of a particularly pestilential English weekly , and whenever that organ refers to the United States ? which it invariably does with a sort of academic abhorrence ? it ends its tirade with what amounts to , " But what can you expect from a people who . . . " and then a citation from the American debunker . And it is all hypocrisy ? the hypocrisy that consists in insisting on searching for the person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States is a great wild country , like any other great wild country ; it is inhabited by human beings much like any other human beings ; it has strata of infinitely varying cultures , as is the case with every other nation . The clergy of all nations are distinguished by what appears hypocrisy to the non-sympathizer ; allpublic men are distinguished by brazen lungs and by their pouring out of banalities ; all small local legislatures are apt to display imbecility ; all natural peoples prefer to have their goods done up in bright-colored parcels . I do myself . We are in the nineteen hundred and twenty-eighth year of the Christian era ? then can not we have done with silly nagging between nations ? For myself I grow nearly frenzied when I hear a semi-imbecile Briton sneer at the United States , or a cheaply epigrammatic American contemn my own country , or a Frenchman too skilful of tongue pour vitriol over both . We are all decent nations with creditable records of varying intellectual value . Then why can not we let one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . Politicians and Finance and Big Business and the Publicists must , I suppose , continue to do their best to embroil us ; that is their game . But hatred between nations is not a necessary or inevitable growth ; we are all in effect too forced to rely the one upon the other . So I have called this article " Pax ! " after the breathless ejaculation that , as schoolboys , we used to let out when we were too hard pressed in any running game . Let us have a cessation , let each of us do what he can to bring about a cessation , of this cruel and ignorant schoolboy 's sport of crying " Yah " and sticking out our tongues at each other over the fence . The Big International Interests appear very formidable and gigantic , but they have their vulnerable heels , and we quiet people seem more in their clutches than we actually are . You have only to look at what France has done to her politicians in the past year to see what a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of God into caucuses and conventions . I am not a constructive politician , but it seems to me that what France could do AngloSaxondom also might accomplish in a different direction . We let our statesmen play old Harry with us for most of 1 the time , but in the end they are frightened of us . It is only really a matter of displaying our goodwill one to the other . I am trying herewith to begin . V And do not believe that that goodwill does not exist . I began with an anecdote of this Mediterranean seaport . Let me finish with another . I was then in the theater here , attending a performance of a play called " Pas aur la Bauche . " The chief character of this play is an American citizen who objects for hygienic reasons to being kissed on the mouth . And this character was played by a real American who was more American than any American you ever imagined . He must have been six foot seven high and leaner than any salmon you ever put back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elongated light-gray suits ; no visible check book ; and upon the charmers who surrounded him ? and they were pretty things ? he beamed with myopic eyes through horn-rimmed spectacles as large as motor headlights . Well , he was an American . And he was beloved . You should have heard the women of that simple audience cry out with delight when he said " Wal , " and I guess and calculate ! " and " Put it there ! " and smiled his lovely bland , imbecilely good-natured smile . And you should have heard them say , " Pas mal chic , ce type I4 . " And , still more significantly , to their attendant swains , when that American had performed some act of generous sentimentality , " Ah , les Yenkis , its sont camme cal " And when , on the approach of a charming young thing , he agitatedly extended his hands downwards in the attitude of a nymph surprised bathing and cried out , " Not on the mouth ! . . A ? oh ! pas sur la boucher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the audience did not object to him . Men do not object to other men who do not want to be kissed . At least the French are like that . In short , he was modest , inarticulate , friendly , generous , infectiously gay ? the American of the old school as the French remember him . As in the case of my American friends who , at the thought of Dickens and the Poet 's Corner considered that they were children come home , that earlier American tradition is a good foundation for friendship between nations . If only we could set a little more store by what lies beneath those flagstones at Westminster ? for of what use is American enthusiasm when confronted with our own indifference to our own chief glories ? ? and if only you could muzzle Senator ? Well , we are not talking politics . But tell him , if he has to say those things in order to ensure re-election , to say them , but differently . He may well be the elect of God 's Own people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are accustomed to believe that we are the children of God ? of a. no doubt smaller God with fewer stars in his Milky Way , and less gold on the floors of his pavilions . But still . . . Have a try at it . Or get him to read Washington 's last message to Congress . Yes , that , perhaps !
