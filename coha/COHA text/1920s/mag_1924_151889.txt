Laurence Stallings America Should Be Proud <P> How Laurence Stallings will dislike the title I have written on this column ! He is not the sort of person who indulges in mock sentiment- yet he need not accuse me of mock sentiment . His Plumes* is as fine a novel of the War as has been written , and why should anyone who thinks so not say so as plainly as possible ? <P> Mr. Stallings is a critic of no mean power . When you first meet him you gain an impression of bulk , and of a winning smile . He is a Southerner with a soft Southern voice , and he has many of the ingratiating qualities which are often associated with gentlemen of the lower part of the U. S. His attitude of mind is eager , even penetrating . So alert a mentality is apt to be a trifle impatient of the slowness of others ' minds . Mr. Stallings is not characterized by literary or intellectual patience , although , as a man , I imagine , he has unusual understanding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravery . <P> Since he has been writing the book columns of The New York World he has developed a large personal following , and for a good reason . His reviews are brilliant , carefully conceived , and show a background of reading which is unusual in one of the young- or so-called " young " - school of criticism . I suspect him of being impatient with daily journalism , yet I wonder if he is not too nervous , too eager a mentality ever to be contented to confine his abilities to the writing of novels and plays . He is one of those persons whose nervous energy drives them to constant work . There is something about a frequent copy date for a writer of this type that is as necessary as an opiate . I am convinced that journalism is an essential stimulus for this type of person . <P> Presently Laurence Stallings ' War play , Glory , will be seen on Broadway . It , too , will be sardonic , perhaps even more so than the novel ; but if it possesses the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should prove to be a drama worth seeing . <P> Mr. Stallings , like most of those young men who were active in the War , does not care to have his War experiences discussed . In this instance , they were heroic ones . That he has been able to see them with detachment , and to view the War with fairness , is one of the things that make him the very unusual person , the very fine writer that he is . J.
