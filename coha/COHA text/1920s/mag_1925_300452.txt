Mitchell Kennerley , President of the Anderson Galleries , returned , dapper and beaming , from London where he had engineered his sensa tional coup to bring the Leverhulme collection to the U. S. He was willing to talk about it , a little . . . . Yes , the sale had been an nounced for London , all plans made , before the trustees of Lever-hulme 's estate changed their minds and sent him a cable . What had made them change their minds ? <P> Why , they were lawyers . They had not known about the knock-out system which British dealers use to get graft out of a sale . <P> Pressmen nodded sagely , though it is unlikely that many of them knew any more than Leverhulme 's perplexed trustees about the knock out system . Knockout , in the ar got of the U. S. collegian , is a floating superlative used to qualify any object whose speed , efficiency or sex-appeal appalls rhetoric . In England the pressmen soon ascertained it is something else entirely . <P> There " knock-out " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reap illicit gains . Instead of bidding against each other , they obtain valuable objects at insignificant cost by forming a pool and appointing a representative to bid for them . Whatever is bought in the interests of the pool is sold again to private individuals or at other auctions and the profits divided . It was an open secret among the Trade in London that the Leverhulme " knock-out " would net its participants approximately half a million dollars out of the pockets of the estate .
