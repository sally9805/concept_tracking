British medical men are in a ferment , it appears from the correspondence columns of the Lancet , over a serum introduced by Henri Spahlinger , a physician of Geneva , Switzerland , for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis . Spahlinger 's serum has been in existence for ten years , but owing to financial difficulties he has been unable to manufacture it in quantity , nor has it been submitted to experimental investigation before official scientific groups . Many competent doctors , however , have visited Geneva , have used the serum and testify to its revolutionary merits . It would be a tragedy , they say , if it were , through accidental circumstances , withheld from the world . A number of acute cases treated with it in 1913 and 1914 are still alive and have had no relapses . A movement is on foot to raise funds to subsidize Spahlinger 's treatment .
