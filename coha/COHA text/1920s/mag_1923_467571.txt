MANY people have an idea that the end of the world may not be far away . Some think the earth is drying up . Others are sure that the sun is rapidly losing its heat , so that the earth will presently be a cold , lifeless sphere revolving around an equally cold , invisible sun . The airless moon with its vast crater pits and its bitterly low temperature in the shadows is cited as an example of what may in time befall the earth . The people who hold these ideas should sympathize with the man who was listening to a lecture on the evolution of the earth . The lecturer stated that physicists have calculated that the world will become cold and lifeless in thirty million years . " How soon did you say that would happen ? " the man interrupted anxiously . " I said in thirty million years the earth will be cold and lifeless . " " Oh , " said the man with an air of great relief , " I thought you said three million . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science run as freely as the waters of a brook . What was believed yesterday has to-day become part of the great ocean of discarded theories . Geologists now hold that a billion years ago ? yes , a billion , not a million ? the earth had a climate not greatly different from that of to-day . The radio-active minerals and their products in the rocks seem to prove that the earliest known sedimentary rocks must have been laid down a billion or more years ago . The life of that time as read from the rocks was essentially like the lower types that still exist . Similar shellfish , worms , and other forms to-day can live only where the temperature does not remain permanently below freezing and where itnever rises much above perhaps 150 degrees Fahrenheit . The air of those vastly remote days must have been much like that of to-day , . for even the o lowly forms of life require oxygen , nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water in order to live and reproduce their kind . The sun itself can not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's climate would have been so different from that of to-day that it would have been wholly incompatible with the forms of life from which all present life appears to be descended . So for perhaps a billion years the climate of the earth has apparently not passed beyond the limits where life , as we know it , can flourish . How this is possible , how the sun can have remained hot , how the earth 's atmosphere can have retained so nearly the same composition , and how the climate can repeatedly have changed and yet always have been brought back almost to the same condition , is one of the most puzzling of the unsolved mysteries of science . Moreover , if the past is any clue to the present , there is every probability that the earth will remain habitable for hundreds of millions of years in the future . Even though the human species may already be a million years old , as many geologists believe , man may be only at the beginning of his career . In another million years he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today differ from the brutish , apelike men of Java , the most primitive human beings whose remains have yet been discovered . In spite of the extraordinary constancy of the earth 's climate , there have also been innumerable changes . At least four main glacial periods , and perhaps more , have covered millions of square miles with vast sheets of ice . Some of the periods , and perhaps all , have consisted of several epochs , each with its own separate advance of the ice . Between the glacial ' epochs there have been inter-glacial epochs when the climate was as mild as or milder than today , for the great icesheets of Greenland and Antarctica show that we are still in the tail of the last glaciation . Between the glacial periods there have been eras of enormous duration when the earth 's climate has been so mild that tree ferns , corals , and other warmth-loving species lived as far north as Greenland . Even since the height of the last glacial epoch minor changes have driven mankind backward and forward in many parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has prevented the climate from going beyond the limits where life is possible , and the vast variability whereby no type of climate has even been permanent ? these conditions , it appears , have been of almost limitless importance in the development of life . During the mild periods the same species have persisted indefinitely and have spread out over huge areas . Like races of men that live in luxury and ease , they have lost their pristine vigor and have become weak and degenerate . Then there has come a change of climate . At first the warmth-loving species shivered and dumbly protested when cold winds , cold currents , violent storms , ice , and snow began to prevail in high latitudes . Then they began to die or migrate . The first to be affected were those in the highest latitudes or in the centers of great continents where the climate is always most severe . Then destruction spread far and wide as icesheets began to creep out from the highlands and the oceans began to be filled with cold waters and floating icebergs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the same time new species began VOL CXLVI. ? No. 574. - 56to develop with phenomenal rapidity . Perhaps the extremes of temperature and the new conditions of food caused the marked changes which the biologist calls mutations , and which seem to be the origin of species , although as to this we are not yet sure . Or perhaps the harsh climate merely killed off all the weaker , less resistant forms , and allowed only those to persist which had certain special kinds of vigor . Whatever the exact process , it appears that in glacial periods the changes in living creatures during a thousand years may have been greater than during a million years of the mild climate of the long intervening periods . It was during the stress of the last glacial period that man evolved his present high powers of mind . With him the quality that counted most in resisting the storms , the cold , and the changes of that trying time was not speed in flight , thickness of fur , fierceness in pursuit of prey , or ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something higher than any of these , namely , the mental power which led man to use fire , invent clothing , build means of shelter , store food , and otherwise adapt himself to the harsh climate and the fierce struggle for existence which the narrowing limits of the habitable earth imposed upon him . So we must look back to the last great series of climatic changes as the inexorable but stimulating agent in raising man from the level of the brutes to the heights of manhood . Perhaps another glacial period with its restriction of the earth 's habitable area and its consequent demand for high mental and moral ability in order to survive may be needed to cause the next great step in human evolution . Whatever the future may have in store , it is clear that climate , and especially changes of climate , have been of almost incalculable importance in the development of the earth 's inhabitants . Hence the thoughtful mind raises two questions : Why has the earth 's climate remained so long within certain fixed limits , when we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cold for every kind of life ? And why , within these limits , have there been such great and stimulating changes ? Many factors co-operate to produce these results , but among these there is probably none more important than the sun . That body has been lord of the life of the earth in the past , and will presumably be lord for an indefinite future . Why it remains so changeless no man can yet answer , except that such uniformity seems to have something to do with radio-activity and with the ultimate structure of the ions and electrons within the atoms that were once thought to be the smallest particles of matter . Throughout the whole realm of astronomy the new developments of radioactivity are leading to the belief that changes which once were supposed to require thousands of years actually take millions . The variations of the sun , if such there have been , are as puzzling as its uniformity . There is every reason to think that the sun 's temperature can not fluctuate back and forth in any such way as would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has suffered . Yet there is much evidence that somehow the sun has been subject to fluctuations and that those fluctuations have caused changes of climate . The key to the whole matter seems to lie in the discovery of a Dutch scientist who three hundred years ago affirmed that when there are many spots on the sun the earth 's temperature is abnormally low . No one paid much attention to this . Nor did the world heed a conclusion reported by Francis Bacon : " There is a toy , which I have heard , and I would not have it given over , but waited upon a little . They say it is observed in the Low Countries ( I know not in what part ) , that every five and thirty years the same kind and suit of years and weathers comes about again ; as great frosts , great wet. , great droughts , warm winters , summers with little heat , and the like , and they call it the prime ; it is a thing I do the rather mention , because , computing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred years the momentous conclusions of the Dutch scientist as to solar cycles lay dormant , but little by little more evidence accumulated . One investigator after another was forced to believe that when sunspots are numerous the earth 's climate is different from what it is when they are few . Some very thorough students , however , such as SimonNeweomb , the great American astronomer , were skeptical . They saw that almost invariably low temperature in one region is balanced by unusually high temperature elsewhere . With rainfall and atmospheric pressure the same is true . Moreover , there may seem for some decades to be a close correspondence between solar activity and the weather , but suddenly it disappears , and an exactly opposite relationship may prevail for a while . Such contradictions appeared more baffling the more widely the problem was studied . So for nearly three centuries the changes in the activity of the sun were almost ignored as causes of the earth 's climatic variations . But Simon Newcomb , although one of the greatest and most accurate men of his day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mathematically that aviation would never be possible because no known material is strong enough to stand the strain . Unwittingly , he helped to kill poor Langley , who made the first real aeroplane , but who died broken-hearted because his crude contrivance persisted in falling into the river . Newcomb was accurate , practical , and wrong . Langley was visionary , impractical , and right . The present century has seen a movement away from Newcomb 's skepticism . It is almost universally agreed that when sunspots are numerous the earth as a whole is cooler than when sunspots are few . This is most remarkable , for the sun 's radiation tends to be unusually abundant at times of many spots . Hence we should expect the earth to be warm , not cool . Some people think that the paradox of a hot sun and a cool earth arises from the fact that much ozone is formed in the upper air when the solar radiation is low , and this is supposed to act as a blanket and thus conserve part of the heat which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective explanation seems to he that when sunspots are numerous the number and severity of storms increase . A storm in middle latitudes is usually preceded by relatively warm winds , and followed by cold winds fromhigher latitudes . The cold air pushes its way under the warm air , and actually raises it to high levels . Thus much heat is carried aloft , and the temperature at the earth 's surface is lowered . But let no one think that , because there is a large spot on the sun , he or any one else can safely connect that spot with any given storm . The relation between the sun and the earth is so complex that not for a long time will accurate predictions be possible . In fact , a large number of the best scientists , including those of the United States Weather Bureau , do not believe the hypothesis which is here set . forth . Perhaps they are looking at a different part of the stream of truth , which we , too , are scrutinizing . There are many curious anomalies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only does a hot sun produce a cool earth , but the activity of the sun causes the temperature and atmospheric pressure to rise in some parts of the earth and fall in others . Stranger than this is the fact that the east side of the sun produces a different effect upon the earth from the west ; and spots in the sun 's northern hemisphere act contrary to those ii the southern . Take , for example , the puzzling meteorological phenomena of atmospheric electricity- They are hard to measure , hard to understand , and hard to correlate with other factors . Recently , however , the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington has found that the earth 's atmospheric electricity seems to vary in response to the movements of the sun . Even during the short period of a solar eclipse the atmospheric electricity and the related phenomena of the earth 's magnetism show an appreciable change of strength . I have found that during the years from 1904 to 1909 the atmospheric electricity at Kew near London ' shows a distinct relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's disk . When a sunspot appeared on the eastern margin of the sun 's northern hemisphere it either had no appreciable effect on the so-called potential gradient of the atmospheric electricity at Kew , or else was associated with a decrease in the potential gradient . During the two weeks while the sun 's rotation was carrying the spot across the solar disk , however , there was a gradual change whereby the spot tended to lose its negative relationship and to acquire a positive relationship so that it was associated with steep gradients when it approached the western margin . Before the margin is reached , however , the apparent effect of a spot rapidly diminished or was even reversed . A similar spot in the southern hemisphere acted in precisely opposite fashion . From 1904 to 1909 , the only years that have yet been tested , the barometric contrasts over the North Atlantic ocean responded to sunspots in essentially the same way as did the atmospheric elee- tricity'at Kew . Slight barometric contrasts and fair weather were associated with sunspots in the northern and erpecially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great barometric contrasts and stormy weather tended to prevail when spots were numerous in the southern solar hemisphere , especially when they approached the western margin of the solar disk . So remarkable a contrast in the effect of different parts of the sun 's disk seems impossible unless the sun itself shows highly peculiar characteristics . And so it does . The recent discoveries by Dr. George E. Hale and his colleagues at the Mount Wilson Observatory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington show that sunspots are highly electrified and occur regularly in pairs as shown in the diagram . The leading member of the pair is generally the larger . The leaders at present are positively electrified in the sun 's northern hemisphere and negatively electrified in the snot lien ' hemisphere . The second , or following , spot in each pair is electrified in the opposite way . Thus sunspots form what may be called hi-polar pairs , of which the strong leader is positive in the sun 's northern hemisphere and negative in the southern Itetilisphere . When spots appear singly , they almost . invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemispheres . Moreover , Dr. Hale has discovered invisible sunspots which are often located where the second member of a pair would be if a single spot were double . To add to the complexity of the arrangement , the signs of the spots in both solar hemispheres were reversed in 1912 . Thus to-day the leaders in the northern hemisphere are positive where they were negative before 1912 . The complex arrangement of the bipolar sunspots seems exactly to fit the peculiar response of the earth to the sun . The leader in each pair of sunspots is stronger than the follower . Hence , as a pair crosses the solar disk the effect of the leader gradually piles up , as it were , and reaches a maximum when the spot has passed perhaps three-fourths of the way across the disk . By that time the leader is turned away from the earth and the follower has a chance to produce some result of an opposite character . Thus , a pair of spots on the sun 's eastern margin must produce a different effect from a pair on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemisphere must act in the opposite way from a pair in the northern hemisphere . This is what we actually have found from 1904 to 1909 . Sunspots apparently send out electrical emissions in the form of positive particles from positive spots , and negative particles , or ions , when the spots are negative . These particles are shot to the earth with almost the speed of light . Presumably , however , they do not pursue straight paths , for they must be deflected by the magnetic fields of both the sun and the earth . Reaching the earth , the electrons influence the atmospheric electricity ; and thus appear to modify barometric pressure and have an effect on storms . Perhaps the reason why the storminess of both the northern and southern hemispheres is largely concentrated in belts is because the earth 's magnetic field deflects the solar electrons into a certain zone in each hemisphere . These facts sound convincing . The peculiar relation of the earth to sunspots seems to be completely matched by the highly peculiar bi-polar arrangement of the spots . But here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met by an objection which to many people seems insurmountable . A calculation of the effect of atmospheric electricity upon atmospheric pressure by Professor W. J. Humphreys of the United State s Weather Bureau seems to show that no matter how strong the electronic emissions from the sun , they could not produce more than a most insignificant effect on the weather . This conclusion seems almost unassailable , but perhaps it is like Newcomb 's conclusion as to aviation . Or possibly . the ease resembles that of the transfusion of water and sap through plants . Physicists have tried again and again to explain the mechanism by which the water rises in the trunks and is given off by the leaves . Atmospheric pressure , capillary attraction , and osmotic pressure due to differences of chemical composition all play some part in the matter ; but even when every known possibility is taken intoaccount it seems mathematically impossible to raise the sap much more than 1.50 feet . Nevertheless , the sap , unconscious of the trouble which it makes for the physicists , actually rises to heights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest trees . Some physical law which is not yet understood allows the tree to do that which is apparently impossible . Perhaps the same may be true of sunspots and the weather . Prom 1904 to 1909 there was certainly the peculiar relationship which we have seen . We must either choose between the facts and the mathematical theory , or pursue the course of withholding judgment until more facts are available . If the electrical hypothesis of the weather is true , it may explain the puzzling way in which a storm sometimes becomes suddenly strong or weak without warning , or perhaps splits into two parts , or changes its course , or perhaps moves faster or slower than was expected . The electrical hypothesis may also help to explain how the sun 's temperature may have remained almost constant for hundreds of millions of years , and yet solar variations may have helped to cause great changes of climate on the earth . At times of many sunspots the earth 's climate seems on a small scale to reproduce the conditions which on a large scale give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods which have done so much to determine the character not only of plants and animals , but of man , may have been connected with disturbances in the sun 's atmosphere . What could cause such disturbances ? Most authorities have assumed that the present solar disturbances such as sunspots , prominences , faculty , flocculi , and the other kinds of gaseous clouds that variegate the sun 's surface , are due to commotions arising solely from the sun 's own heat . There is much evidence , however , that while the energy of these commotions is derived from the compression and contraction of the sun itself , the times when the disturbances occur and their degree of violence depend on outside causes . A number of famous scientists have suggested that the intensity of the sunspots somehow depends upon the relative distances and positions of the planets . They have also suggested that the planets influence the sun electrically as well as by means of tides . That is , just as the sun 's electrical activity seems to cause disturbances in the earth 's atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances may initiate disturbances in the solar atmosphere . If little bodies like the planets can initiate disturbances in the sun 's atmosphere , the vastly larger , hotter , and more effective stars may produce similar effects on a far greater scale , provided they come near enough to the sun . I have tried to estimate the probability that any stars are now or have recently been near enough to the solar system to have an appreciable effect upon climate . Ifwe suppose that the present sunspots owe their periodicity and relative strength primarily to Jupiter , since that planet is much the most effective , we can form a rough estimate of the effect produced by stars of various types at any given distance . Alpha Centauri. the nearest known star , appears to have some effect in keeping the sun 's atmosphere in a state of perturbation . When the two parts of that double star are approaching each other in their highly eccentric orbits , sunspots are much more numerous than when the two parts are receding . This is what would be expected . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seems to be the case , the two parts of Alpha Centauri which revolve around each other at a distance not much greater than that of Neptune from the sun , must be in a state of almost incredible disturbance . Moreover , about twenty-eight thousand years ago Alpha Centauri was at a minimum distance of about , one and one-half light-years from the solar system , and its effect must have been multiplied several fold . This , again , accords with the terrestrial facts . Geologists generally agree that the last glaciation reached its last climax from twenty-five to thirty thousand years ' ago ; they also agree that the earth has not yet entirely passed out of that glacial epoch . Thus , whether we look at the small fluctuations of the present or at the great pulsations of the past , the actual course of the earth 's climatic history has been what would be expected if the stars , like the planets , disturb the sun 's atmosphere and thus cause the earth 's climate to become stormy and cool . As to remoter eras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries , however , make it seem probable that the solar system has not infrequently passed close enough to other stars so that the sun 's atmosphere may have been disturbed . These discoveries tend to show that many of the stars are far larger and brighter and move much more rapidly than was formerly supposed . For example , the great ? red star known as Betelgeuse has a diameter nearly Lwo hundred and fifty times that of the sun . A double star much farther from the sun consists of two parts , one of which is twelve thousand and the other fifteen thousand times brighter than the sun . A third star appears to move at the rate of nearly eight hundred miles a second fast enough to go around the earth a hundred times a day , or to the moon and back five times . The larger and brighter a star , the greater its capacity to radiate light and electrical energy into space ; the faster it moves the more likely it is to approach other stars . Hence , if there are many such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun has been influenced by some ? of them during geological history are much greater than if the stars average only about the size of the sun . Each day our relation to the vast universe changes a little . The " fixed " stars are no more fixed than are the clouds in the sky . Even in ten thousand years their relative positions change appreciably . And in the course of geological history the whole aspect of the heavens has utterly changed time and again . Stars that , are 11 ow hundreds of light-years away may once have been near neighbors of the sun . Sometimes the solar system may have pursued its course far from other stars and almost undisturbed by outside influences . At such times , the earth may have enjoyed a mild climate with little change from summer to winter or from latitude to latitude . The warmth-loving forms of life expanded , enjoyed themselves , and grew weak and incapable of resistance . Then the steady cosmic sweep of the sun and stars brought the sun into a region where it passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars , some of which were large and double or even triple , as is frequently the case . At such times all sorts of disturbances may have arisen in the sun 's atmosphere , and the earth 's climate may have been correspondingly stormy and severe . All living species may have fallen into the throes of a great struggle for existence and old species may have been extinguished , while new ones , more resistant , more specialized , and more adaptable , supplanted them . If this hypothesis is correct , man may owe much of his mental development during the last half million years to the presence near the sun not only of Alpha Centauri , but of other stars which have been able to engender disturbances in the solar atmosphere . If such is the case , the sun has indeed been the lord of the earth 's development , but in its turn it has been no more than the pawn of the vastly greater forces of the COSMOS                 @ @ @ @
