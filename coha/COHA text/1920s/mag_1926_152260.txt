THE CITY OF THE SACRED WELL -T . A. Willard-Century ( $4 ) . Here is the story , told by an intimate friend , of Edward Herbert Thompson - " Don Eduardo " , as they call him in Yucatan-to whom is credited the bulk of modern archeological knowledge of the great Mayan civilizations . Reading explorers ' books as a boy in snug New England , he connected himself with the Peabody Museum and the American Antiquarian Society , which obtained him the first U. S. consulship in Yucatan and opportunity to devote most of his life to baring the secrets of Chichen Itza , the Mayan capital . Besides constituting a reliable compendium of Mayan culture-Author Willard is himself an accomplished archeologist-the book recites in Thompson 's own words the feats of dredging , and then diving , to the bottom of the home of Yum Chac , the Rain God-a limestone sinkhole 160 feet across and 150 feet deep-where virgins and warriors , decked with jade and golden bells , accompanied by balls of copal ( aromatic resin ) , rubber and cotton goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brooches , mirrors , were flung as sacrifices from the high brink ( TIME , Nov. 16 , SCIENCE ) .
