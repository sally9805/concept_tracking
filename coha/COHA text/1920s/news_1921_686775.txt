txt By an instructive coincidence it happens that the reduction of the rate of discount between Federal Reserve Banks was published on the same day with the report of the National Credit Office on the working of our open market for discounts . The two things together explain why thAreduction . of the interbank rate of discount means so much less under our system than under the systems of other countries which have central bank systems . In England the alteration of the bank rate means that credit is cheaper or dearer to the man in the street because he can sell his paper on a quotation altering by the smallest fraction of 1 per- cent. , far smaller than the bank rate alteration . There is also a closer relation in England between the rates on , discounts and on deposits than here . The report of the National Credit Office shows what a shadow our open market is , although the quality of the paper Sold is of the highest . The Credit Office states that during the last eighteen months 3,676 concerns sold through note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest num " ber of names ever involved in any " period of like duratlon , " and only eighty-nine asked ' for any indulgence at maturity . Of the eighty-nine , fifty-three will pay in full , and the rest in an uncertain proportion which reduces the final loss to a small fraction of 1 per cent . Greater efficiency and security than that may be desirable , but is hardly to be , expected . Our experience under the Federal Reserve act only ' confirms the experience in other crises under the Clearing House system of liquidating panics that nothing in finance is surer and safer than commercial paper . This time we have had nothing like a panic under a - liquidation rivaling any we have ever known in both totals and proportions . It needs no demonstration that the total of four billions of discounts-sold . s in open market by 3,676 concerns is only a puny proportion of our total discounts . In other words , we . have no open market for money worthy the name . The bulk of our . bank business is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well explained in THE AN : NALIST of the current week by the economists of the Chase National Bank , Mr. HEPBURN and Mr. ANDERSON . The depositor in a member bank will find that-the reduced rate jpf in- ' terbank discount affects him little , more likely not at all . His relation with his bank depends en his business and condition , just as the ' relation of member banks with regional banks depends on their condition , and as the relation of regional banks depends on their relation with the Federal Reserve Board. : The borrowers who despend on theeopen market are accommodated below the market in dull ' times , and pay - top prices .111 active times .
