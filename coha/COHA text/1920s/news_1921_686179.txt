txt Foreign banking circles in France are rather upset by a new measure now being studied by the Finance Committee of the Chamber , which , should it become law , might drive all foreign banks out of business. * The measure was proposed a little before the end of the year and contains the two following provisions : " 1 . Foreign banks installed in France shall be subject , In addition to other taxation , to a special tax of 1 per 1,000 on their capital and reserves and a supplementary tax of 2 per 1,000 on aft business of any kind done by them in France . " 2 . Foreign banks installed in France shall be forbidden to receive deposits or take part in any operation , relative to foreign issues , other than those concerning their own nationals , without Governmental authorization given by decree . " In the preamble to the bill , which is a isavage attack on foreign banks and their " shady manoeuvres " the author of the bill , Deputy Georges Gerald , makes it Clear that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . Since the war the number of foreign banks in Franco , especially American , British and South American , has greatly increased , and the impression has spread among a section of the press and public unfamiliar with economics that they were in some mysterious way responsible for the fall in French exchange . This , however , Is the first occasion on which a deputy has put his opinion on record in the form of a proposed law . For several months there has been something approaching a campaign against foreign banks in some French newspapers , some of them of undoubted standing , and M. Georges Gerald 's proposal appears to be its culmination . Exactly what purpose the promoters of this campaign hope to serve is not clear . If , instead of correcting the erroneous opinions of the public , they succeeded in stirring up sentiment so that the Georges Gerald bill became a law , its Most probable effect would be the withdrawal of foreign banking institutions . This could hardly fail to cause France serious injury . Not only would it bar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reparations burden , once the amount of the German indemnity Is fixed , but it would coincide with the moment when France is reported to be negotiating for a new loan of $100,000 , - 000 in the United States , and when there . ls talk of trying to arrange for the extension of the maturity of the loans already outstanding . The argument put forward in support of the proposed legislation is that the State of Now York has a law forbidding agencies of foreign banking concerns established there to accept deposits and that in Spain a special tax has recently been imposed upon foreign banks . The French are believed to be unaware that Important American bank ' ing interests are trying to get the New York State law repealed and that , in fact , It was recently repealed by the Assembly and the Senate and is only still in force because the Governor refused his assent . In Spain the law has proved unpopular , and there is talk of having it repealed . At a time when commercial and financial operation in France are cruelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal is regarded as little less than suicidal . Far from taking capital out of France , the foreign banks actually introduce it , and , anyway , as regards the exportation of capital , foreigners are subject to the same restrictions as the French themI selves . I learn on high authority that there are hundreds of millions of francs almost entirely of foreign origin , held by foreign banks hers for the account of Iclients in their respective countries . This money is invested for the most part in short-term French Government securities , and , however employed , tends to assist the economic situation of the country . The reproach address by M. Georges Gerald to the foreign banks that they take advantage of the favorable exchange position to install themselves in costly and luxurious premises , can be met by the answer that every franc of money so spent helps French exchange , which would not be slow to suffer if all foreign capital were repatriated as the result of the withdrawal of foreign banks .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
