In the third week of their Quadrennial General Conference at Kansas City , the Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church passed judgment upon Anton Bast , Bishop of Copenhagen , who was accused of unministerial , imprudent conduct . He was charged with having made personal use of funds given to him for supposedly charitable purposes . For it , he had been convicted abroad and sentenced to three months in jail by a civil court . <P> Despite the pleas of Bishop Bast 's associates and friends , Bishop Edgar Blake of Paris and John L. Nuelsen of Zurich , the jury of 17 ministers upheld the charges , deprived him of his office . Also they agreed that a less severely penalized but more disgraceful accusation had been justified-namely , that Bishop Bast had gone on too many yachting trips with Mrs. Ellen Vedel , the wife of a Danish Government official . When informed of the verdict , which required only the expiation of an apology and which would permit him to continue as a member and minister of his church , Dr. Bast seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , go back to a small parish and live a simple , holy , humble life , not concerned with yachts or embezzlements . <P> In addition to condemning Anton Bast , the Methodists condemned wet newspapers , wet politicians and all others who audibly oppose prohibition . <P> They also voted to give Methodists in foreign lands the power to elect their own bishops , thus settling a long vexed question in the church . No sooner was the overwhelming vote recorded than cheers and joyful shouts , mingled with hymn-singing reverberated inside Convention Hall . When the tumult subsided , Bishop Fred B. Fisher , of Calcutta , India , said : " Never have I witnessed a more wonderful session . . . . Methodism faces a new day . " <P> Methodist support of church unity , which was so forcibly demonstrated last week ( TIME , May 21 ) , was again emphasized when the bishops gave their approval to moves for merging the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church South in Korea . With pleasure , they received messages from Congregationalist State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Congregationalist Churches . They learned , too , that in New York State the Congregationalists and the Disciples of Christ were planning a local merger which they hope later to make national .
