AWEEK has elapsed since we requested the Traffic Department to erect from two to six broad elevated highways , to relieve congestion . Nothing has been done , no ground has been broken  --  presumably because all available ground in town is already broken . But we arc going to keep at the evil , day and night , and at this point wish to amend our original suggestion as follows : every exit from New York into Jersey , Westchester , and Long Island shall he a valvular exit , so that any vehicle leaving the city can not , automatically , get back in . That would fix everything . ELENTLESS guardian of pub -- 1A- lic safety that we are , we spent the week investigating the increasing nudity in chorus ladies . Facts at our command are that the producers of musical shows have gone over to bare-leg choruses because of the great expense of tights and silk stockings . Even more than the five-cent fare , this matter of discarding clothing on the stage involves the question of whether the public is getting value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , brought us close enough to the matter under investigation to locate , in three separate instances , thirteen vaccinations , nine moles , seventy-two cases of sunburn , one lifted calf , and a mosquito bite . Our opinion is that hare feminine flesh is never beautiful and our advice to the managements is to cover up . IN our opinion the Plaza con-tinues by a wide margin to lead all hotels in the matter of sophisti-cation  --  and this in spite of an ex-traordinary event that took place on Fifty-eighth Street . A huge truck actually went by the door , laden with a dozen or more cows , and leaving a delicious odor of cowbarns behind it . Investigation brought to light that , as the vehicle rumbled by with its innocent freight , the suave headwaiters in the dining-room grew faint and covered with goose flesh , the sensuous orchestra missed a whole beat , and several hundred women sitting in chairs instinctively plucked at their skirts as if to bring them down to their knees . THERE is now a night club on Broadway called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chewing gum , and a fireboat by that name . Many people wonder whether these developments represent our influence . They certainly do . In fact , we are secretly behind all four enterprises  --  a step we took the minute we found that merely publishing a magazine took almost no effort and very littletime . Perhaps we should also inform our constituency that this publication was originally named for a railroad train . With what sinking of heart and bitterness of mind we subsequently learned that the name of that train had been changed from the New Yorker to the Spirit of St. Louis , no one can ever know . It looked to us like ingratitude . THIS morning 's post brought us a - I-  letter from Mr. I. Altman . He says : 0/ should like to name one of my saddle horses The New Yorker . Have you any objections ? " This , we confess , presents a rather delicate situation requiring judgment and courage . We have held several editorial conferences upon the matter , but we must admit that as yet our policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't allow horses in the office , and we are not sure we want them named after us . In the emergency we have drafted a reply to Mr. Altman , suggesting that , pending our decision , he tall his horse The Literary Digest . IN order to give the devil his due , - I-  we shall report what seems to be an authenticated but isolated case  --  that of a gentleman who arranged the successful transfer of his gas , phone and light in ten minutes flat . He tells us that in each instance he was answered by an intelligent girl at the other end of the wire , that the proceedings were smooth and easy , and that the only complication was dropping in on the Edison Company , on his way to his office , to sign a paper . He said that took an additional sixty seconds . It all sounds like a fairy tale , but we present the facts  --  as evidence that we are not just old and cynical and wise . Flying Home ? A N airplane de luxe , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , costs about sixty thousand dollars . Maintenance averages twenty-five thousand a year . You have to figure on that at least , what with the salary of a pilot at six thousand , a mechanic at half as much , and gas , oil and repairs . This estimate comes from a gentleman from whom we are able to learn much about the whole air situation . He tells us , for instance , that there are about five thousand privately owned planes in the United States . These include those operated by stunt flyers , pilots in the passenger-carrying business , and so forth ; only a few hundred are to be classed as pleasure planes . New York , because its weather is n't so favorable , is not conspicuous for the privately owned , but we have a promising nucleus of owners , among whom are Harold S. Vanderbilt , Vincent Astor , Earl D. Osborn , Reginald L. Brooks and Roger Wolfe Kahn . Mr. Astor has had his for some time , a Loening amphibian with a Liberty motor . Mr. Brooks more recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic at the Bellanca hangars before buying a plane with a 200 horsepower Wright ' Whirlwind motor  --  cone like Lindbergh 's . The most luxurious privately owned airplane in the country , we were told , was purchased not long ago by Mr. William H. Denning , a Texas oil millionaire . It is a Fokker with a 450 horsepower air-cooled motor and is said to be the fastest of the private planes , making , if the host decrees and the four guests it accommodates do not demur , 145 miles an hour . It is painted black and gold , the interior is finished in gray , the upholstery is of brown leather and it is equipped with a baggage compartment , wicker chairs , card tables , ice box , pantry and electric stove . Mr. Denning plans to use this craft in his frequent trips to New York . 00D planes come high , but we GOO are advised that many purchasers who wish nothing elaborate have bought war planes ( never taken out of the crate ) at twenty-three thousand dollars . A considerable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bored with cars . Intimate flying about New York is restricted now by lack of a landing field . One may not take off at Curtiss or Roosevelt Fields unless one rents a hangar there . The Army of course monopolizes Mitchel Field . Most owners of pleasure planes have their hangars on their estates . A plane maybe rented , our informant says , from an ever-growing list of companies . The cost is about sixty dollars an hour . Stopping overnight costs twenty-five dollars and one catch is that you have to pay for the return flight , whether you make it or not . For long-distance flights , such as to Chicago or Washington , the charge is by the mile . This is usually fifty cents which , of course , becomes a dollar even if you do not make the trip back . A trip to LVashington , or to Washington and hack , would thus cost about two hundred and twenty dollars . Ambassador Extraordinary A LL the anecdotes we have heard / I about Mr. Dwight Morrow have to do with his absent-mindedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably some of them are not true , but it is a fact that he is absent-minded , this professorial symptom growing out of a notable interest in academic learning and research and a deeply reflective temperament . One story , quite often related , discloses our new Ambassador to Mexico in the Grand Central Station in a deep and restless study , interrupted by an occasional search into his pockets . An acquaintance asked him if he had lost his ticket . " Worse than that , " the financier said , " I have forgotten where I was going . " On another occasion , while pacing up and down during an earnest conversation with a distinguished businessman seated in his office , he is reported to have absently used the visitor 's bald head to knock the ashes from his pipe . He is known to have stepped into an elevator of an uptown hotel and to have directed the operator to take him to the Bankers Trust Company . On still another occasion the vice-president of a bank called on him to ask his advice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the subject , in which he was greatly interested , sat down in a chair , put his foot on his desk and stared out the window . After perhaps a ten-minute silence he turned to his visitor and said , " What do you think of it ? " " But , " said the other , " you have n't said anything . " " Oh , I thought I had , " murmured Mr. Morrow . Presentation DR . HUGO RIESENFELD , who now directs the program for the newly re-opened Colony theatre , came here from Vienna with nothing but a violin , and yet thisyoung musician ( we are assured we can say this without fear of contradiction ) did more than anyone else to put movie presentations where they are today . Having got them there , however , he has come out of temporary retirement with productions notable for having a small orchestra and intimate little acts on ashortened stage . All about him the cathedrals still indulge in his earlier manner on an elaborate scale . When still in his teens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he asked for a raise Ice was fired . His first job in New York , twenty years ago , as a theatre organist , was threatened when he played classical music . The irate manager was subsequently mollified when the audiences seemed to like it . When he got his second week 's salary Riesenfeld disclosed his European point of view and his honesty by returning it with a statement that he had already been paid for the month . It had to be explained that he was getting fourteen dollars per week instead of per month . Fifteen years ago he played the organ in the Irving Place Theatre . He was concert master in Oscar Hammerstein 's Manhattan Opera House venture , director fora barnstorming opera troupe , conductor for a Klaw &; Erlanger musical comedy , and wrote the music for a show which died out of town . He began his movie-house career ten years ago as director of the " augmented " Rialto orchestra , and his classical and operatic programs succeeded . Here he originated the idea of stage presentations with films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of the Rialto , Criterion and Rivoli theatres , all operated by Famous Players . He introduced his " Classical Jazz , " and thesescores are now preserved in the Library of Congress . When Paramount took over his theatres he resigned , feeling his liberty would be prescribed . During the past two years he has been fashioning musical scores for the movies at this studio in Steinway Hail . He has one of the most comprehensive musical libraries in the world . He is credited with originating the idea of writing a special score for each feature picture , to be played wherever the film is shown . He can suggest appropriate programs for a film , in a few moments . Dr. Riesenfeld 's hobby is the study of Julius Caesar who , he believes , was the greatest man in history . He collects rare books ; also autographs ( specializing in kings and popes ) , and has several hundred written for him by eminent living men and women . He is mild-mannered except at rehearsals , when he yells at orchestra , movie operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insure his hands for a quarter of a million dollars the insurance company refused because he " dealt with too many unions . " He selects beauty-contest winners ( and runners-up ) as his ushers . The musical directors of the Paramount , Roxy , and Capitol arc , we arc told , graduates of his orchestras . Retort OWEN DAVIS , it seems , was working for one of the larger motion picture companies a few months since at the time when the industry announced its ten per cent cut in salaries . In a letter sent to Mr. Davis , a form letter which went to executives , riuthors and stars whose pay was specified by contract , the managers of the company suggested that he accept the reduction which , it was hoped , would he generally acceded to by all those who loved the movies . This love , they said , had led the producers themselves to accept even more than a ten per cent cut . To this communication Mr. Davis replied : " I appreciate your sentiment in taking a reduction because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must beg you to continue my contract because I hate the damn pictures . " Aires-Midi d'art Phone WE encountered a genial gentleman , with a hag of tools and a coil of wire , at a friend 's apartment the other afternoon and watched him put in a telephone in twenty minutes . Thus we were surprised when he told ? ? us he averaged only two or three installations a day during the moving season , this because the subscriber is often not at home when he calls even though an appointment has been made . Fifteen hundred men , we learned , were kept busy installing instruments , or walking about town , during the peak of the recent moving season . We also picked up several other facts about the company 's business ; for instance , a number of new exchanges will soon be in operation because of the increasing load . The telephone company detects the incipient symptoms of the overcrowding of an exchange five years in advance . Larger building and extension operations are charted twenty years in advance . The French type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the term French phone , however : its official title is Bell system hand-set . Several hundred experts have been at work since this instrument was devised , improving it , but experiments still go on . The phone does not survive satisfactorily the rough treatment it receives , although it is as durable as the old desk type of instrument . Slamming the headpiece on to the delicate plunger and knocking the whole apparatus on the floor present problems in durability . In their experiments the engineers slam and kick the phone around the laboratory and use special machinery which subjects the instrument to the same strains it would receive through rough handling . It is even now , however , superior to any other of its type , the engineers report , and is the only French instrument the company allows to be used . Employees are instructed to report any " alien " instruments and the Vile company then orders them removed . In investigating faulty transmission the officials first determine whether the subscriber has an outlaw instrument . Fifteen of these , dis- covered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones were elaborate ones and cost a hundred dollars each . The owner cleverly sent them to a branch office in Oklahoma , where they are not against the rules . Damning PARLOR groups about town have recently been thrown into confusion and dismay by the latest indoor pastime  --  reading handwriting . A book on the game is out , and the character delineation is arrived at by comparing a specimen of one 's handwriting with various pages in the book and working toward the final verdict by a process of elimination . Certain peculiarities of forming letters or spacing words indicate certain traits , which arc traced by key numbers . Many persons , after a life of comparative calm , develop sudden weaknesses in the presence of friends , and some , we are told , have taken to doctoring their writing to avoid suspicion . There is unquestionably something to the game : we were lured into a session the other night , and our carefully modulated script showed strong tendencies toward insanity . Gourmet NEW YORK scarcely looked up from its curds and whey when not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared an impressive monument to Anthelme Brillat-Savarin , the most celebrated gourmet the world has ever produced . Yet those of us who can remember as far back as 1794 and there are only a few of us left ) recall that the gentleman was at that time an ill-appreciated resident in our midst and found several of his most highly prized recipes here . He has had a monument here for many a day  --  a cafe named in his honor  --  and on several exclusive shelves are to be found copies of his most famous book , " Physiologic du Goat , " a curious bob-tailed autobiography which seems to have been written largely with knife and fork . His New York experiences are set forth largely in a line of asterisks , indicating that they are best forgotten . They came with his lean years and lean years are not to be remembered by an epicure . He came in 1794 . The year before , he had been mayor of his native Belley . Then had come the Reign of Terror and his flight , first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of food , Brillat-Savarin fortunately had also some knowledge of the violin . He obtained employment as a fiddler in the old John Street Theatre , the one George Washington attended when he was a resident in our midst . There he spent his evenings . By day he tried to add to his funds as a teacher of French , Spanish and German . His earnings , however , were small and when Robespierre toppled he was glad enough to go back home , where he became a magistrate and an author . Perhaps his two greatest gastronomic discoveries here were turkey and Welsh rabbit . He took recipes regarding each back with him . To turkey he gave great space in his volume , even setting down a minute account of a turkey hunt in Connecticut in which he participated . He tells , too , of the early American experiences with ice cream , recounting that one Captain Collet " gained a good deal of money " in 1795 by making ices and sherbets for the inhabitants , the author adding that it was " amusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His most fascinating American account , however , is of an international drinking contest in which he , the Viscount de la Massue , Jean-Rudolphe Fehr , a Mr. Wilkinson , a Jamaica planter , and another Englishman indulged at a tavern operated by a Mr. Little in New York . They started on Claret and went progressively to port , Madeira , rum , raspberry brandy , and finally punch . The French won . At the end , the narrator says , Mr. Wilkinson rolled under the table and his unidentified colleague 's head " smoked like a boiling caldron . " The gourmet 's visit came , of course , before the Constitution was old enough to have amendments . Rite IT appears that the Red Caps at the Grand Central have a code of little amenities . The other day one of them dropped an armful of luggage , put a penny in a paper-cup machine , filled the cup with water and placed it carefully on the floor before a small black cat . To the traveller thus delayed the porter explained that this cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably founded in superstition , calls for giving it a drink always in a new cup .
