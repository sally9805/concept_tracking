txt When the Navy Department today took steps to make every effort to salvage the submarine S-51 , very little hope was felt by department officials that the six officers and twenty-eight enlisted men who went down with her when she was struck by the steamer City of Rome . off Block Island . last night , will be rescued alive . But faint as- the hope is , the department , according to what was said there and the orders Issued with a view to bringing the vessel to the surface without delay , is utilizing all means at its command to overlook no chance of succoring the mitring members of the crew of the S-51 . Charts of the locality where the submarine went down show that the bottom of the ocean there is 120 feet below the ' surface and the S-51 was built to stand a pressure at a - depth of 200 feet , so in that fact lies the possibility that she is holding together in spite of having received a heavy blow from the City of Rome 's bow . The question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open when she sank , and whether interior bulkheads of watertight compartments were closed when she began to go down . Naval officers on duty at the department assume that an officer was on the bridge when the submarine was struck by the City of Rome . As all officers are missing , it is also assumed that the officer on the bridge jumped through the hatchway , closed it and went ' down with the ship . It is probable , according to the Navy- Department view , that he gave orders for closing the watertight bulkheads as soon as the collision occurred . Oxygen Enough for 9 Days . If such was the case , the officers and crew who went down in the 5-51 , or most of them , may still be alive . One theory is that if any men were in the forward quarters for the crew they may have been suffocated by gases , something , it is believed , not likely , to have happend in other parts of the ship , including the after-quarters for the crew . Officials said there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those on board for three days . With that time limit in mind , the Navy Department nag urged its ' officers near and on the scene of the disaster to Ilse every effort to bring the S-51 to the surface . Divers are at work around the sunken hull , but without- having been able to obtain communication with those inside , according to latest information reaching the Navy Department . Some tugs and other vessels are at the point where the submarine went down ; others are on their way . Information given the , Navy Department is that a weight of , 250 tons can be lifted by the vessels sent to the rescue . When the submarine F-4 went down near Honolulu in March , 1915 , the Navy Department did not have at hand the machinery that is now available for rescue work in connection with S-51 , and it was impossible to raise the F-4 in time to avert the loss ' of the lives of all on board . But a deadweight of 250 tons was lifted from a depth of 305 feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faint hope that the S-51 may be brought to the surface before the lives of all in her are extinct . It was apparent from what Secretary WiUnit said , in commenting.on the loss of the S-51 , that he felt the City of Rome should have remained at the place where she collided with the submarine . Reports to the Navy Department indicated that through the departure of the . City of Rome there had been some difficulty on the part of the ships hurried to the scene in locating the spot where the S-51 went down . At the same time Secretary Wilbur emphasized that he did not care to utt.u. one word of criticism in connection with the disaster . He satd that he would suspend judgment until all the facts were at hand . But Ito intended , he added , in obtaining those facts , to follow along the line of ascertaining how the collision came about and why the City of Rome proceeded on her way so soon . It was conceded at the Navy Department that there may have been a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the necessity of getting to a port where the three rescued enlisted men of the S-51 could receive hospital treatment . But all this would be shown in due course , said Secretary Wilbur , although he did not fail to mention in connection with it that he intended to bring to light everything concerning the actions of the City of Rome prior to and after the collision . Rear Admiral H. H. Christy , in charge of the naval control force , with headquarters at New London , is in charge of the work of salvaging 5-51 . ' His latest report to the Navy Department sent by radio from the scene of the collision , reads : " Diver reports S-51 resting on keel , inclined to port . Attempt to communicate ? with crew not successful . Large hole in port sale abaft conning tower . " It was this last news that a diver had been unable to communicate with those imprisoned in the sunken vessel that led officials in the Navy Department to take a rather pessimistic view of the chance of saving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rescue boats will be to attempt to raise the bow of the submarine above the surface of the water . The submarine is believed to have been struck in the section where the engines arc , and naval officials are of the opinion that if the water-tight doors were closed in time the bow would bo intact . It was suggested at the Navy Department that owing to the position of the two vessels at the time the collision occurred it might have been impossible for the City of Rome to have seen the lights on the submarine owing to their spseial disposition , which renders them invisible to a vessel approaching at an angle un the port side . Officials were disposed . however , to lay the responsibility for the accident to the commander of the City of Rome , stating that the submarine was entitled to the right of way according to seafaring regulations and an approach to her from the port side bythe City of Rome was contrary to fixed rules of navigation . Naval officials pointed out that a ship having another Ehlp on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine , has the right of way and shoal. ! maintain its course and speed , Furthermore , it was said that any ship coming from astern , as did the City of Rome , should keep clear of an overtaken Secretary Wilbur expressed little optimism this afternoon over the fate of the men aboard the sunken submarine . but said that every effort would be made on the part of the navy to raise tire bow of the vessel and attempt to save the lives of those aboard . He said that a board of inquiry would not be appointed until more was known of the circumstances of the accident . Nothing had been heard at the Navy Department concerning the condition of the three men whose lives were saved , Alfred Geier , electrician ; Dewey George Kilo , engine:nen , and Michael Secunda Lira , eman- , but naval officials am inclined to doubt the report that they made their escape through the conning tower . Their account of their escape it desired by the department , as it is be ? lieved it will help to shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fated submarine . According to advices received at the Navy Department , the position of the sunken sumbarine is fourteen mile ; east-northeast of the southeast light on Block Island . Additional divers from : New London , with all necessary goal for salvaging operations , are ready ai New London this evening , but the lift . ing barges will not reach the scene of the accident until noon tomorrow . VESSELS SENT TO RESCUE . Ten Salvage Craft Dispatched From Brooklyn Navy Yard . Ten relief vessels were dispatched from the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn yesterday to help the submerged submarine 5-51 . The first to leave was the salvage ship Falcon , which left Brooklyn at 9:10 A. M. Formerly a mine sweeper , she carried derricks and other materials , besides three divers experienced in deep sea work . Capable of 12 knots an hour , she left at full speed . Lieutenant Henry H. Hartley was in command ' aria Commander E. Ellsberg of the Naval Construction Corps , an expert on salvage and rescue work , was on board . Later in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  left for the scene of the accident . The Sagamore had in tow a " cutting barge " with divers on board . The minesweeper Iuka , a Merritt , Chapman &; Scott wrecking tug , and a derrick left during the afternoon . The Merritt , Chapman &; Scott salvage ship Resolute left New York at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon in response to a request from Rear Admiral de Steieuer , commandant of the Boston Naval District . . aboard the Resolute is a large crew of trained men and a number of deep sett divers , among them the men who brought up the F-4 in Honolulu Bay several years ago , from a depth of 306 feet , more than twice as deep as the water in which the 5-51 went down . The salvage vessel was hurriedly equipped today with several new diving devices which are expected to aid greatly in her task , among them a mixture of helium and oxygen gas to be breathed by the divers instead of ordinary air , enabling them to stay down longer and come up quicker ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have just been used successfully in Lake Michigan to make a diving examination of the wreck of the steamship Lakeland , for the purposes of determining why she sank . The lamps throw a very powerful beam of light , about four times as strong as that of a locomotive headlight , for a distance of approximately forty feet , according to their makers . A special hardened glass bulb enables the lamps to burn right in the water , without any protection , and a parabolic reflector combined with a concentrated filament results in a light as good as ordinary daylight , the makers say . The Navy Yard at Brooklyn received its first word of the accident at 2:15 o'clock ' yesterday morning , when it intercepted a message from the Chief of Naval Operations at the submarine base in New London , Conn. , to naval headquarters in Manhattan . At 5 A. M. New London notified the Navy Yard directly . The time taken to start the Falcon for the , scene af the disaster was used for ooslin aa4 nuiPigns fits Wads -  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
