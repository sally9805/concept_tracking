THE odds ought to be eight hundred to one an Mr. Walker , not eight to one . It may he true that in the time he devotes to civic affairs he personally does little , beyond changing a police commissioner and handling such matters of broad policy , but his attitude toward accomplishment does not seem to he antagonistic and somebody , we know not who  --  the borough presidents , or the bosses of Tammany , or the civil-service engineers in the Department of Plant and Structures , possibly  --  gets some things done , subways built , tunnels dug , streets cleaned , asphalt laid  --  not enough , Allah knows , but some . The city struggles on . Meantime Walker does things of infinitely greater importance . He lives . He is gay , carefree , obviously happy . He makes whoopee , stays up late , rises late . He dresses snappy and talks snappy . He dines with the Biddies and is photographed with Colleen Moore . Thus he has become the symbol of some odd million glamour-starved souls numbly seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxy 's , Babe Ruth 's home-run score , Ziegfeld 's chorus , the tabloids , the Edison test , the Snooks case , or Lindbergh 's or Rockefeller 's private lives . He 's five hundred years ahead of his time . Or maybe only one hundred , at the rate we 're going . ASIDE from a few scattered cases of nervous breakdown , we have not noticed that this mad age is any harder on people 's constitutions than previous periods in the world 's history . There are times , though , when one 's mental balance is maintained only by reverting to the more soothing influences of a bygone day . This was the case with a man we know who became very fond of modern music  --  the George Antheil variety , which is full of dissonances and racket of one sort and another . He spent hours studying it and listening to it . After a bit , he got sick . His physician , finding no pathological weakness , concluded that the modern music was getting him down . The doctor arranged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice old love songs each day . The man 's recovery was rapid . ANTE advocate a return to the old-V V fashioned letterhead . The modern letterhead is too chaste , too restrained , not interesting . The reason we happen to bring up this vexing subject is because we 've just received a letter from the Horlick 's Malted Milk Corporation , of Racine , Wisconsin ( the first we ever received from them , incidentally ) , and there , folks , is a letterhead ! We spent fully ten minutes in silent admiration of the scene  --  a pastoral , covering nearly half the page , depicting a sweet-faced dairymaid fully two inches high , her right arm around the neck of a Horlick cow , her left arm holding a can of milk , all about her daisies  --  myriads of them  --  and in the background a rippling stream along whose bank four other cows and a calf are grazing , while beyond are harvest fields full of ripe grain being gathered into sheaves ; in a peaceful valley to the left are the laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mind you , as plain as the nose on your face ; each cow as motherly as a cow can be and still stay in the picture . That 's what we call a letterhead ! The scene so fascinated us that ( come to think of it ) we never got around to reading the letter  --  which is an added argument in favor of going back to the old-fashioned letterhead . N authority tells us that soon ( within eighteen months , he says optimistically ) the airplane will be only ten per cent pilot and ninety per cent airplane .

Painting on the Wall ANDSCAPES and other scenes painted on the exterior walls of buildings are not common any more but they are no longer a great novelty , what with those put up around roof gardens , children 's playgrounds , etc . Gay decorations of the kind we mean ? not primarily advertising signs  --  adorn the walls adjacent to the new Sherry Building in Madison Avenue . Members of the older generation say that the credit for originating this kind of mural goes to the late Mr. Lyman G. Bloomingdale , founder of Bloomingdale 's . He got the idea while travelling in Europe . He did n't see such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so impressed by the quaintness of Nuremberg that upon his return he engaged an artist from the honorable sign-painting firm of Disosway &; Fisher , of Brooklyn , still in existence , by the way , to reproduce some of the old-world beauties on the west wall of his store . That was in 1904 . Mr. Lyman Bloomingdale died before the completion of the work but his son , Samuel , carried it out . Completed , it attracted a good deal of attention , being the first of its kind . It was a m  --  lange of marble terraces , leafy trees , old Nuremberg houses , a sylvan bridge , and a fountain in which two marble cherubs struggled over the possession of a marble umbrella . This striking scene , which occupied several thousand square feet of brick , bore the simple legend , " All Cars Transfer at Bloomingdale 's . " The bright colors were refreshed every year and the thing could be seen for a mile or more in those days of fine visiblity . About fifteen years ago , Bloomingdale 's tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . They painted out the old sign a n d executed another , the one depicting a crosssection of the interior of the store , which has been there since . It is less exotic but is thought to have more saleS appeal . It has been remarked that two deer heads painted into the scene seem extraneous . These were a little joke of Samuel 's on his brother Hiram . Hiram was quite a huntsman and the deer heads represent a pair he shot about the time the sign was made and of which he often spoke . All this is timely now because the mural is soon to disappear , obliterated by the new building which will rise beside the store . Bloomingdale 's is proud , however , of the fact that it originated this kind of art , even if it really never got very far , and also that it was the first concern to give away big striped sun-shades to the drivers of horse-drawn vehicles .

Cigar House CIGAR smoking is another thing that is n't what it was once , but according to Mr. Dick Steere , who has been the tobacco specialist at Park &; Tilford 's for twenty-five years , there are still many connoisseurs who take cigars quite seriously , find fault with them , sigh over them , and who can tell much by the color of the leaf , its odor , and its feel . Among the most notable experts he knows are Mr. 0 . L. Dommerich , of 50 East Sixty-ninth Street , Captain David Hanrahan , of Park Avenue , Dr. P. %V . Nathan , of 110 East Seventy-eighth Street , Mr. Louis Shour of Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bar Harbor . Mr. Steere presides over one of several elaborate humidors in the city . It is deep in the cellar under the Park &; Tilford store in Fifty-seventh Street . The walls are panelled with Spanish cedar , behind which is , first , a lining of cork and , second , a false wall of plaster . This combination makes the best town house for a cigar . The interior is lined with shelves piled high with cigars , some rare imported ones in especially fancy boxes . Above the shelves are some seventy-five private lockers rented by serious smokers who have their cigars made to their special blend a thousand or more at a time . Mr. Steere cares for these and delivers them to homes as wanted . The humidor is kept at seventy degrees and two machines pump moisture into it . The worm , bane of the cigar , has been overcome by a special steaming process . The most expensive cigar on hand for sale is the Hoyo Monterrey . The ordinary size costs a dollar each . There is an eighteen-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chicago millionaire bought a hundred of these for his yacht .

Violin Maker IN an old brownstone in Eighty-sixth Street near Second Avenue , as a great many of the musicians of the town know , Paul Glaesel and his two brothers make and mend violins . It was related in these columns that but one music-box repairer is left in this great city , and but one firm still in the business of decorating shaving mugs . Unlike these industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred violin-making and repairing places . The Glasel shop , usually filled with musicians come in to talk things over , is as popular as any . It is a maze of instruments . Violins and cellos in various stages of ill health hang down from hooks in the ceiling , or lie on shelves . flair for the bows is stretched across wooden frames that look as though they might he used for old-fashioned weaving . Hundreds of bridges hang on the walls . Paul , the shop 's master craftsman , a shortish , good-natured man in his middle years , is usually to be seen bending over a violin or cello which is held in a special kind of flat frame , its inwards exposed . He fits and glues with the delicacy of a surgeon . Mr. Glaesel has been at his craft here for twenty years , but he began work long before that , when he was fourteen , in Markneukirchen , Saxony , where he was horn . That is about the age all violin makers go into the trade there  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him . Markneukirchen is noted for its violin makers . People come or send there from all over for violins , cellos , parts of instruments . Almost all of the men in the town of eight thousand are in the business , and the women occasionally assist , too , in such lighter work as sorting the hair for the bows . Mr. Glaesel has a book containing the names of the great violin makers since the fifteenth century and there are eight hundred from Markne ukirchen , twenty of them members of his own family . As for the making of new violins , it is all done by hand , and thousands of instruments are turned out in the shops of New York . Much of the wood is imported , and there is no such thing as a domestic bridge , it seems . Some cheap violins are termed factory-made , but they are so designated because the whole instrument is not made by one man but is assembled by workers who specialize in various parts and turn them out in large quantities . The violin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together once a year at a picnic on Long Island . Tale from the Hills AGENTLEMAN re- turned from the South tells a story about a colored family of rural Georgia that for years had saved up trading stamps and finally accumulated enough to send to Atlanta for a fine , ornate cuckoo clock which they had long before picked out in the catalogue . It was duly received and placed on the mantel , the only fitting place in the one-room house , and to make room for it , the trusty rifle of Pappy Jackson , head of the family , had to be removed . He grumbled about this , but finally found a place for the gun over the doorway . The Jacksons , like their neighbors , had always told time by the sun , accurately enough for all practical purposes . They had never seen a clock before and had no idea what one was for . But this clock was ornamental and they were pleased , and they audibly admired it from time to time . One day a stray salesman for something came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its purpose . He wound it up and left it ticking , much to the amazement and satisfaction of the entire family , all save Poppy Jackson , who was absent at the time , He returned a short while later , unfortunately just at the hour . The clock opened and out popped a small bird who chirped at him several times . He took his gun down from its pegs and shot the bird , and that was the end of the dock . The gentleman who relates this anecdote deposes and says that it is true and that , moreover , in the same village be came upon a small colored girl whom he heard respond to the name of Corliss . Inquiring of her mother as to how she came to select this name , he learned that on the day she was born a new sewage pump had been installed in the town and , it being named Corliss , the new babe was christened after it . Animal Insurance POINT having been made of the fact that the gorilla- which came here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , one of our restless odd-fact informants got to work and dug up the news that a special company handles that kind of thing in this country , the Hartford Live Stock Insurance Company . Coverage is for mortality only , not accident . Many policies are written on polo ponies and blooded cattle , the rote being from five to seven per cent of the value . Circus animals are not considered good risks because of the transportation hazard . No policies are accepted on dogs because their life is too variable . Babel OUR story about the shopkeeper who ?  - -  .1 got his tin tacks confused with Tintex , owing to his nationality , brings a report from a gentleman who motored in from Greenwich last Sunday evening . He stopped at a wayside refreshment stand which an old Jewish gentleman was attending . " White Rock , " he ordered .

" New Fish for Old IVE had a lucky break when we V we to see the new fish at the Aquarium . A large fuzzy man in his shirt-sleeves startled the murmuring crowds by beginning to sing " The Sidewalks of New York " at the top of his voice to the two sea lions . He was hustled out by a burly guard . " Politics , " explained another attendant to us , wiggling a forefinger at his brow . The sea lions arc from California , Hoover 's state , and it boldly says so on their placard , and that angered the fuzzy man , a staunch old Smith supporter , and started him singing .

" Ourself , we saw an old economics professor of ours among the orange tile-fish ( their skin is sometimes used to scratch matches on ) . The groupers and the angel-fish attract the largest galleries . They are very colorful . One species is a bright lovely blue , such as we have never seen before on sea or land . The color schemes in the recently re-arranged tanks might have been supervised by Ziegfeld or Earl Carroll . Indeed , we think they were . A placard on the Nassau groupers ' tank , for example , says that they can change color rapidly ? " as many as eight different phases of coloration in as many minuets . " The groupers execute , of course , no minuets minutes was the word some-one had in mind  --  but the confusion is rather pleasant .

There are some porcupine fish which puff up and shoot out prickly spines , and some swelifish which can inflate to twice their normal size in order to come up to the surface and see what is going on . A variety of puffers used to he plentiful in New York harbor , but they are n't any more , possibly because the novelty of coming up and seeing the same old harbor has worn off . Virtually all the new fish were caught off the Bahamas . They take the place of a number of fish which died in the Aquarium . While the newcomers are southerners , a few are occasionally found in the ocean up this way . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The green morays , which we always visit when we go to the Aquarium , are still alive . One or two of them are in their third year here . Morays are desperate , eel-like fish , uglier than snakes .

The Changeless ALITTLE while ago we reported that Mr. Norbert Kates is still carried in the telephone book although he ordered his phone taken out six years ago and has been in Europe ever since . Now we are told that Mr. J. C. Hammond is listed as living at 41 Monroe Boulevard , Long Beach , although he sold the house at that address and moved away fourteen years ago .

" So that there would he no mistake about it they went further and became specific ? " taller than the Chrysler Building . " This naturally led to difficulties and these were approximately cubed by the fact that Mr. William Van Alen had been commissioned to design both buildings . Never , so far as he knew , had an architect been placed in such an awkward position before . Things have been going along in his office strangely ? staff divided into two , each side commanded to secrecy , secret codes , two kinds of hog-Latin employed , secret passageways , workmen pledged . All most complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but observers think it likely that when both buildings are done Mr. Chrysler will probably release a tenthousand-ton , collapsible , unfolding , one-man top on his building and be countered by No. 1 Wall Street with a semi-floating Zeppelin superstructure , and that the duel will then begin all over again . Reports from Tasmania are that everything is quiet down there . Like Old Times A l interne says this happened  --  and you know interns .

He could no longer chant " First floor  --  ladies ' hats , trimmings , lingeries , notions , etc. " and he had rather liked that .
