txt LIGHT does not flash everywhe.e at the same Instant . You have , no doubt , often seen the steam from a distant whistle jet up and then , several second after , hear the note . Sound is carried by waves in the air . It travels a little over 1,000 feet per second , or slower than most bullets ay . Light is also a vibration , but it travels so fast that . a beam would shoe , - a distance eY over seven times around the world in a second . The speed of such rapid moving vibrations is naturally most difficult to learn . In former years the velocity of light eras determined by watching the moons of the planet Jupiter . This far oft world has four satellites circling about him . Some of them are eclipsed in his shadow or pass between the earth and him almost every night . Astronomers made tables showing when eclipses should occur , much like the tables in an almanac . But Jupiter 's moons for a long time would n't keep to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last they realized that light itself does not flash here and on Jupiter at the same instant . When the planet was farthest away the eclipses began and ended 16 minutes and 16 seconds late . This quarter of an hour was evidently the time required for light to cross the earth 's orbit . The light time between here and the sun is 8 minutes 8 seconds , , and as the distance is 93,000,000 miles , we find that light travels 186,000 miles per second . Celestial distances are commonly measured in light years , or the number of miles that light will move over in one year of time . Miles , and even millions of miles , are far too insig ? log on the problem . Light beams from a narrow source are permitted to shine on a mirror sot on a- wheel , from whence they are reflected to a second more distant mirror set as far away as possible . From this second glass the waves retrace their course , are reflected by the mirror on the wheel a second time , pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
