In spite of almost daily political disturbances , the opera season closed with its usual brilliance . Opera in Egypt is state organized and state subsidized . The Royal Opera House was built by Khedive Ismail as part of the celebrations in connection with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 . Verdi wrote an opera for its opening-Aida , and ever since Aida has opened the Cairo season . Since the war the visiting companies have been chiefly Italian . It is from the business community that the greater part of the opera audiences are drawn . Egyptians are generally indifferent . Italians , Greeks , Syrians , but above all , Jews , support the opera . Puccini , once supreme with Egyptian audiences , is losing his hold . Next to Aida , the greatest success this season was Mefistofeles , the title role being magnificently sung and acted by Masini Pieralli . German opera is expected next winter .
