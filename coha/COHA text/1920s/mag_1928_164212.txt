Should the U. S. grant independence to the Philippine Islands and then , after six years , withdraw that boon , Filipinos could scarcely become more vexed than were Egyptians last week . <P> The Independent Kingdom of Egypt was proclaimed in 1922 , supplanting the British Protectorate established when Egypt was snatched from Turkey by the Allies in 1914 . Last week fat King Fuad , a placid puppet of Great Britain , signed two decrees . One suspended the Egyptian Chamber of Deputies and Senate for " three years , or longer if circumstances shall so require . " The second decree suspended ' ' indefinitely " Article XV of the Egyptian Constitution wherein is guaranteed free speech and freedom of the press . <P> Thus by a single coup de politique the Great Power whose name stands axiomatically for a free Parliament and free speech , deprived Egyptians of all parliamentary or democratic expression and gagged them into nonresistance . <P> His Majesty Ahmed Fuad of course declared that he was acting by advice of Prime Minister Mohamed Mahmud Pasha . London correspondents even learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by the developments in Egypt . The transparent facts of the case appear when it is recalled that Prime Minister Mahmud Pasha commands the support of exactly 28 Deputies in the Egyptian Chamber of 210-that is to say he does not represent the country at all . The previous Prime Minister , Mustafa iNahas Pasha , recently and curtly dismissed by King Fuad , retains the support of 170 Deputies . Last week the members of his party , the Wafd , were forbidden to hold any political meetings whatsoever in the Egyptian provinces . <P> British Justification . It is not suppositious but certain that if Britain 's King-Emperor ever tries to nullify the powers and liberties of his subjects , as did King Fuad last week , he will face instant Revolution . <P> However , Egyptians are not Britons . They are a weak people , for centuries the vassals of conquerors . If Great Britain abandoned them to true independence , they would again fall prey to some other Power-which Power would then control the Suez Canal , the chief route to India , vital artery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Office has honestly and without hypocrisy proclaimed that control of Egypt is , for the British Empire , a measure of self defense ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . <P> The present crisis was caused by the obstinate though patriotic refusal of recent Prime Minister Nahas Pasha to ape his King in the sorry but inevitable role of British puppet ( TIME , April 2 ; May 14 ) . <P> Assassination of individual Britons in Egypt is the one weapon left to individual Egyptians ; but after the assassination of British Major General Sir Lee Oliver Fitzmaurice Stack ( TIME , Dec. i , 1924 ) the British Empire demanded and received from Egypt an indemnity of 500,000 ( about $2,300,000 ) , together with other humiliating capitulations .
