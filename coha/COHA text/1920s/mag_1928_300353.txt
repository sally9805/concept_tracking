Politics is a fluid science and so is bookkeeping . Mixed together in unknown quantities the two will generate various reactions , sometimes quiet and invisible , sometimes violently explosive . The final solution usually defies exact analysis . <P> Andrew Mellon 's bookkeeping has been widely and highly praised for seven and three-quarters years . It has also had its detractors . The Mellon estimates of Treasury surplus have been wrong often and far enough to cause some people to suggest that the Secretary of the Treasury 's calculations are not purely arithmetic , that they are sometimes tinctured with policy if not politics . In his own party , Mr. Mellon has been frequently flayed by Michigan 's Senator Couzens . Democrats in the House have kept up an intermittent fire . Last week , Democrat John Nance Garner of Texas , minority leader of the House Ways &; Means ( revenues ) Committee , renewed the attack . <P> Last June , President Coolidge announced that he was advised there might be a Treasury deficit of 94 millions in fiscal 1929 . When Congress met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be a Treasury surplus of 37 millions in fiscal 1929 . Six days later , President Coolidge announced he had been re-advised , that the Treasury had underestimated by 75 millions the amount it would have to pay in tax refunds . The Treasury was thus seen facing a deficit again . <P> During the six days between prospective surplus and prospective deficit , the House had voted various appropriations , including a loan of 12 millions to Greece . <P> Upon the revised list of tax refunds submitted to Congress for approval was an item of 15 millions for the U. S. Steel Corporation . <P> It was upon these two items-Greek loan and Steel refund-that Democrat Garner pounced in a speech designed to embarrass Mr. Mellon thoroughly . Said Mr. Garner : " In order to induce you to pass it Greek loan , he Mr. Mellon made a misleading-and the facts show , it seems to me-a deliberately false statement as to . . . the prospects of our Treasury . <P> " . . . If I were President and he deliberately fixed it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I would ask for his resignation . <P> " Gentlemen , this is a fraud . Any time you give me information in order to pass or defeat legislation and that information is incorrect , that is fraud . . . . <P> " Immediately after the election and after permitting the President to misrepresent the situation to Congress , you come in and ask for refunds on claims that have been pending eleven years . Is there nothing which indicates that there must be some kind of manipulation about this ? " <P> The Steel Corp . ' s claims , and claims similar , for taxes dating back to 1917 , were not made until 1923 or later because the claimants had not known there was any chance of recovery . The claims have not yet been paid because of the intricacy of opposing contentions , the delays of tax appeal . Democrat Garner wanted to know why Mr. Mellon could not have delayed such refunds a little longer . <P> " Why did n't he do it ? I do not know , but . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance .
