On a hot day last week , a small baldish man named Paul Block announced he had bought the Brooklyn ( N. Y. ) Standard Union . The price was $1,000,000 or thereabouts . For the Standard Union it was a tidy sum , because for all its 65 years of distinguished history , the paper was losing money at the rate of about $25,000 dollars a month . <P> When the deal had been made public , when the Standard Union had carried polite letters of congratulation from the country 's celebrities , Publisher Block gave a theatre party . He bought out the house for a performance of George White 's " Scandals , " and asked his friends to help celebrate . Among the guests were Polar Pilgrim Byrd , Aviatrix Earhart , Mauler Dempsey . Both the purchase and the party were typical of Publisher Block . <P> Like another newspaper chain owner , famed Frank Ernest Gannett , Publisher Block was trained in the quiet city of Elmira , in the " southern tier " of New York State . He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did odd jobs , ran errands for the Sunday Telegram . <P> Thirty-three years ago he quit Elmira and advanced confidently upon Manhattan , to the offices of a Frank Richardson , then acting as the New York representative of many a country newspaper . Young Block became adept in garnering rich advertising contracts . By 1898 he felt able to start out in business for himself . Ten years later , he bought the Newark Star-Eagle at a receiver 's sale for $235,000 . It required all his savings in cash , some $125,000 . <P> In 1910 he gathered in the Toledo ( O. ) Blade ; the Duluth Herald he bought in 1918 . Last year , he negotiated a shrewd deal in Pittsburgh , where he bought both the morning Post and the evening Sun , then traded the Sun to Publisher William Randolph Hearst for the morning Gazette-Times , then consolidated the two morning papers into the enormously profitable Post-Gazette . With the Standard-Union , Publisher Block owns five daily newspapers . <P> From time to time , he has owned many another . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Mail , swallowed by Frank R. Munsey ; the Detroit Journal , swallowed by Hearst ; the Memphis News-Scimitar ; a paper in Lancaster , Pa . These he bought and then sold . But he rejects vigorously the idea that he is a newspaper broker . " It is a good business , " he says , " but it is not my business . " He sold the Mail , he explains , because neither he nor his partner , Henry L. Stoddard , had the money to carry on . The Journal was a sacrifice to a Hearst scare in Detroit . Neither the News-Scimitar nor the Lancaster paper interested him . The one he bought to settle a debt ; the other to give a friend a job . <P> But Brooklyn is another matter . It is near home , available for his experiments . His plans for the Standard Union are expansive and expensive . He has made a bet with himself that he can make the paper break even by January .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
