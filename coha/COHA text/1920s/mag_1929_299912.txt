( See front cover ) <P> The father , brethren and children of Electric Light will shortly begin celebrating handsomely its 50th anniversary . <P> The father , Thomas Alva Edison , will remain at his rubber experiments in Fort Myers , Fla. , for the actual anniversary does not come until Oct. 21 and there are many things which Mr. Edison , aged 82 , wants to crowd into his remaining years . <P> The brethren , members of the National Electric Light Association , were beginning last week to assemble in Atlantic City , N. J. , for their annual convention and , incidentally , an electrical 75th birthday party for the city . <P> The children of Light-all U. S. citizens within reach of the beams of an incandescent bulb-will be included in the festivities by electrical galaxies on White Ways from Squeedunk to Broadway . <P> W. D'Arcy Ryan , who is to General Electric Co.

Again and again will be told the U. S. folk-legend of the newsboy , born in Milan , Ohio , who built a great fame out of such invisibilities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pending the full blaze of the Golden Jubilee , retrospective minds returned to years between the first spark of Edisonian genius and the visible glow of its social application . Between laboratory and layman stand innumerable middlemen , not the least important of whom are usually a few bankers . Inventor Edison at 35 was by no means financially ignorant . He understood that money , though social rather than " natural , " is a force not unlike electricity , with sources and laws of its own . A respecter of such forces , he turned to financial experts in 1882 , when it was time to incorporate the first Edison Electric Light Co.
