A vice that is frankly a vice can al than we are that the virtues we are so ways be put up with , because it offers keen about practising ? and making no defense . It is every good citizen 's other people practise ? arc virtues at all . job to see that he and his are not con I am not desirous of " indicting a taminated thereby . Perhaps the most whole nation , " particularly when that insidious vices are those that began as nation is my own . Nor do I suppose virtues , and have been sentimentalized that we are unique in " invasion of long after they became ugly . It all goes privacy , " or even in sentimentality . back , of course , to the middle way , and The yellow press is the yellow press in the golden mean , and authentic temper whatever civilized country . Also , the ance : all the old classical admonitions people who read the yellow press . It is to the effect that moderation is the not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . Even which we have to fear , as the pink-andmoderation in sin , I take it , to some of white periodicals which are all for godliness . For the important thing , as we were saying , is to learn to recognize those virtues which have gone rotten . The obvious vices can more easily take care of themselves . No student of history ? even the casual amateur ? can fail to realize that human nature can pretty well always be counted on to behave , under the same stimuli , in the same fashion . We gape at the marvels of Tut-ankh-Amen 's tomb , and feel a curious surprise that there should have been such a civilization as that three thousand years ago . It is salutary , no doubt , for us to realize that the ancient Egyptians knew a great deal without having to wait for the twentieth century to tell it to them . Even more salutary would it be for us to realize that , since Egypt went under , and Greece went under , and Rome went under , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have not fiought often enough , perhaps , of that hypothetical New Zealander on Westminster Bridge . We have been too apt , always ? doubtless it was the same in Tut-ankh-Amen 's time ? to think that human nature ( and therefore history ) can or will readily alter its little habits . At the same time there is no doubt that , now and then , an impulse comes into the heart of the race or the nation or the tribe or the community , which is , relatively speaking , new . New , I mean , for that particular human group or human epoch . Such an impulse surely stirred in Europe ? and by contagion in America ? in the eighteenth century . Some people call it " Rousseau , " though there are as many types of romanticism as of grippe . Romanticism , at all events , can hit the human organism anywhere ; and when practically everyone is infected , the complexity of human nature insures an infinite variety of symptoms and aftereffects . Egotism , humanitarianism , optimism , pragmatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infection can take . Leaving to one side the effects of Rousseau and his followers on politics , literature , and social theory , let us merely note one simple little state of things . Until the Romantics came in and made inquisitiveness decent , we rather admired reticence . We took it , at least , as a man 's right . ( Personally , I love the Romantics , and feel that lyric poetry and impassioned prose are their proper bailiwick . ) What helps it now , that Byron bore , With haughty scorn which mock 'd the smart , Through Europe to the rEtolian shore The pageant of his bleeding heart ? That thousands counted every groan , And Europe made his woe her own ? Well : it does not help now , except for sheer sesthetie delight . The point is that , a century before , Europe would not have counted his every groan . When Pope said that the proper study of mankind is man , he did not mean to " boom " for posterity the pageant of Byron 's bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humani meant to celebrate prophetically the Russian novelists . Somewhere between the middle of the eighteenth and the middle of the nineteenth centuries was born , in the mind of western Europe , " the personal interest . " It began , one supposes , with the excitement of discovering that the fourth estate was human . That that was a happy discovery , no one will question : the results of it were chiefly political ? and usually admirable . In literature , Wordsworth , with his Michaels and Betty Foys and poor Susans ; Burns , with his cotters and Tam o ' Shanters , no doubt helped . Byron 's personal interest was largely confined to very remarkable people ? beginning with himself ; and Shelley never looked , poetically , at human individuals at all . It is absurd to make chronologies ? categories , even ? for this sort of thing , and we shall by no means attempt it . What we can safely say is that the excitement of finding that psychology was not the peculiar possession of the few , and that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world than Pope or Dr. Johnson would have believed , widened out into a greater interest in the psychology of everybody . People began to poke and probe the human soul ? not so much in order to discover more about human nature as to discover more about this or that human being . " Invasion of privacy " had begun , even before the psychologists took over the case system and filed their victims by name in card catalogues . Now , I believe , some people want to finger-print us all at birth , for our fascinating researches into human nature have convinced various publicists that we are alI potential criminals . Sympathy and the desire to understand other people , the better to help them , are originally , I am forced to believe , virtues . But the desire to understand may ? if we do not keep our sense of values ? turn into mere inordinate curiosity ; and if you once get the taste for publicity , you arc apt to desire it for its own sake , not for mere redress of wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt the " news-sheets " are largely to blame . But they can have been only accessories after the fact , for no one would read all this personal stuff if it did not minister to some appetite of his own . If we would call ourselves abominably inquisitive , and let it go at that , it would not matter so much . But we have come to feel that there is something virtuous in our desire to investigate personalities . No one is ashamed of feeling a " personal interest " in a stranger , or of wanting " the personal touch " in his dealings with him . The English-speaking world worried along pretty well for two centuries with the plays of Shakespeare : people read them , memorized them , delighted in them . It remained for us modern folk to publish manifold interpretations of the Sonnets , scandalous or other ; and to make Stratford hideous with trippers . Trying to discover " the man behind the book " is an entirely modern pastime . Shakespeare is apparently safe ; though one can not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a mere attempt on the part of baffled and maddened inquisitors to ascribe the authorship of the plays to some one about whom they can learn biographical details . It is probably incredible to them that a man could be satisfied to leave Shakespeare 's plays behind him without leaving a diary as well . Every little while one sees in the newspapers a pathetic request from some one for letters of such and such a person of whom he or she is writing a biography ; and often the proposed subject is a person of whom you and I can not imagine wishing to read the biography in any circumstances . There are two kinds of biography a sane man welcomes : that which deals with a truly extraordinary or amusing mundane experience ; and that which deals with a man so important that anything concerning him is of public interest . Otherwise , the Dictionary of National Biography and its equivalents are quite enough . I leave out the folk who are sufficiently significant to a particular sect or group ? often religious ? to make an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , there must of course be a supply ; and no doubt there is always a sectarian market for the life of a bishop or a missionary . I would not , myself , for anything , have missed the life of Mary StessOr of Calabar ? though it was evidently written by , and for , the narrowest type of Scotch Presbyterian . But it is safe to say that the biography of a man is not worth while unless impersonal books about the work lie has done are worth while . We ought to get many more critical studies of men 's achievements than we do biographies . But do we ? Not only are we deluged with the " life and letters " sort of thing , but we get incredible volumes of reminiscence . If some one of no importance has shaken hands with several people of slight importance , he makes a book out of those gestures . We were reproached once for asking " what porridge had John Keats ? " instead of re-reading Endyntion : but now we are expected to he interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently are . Once , biographies were sequent upon death and a decent interval thereafter . Now the living write their own reminiscences ? and sometimes write them very young . Mrs. Asquith is by no means unique . All sorts of people are telling , in the magazines and between book covers , everything praiseworthy or striking that they can remember about themselves . The curious thing is that we are supposed to be interested ? and doubtless are , for editors are a canny race ? in intimate information about people concerning whose achievements , political , artistic , or literary , we really have no interest at all . People will read a chatty article about a man , illustrated with pictures of his home and family , whose own product they would never study or admire , read or look at . " The personal touch . " It is the craving for that , I suppose , that swells the audiences for lecturing foreigners . One quite sees why all the Englishmen come : they enlarge their bank accounts , and they acquire , besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh is supposed to be more likely thereafter to buy his books . Henry James could not now make old Lady Davenant credible . " This evocation of mortality " ( you remember A London Life ) " led Mr. Wendover to ask her if she had known Charles Lamb ; at which she stared for an instant , replying : ' Dear me , no ? one did n't meet him . ' " The point for us about Lady Davenant is not her snobbishness , but her general assumption that one could be interested in a. man 's work without being interested in him . She came before " the personal interest " had seeped through all classes of society . I should not wish to be thought incapable , myself , of ejaculating " Ah , did you once see Shelley plain ? " I would go far ? as would you ? to see Shelley plain , if that were possible . Most of us , I feel sure , took the trouble to lift our eyes to see Marshal Foch go by . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the street to see ? though , I believe , only one . I am glad to have heard , in childhood , the deep , deep notes of George Meredith 's voice , and glad to have sat in quiet tete-d-tete with Henry James in the garden of Lamb House . I have always been sorry for brushing past Catulle Mendes and not knowing it until he had disappeared into nocturnal Paris . I have always been amused ? not annoyed ? by the fact that , quite unintentionally , Mr. Paderewski nearly knocked me down once in Vanderbilt Avenue . But it is hard to imagine oneself caring to " meet , " or listen to , any but the very great , unless they were guaranteed beforehand charming or amusing . Statesmen or politicians , I think , are in a class by themselves , since their power is a public power , and one 's relation to them is precisely the relation of audience to speaker . Invasion of privacy is another matter , and the curiosity which is the cause of it . The proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him : his whole business in life is to get people to listen to him . But the proper thing to do with an artist is to look at his pictures ; with an author , to read his works ; with an inventor , to use his inventions ; with a man of science , to leave him in his laboratory . Not , certainly , to jostle him in the street to get a good look at him ; or to worm one 's way into the confidence of his cook , in order to be able to say authentically whether or not he likes shell-fish . There are a few people , in any generation , so truly great that one 's vision is , in a sense , forever richer for having included them . When we are old , we shall like to think that we once saw Shelley plain . " J'aime en vos yeux touter les mars Wily and rues " says a forgotten French heroine to a forgotten French hero . My own acquaintance is divided between proud people who saw Edwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who saw him have a happy sense that their eyes are different from other eyes . That is all to the good ; and a rich experience of what one 's time offers is one of the things to be most grateful for in life . Nor is hero-worship a thing to be stamped out or frowned upon . About a few people in one 's own generation one has ? legitimately enough , no doubt ? a sense that their maim ( as the anthropologists might say ) is so very great that one must profit by merely seeing them ; that something which has passed through their hands is indefinably and magically precious . It is not curiosity that takes us to stare at Foch : we know well enough what he looks like . It is ? and this the savage would realize , though we may not ? an obscure sense that something has been added unto us thereby . But this sort of interest , though it may be intense , is after all only slightly " personal " ; and is , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited in scope and is , besides , very exclusive in mood . Whence comes this widespread interest in almost every personality that has ever been heard of , this taste for intimate detail that includes even people one never heard of , until one saw their names in the morning paper ? Gossip is perennial ; the eighteenth century , one fancies , was as gossipy as any . But a man had to be great to be gossiped about by the intelligent ; and eighteenth-century gossip was cultivated and perfected as a genre in itself . Wit was more important than " the real dope " ; and the art of talk was what mattered . There was , I fancy , very little sentimental interest in anyone ; and " the personal touch " was desired only to make a mot more authentic . Things are different now . Pace the feminists , I believe my own sex is largely responsible for this abnormal and impertinent curiosity . Women did not make the yellow press ; but they have done more than men , I believe , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that the investigation of people 's porridge is a praiseworthy and lovable habit . My sex has always heard that men 's clubs were the worst hotbeds of gossip going ; but somehow the men who gossip in clubs do not seem to make a virtue of it . Perhaps I can illustrate better what I mean by referring to certain habits of women 's clubs , the country over . Every one who has ever published a hook has had the experience of being written to by some stranger , a thousand miles away , who has to prepare a paper for her club on the hapless author 's work , and would like the author to write the paper for her . This request is perennial . That is not very important , though it certainly throws a white light on the value of club study of contemporary literature . One 's flattered amazement at being considered worth a " paper " is equalled by one 's amazement at any group of women 's thinking any writer worth " considering " who is evidently not worth their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational value of women 's clubs has sunk greatly since I discovered how inveterately they expect the author not only to give them books to consider , but to tell them what to think about those books . Nothing , certainly , could be less calculated to develop the habit of intelligent criticism in the minds of club members . Intellectually speaking , it is as immoral as it can be . More appalling , however , than requests like these are the requests that are beginning to come of late years from the same clubs . Only of one 's own experience can one speak authoritatively ; but I know that one has only to print anything , anywhere , to be thus assailed . Latterly the form of the appeal is changing . Whereas once they wanted your own critical estimate of your work to read to their clubs , they now want ? that , indeed , but something else . They want an account of your life ? as they say , something " intimate . " Within a few weeks I have had requests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly that they want , particularly , details of my family life ; details of personal appearance , such as the color of my eyes and hair ; facts about my house , husband , and children ? and , they do not omit to say , " a cozy , chatty letter , in order to get the personal touch that is so valuable . " The matter of answering such letters is settled for me , by fate itself . Not having a secretary , sotnetirnes I can , but more often I can not . To some of the latest I have not replied , because it would he so difficult to do it without rudeness . " Sweet are the uses of obscurity , " a friend of mine once wisely parodied a famous quotation . A fairly obscure person , I feel , should be entitled to some privacy . The color of my eyes is no secret to my acquaintance , and is something I have long ceased to consider of any importance , even to myself . But when strange women in Oklahoma demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being morally burglarized . I would defend that information from casual marauders as I would defend my house from unwarranted intrusion . I feel as a householder feels when a strange drummer pats his foot in. the door lest it be closed against his conversation . I feel even more as an innocent woman must feel if accident causes her to be searched by a police matron . Except that , in the latter case , one might have a sense of submitting in a vague way to mere Law and Order . Impertinence is as old as organic life , probably , and I would not put it past a dinosaur to be impertinent in his own fashion . No one has lived to grow up without experiencing impertinence . Also , it would be ungracious of any person to accuse people who are kind enough tothink him worth their interest , of impertinence pure and simple . The trouble goes deeper than that ; and illustrations have been used only by way of helping to define our plight . The point really is ( is it not ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other matters , distorting real values , and calling things by their wrong names . We justify our artificially stimulated interest in a man 's private affairs by assuming it to be a part of our natural interest in his achievement . We have somehow come to feel that we can not appreciate Endyinion without knowing about Keats 's porridge . Therefore , our interest in his porridge becomes moral and desirable . The natural consequence of all this is that a man is eventually hampered in his service to the world . Our forefathers read Paradise Lost , for the most part , without thinking about Milton 's conjugal affairs . If he had lived in our own epoch , people would he so busy with his family life that they would neglect Paradise Lest . Many of the great works of the Middle Ages were anonymous ; and if the " personal interest " mania had been developed at that time , the works themselves would have perished . Public interest in an anonymous work reduces now to an interest in discovering the real author . Having developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to feel that , because its origins were on the whole legitimate , it is , itself , a creditable thing . In politics , a man has always had to look to himself , though it remained for the " Woman 's Party , " I believe , to make a card catalogue of the private affairs of its opponents . We demand not that what a man gives to the public shall please us , but that his home life shall please us . We do not want the information that really counts ; we want the information that does not count and is none of our business . Does the public at large wish to read articles , by experts , on the musical achievement of a composer ? It does not . But if it has ever heard of him at all , it is willing to read articles by non-experts telling whether he prefers parrots to canaries , and whether or not he breakfasts in bed . It would not matter so much , did we not deceive ourselves into the belief that knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his music . It is , as we said , not the recognizable vices , but the virtues that have turned rotten , which we need most to be aware of and to fear . The sole excuse for our wishing to know about even Shakespeare 's breakfasts is that no information about supreme genius can come amiss : any information may help us to realize the conditions under which genius can best operate , and that realization may help us to hold up the hands of genius when we find it ? if we find it ? in our own time . But this is not precisely the purpose or the result of the chatty articles . No sane person ? except for those rare instances of hero-worship ? cares especially to know about the porridge , or the complexion , of the particular artist , or scientist , or man of affairs by whose work he profits . But on this point , we are growing less and less sane all the time . If a man 's work is good , it exists in and by itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we divert to . his person is diverted from the thing he wants us to care for ? namely , the thing he has toiled hard to offer us . No one in the United States is more of a household name than Mr. Edison . We all use Mazda lamps , and we are certainly never allowed to forget that Mr. Edison was responsible for them . That is no reason why , once a year ( I suppose it is only once a year , though it seems much oftener ) our intelligence should be assaulted by a column on the front page about how Mr. Edison spent his birthday . If our interest in Mr. Edison is so overwhelming that it must somehow be manifested , we might occasionally light our Mazda lamps an hour earlier than necessary . If we were really interested in an author , we should reread his work , instead of asking ? at the point of a pistol ? whether or not he drinks black coffee after his dinner . Every bit of impertinent curiosity about the man draws off energy that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation ; and it is one of our greatest intellectual sins to pretend that it is . What we are really coining to do is to neglect the important things about a man for the sake of the unimportant things . There is less intelligent interest in the work of the world than there used to be , just because there is more desire for " the personal touch . " Literary or artistic criticism , for most of our millions , consists of liking or not liking a man 's taste in food , his clothes , his mode of life , his looks . In the mental field , we are perilously near a confusion of nteunt and tum . Even murder , if you choose to look at it from the point of view of the murdered , is only the supreme impertinence . A man has lost the right to live for himself and his chosen circle ; and if he has given to the world a sonnet-sequence , he must be prepared to disclose to it the color of his pajamas . Naturally , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reading his sonnet-sequence . But they think they are . Surely this is one reason why art and letters are not progressing among us . What Europe has always found it difficult to understand in America is its intellectual dishonesty ? its refusing to look at anything until a pretty name has been provided . Europe has plenty of vices ? it may be , more than we ; but it does not confuse pajamas with sonnet-sequences . It does not call gossip criticism . It can cross the biggest bridge in the world without wondering whether the engineer who built it had blue eyes , and without feeling somehow imperiled in transit if he happened to eat with his knife . The real trouble with all this curiosity is the disloyalty involved . I am not such a cave woman that I should not prefer , on the whole , taking my chance with the celebrated or the near-celeprated , at a dinner party , than with strangers of whom I had never heard ? though I am enough of a cave woman to prefer to anything else a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then an encounter of the sort is greatly worth while : the personality is even more than the work . But generally speaking , the man who has achieved stands out from the ruck much more by what he has achieved than by what he can offer to a stranger , personally , in a single social hour . We are disloyal to the best in him when we neglect his real significance in order to go chasing off after his personal idiosyncrasies . We are very disloyal to real values when we permit ourselves to think that knowing about his personal affairs is the same thing , or as good as , knowing about his work . If some fortunate antiquarian could unearth an authentic account of Shakespeare 's life , the public would be more excited than if the same antiquarian could unearth an authentic Shakespeare play . People who do not read Shakespeare from year 's beginning to year 's end would tear the book , each from other , to read the " real dope " about Anne Hathaway and the Dark Lady , and Southampton or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plays would remain the same . The eighteenth century has many faults ; but it would never have made the mistake of thinking Mr. . Lytton Strachey 's Eminent Victorians biography . It would have known perfectly that Mr. Strachey , being very much of his period , had been interested only in the kind of personality he could create on paper for a gullible public . No one who treated Gordon 's Journals at Khartoum as Mr. Strachey treated them is a historian , of course , or a biographer , in any serious sense . He had his cynical formula : to make human beings real by making them disagreeable . It is the converse of our habit of eulogy , and , to a public tired of eulogy , Mr. Strachey 's clever prose made good reading . But it is as immoral to suppress people 's virtues as it is to suppress their vices in any biographical account ; and Mr. Strachey 's book was as gross a piece of impertinence and disloyalty as any gushing , intimate interview in any newspaper . It used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valet . Nowadays we are bent apparently on proving , concerning any notable or semi-notable person , either that be is a hero to his valet , or ? if we belong to the Strachey school ? that he never could have been . In other words , what we really care about , with any hero , is what his valet thinks of him . The Kaiser 's dentist , the Kaiser 's barber , are listened to as if our knowledge of world politics were being increased . If you can not get at the great general , get at the great general 's housekeeper : then you will be able to discuss his strategy intelligently . The man who made the epigram we have just quoted would have been alarmed indeed had he suspected that a later century was going to rest all its criticism on valet 's evidence . He had not foreseen " the personal touch , " or realized that we should care less about a man 's demeanor at . a Cabinet meeting or on the battlefield than his reactions , in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when Tennyson told us that kind hearts were more than coronets , he did not mean to say that kind hearts were coronets . You may be very sure that he knew the difference . Macaulay had very scathing things to say about the people who defended Charles I as a ruler on the score of his being a good husband and father . Had he lived a little longer , he would have seen us making that easy substitution of terms , every day , for the living , whatever we may do for the dead . " I have read only one of his novels ; but I have met him . He has blue eyes , and he 's very charming . " You hear it every day ? and behold , it is criticism . When the hapless notable is charming , even , it is not so hard on him ; though it is unfair to make an explorer , a poet , an engineer , or an artist , pay with his person when lie has already paid with his work . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare in any social group whatever ? it is more than unfair , it is cruel . Worst of all is our being willing to take the valet 's word as to the man 's whole significance . As usual , our vices , or our rotted virtues , are most detrimental in the long run , to ourselves ; and what we need blame ourselves most for is not impertinence , not unkindnesseven , but the habit of saying the thing which is not , and of calling things by their wrong names . When Milton said that the man who would write well hereafter in laudable things ought himself to be a true poem , he did not mean that we were to take the latter in lieu of the former and read a man 's life instead of his verse . Strictly speaking , he was , if you like , discussing technic ? the ars poetica . But Milton had never heard of either Chautauqua , or the modern newspaper . or " invasion of privacy , " or " the personal touch . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
