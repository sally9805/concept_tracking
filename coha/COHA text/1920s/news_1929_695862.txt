txt The name Heliopolis has been given to at least two of earth 's cities , each as a seat of sun worship . One can understand , seeing the six Standing colossal columns amid the mighty ruins of the ancient temple of Jupiter in Baalbek , that it must have been a city especially beloved of the sun . Jupiter-Baal , identified with the sun , must have hastened his rising over Anti-Lebanon to catch sight of this splendor after crossing the desert , and must have lingered On the crest of Lebanon to the west , reluctant to take his eyes away from the alluring view . Yet not until the coming of the airplane has man been able to know with rturacy of form and color how cis . must appear to the sun in his daily course . Geographers of the sixteenth and later centuries have done their . best to give " birdseye " views , trusting to measurements and their imagination . But now a new geography is ? possible . ORTELIUS can not vie with the geographer of the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo , near the site of ancient Egyptian Heliopolis , with all . its charm and picturesqUeness near ; at hand , can not have such enchantment at a distance . Even photographs of the:Pyramids and the Sphinx taken from a . height are not impressive , however interesting . Athens , with its Parthenon , " the best geni " upon earth 's zone , would probably take first place among all the sky-viewa of earth 's cities . if only it could be seen in. all its ancient glory . Rome . with St. Peter 's , the Forum and the tawny Tiber , winding from the hills across the Campagna toward the sea , must still be dear to the sun . Paris and London can not be so tempting to sightseers of the sky as they are to tourists on the ground , or to those looking for Croydon or Le Bourget as goals of their planes , but smaller cities clinging to mouna tains or tinctured by rivers or mirrored in lakes must have their peculiar charms , enhanced when seen from above in their environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the sun ( unless it be on the other side of the earth , in the lands of pagodas and the Taj ) than that which New York City , with its environing waters , presents to a spectator a few thousand feet above the streets . Manhattan Island is seen as a city that is " compact together " but without inconvenience , noise or any abomination or contamination ( except the offending smoke ) . It is as a city let down . from the skies . The skyscrapers stud the panoramic view with glinting monuments and so adorn a man-made scene that it has no competitors except the God-made mountains . In the air-minded age which we are entering a new . landscape is to be given to the sight of the human race  --  that which only the sun , the stars and the birds have had since the beginning of life on the earth . Then New York will be a new Heliopolis , beloved not only of the sun but of all who travel in her skies .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
