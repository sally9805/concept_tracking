Col. Lindbergh last week issued a statement . At the request of the Associated Press , from information gleaned on his national tour recently ended , he wrote his impressions on current aviation in the U.S. ; future possibilities . <P> Warning : Inefficient flying schools are graduating men to meet the snowball increase in demand for pilots . Such pilots , seldom hired by reputable airways , must make their living . They fly passengers for cash ; their inexperience breeds crashes . <P> Remedy : Regulation by the Department of Commerce of flying schools . Strict regulation of qualifications required of a pilot in commercial flying and especially in passenger carrying . " A number of States have adopted the Department of Commerce regulations , but the majority have either no regulation whatsoever or have enacted special rules which will , in the end , only strive to retard aeronautical development . "
