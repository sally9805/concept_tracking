When Postmaster Peterson of Douglas , Ga. , committed suicide this spring ( TIME , April 16 ) , people said it was because he had gone broke paying the politicians for his job . It aroused a Senate investigation of how Federal patronage is dispensed in the South , an investigation which got afoot last week under the leadership of Iowa 's Brookhart . Georgia 's George was on the committee , too , and Ohio 's newly-seated Locher . <P> The Peterson scandal-he was supposed to have paid his political overlord some $2,000-soon evaporated . Not to malign a dead man , it seemed sufficient to say that Postmaster Peterson 's bankruptcy was his own fault and not political . But there were other cases . <P> Postmistress Esther McCollum of Conyers , Ga. , told that she had always understood she must pay 5% of her salary , or some $100 per annum , into the campaign chest of the Republicans responsible for her appointment . <P> Postmistress Hattie Giddings of Doles , Ga. , said that before and after Benjamin Jefferson Davis , Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give money . <P> Georgia 's Republican politicians rebutted these tales , and many another like them , with instances where candidates for office had offered to buy their way in . One G. F. Flanders , G. O. Patronage man cr Georgia 's Twelfth District , declared he could sell every postmastership , if he wanted to , which he did n't . " I am not a grafter , " he said . <P> The investigation was all anti-Republican in tone , what with Federal patronage having been Republican for eight years and the Senate investigators being mostly Democratic . So Postmaster General New asked to be heard . The Senators returned from digging up fresh dirt in Georgia , to hear some old dirt in Washington . Postmaster General New read letters and affidavits showing how postmasterships had been sold and levied upon in the Wilson days of 1917-20 . The system , he implied , dated back to Civil War times and was common to both parties . Democrats demurred that the campaign contribution law had been changed since Wilson days and that the Georgia Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of card-indexing its customers . Mr. New was requested to produce more information . The investigation continued . <P> Meantime , forestalling Senate action , Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , Assistant U. S. Attorney General , spurred a Grand Jury investigation of Mississippi 's postmasters , 75 of whom were summoned last week to Biloxi to be scrutinized . As everyone knows , Mississippi 's Negro Republicans , headed by National Committeeman Perry W. Howard , control their fair share of the South 's 25,000 Federal jobs , which aggregate $35,000,000 per annum in salaries . Indictments began , arrests followed for " purchase and sale of public offices . "
