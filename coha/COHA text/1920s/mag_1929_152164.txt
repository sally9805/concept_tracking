Selling health on the instalment plan was last fortnight suggested to the Chicago Medical Society . President-elect Dr. James H. Hutton suggested that , physicians , when they are called on a new case , estimate the total cost of treatment , have the patient sign notes for the expected bill . The notes would bear 6% interest charges and would fall due at regular intervals , like instalments on a motor or radio . The doctor would take the notes to a special financing corporation and get $35 for every $100 which his patient was to owe him . When the full bill was paid to the financing corporation the doctor would get $51.37 more , a total of $86.37 for each $100 of service . The corporation would keep $13.63 for its expenses and for a fund to pay off bad debts .
