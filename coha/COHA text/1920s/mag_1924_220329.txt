In the Royal Palace at Santander , a luncheon party was given by King Alfonso . Among the notables invited to lunch were the Duke of Alba , General Primo Rivera , U. S. Ambassador Alexander P. Moore . <P> During the conversation , in which the King spoke on internal affairs , it was duly noted that Ambassador Moore called the King " Chief " and the Duke of Alba " Jimmy " . Alfonso responded to such familiarity by saying that he and Mr. Moore understood each other . <P> It is an unwritten law- not always , however , unvoiced- that royal utterances shall not be directly quoted . What King Alfonso has to say about Spain was therefore placed conveniently in the third person . If the account had been quoted in the first person it would have revealed Alfonso 's sang froid to a marked degree and would have appeared thus : " The rumor of a coming crisis has been spread by Spanish newspapers which do not like the present rgime because it has cut off the subsidies allowed the Press by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other periodicals in Spain , and I interpret much of their opposition to the Directorate to a desire to see the rstablishment of a rgime which would restore the subsidies . Personally , I oppose such a system as leading to corruption , whereas one of the objects of the present Spanish Government is to have in Spain a system of independent newspapers such as exists in the United States . <P> " Several Madrid journals published a statement that General Primo de Rivera was going to fight a duel with another General , a member of the Directorate . Observe , gentlemen , that both Generals are present at this luncheon and on best terms . <P> " It is not proposed to abolish the system of representative parliamentary government in Spain ; it has been suspended as the most efficacious means of reforming conditions , which is the purpose of the new rgime . I think great strides have been made toward giving Spain a clean Government . There is no intention of superseding Primo de Rivera ; on the contrary , I am sure that the Dictator will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return of parliamentary government , and I think this will take at least another year . <P> " The Government is making great progress toward rooting out governmental graft , including padded payrolls . As an example of what has been accomplished , look at the budget of the city of Valencia , which has had a deficit of 2,000,000 pesetas . Without curtailing the public service , this has been converted into a favorable balance of 1,000,000 pesetas . The Government has gone ahead with the good roads program and the extension of the common-school system . <P> " But the big job of the new rgime is to give clean government to Spain , and from what I have heard from the people , I feel confident that Primo de Rivera has popular approval . I may say that it is wrong to call the General a Dictator , since Spain is really being run by a directorate of ten men , and not by one man . " <P> As was truly remarked , the King is unafraid of his enemies , who represent the throne as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
