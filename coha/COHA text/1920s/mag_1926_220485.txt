Into the garden where clustered a whimpering lad , his pale mother , a few niched apples and a Seventh Day Adventist missionary there came a maid servant . In her hand she held a bottle of silver nitrate which the missionary , C. A. Haysmeir , had bid her fetch . The pale Korean mother glossed her son 's felony with imploring tears . But Missionary Haysmeir picked up the brush portentously . He dipped it into the bottle of scarifying chemical . <P> The little Korean boy shrieked in bewilderment . Calmly , with delicacy , Adventist Haysmeir etched " Thief " on the boy 's either cheek . It did not hurt much . What hurt was the later ridicule of playmates who jeered the little fellow out of school . Missionary Haysmeir was dismissed last week by the Far Eastern organization of Seventh Day Adventists . <P> Reports that mild-tempered Koreans were about to wage a Boxer massacre were ill-founded . Koreans happen to like missionaries . They evidently realized that Missionary Haysmeir was an unbalanced member of a fanatical sect.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
