The first and the latest American Ambassadors to France have both delighted Frenchmen . They like Myron Timothy Herrick , and they thought Benjamin Franklin was dlicieux . Therefore Parisians were a-tiptoe with anticipation , last week , as the state-owned Thtre de L ' Odon ( second only in kudos to the Comdie Francaise ) started rehearsing Pauvre Richard . <P> The Paris premire of Poor Richard will be on the night of March 22 , 1929 , not an anniversary of anything but , roughly speaking , the Sesquicentennial of B. Franklin 's arrival in Paris . The play , by Playwright Louis Evan Shipman of Manhattan will be the first by a modern U.S. author ever presented at the Odon.
