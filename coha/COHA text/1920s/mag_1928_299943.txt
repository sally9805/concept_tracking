A lane of 14-foot cornstalks appeared at the West Branch , Iowa , railroad station . Down it , early one morning , last week , marched Nominee Hoover with his wife and sons . Automobiles carried them through the proudest village in the U. S. to a house of which the original part was a log cabin , where , 54 years and eleven days before , Herbert Clark Hoover had been born . A Mrs. Jennie Scellars , who now owns the house and has declined to sell it to Mrs. Hoover , served up an oldtime Iowa breakfast . On her front porch she drove a fast trade in what a wag called " Hoovernirs . " <P> West Branch , pop . 745 , was becoming crowded with brass bands and parading visitors to the number of 15,000 or more , but the Hoovers were permitted to go alone to the graves of the Nominee 's parents , Jesse Hoover , the West Branch blacksmith , and his wife , Huldah . They both died before the Nominee was 10 . <P> The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which West Branch* is named . Part of the villagers ' preparations had been to restore , with a dam , what used to be the Old Swimming Hole . The Nominee eyed the work and then said to Newton C. Butler , one of the three playmates of his youth whom he had found still in West Branch : " No , this is not the place at all . I think it is up yonder by that tree . " <P> " Up yonder " the party headed , but thick Iowa gumbo prevailed . The reminiscers turned back to their automobile , hot and muddy . Not until the afternoon , when persevering , he returned to the streamlet , did the Nominee see the place where small " Bertie " Hoover used to splash . <P> Postmaster I. O. Yoder , a remote cousin , entertained at lunch . All afternoon there were conferences and buzz-buzzings in a big tent pitched behind the high school . Dinner was a Hoover-family reunion at Remote Cousin Ralph Branson 's ( on whose farm was the swimming hole ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude . " This , " he said , with some emotion , " is a home-coming . " He talked about his and their pioneer ancestors ; about his first schoolteacher , Mrs. Molly Brown Carran , who was present , gazing up through thick-lensed eyeglasses at her prodigious pupil . He recalled Iowa 's apples , rabbits , nuts , fishing . He returned again to the Old Swimming Hole : " As an engineer I could devise improvements for that swimming hole , " he said . " But I doubt if the decrease in mothers ' grief at the homecoming of muddy boys would compensate the inherent joys of getting muddy . " <P> He soon got on to the practical purposes of his visit . He reminded people that he was farm-raised in the days when farming was a mode of living , not an industry . He redescribed farming 's transformation and its post-War predicament . He repeated his pledges : 1 ) for a Federal Farm Board ; 2 ) a Farm Loan Fund ; 3 ) a stabilized , autonomous , farm marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not insensible to the value of the study which sincere farm leaders have given to this question of farm legislation . They have all contributed to the realization that the problem must be solved . They will be invited into conference . Outstanding farmers such as Governor Lowden will be asked to join in the search for common ground upon which we can act . "
