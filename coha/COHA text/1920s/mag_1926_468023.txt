AN astronomer thinks we are a queer lot because we thrill at the picture of " stout Cortez " discovering an ocean some centuries ago , while we are languidly indifferent to the discovery of new universes in our own day . To an astronomer we must seem like clams : very much excited at the conquest of a pebble that impedes us , but calmly heedless of an earthquake that has let in sunshine upon our shells . Some time it is going to occur to a poet that the feats of Prometheus and Pocahontas are mere bits of tinsel in the panorama of liberating the soul . Through all its history our mind has been a slave to terrifying fancies about its home . It always had to grovel in its dread of the Great Dark that surrounds it ? until astronomy lighted a candle . The poet will see his theme as a flickering of scientific curiosity , very faint and blown by all the winds of illusion , in the murky darkness of the mind . His first glimpse of it will be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure , all the early watchers of the skies were ignorant of what they were about , and the knowledge gained by fifty centuries of the efforts of the best intellects would not be sufficient for a nursery rhyme to-day . In their myths and guesses there was no more than the spark that could light the candle of science . The dramatic heart of the poet 's theme will be the learning of the regularity of the stars ' and planets ' motions . Thus he will be a greater innovator thanany the muses have supplied since Homer set a standard . In this way of stating the plain fact there is no playful paradox . Indeed , we shall never sense the reality until we conceive it as an exultant song about the first realization that the heavens are not capricious , not peopled by malicious powers . For all the happenings of our lives on earth appear so wanton that we might not yet have learned about invariable natural law if the stars had not given us the clue . II For thirty centuries before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the regular cycles in the heavens and had concluded that our earth might be only a globe in space , like other globes that swing there , invisibly suspended . A Greek had guessed that the stars might be at infinite distances . Mankind had begun to peer beyond its confines and to see the light of day , the light of mental freedom . But astronomy was almost snuffed out by a monstrous Logic that crept upon our senses like so much carbon dioxide in a cellar . This Logic of theology argued that all our powers of eyesight were false , that knowledge of what surrounds us must come from the visions of men 's brains . So the world remained a flat square , under which were fiery caverns , over which was a crystalline floor of stupendous weight and solidity . The stars became little lights , managed by angels , as if they were so many lamps in a ceiling . All spaciousness vanished . The outdoors became a vile heresy . Men once more cowered in the terrors of the dark and felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without much stretch of the imagination , feel the darkness thickening upon the intellect as you read in any sketch of astronomy something of this sort : " The study of the heavens became confined to Alexandria by 400 , A.D. and the last glimmer of this was extinguished in 641 , not to be lighted again for a hundred and fifty years , and then at the place of its origin . " During the eight centuries from Haroun-al-Rashid to Milton the light of astronomy was of no more use in the world than a will-o-the-wisp in a tomb . Only a handful of speculative men in each generation knew that such a phosphorescent shimmer existed , and they did no more than to bend over it suspiciously and whisper about it , fearful that they would be made outcasts if their curiosity was known . Practically the whole learned world during those centuries agreed that our earth was the center of the universe and that about it revolved ten spherical shells of transparent crystal , bearing the heavenly bodies . If you smile at this invention of Ptolemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberation that I am going to sketch . Ptolemy was a more powerful observer and reasoner than most modern astronomers , as they would be the first to insist . He examined with complete candor and acumen the question " Do the stars revolve around us ? " And there was no possible way to tell whether the motions in the sky were caused by our movement or by the movement of the stars . A brilliant mathematician has recently declared that even to-day , when Einstein newly raises the question , there is no way to tell . The overthrow of Ptolemy 's theory was about the most extraordinary feat ever performed by the human intellect . It was begun by Copernicus , who in 1496 went from Poland to join the small band of radicals in Italy who were peering at the queer , uncanny glimmer of a thought that perhaps the earth is not the center of the universe . His thirty years of calculation came almost to nothing . Most instructive for all who desire to think straight is the reason for this failure : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The circle , you see , is the perfect curve ; all other curves are inferior ; and it is impossible to conceive that God should have set His creations traveling on blundering paths . Men have always assumed , and to-day as much as ever , that their reason will inform them about what God would not do and what His ideals of architecture are for a sky or a society . Sixty years after Copernicus died Tycho Brahe completed his treatise on celestial motions . Here was an observer of the highest ability , who made instruments of far greater precision than had ever been used before , whose only ambition was to find out the form of the universe . He examined the reasoning of Copernicus , recognized its advan tages , and wished it might be true . He found it false . Though he conceded that the planets probably revolve around the sun , he had to conclude that they and the sun revolve around the earth . The principal reason for his judgment was entirely scientific . It can be illustrated by what happens on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telegraph pole which is a mile away to the north , and is outlined against a long hill . The pole is seen to move along the hill ; at the east end of the course it is outlined against a small clump of trees , while from the west end it is seen against a house that stands a quarter of a mile east of the trees . As a person rides around the track he sees the pole " displaced " against the hill . " So , " Brahe reasoned quite sensibly , " if I am really riding around a stationary sun once a year as Copernicus thought , my position in January must be very far from where I was in July ; there must be this racetrack effect of displacing ' the nearer stars against the background of the more distant ones . I will observe with the most accurate instruments ; I will find out whether there actually is any displacement , any ' parallax , ' as we astronomers call it . " His closest scrutiny revealed no parallax whatever . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book that contained the demonstration was seen through the press by a young assistant , Kepler , who proved to be the most original mathematician that ever lived . In 1600 he set himself the task of figuring out why Mars had such an eccentric orbit . With never-flagging zeal he computed for nine years , and then found , contrary to all previous convictions of the human intellect , that planets do not move in circles , but in ellipses . Now he could substitute these ellipses for circles and show that the calculations of Copernicus corresponded closely to the facts . In 1621 he issued a very persuasive defense of the idea that the earth moves around the sun . But this was as difficult a proof then as Einstein 's calculations are for us to-day , and there was then no Associated Press to give such a novelty a boost . Even to the eager Galileo , who believed in the Copernican idea and corresponded with Kepler , the proof meant little . It had furnished new wick for the taper of astronomy , but the kindling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might be said that Kepler 's proof had not brought much understanding even to himself . His way of thinking was still the groping of fancy in the cellar of the Great Dark . So mystical were half the operations of this marvelous mathematical mind that we can hardly credit them . He expounded the harmonies of the planets as caused by the soul of the sun ; he seriously speculated about comets as a kind of living beings traveling with a purpose ; he was conVox , . CLII. ? No. 909. - 24 vinced that the universe is framed in accordance with laws of aesthetics ; and as for stars , he could not suppose that they were suns , but let his thoughts soar into the sheerest metaphysics . It was Galileo who did more than all the mathematicians to show its where we live . He worked by the only method that has ever brought conviction ? by showing us sights . As soon as he heard a description of the new Dutch glasses for looking at distant objects he fashioned one and looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . With his own hands he manufactured hundreds of telescopes which were sent all over Europe . Everywhere people could see that Jupiter was sailing through space attended by some satellites which revolved around it without being left behind . There was a picture of a miniature planetary system in operation . Then for the first time the Copernican theory became a reality to those who were willing to trust their eyes . Still the first computation which really proved the revolution of the earth was that published by Newton in 1686 . And during the next century and a half the idea that the earth moved seemed to have only a slight and speculative foundation . The idea was generally considered " degrading . " Just as Darwin had to recognize that his theory was " revolting to our pride , " so the astronomers had to concede that a moving globe was a mean , belittling conception compared with the nobility of an earth that stood fast in the center of all and was served by the spacious firmament on high . Conviction spread with exceeding slowness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous doctrine of materialism to most professors in American colleges . Not till Bessel measured the aberration of light in 1838 was there any certain proof of the parallax of stars . Even by 1900 there had been telescopic measurement of parallax for only forty of them . No measurement of the diameter of a star was made till 1920 . How refined an achievement this was can be appreciated if we realize that it was equivalent to finding the diameter of a quarter-dollar at a distance of seventy miles . IV The modern astronomer does not rely on his telescope for measurements . He uses the spectroscope and interferometer , instruments of unrivaled subtlety and sureness . By looking at the bands of light that they furnish , an astronomer can read descriptions as detailed as the reports of a ball game . He learns the temperature of any particular star , the elements of which it is composed , the density of the materials , the atomic conditions of gases which are in states unknown in our solar system , whether the direction of its motion is away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a microscope he can see that a star is double and can calculate the orbits of the two suns about each other . By interpreting such knowledge he has recently learned that all stars go through the same course of life , from a thin gaseous giant of moderate heat to a more compact state of maximum heat , and then to states of decreasing heat and size . Within the last three years he has learned to read the distances of certain variable stars , the Cepheids , and thus has been able to estimate the distances of some nebulas . There are now spectroscopic wizards who give out matter-of-fact information about the speed at which the hydrogen electron revolved around its proton when it started toward us from its distant sun a thousand years ago . There is no way of conceiving the distance that separates us from that sun . If we use as a unit for expressing it the distance from the earth to our sun ( 93,000,000 miles ) , we shall find it inconveniently small , for this petty yardstick must be applied 260,000 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance is to use the speed of light as a measure . Light travels from the sun to the earth in 8 minutes and 20 seconds . When it has traveled for a year it has covered nearly six million times a million miles . This distance that light travels in a year , a " light-year , " is large enough to serve as a unit of measure in astronomy , though it is now being supplanted by a unit 3.3 times as long , the " parsec . " The nearest star is 4.2 light-years from us , Only four stars are within a radius of ten light years from us . Another way of trying to imagine stellar spaces is to diagram them . Suppose that the sun is a tennis ball lying on a court near New Orleans . The earth would then be represented by a grain of sand at a distance of 23 feet . The nearest star will be another tennis ball ? how many yards away do you guess ? You can not reach it in an hour 's walk . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must journey northward through the whole length of the Mississippi valley , 1100 miles , to the neighborhood of Duluth , before you come upon it . And even this utterly unimaginable distance is less than the average between stars in the universe . Such is the space which the astronomers now explore ? a vacuum in which three-inch globes and specks of dust occur at intervals of thousands of miles . For our sun is not far below the average mass of the stars . The brightest star , Sirius , has a mass only two and one-half times as great . Our sun is not a dwarf compared with even such a monster as Betelgeuse , which , though it may have a diameter 250 times that of the sun , has a mass that is only ten times as great ; for it is composed of an excessively thin gas . Suppose , for an illustration of average conditions in the universe , that we are in the center of a sphere of space that has a diameter of 33 light years ? that is , nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than thirty suns . If we reduced this sphere to a ten-foot globe , the thirty suns would be molecules . Now a molerule is not comparable to a gross " speck " of matter ; it is so small that if it passed it be through like a man passing through gh a microscopical pore in the skin t an aperture seven miles wide . In a ten-foot globe the suns would be no more than thirty molecules . So inconceivably rarefied is the star-gas in our bourne of time and place . Astronomers have calculated the speeds and directions of these molecular suns that float about in a vacuum . If you look toward the bright star Vega , you will see the direction in which our sun is drifting . Its rate is excessively slow ? only twelve miles a second . We shall be half a billion years in reaching the neighborhood where Vega now is ? and then Vega wo n't be there . All the stars are swinging gently along on courses that appear to be straight lines , but that are presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Very few move sufficiently fast to have distorted the chart of the heavens within historic times . The most rapid one has a rate which carries it in 220 years across a space in the sky that is no wider than the area occupied by the moon . The slow ones will gradually shift positions as the centuries pass ; in the course of millions of years the present constellations will be replaced by other configurations . The " fixed " stars are as wandering as so many motes in a beam of light . They move in all directions . Collisions are possible and doubtless occur at times , but must be rare . The universe seems to be , in the main , a peaceful , happy-go-lucky concourse . Yet the motions in it appear to be far from random . Already there have been determinations of decided " drifts " of large proportions of the total population of the billions of inhabitants of our Galaxy , and the next important announcement of novelty from the observatories is likely to be some generalization of the Quo Vadis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our Galaxy is lens-shaped ; its size is esti mated to be more than 100,000 light-years in diameter and 10,000 in thickness . And this vastness is now supposed to be only a small portion of the total universe . So frequent are the bulletins which stretch the limits of stellar space ? each so staggeringly surpassing the previous ones ? that if I report the latest , the details may be antiquated before they can be printed and put on a newsstand . Some examples of how astronomical knowledge soars year by year are really comical . In the new Britannica volumes of 1922 it was grudgingly conceded that in our galaxy ( the Milky Way ) there might possibly be as many as three or four billion stars ; in June , 1925 , Doctor Abbot of the Smithsonian Institution calmly stated , " The telescope proves that there are thirty or forty billion stars in the Milky Way . " In 1924 Hale , the director of the Mount Wilson Observatory , startled us by speaking of the most distant stars as 220,000 light-years away ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that very observatory , had proved the spiral nebula of Andromeda to be a million light-years away . When I first saw the statement by a popularizer of astronomy that perhaps there are in the entire universe " thousands " of galaxies like our Milky Way , I was scandalized by such a flighty perhaps . But Professor Russell of Princeton , who says we may safely conclude that Andromeda is as remote as Major Hubble reckons , now admits the likelihood of the thousands . " This possibility , " he says , " makes even the casehardened astronomer gasp . " He is now prepared for the worst that the Hubbies and Shapleys and Leavitts and Lund-marks and Kapteyns may do in the next three years . We must all make ready to accept the utterly incredible . While I am typing this article , Doctor Luyten of the Harvard Observatory states in the press , " That the whole of sidereal space is strewn with thousands of separate universes , comparable in size               @ @ @ @ @ @
