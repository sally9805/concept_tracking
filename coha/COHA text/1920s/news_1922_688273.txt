The management has taken pains to provide a pleasing program to show the six million people said to have patronized the playhouse during the last year how much they appreciate said million 's  --  millions . The Music is good . The ushers are extra polite . The air that is ice-cooled in summer is now being run through a toaster . The picture features Richard Barthelmess .

But , even in his most hectic Moments , I couldn't. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  suffering as 11111011 as he really ought to in such a mournful t Olin . Nor did Mary Alden 's grief move me as it usually can .
