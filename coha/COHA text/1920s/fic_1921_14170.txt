Sunrise after a night of storm , with the sea swaying prodigiously . A great Venetian argosy has been wrecked overnight ; ships and men have disappeared , leaving only the cargo spread out upon the waters . Momently new treasures from the ships ' holds float upward and , reaching the surface , are swept hither and thither for miles  --  Persian rugs ; great lengths of brocade ; boxes of spice , made from tropical leaves and bound with dried vine ; and an apparently interminable swathe of gray silk unwinding from its ivory standard . In the foreground a mermaid is feeling her way among the stuffs with considerable distaste . To one used to the shadowed harmonies of deep-sea color these crimsons and oranges have no attraction . Brigomed has the green wiry hair of her kind , entangled with the friendly snail ; the iridescent shoulders of all sea-women , and the gray thin mouth . Suddenly she comes upon the Prince . The royal divan has been swept from the decks , and while the huge pillows are gradually soaking up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious . For a moment the mermaid watches him open-mouthed . She steals nearer and , holding on to the tassels of seed-pearls , leans cautiously over and scans his face long and wonderingly . She sighs faintly , splashes a little in discontent , and then gazes upon him again with a frown of concentration . BRIGOMEIDE It 's breathing . He has not lost  --  what they call  --  the soul . I wonder where he keeps it . It is the great difference between us ; we sea-people have no soul . I wonder where he keeps it ! I have heard that it can be seen at times , in the eyes . Perhaps if I borrowed it from him while he slept he would never miss it . No  --  I will ask him for it . ( She claps her hands suddenly to awake him , falling back , at the same time , into the water . The young man does not stir . She grows angry . She strikes the water sharply with the palms of her hands . By quick degrees a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robed in silk ; they break over the divan and the Prince stirs . Immediately Brigomed strokes the water to a stillness , and fixes her attention on the young man. ) p. 3 THE PRINCE My father , take not your hand away . My brothers , why have you ceased talking ? Where am I ?  --  All is lost ! Ave Maris Stella ! BRIGOMEIDE ( Watching him intently ) How could you sleep so  --  during the storm ? THE PRINCE You  --  you are out of a dream . You are out of my fever . Yes , yes  --  the storm  --  you  --  all this is but the painting of my fever . I shall awake in Venice with the lute player fallen asleep by the window . I will call to him now and he will wake me up : Amedeo !  --  Lute player ! Shake me out of this dream ! ( The silence that follows is filled with the crackling noise as the pith fillings of the heavier cushions become saturated . ) BRIGOMEIDE ( Harshly ) Who is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you and me only . THE PRINCE Amedeo !  --  He does not answer : this is real . But you , you are dream ; you are illusion . Ave Maris Stella ! BRIGOMEIDE ( Indignantly ) I am not dream . I am not illusion . I am royal among all sea-women.  --  I am of the Third Order : On the three great tide days I am permitted to bind my hair with Thetis-Agrandis and wear in my ears the higher Muria. p. 4 THE PRINCE You are out of an old ballad , taught me as a boy , and you have come back to me in the last hour on the tide of fever . In a moment my dream will have passed on from you . BRIGOMEIDE ( Vehemently ) You think I am only dream because you have heard it said we sea-folk have no souls . THE PRINCE Soul nor body . BRIGOMEIDE ( More softly ) Tell me where it is you keep your soul . Have you it always with you ? THE PRINCE ( As a great pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save me ! Deliver me ! Hear my prayer ! BRIGOMEIDE Who are you speaking to ? Did I not tell you there was no one here but you and me only ? THE PRINCE You ! Tell me where is shore . You can swim for days . Draw me to some island . I will give you great riches all you desire . BRIGOMEIDE Give me your soul . All my days I have longed for two things , black hair and a soul . I have not lacked anything else . I will draw you to your home if you will give me your soul . THE PRINCE ( Violently ) It can not be given away . No one has seen it ; it can not be felt with the hands ; seen or tasted . p. 5 BRIGOMEIDE And yet they say it is the greatest thing in the world ; that without it life is a cold procession of hours ; that it gives all sight to the eyes , and all hearing to the ears you are mocking me ! I see in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and am about to lose it . BRIGOMEIDE Give it to me , and I will bring up from the bottom of the sea your father and your brothers . I will return to you all the pearls that have fallen here , and draw you softly into the narrows of Venice . THE PRINCE ( As the water closes over him ) Amedeo !  --  Lute player ! ( Brigomed turns away contemptuously . ) BRIGOMEIDE It is something you can not touch or see . What could I do with it so ? ( The Prince rises , dead , entangled in scarves . Brigomed stares into his face long and earnestly . ) It is true ! There is something gone that lay about his eyes , that troubled his mouth . The soul , perhaps . ( She claps her hands . From a great distance a sea serpent swims hugely toward her . He is caught in the trailing lengths of gray brocade . ) Gog-etar ! There is no longer anything precious in this man . You may divide him among your young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These spices have made the streams unendurable . By tomorrow morning the waters will be tainted as far as Africa . Already my young are ill , lady . They lie motionless in the mud , dear lady . It is terrible to see them so BRIGOMEIDE I do not want to hear your troubles . Take this man away . LEVIATHAN Thanks , gracious lady . Perhaps these hateful essences will have made him endurable BRIGOMEIDE Cease ! ( He drags the Prince away . The frustrated Brigomed starts to comb the shell out of her hair , singing . Suddenly she breaks her song and adds musingly : )
