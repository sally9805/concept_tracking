WARRIORS IN UNDRESS-F . J. Hudleston-Little , Brown ( $3.50 ) . As librarian of the British War Office , Mr. Hudleston has pored these many years over curious volumes . To readers of Warriors in Undress it will be instantly self-evident that he long ago formed the excellent habit of jotting down a good thing when he sees it . Probably on these occasions he slaps his knee and cries : " By gad ! That 's good ! " <P> Out of a rarely discriminative collection of such tidbits , he has fashioned these wholly delightful and often pungent essays chiefly anent great soldiers of the past . One can no more resist quoting a few of Mr. Hudleston 's " good things " than he could resist jotting them down : <P> Wellington : At Waterloo " Lord Anglesey suddenly observed , ' By God , I 've lost my leg ! ' ' Have you , by God ? ' replied the Duke . <P> " There is a noble simplicity about this reply . ... Is there any phrase in English military history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is impossible not to admire ( although he once set out to invade England ) that high-spirited batard de Roi , Marshal Saxe . ... To wrap it up pleasantly , in the quaint language of the turf , he would have started 100 to 1 , and no takers , for the Continence Gold Cup . . . . His father ( Augustus the Strong ) was well called the Strong : he had 353 illegitimate children . " <P> Early Bostonian : There is " a story told by Carl Schurz , who , during the American Civil War , on asking a sentry guarding his tent why he had not presented arms to a General who had just left it , received the answer : ' Why , sir , that General was never introduced to me . ' ' <P> Garibaldi : " His was an impulsive nature . He fell in love with his Anita at first sight . . . . His first words when they first met were : ' Thou oughtest to be mine ' - which she incontinently was . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as if his character were not black enough already ) while Rome was burning , played , not the fiddle , but the bagpipe ? " <P> Women : " I find amongst many anecdotes concerning women a note of an Austrian General , who , in 1859 , was savagely denounced by a French newspaper because he had put in an application to headquarters for belladonna* for the use of his men . " <P> * Bella , beautiful ; and donna , woman , in Italian .
