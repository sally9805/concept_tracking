One bearish day last week when securities on the stock market were being heavily sold , Baldwin Locomotive stock worked its way higher , closing with a net gain for the session of over nine points . This reflected marketwise the fact that the Fisher brothers of Detroit , onetime owners of Fisher Body Corp . lately incorporated into General Motors Corp. , had waged successful battle for representation on the board of directors of Baldwin Locomotive Works , of whose common stock they own 120,000 shares , a controlling interest . Samuel Vauclain , President , opposed to the Fisher brothers , was prevailed upon to allow them two places on the board . The importance of their victory was . diminished by President Vauclain 's success in enlarging the Board from 12 to 15 members , * thus reducing the proportionate value of the two seats that will be filled by Fred J. Fisher and his colleague Clarence R. Bitting , engineer . <P> <P> * Officially the increase in the board must await confirmation of the stockholders who meet Nov. 10 . Till then Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the board , Mr. Bitten on the finance committee also .
