 | BEFORE this article sees the light of print , Senator Curtis of Kansas will have introduced into the Senate , and Representative Anthony , also of Kansas , into the House , an amendment to the Constitution of the United States , called the Lucretia Mott amendment . That amendment is the present platform . of the Woman 's Party . It reads , " Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction . " Now , what does the Woman 's Party mean by equal rights ? To answer this question , it is necessary to go back a little distance into history . In 1848 there was held at Seneca Falls , New York , the first woman 's rights convention in the world . That convention drew up a declaration of statements and a series of resolutions which we have begun to refer to as the woman 's Bill of Rights . Although that convention seemed unimportant in the seething decades which preceded the Civil War , it has grown steadily in significance ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past like a vast monument marking the forward march of an entire sex . And that Bill of Rights has become as important to 18 the woman 's movement as Magna Charta to Great Britain or the Declaration of Independence to the United Slates . It demanded for women ? that extraordinary document ? a perfect equality with men before the law and in all other relations to human society . It demanded also an equal moral standard for men and women . And of course it demanded the ballot for women . Seventy-five years have passed since 1848 . Of the whole splendid program outlined by the convention at Seneca Falls , the only right we have gained for all the women of the United States is the right to vote . Of course , there are many women who innocently believe that , having become enfranchised , woman has taken the last trench in her struggle for freedom . And it is true that for women to enter the economic conflict without the vote is a little like going into battle without a gun . The present writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of women be interested to enter the struggle for ? let us say ? international peace , or can they effectively engage in such a struggle if they still do not possess such simple fundamental liberties as the right after marriage to their own earnings ; to inherit property equally with their husband ; the joint ownership with him of their children ? ciate the value of the ballot ? only that tendency to believe that enfranchisement completed woman 's freedom . The majority of women who were interested to see women obtain the franchise pictured her , I think , engaging at once , equally with men , in movements for national and After the United States enfranchised its women , the Woman 's Party called a convention of its members to decide whether there was any need for it to continue . It invited every reform organization of women in the United States to send a speaker to present its program to that convention . After listening to these various programs , the Woman 's Party realized that no on of them purposed to establish complete equality between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its existence and to remove all the remaining forms of subjection of women , beginning with the legal disabilities . The Woman 's Party has always had but one plank at a time in its platform ? but back of that plank it has massed the entire Party . In its  | brief history of a dozen years it has had but two platforms . The first demanded votes for women ; the second , equal rights . And just as in its work for the suffrage it went straight on , without deviation toward any other cause , until the women of the United States were enfranchised , so in the fight for its present platform , it will go straight on until women stand equal with men before the law in the United States . Until this complete national freedom is won , it is unlikely that the women of the United States can make a big , concerted sex movement toward any great international reform . In the last two years the Woman 's Party has been engaged in an exhaustive research of both the federal and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being done in the Law Library of the Supreme Court of the United States by a corps of women trained in the law . From these digests the summaries of twelve states have already been put in pamphlet form . I cite the laws as typical of four states ? a southern , an eastern , a middlewestern and a far-western state . In Florida , one discovers that women can not serve on juries and are not admitted to the State University , except the Normal Department , on equal terms with men . A married woman 's services belong to her husband . She can not choose her legal residence ; does not control her own property ; has practically no right to contract or do business on her own responsibility . The father controls the services and earnings of children . The inheritance laws discriminate against women . In Massachusetts , women are disqualified for jury  | service . The right of married women to carry on business is restricted , and mothers have not equal rights with fathers to the services and the earnings of their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contract ; they have not equal rights with husbands over joint property . The husband owns his wife 's , services in the home and controls her right to work outside the home . Mothers have not equal rights with fathers over their children . In Nevada , marriage revokes a woman 's will . Married women have no general capacity to contract or to sue , and are restricted in the right to carry on a business . The husband has the exclusive control of community property , and a widow 's share in community property is less than a widower 's share . Laws concerning the administration of estates discriminate against women . The apprentice law discriminates against girls . The legal age is less for girls than boys . Prostitution is a matter of commerce . A Few Facts about Laws I will add ? and I pick a few facts at random ? that in New York , fathers are preferred to mothers in control of the services , the earnings , and the real estate of the children ; and that the laws regulating industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect money damages when his wife is injured . In Maryland , fathers can will away children from their mothers . In Virginia , a married woman 's property is presumed to belong to her husband unless proof to the contrary is shown . In Louisiana , married women are classed with children and the insane in regard to making contracts and are unable to contract equally with their husbands . In two states , the father can still will away the custody of the child from the mother . In two states , the earnings of the wife outside of the home belong to the husband . In less than fifteen states is prostitution a crime for the male as well as the female . More than half the states do not permit women to serve on juries . In at least forty states , the husband owns the services of his wife in the home ; and in most of these states this means , among other things , that when a married woman is injured , her husband recovers damages for loss of those services . In mpst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal guardians of their children , but many of these states still deny the mother equal rights to the earnings and services of the children . I commend these twelve pamphlets to the women of the United States for reading matter . I commend them not only as a woman and a feminist but as a novelist . They illustrate the laws which they cite by court cases . And these cases form as poignant a collection of stories as any fictionist has ever turned out ; compressed to a brevity which makes a Balzac or a Turgeniev seem verbose . This happened in Virginia : " Another case is that of Mrs. Y. , who was living separate from her husband . She contended that the separation was due to his mistreatment of her , while he contended that the separation was her fault . They had two children , one only three months old and the other two years old . The fitness of the wife to have the care of their two children was never questioned , but the Court decided that these babies should go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had a little I property , while the young mother had none . " This happened in Louisiana : " A woman was married in Alexandria . . t to X. , and two and one-half years later they came to New Orleans , where they established a domicile . X 's trade . . . was that of fireman upon ocean-going steamships , and his absences from home were of four or five months ' duration , while the intervals between them did not usually extend beyond that many days . His wife engaged in the business of renting rooms and for the purpose of that business retained her maiden name . She also bought real estate in that name , imposed  | mortgages upon it to secure money borrowed in that name , and made other transactions in the course of her business . By her labor this energetic woman acquired property and money amounting to fifteen thousand dollars ( $15,000 ) . The ignorant sea-faring man ' ( husband ) learned of his wife 's business . He also learned that although she had acquired $15,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no legal right to mortgage it and that since he was head and master ' of the community , it was under his sole control . He objected to her contracts , mortgages and transactions , as being without the knowledge or consent of her husband , ' and the courts decided in his favor by sustaining his objection , so that her business transactions concerning the money she had earned were held to be void . " This happened in Mississippi . " Colonel X. refused to allow his stepson , the only child of Mrs. X. , to visit her . The court upheld him , stating that he had a perfect right , as master of the house , to exclude any person from his doors , and to determine as to whom should be received , as a visitor ' by his wife , whether or not the grounds upon which he acted were sufficient to justify him in a moral point of view . ' " These happened in New York . " Mrs. Reynolds , a married woman in Washington County , for eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home . This boarder , who was suffering from cancer , promised to pay her for her services . The work was difficult and disagreeable , including nursing , bathing , extra washing and , for six years , dressing the cancer twice daily . Upon the boarder 's death the Court decided that Mr. Reynolds was the proper person to collect the compensation for his wife 's labor , as in the absence of some arrangement . the inference of law and of fact would be that she was working for her husband in the discharge of her marital duties . ' " " A Japanese dancing studio on Riverside Drive was raided by the police , and nineteen white girls who were employed there , receiving a commission for each dance , were arrested . Although the girls were found not guilty of any offense , they were subjected to many indignities before the trial . The older girls were put in cells at the police station and the younger girls were sent to the Crittenden Home , where they were garbed in work clothes and made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a room with disreputable persons , both colored and white , while their names and addresses were published in thenewspapers . The men were not detained , there being no law under which they could be held . " The Woman 's Party Takes a Stand The Woman 's Party finally decided that just as in their fight for Votes for Women they had demanded an amendment to the Constitution , they would in their fight for Equal Rights also demand an amendment to the Constitution . They adopted this method for several reasons , one being that a federal amendment is permanent and that it prevents the thing which has twice happened in the case of state laws , that a right has been given and then taken away . Again , a federal amendment means the saving of time , money , and strength of women which forty-eight separate campaigns would enormously dissipate . Then , too , the work in the states ? where the fight centers around each point of inequality with its personal angle instead of around a fundamental principle ? is very difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . At one stroke it wipes out past discriminations and prevents new ones . However , the Woman 's Party has already been working , though with great difficulty , with state legislatures . It will take every method to get Equal  | Rights incorporated into the la W of the land . The Woman 's Party calls the attention of American women to the fact that all interpretations of the law involving women , in our country today are based upon the subject position of women under the English common law instead of on the equal position of women with men . New situations and conditions are always arising which demand a legal interpretation based on equality between men and women rather than on that subject position . There are few women , I take it , in the United States today ? and certainly few women of in- , telligence ? who will deny to women the equal right with their husbands to the guardianship of their children . There are few who will deny women the right to their own earnings ; the right to make contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the right to equal opportunities in schools , universities , government service , the industries , the professions , the arts ; the right to their own identity after marriage . We do not anticipate from so clear-thinking , forward-gazing ? so emancipate a group ? as the women of America , much argument on any one of these scores . If there is a fight ? and our great hope , of course , is that there will be no fight ? it may come on the subject of welfare legislation . The Woman 's Party is not a labor organization and does not pretend to say whether benefit should be obtained by legislation or organization , but it contends that if . those benefits be obtained by legislation , such legislation should apply equally to men and women . The Lucretia Mott amendment will make impossible any legislation with a sex basis ; so that the law demanding an eight-hour day for women only , and the law prohibiting night work for women only , will apply to women and men equally . A great change has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . The Woman 's Party believes that there is a fallacy in special sex legislation , by which it may not work definitely for the betterment of women . In brief , it may result in preventing them from engaging in certain gainful occupations . For instance , where women are enjoined from night work , they may be forced to give up superior night jobs ? which are of course eagerly snapped up by men ? to take inferior day jobs . If you have considered this question , I am sure , reader , that you are going to pause at this paragraph ? appalled . You are going to say to yourself that the Woman 's Party is trying to tear down the fair structure of pro- , tective legislation which a band of noblehearted , self-sacrificing men and women have been , for a quarter of a century , building up . But the Woman 's Party designs no such sinister work of destruction . It does not ask the repeal of any of these laws . It only asks that they apply equally to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucretia Mott amendment will not affect maternity legislation , as it is designed to remove inequalities based on sex , not those based on motherhood . It will not interfere with so-called motherhood pensions , because these pensions are not given to mothers alone . There is an increasing modern tendency toward granting this aid to whichever parent is legally responsible for the child . The trend of our modern world ? and by our modern world , I mean our after-the-war world ? is toward this complete equality . Seven different European Constitutions , new since the war , have embodied this equal rights idea ; those of Germany , Austria , Prussia . CzechoSlovakia , Lithuania , Danzig , and Esthonia . The United States lagged behind other countries of the world in the enfranchisement of its women citizens , and it can not , alas , now lead in this matter of making them equal with men . But it can be among the first ten to do so . It is the hope of the Woman 's Party that it will be number eight .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
