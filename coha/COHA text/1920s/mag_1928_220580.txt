AUBREY BEARDSLEY-Haldane MacFall - Simon &; Schuster ( $6 ) . Some 30 years ago a lanky fop , carrying a pair of lemon-kid gloves , his hair falling about his ears like a hermit 's , attended an ironic ceremony in a London church . The occasion was the unveiling of a bust of John Keats ; after it was over , Aubrey Beardsley " . . . broke away from the throng , and , hurrying across the graveyard , stumbled and lurched awkwardly over the green mounds of the sleeping dead . " It was an ironic ceremony because Artist Beardsley , as Poet Keats had done , was to go southward and die of consumption before he was 26 years old . It is easy to remember him now as he must have looked to the people who had come to church that afternoon-the figure of a frightened , scarecrow dandy , scampering crazily through a graveyard . <P> One of the people who came to church that afternoon was Haldane MacFall , then a London art critic , now the author of a biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beardsley 's family , his schooldays , his friends . It conveys scarcely any of the color of the period , already so remote and glittering , in which Beardsley drew his astonishing pictures for The Yellow Book . Only between the somewhat heavy lines of Author MacFall 's writing can be discovered the eccentric tragedy of Beardsley 's last year of life , when , while he was doing his best drawings for The Savoy , he was living far from London , sick and making dirty pictures . Author MacFall is still the critic ; when he discusses Beardsley 's technique , his methods , his artistic development , he writes more soundly than when he describes , or tries to , Beardsley 's character . The book reproduces many of Artist Beardsley 's works ; the most spectacular , perhaps , is a drawing of a flamboyant lady , leading on a ribbon her meagre , birdfaced , pantalooned monkey .
