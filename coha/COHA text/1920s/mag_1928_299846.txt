Eat somewhat less but eat it more Would you be hearty beyond fourscore . Eat not at all in worried mood Or suffer harm from best of food . Do n't gobble your food but " Fletcherize " <P> Each morsel you eat , if you 'd be wise . Do n't cause your blood pressure e'er to rise By prizing your menu by its size . <P> This little lyric was the popular expression of a fad which made famous its founder , Horace Fletcher , some 20 years ago . John D. Rockefeller took it up and provided a prose version of its message : " Do n't gobble your food . ' Fletcherize , ' or chew very slowly while you eat . " For a time wealthy mothers counted their children 's jaw beats at the table while ragged micks in the streets threatened to " Fletcherize " their little enemies . Gradually , the fad died because people were too lazy or too busy with other things to give the required 45 strokes to every mouthful . One still sees the last adherents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft boiled eggs with sly and dreary routine . <P> Apparently no one attempted a scientific and personal controversion of Fletcherism during the period of its maximum popularity . In fact it was not proved foolish until last week when one Dr. Harold G. O. Hoick , an instructor in physiology at the University of Chicago , announced the results of a four-and-a-half-year test which he had made upon himself . For two and a half years he ate like a pig , whenever he wanted and without undue mastication . Then for a year and a half he became a Fletcherite mincing his mouthfuls with bovine perseverance but not enthusiasm . After that , Dr. Hoick entered another control period of gluttonous and careless chewing , which lasted a half year . <P> During his Fletcherizing interval , Dr. Hoick found that his calory intake per day dropped from its previous 3,200 to 2,800 , a condition probably due to the fact that so much munching made his mouth tired and reduced his appetite . His weight declined 30 pounds . His muscular endurance sank far down , as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His blood pressure , pulse , temperature , sleeping time , and ability in mental multiplication remained unchanged by Fletcherism . The only beneficial effect he found in Fletcherism was a marked increase in his ability to solve chess problems . <P> It is sad to contemplate what the effect of Dr. Hoick 's words must be upon the few remaining Fletcherites . Unaccustomed to normal mastication , these fastidious trenchermen will swill too much and too abruptly and die off in short order . Not so John D. Rockefeller who , unmoved by fads and always conservative , will continue to chew his food soberly and slowly in a modified adaptation of Horace Fletcher 's preposterous method .
