Shrewd Ivar Kreuger has known how to dicker with sensitive governments , greedy governments , when the Swedish Match Trust wanted another monopoly ( TIME , Oct. 1 ) . A fat check here , a guarantee there , and competition has pleasantly evaporated . Thus it was that , last week , the match king of Sweden could look with satisfaction at every major match-consuming country of the world , except one . <P> The exception , of course , was the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics . From Moscow had issued orders for war with the Swedish Match Trust in the world 's markets . And following the orders came inspired reports that the U.S.S.R. had enlisted both the Japanese trust and the Chinese syndicates as allies . And following the propaganda came Russian matches , in boxes , in crates , in carloads , flooding the markets of Europe . <P> Viewing these warlike moves , fearing lest some might think his company endangered , Matchmaker Kreuger last week spoke sharply , scornfully . Said he , through the Swedish International Press Bureau : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndicates do not exist . Russian matches are not good enough to compete with us in European markets . " <P> Said he , through his own company : " The Soviets want to frighten us into a deal . They want us to buy the Russian monopoly with a loan to the U.S.S.R. We shall lend them no money and we will make no matches in Russia , even if the monopoly is handed us as a gift . " <P> With this blast , Matchmaker Kreuger thought he had extinguished the flickering Soviet-Swedish match war . <P> <P> *Swedish Match Co. , Ltd. , a $270,000,000 concern , which not only sells matches but also makes huge loans to needy governments .
