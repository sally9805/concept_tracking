At the first Cabinet meeting following President Harding 's return from Florida , Secretary Mellon renewed his suggestion that surtaxes and incomes be scaled down from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 25% . His argument was that the previous reduction of maximum surtaxes from 65% to 50% had resulted in an increase of $70,000,000 in income tax returns for the first three months of 1923 . He also presented statistics that of the total income tax revenue only about 6% is derived from surtaxes above 25% . <P> Mr. Harding felt , however , that it is too early to judge the effects of the present tax law . In any case he would favor a reduction in the general income tax rather than in the surtax so as to relieve the small tax payer in preference to the very wealthy . <P> All prospects of tax reductions are remote .
