Mustapha Kemal Pasha comes into the limelight under a new guise . Speaking before the Teachers ' Association at Brusa ( across the Bosphorus from Constantinople ) , he exhorted women to educate themselves and to take an active part in the nation 's affairs . <P> He recalled the olden times when Turkish women went to war side by side with their husbands . " At the very dawn of Islamism there were women savants , women of letters , women orators and women who opened schools , lectured , and took a great part in public life . The Moslem religion orders women to educate themselves in the same degree as men ! "
