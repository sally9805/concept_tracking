txt The Harvard coaches put their football team through another heavy day today , virtually completing the drilling of their men for Saturday 's game at New Haven . During the last two days the work was mainly on the defensive , as both Holder and Hubbard returned to the line-up at right end and right tackle . These players have profited by their rest since ' Saturday . However , Greenough still remained at left tackle in place of Harvard 's heavyweight boxing champion , Charley Eastman . The latter was on the field in playing clothes , but did not take part in the drill . It was announced , however , that he will be in his usual place tomorrow , when the team will put the finishing touches on its offense . Lastman was pretty much used up last Saturday , when he and Guilan , the husky Brown tackle . were In opposition most of the time . But he was not hurt , and his rest was one which the coaches had intended . Captain Buell was out again tod:fy in playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the signals from outside the dummy scrimmage . In the play , though , the quarterback work fell on the shoulders of Phil Spalding , Chapin continued in the backfield , alternating with Jack Hammond , who has an even chance with Chapin to start at New Haven . There were two scrimmages today , both of the so-called dummy order . The first ' was between the first and second varsity teams and the scrubs . The work on defense continued . Hammond was coached - thoroughly on defense , as ho has missed all the work Which has been done since the team started drilling Monday . The other workout was for the varsity against the substitutes . Each team did a lot of middle field rushing , and there was considerable work done on protection for kickers and blocking kicks . Lew Gordon was at right end for the substitutes , being on the field for the first time since Saturday . His leg is bothering him slightly , but he will be available by the end of the week . Phil Coburn also was out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard 1i01101 'S , but Fisher has not much hope that he will be able to use the big defensive back in the Crimson 's final game . Spalding got e. lot of life- and speN1 out of the first team today . Although lie ( 1141 most of the work , and gaVe way to Jimmy Lee for only a short time , there is little doubt as to i3uell being the man who will open the game at quarterback for Harvard . Buell Ia no : limping and is able to start and atop without trouble . it is felt that if he has ' any luck at all he will be able to play for the greater part of the tolw . Coach Fisher says that while he thought a few days ago that II:Anmand would be in the game at fullback ahead of Chapin , he is not so sure now that Hammond has not had the defensiv , work the coaches figure he needed before starting away with Owen and Gehrke . Still , with Hammond In the game , Harvard will have a punter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop kicker . With Hammond in the game to run back kicks , Buell would be saved a great deal . Tonight there was a big mass meeting for the students in the Union . Coaches Fisher and Trumbull both impress r1 their hearers with the confidence they have in the trans and urged the undergraduates to have the same faith . Th players attended the meeting , which was most enthusiastic in spite of Pk.rvard 's recent reverses .
