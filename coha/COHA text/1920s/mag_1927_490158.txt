WITH the Beaux Arts Ball only six or five or maybe four days off , I am reprinting the list of costumers recommended by the committee as able to provide suitable garments for the occasion . These , I warn you , rent from $25 to $50 for the evening at present writing . Brooks Costume Company , at 1437 Broadway , leads the list as being the official costumer . Bayer-Schumacher , 67 West Forty-sixth Street ; Broadway Theatrical Costume Company , at 116 West Forty-eighth Street ; Chris-die , 41 West Forty-seventh ; Eaves , 110 West Forty-sixth ; Lane , 133 West Forty-fifth ; Tams , 318 West Forty-sixth ; Schneider Anderson , 229 West Thirty-sixth , and Vanity Fair Costumes , 149 West Forty-eighth , are at your disposal . Lord &; Taylor has some of the Reynolds costumes , designed for this occasion , for sale , as I have told you already . After which proof of exhaustive research , I am amiably turning over my precious space to an affable young woman hereabouts , who is invited to have fun while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? L. L. Household GoddessesUnif orms , Black and White and Red All Over THIS is the season at which the servant problem is more acute than ever , as the baggages , having collected their handsome Christmas tips , are scurrying about in search of better positions , and I have taken the burdens of abandoned housewives on my own broad shoulders , and hope to see no more dinner-parties ruined by their monotonous dirges . They will find that the danger of premature grayness is considerably lessened by a use of the intelligence offices , which are humming with activity this month , and I heartily endorse the small , individual bureaus run by gentle-voiced spinsters who avoid the brutal impersonality of the big bureaus . The standard fee for the service is ten dolWHAT ! NO FASHIONS ? lars , and the small agencies , which charge no more than this , are more conscientious about the matter of references , dress and church membership . ONE of the oldest and most reli- able offices is that of Mrs. Lida Seely , at 38 W. Fifty-second Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants with ? impartial efficiency . It is one of those scrupulous agencies where the mistress must bear inspection before any jewels are sent her in the way of English butlers with an authentic accent . Speaking of the English , Mrs. Louise Illidge , at 126 East Fifty-ninth Street , I has the best small agency for English and Scotch maids who have served various branches of the Guelph family , and the important matters of court etiquette are no secret to her waitresses . Another excellent bureau for Anglo-Saxon inside servants is that of Miss Sarah Hutchinson , at 627 Lexington Avenue , and we recommend that you enter your name at two or more of these if you wish quick service and do not take the ten dollar fee too seriously . ONE of the safest old standbys in the city is Hedlund 's , at 740 Madison Avenue , which supplies servants to fill every correct capacity . The waiting room is one of those places where you are sure to meet all your friends , and can conveniently study fashions in gowns and fashions in maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the women who have always a flock of charity ball tickets to sell . ) Another of the conservative agencies which promise that the maids they supply will have no use for your gold-tipped cigarettes is the Gordon Agency , at 132 East Fifty-eighth Street , run by a Miss Brown , who learned to wrestle with the domestic problem in the role of housekeeper . English and Scotch maids are her specialty , though she will supply you with any color or race you may prefer . AND NOW , to get around to the problem of manning your house in more literal terms . R. T. Hutchinson , who was once a gentleman 's gentleman himself , is said to inspect his applicants with the stony eye of an adept , and to supply the last word in butlers and housemen . Besides the New York office , at 516 Madison Avenue , there is an English branch , which exports promising material to America and secures them positions of good social standing . The Hutchinson butlers , we understand , have a way of refusing to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all in all , they seem the most efficient . Another excellent bureau is Harry Turner 's Agency , at 789 Lexington Avenue , which supplies butlers guaranteed to be pure cockney . Lest I seem prejudiced against the southern races , may I state that I adore dark men , and that Madame Jacquin , at 602 Sixth Avenue , will supply as many soubrette lady 's maids as you wish ? Rouxel , at 68 West Thirty-seventh Street , is another pan-Gallic bureau , but I believe that at all the . French agencies any countryman is patriotically welcomed , and the selective process is left largely to the employer . If you are interested in German or Viennese cooks , Lang and Boecherer , at 64 West Forty-eighth Street , has a good name among the large agencies , and for Scandinavians , you will find a fine assortment of straw-haired , brachycephalic types at Emil Leffler 's , 832 Lexington Avenue . A glance into Donnelly 's Red Book will show you a number of bureaus which supply Orientals of any desired religion and caste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in efficiency , though the Japanese Employment Agency , at 112 West Forty-fourth Street , is highly commended to we for bachelor uses . IT IS unfortunate that the bureaus are divided on the wholly irrational grounds of nationality , and most of those already mentioned can also he depended on for polylingual governesses and nurses . Of course , the very best upper servants never reach the agencies at all , as they are signed up years before a probable demise bv eager friends of the family . But very good housekeepers , governesses , companions and nurses can he obtained through Louise Wachter , at 624 Madison Avenue ; Mrs. Pillsbury , of 507 Fifth ; and Miss Sherlick , in the Putnam Building . The last-named agency is one of the very few who specialize in baby nurses ? most of these are monopolized by the doctors , who send them from one patient to another as soon as the child reaches the pantaloon stage . For governesses , the Home Bureau , at 36 West Thirty-ninth Street , is less smart , but very reliable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assortment . The chauffeur problem is one of the most difficult of all , and there is a dearth of reliably exclusive agencies . Most of the small bureaus content themselves with furnishing the inside of your house , and the only specialist of whom we know is Mr. Buell , down at the old Brewster carriage house , who supplies drivers for most of the Hispano-Suizas about town . Do not apply here if you arc trying to rut down on the budget this year ! THE ENTIRE problem can be much simplified by calling in an expert who is in touch with all the agencies and will furnish your house complete , as well as attending to such matters as moving , opening the summer cottage , and other duties . The best-known of these invaluable souls Miss Ellin Buckler , who can be reached at Chelsea 6640 . Inside servants , all white , occidental , and members of the church , are her particular field . ' THERE are persistent rumbles of a revolution in the whole domestic system . One ex-butler is making plans , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with servants for twenty-five dollars a year . In the meantime , there is that admirable organization known as Scientific Housekeeping , at 158 East Forty-seventh Street , which is trying to raise the standards of domestic help to as high a plane as that of trained nursing . They guarantee to fill the most eccentric orders within a week , and continue to act as go-between after the maid has been engaged . The hopeful mistress might do well to drop in at Mrs. Richard Boardman 's private home for luncheon some day  --  here she may see the servants being put over the hurdles in the test school . She may sample the puff pastry of the cook , study the waitress 's technique at first hand , and run her finger over Mrs. Boardman 's piano for dust before she comes to a decision . Any of the servants may be engaged and fifteen hundred have already passed through the school . The maid who lives in must pay board and rent out of her wages , and work according to a strict schedule , made out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Budget Service is provided which attempts to break up the entente cordiale between the cook and grocer for the purpose of running up bills , and the arrangement gives the maid time off at just the hours when she would be trying on your evening wraps or flirting with the iceman . Scientific Housekeeping has eliminated the necessity for weekly or yearly house-cleaning and will bring all its social tact and skill to bear on the problem of discharging your cook for you . THE MATTER of wages is an- other matter into which I have been prying , and I can tell you that if 10u pay the butler more than $150 a month , you are making a great mistake ; that a second man deserves from $90 to $100 ; a personal maid , $75 to $85 ; child 's nurse , $90 to $100 ; parlor maid , $70 to $75 ; waitress , $75 to $100 ; cook , $90 to $150 , with $110 as the average ; governess , $100 , and chauffeur , $150 . THE PROBLEM of servants ' dress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report that maids ' fashions are trailing along in the van of our own . At 19 West Fifty-seventh , Joseph 's costumes , for instance , show a distinct Lanvin influence , and her tight-fitting corsages inevitably suggest the robe de style . They are made very , very short , and taffeta is the favorite fabric . Madame Joseph is inducing her clients  --  they simply are n't customers  --  to dress their dining-room maids in colors to harmonize with the decorations , and is showing claret , green , and even yellow uniforms . The accompanying aprons should be of embroidered ecru net for evening  --  organdie for day-wear . With these dresses , the maids wear very sheer nude silk stockings and black satin slippers . The caps should have long streamers  --  and these come in organdie with aprons to match for $5 . The taffeta dresses , if made to order , may cost as much as $85 , but they can be had in mohair in a wide selection of colors for $18 . These are also appropriate for the parlor maid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am seriously considering going into service to he able to wear one . For personal maids , Joseph shows taffeta or silk poplin uniforms  --  invariably of black  --  at from $18 to $28 . Some very cunning pleated taffeta aprons at $8 accompany these , but a personal maid , never , never wears a cap . It would be advisable to wear the real pearls when you go to Joseph 's . SAKS-FIFTH AVENUE has a large ready-to-wear uniform department , and is specializing in black uniforms , as the more conservative families are certainly abandoning the pastel shades for evening . Saks emphasizes the straight-line dress for maids in every capacity , and has silk mohair dresses , suitable for waitresses or parlor maids , at $17.50 . They are also showing some black satin dresses at $29.75 , which they recommend as more durable than taffeta , and crespe de chine dresses , which come a little higher . They have a large assortment of aprons of different shapes  --  the plumper maids appear best in pointed aprons , the slender little chits in round ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aprons may be acquired and should warm the heart of any waitress at all . Saks are showing purple silk aprons which would look rather well against a black background that was not too expansive , and these come at $3.95 . For nurses they recommend velour coats with capes at $65 and velvet bonnets with very becoming streamers at $10.50 . The charming nurses ' veils which English women demand , and which give them an interesting resemblance to nuns , are priced at $14.50 , and come in several shades . The printer , who does n't understand me at all , feels that this has gone on long enough , so you will have to wait until next week for my expose What the Well Dressed Second Man Will Wear .
