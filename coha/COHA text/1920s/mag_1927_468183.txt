THE call that went up some fifty years ago urging women " to come out of the kitchen " was so enticing that the effect of their wholesale response has assumed almost the proportion of a stampede . The sudden realization of their new-found powers in untried fields and the joy of the new freedom from the confines of the traditional sphere seem to have propelled many of them so far from home that they have forgotten what it is they left behind them . And it is of this that I should like to remind them . After reading innumerable articles written by women who argue that economic independence is the summum bonum for mothers , I strongly suspect that most of them never honestly tried the experiment of staying at home to see what satisfactions may be derived from experiences and relationships there . Else how can they ignore or skirt so gaily the whole question of what the career does to the children ? That , it seems to me , is the crux of the whole matter in any consideration of careers and mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The question is not " What right has a woman to pursue a career that takes her away from home the greater part ofeach day ? " but " What price career ? " what does she give up for it and what does she get out of it ? What effect does it have upon her home relationships and her life as a mother ? Every reasoned choice in life is a matter of determining values . What is an extravagance for you may be a necessity for me . If I regard it as a necessity and think I must have it , I may be willing to make any sacrifice to get it . I know an able professional woman , the mother of two children , who regards a career as a necessity for one of her temperament , taste , education , and experience . She is willing to make certain sacrifices for it , she admits , such as social gaieties and the trimmings of life , like window curtains and embroidered linens , for instance . But what , I sometimes wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rest of us consider essential to our happiness ? What about the time she has to spend away from the children ? is that nothing ? Does she ever wish that she might be with them at meal times when their sense of humor is usually at its best ? Does n't she ever envy the hired housekeeper who is there to hear the news when they come bursting in from school ? I know no more important moment in the day than that in which my small son comes pelting into the house , shouting for " Mom " at the top of his lungs . " What is it ? I answer , thinking that something tremendously important has happened . " Oh , nothing , " he lets me down , " I just wanted to know if you were there . " " Being there " is the greatest contribution we mothers can make in the lives of our children . Being there , not to meddle or control , but to dispense comfort and consolation , to receive confidences , to share a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become very involved and have serious consequences later on ; to scotch bad habits before they grow big , to build up good ones by tactful diversions , and to develop taste in the arts , in behavior , and conversation . Perhaps the business-going mother can do all these things in her off hours , but , as these are the early morning and late evening ones , when people of all ages are least inclined to be amenable , I ha ' me doots ! Most of the professionally engaged mothers I know admit that they have had to give up all entertaining . They say it with considerable pride in the sacrifice . But will their children be as proud of this sacrifice when they find out that everybody has open house but they , that they are always going to other people 's houses and never asking others to come to theirs ; when they get to college and find they are sadly lacking in the social graces because they never had the opportunity to develop them at home ? They can acquire these at boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Another one of those that evade he issue . College presidents and school princi ) als are so frequently being quoted as to ; eem almost unanimous in declaring that he standards maintained in their inititutions of learning can be no higher ham those of the homes and the commu'hies from which the students come . iVater can not rise above its source . Ind , yet , how many countless homesthere are that dump their children on the schools , expecting them to teach and train their offspring in everything from manual work to manners . Is anything still being taught at Mother 's knee ? ( The evolution of woman 's knee is a subject for a sociological study in itself . ) What is a home for in the life of a modern adolescent who goes from boarding school to camp and back again ? A stopping-off place for repairs ; a rest cure , an outfitting establishment where they sew the name-tape in your clothes free of charge . " Hello ! Good-by ! " Does anybody profess to know that child ? He is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a name in the books at home ? I have just been reading an article by one of the foremost psychiatrists in the country on the needs of the growing boy and girl , in which he stresses the fact that each child must be studied and handled as an individual -- -that , where one may need social opportunities , the other requires enforced rest ; where one is over studious and must be diverted from books , the other requires tactful prodding and persistent holding to the task to develop steadfastness of character . Is it within the range of many schoolmasters to give this individual attention , to show the patience and endurance which is necessary to see young people through their " difficulties " ? Has any mother the right to ask others to do this for her ? To me it seems an outrageous imposition . It is part and parcel of the great modern game of " passing the buck . " II We each of us know the kind of home we should like to create and the sort of children we should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to approximate any ideal when you are on guard all the time to see that it is not dragged down or compromised . How can we be sure , then , if we delegate the care of our children to others , that our ideals are going to be upheld ? Is it really possible to find someone outside the family circle who can help establish the family " tone " which you wish to have pervade your home ? Will your substitute take the pains to make your children independent when it is so much easier to do things for them ? How do you know that she will he intellectually honest with them and not stuff their minds with cock-and-bull stories and befuddle their thinking powers with superstitions and untruths ? There are much more sinister faults in mother 's helpers than failing to sterilize the bottle properly , and faults which are far more difficult to detect . Will not the motherwith-a-job , in short , either have to resign herself to accepting another 's standards for her family or find herself in constant friction where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate ? As everybody knows , it takes an immense amount of money to substitute for a mother 's labor in the home . A wife-and-mother represents , more than ever , the most economical service any man can secure . Some women , therefore , find it beyond their means to engage in mental work and to pay someone else to do their manual work at home for them . For purposes of this discussion we shall , for obvious reasons , have to consider only the households in which one or both parents are earning enough to enable them to engage expert help to attend to all the physical needs of the family . Granted , then , that the children are adequately housed , clothed , and fed ? do they suffer any loss if their mother comes and goes with father to business every day ? Is there no danger of introducing an institutional " flavor " when all the home tasks are attended to by paid workers ? Why is it that babies in institutions , who have the most expert care , do not flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm-hearted tenement mothers ? Nobody knows the reason , but I have a suspicion that affection plays the same mysterious partin spiritual well-being that vitamines do in physical health . How do children regard the mother who heaves in the morning after a hasty breakfast and returns at night with their father , I wonder ? Do they think of her as I found my son regarding the mother 's helper who was with me one year when he was very little ? " She was my mother once , " he explained to a friend when she came to see us a few years later . I confess I am rather pleased to be reinstated by now . The women who advocate a job for all mothers talk very much like an Englishwoman I once knew who was extolling their " Governess system . " " What respect we have for our parents ! " she exclaimed . " American children have no respect for their parents ; they call them the most insulting names , like ' the old cheese ' or ' the boss . ' But English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of their parents to become so familiar . Teatime was a great event for us , for that was the hour we might spend with our parents . We were always especially dressed up for the occasion and were on our best behavior . Our parents seemed like inaccessible gods to us and we always had tremendous respect for them . " To which an American father answered , for the best of his kind , " I 'd rather be a circus than a god to my children ! " Familiarity does not have to breed contempt ? if the familiar sights and sounds are conducive to respect . It is really a great test of character to stand well in the eyes of your children ? a test that is far easier to pass when you are n't around so much ! It 's a tedious business ? this of being monitor , cook , guide , policeman , buyer , general-houseworker , and stocking-mender for a bunch of squirming little nuisances . But it is a mistake to think that by turning our backs on it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can solve the whole problem of a mother 's relation to her children . There is a great deal more involved than hiring efficient , trained people to do these irksome things for us . And all these considerations are far more difficult to write about than the logic of woman 's economic position because they are so intangible , so mixed up with emotions and sentiments and memories of one 's own childhood , and also because they involve the use of two words so sadly in disrepute these days : duty and responsibility . It really requires a great deal more courage to write of this phase of the mother-career problem than of women 's rights because you lay yourself open to ridicule as being a sentimental old fudge . I dare do it only because I am an ardent feminist who regards it as axiomatic that a woman has every right to pursue any career she may elect . But to this I would add the corollary that when she chooses to bring children into the world , they have a prior claim upon her attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and attention and can still hold her own in the competitive world outside her home , all credit to her . But how many women can really do justice to two such absorbing interests ? It requires a remarkably buoyant personality and great physical endurance ? and I do n't know any man who would be fool enough to try it . One of the chief difficulties , in my Dpinion , in the way of making a satisfactory compromise between an all-day job tnd a happy household is this conflict in nterests . When I am engaged on some mtside task ? editorial work , a publicity ! ampaign , or whatever else it may bemd must concentrate my efforts to make t a success , I have found that my . children become distractions and interuptions . I have no time to play with hem . I am always " dreaming " as hey call it ? thinking of things remote mm them and not taking any interest a their immensely important affairs . heir prattle , which once amused me lore than a three-ring circus , becomesannoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-determining small people , disturb my adult thoughts ; I become irritable , and they respond to my irritations with their own brand , which is even worse ? and the fireworks are off ! I may be wrong , but I think it is a rare person who can keep her adult interests and her interest in her children in separate compartments so that they do not interfere with one another . I have known only a few women who could do it successfully . IV The choice between the devil or the deep sea seems an easy one compared with that which confronts us women to-day . If we really had to choose between continuing a career on which we had started and marrying the man we love with the hope of bearing him children , it would be a cruel world indeed . But I do not think we must make this choice . I do not think we must cut off our careers entirely . Rather , I think we must look at the whole matter of careers and motherhood from a new angle , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real part of a full life . If we " take a long view of life , " as the vocational guidance experts exhort us to do , and plan our lives to include the possibility of marriage and children as well as the satisfaction of our special talents , we may manage to pick out the sort of work which will enable us to make a happy combination of the two , should the opportunity present itself , later on . Work which exacts our regular attendance at an office or a laboratory is , of course , the most difficult to adjust . But , even here , the woman who has gone far enough in her field before she marries to be known , at least among her confreres , for the quality of her work , will have something marketable to offer in the work-a-day world at any time , provided she does not allow herself to " grow stale " during the infancy of her children . It 's the old story of the mouse-trap all over again if any of us can do any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . What 's more which is a far more daring thing to say ? we can stipulate that we will give only as much time to satisfying that demand as we can afford to give after we have attended to the needs of our family . More part-time jobs is not what we need so much as more women with a real contribution to bring to the marketplace . The mother who yearns over her children and the mother who earns are the two extremes . Here , as everywhere , the mean is golden . Every mother owes it to her family as well as to herself to have a very real interest outside of her home circle of activities . But , she also owes it to her children to keep that interest subordinated to her interest in them . Her aim , it seems to me , should be so to adjust her life as to be a full-time mother on a part-time job rather than a part-time mother on a full-time job . I would suggest that she reduce her vocation to the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore it to its full importance as a vocation when they are in school most of the day and no longer require so much of her time and attention . It can be done . I know any number of women who have done it . They spent from six to ten years , after graduating from college , in the pursuit of their career . Then they began to produce children and they went into that inimitable experience with all the zest , all the enthusiasm and determination to make good with which ever they began a new piece of work . Their spare time and strength ( which is often precious little when children are babies ) they gave to " keeping their hand in " their vocational interest . This meant , of course , giving up practically all social life in the daytime , and much of it in the evenings ; substituting the reading of technical journals for magazines and technical books for fiction . But that does not seem a hardship to the woman who really enjoys her careering . And then , when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursery school , if one was nearby , they had their innings . No sentimental weeping when " the last little one " went out the garden gate to school , no moaning " because the house seemed so empty , " but a happy effort to see how they could best . begin building up their careers so as to have them in full swing by the time they were put on the parent 's retired list . Nothing is more pathetic than the middle-aged mother whose children have been her only interest in life . When they have left home to go to college , or to start homes of their own , she is left high and dry without anything to do or anybody to fuss over . So she joins a woman 's club or a lecture course to improve her mind , or she goes in heavily for social work for which she has had no previous training , or she goes into a decline in order to win back the attention of the family , which seems to be diverted in other directions . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren while her daughter pursues her career may keep her out of mischief for a while but , sooner or later , the woman who has had no interest in life outside of her children and her home becomes , if not a public charge , then a private one ! V The girls who graduate from college to-day are not going to have to suffer the conflicts we graduates of ten or twenty years ago have been going through , and for the graduates of ten or twenty year hence it will be still easier . There are several reasons for this : In the firs1 place , everybody looks at life much more frankly and fearlessly to-day , admitting quite unblushingly , that motherhood a thing to be reckoned with ; secondly we pioneers of the first quarter of this century have not worked in vain t ( educate the world to accept us in thi professions ; and finally there is develop ing a new science of child study and education which is opening a fine array of new occupations for women interested in children which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those which they have taken up heretofore . Those of us who graduated from college in the first decade grew up without benefit of vocational guidance and in a madly feministic era . We claim all labor for our field , " we cried with Olive Schreiner , and we completely overlooked the labor of childbirth ! Everything in the world was vastly more interesting than bringing up children ( anybody could do that ) but we ? we would show the world what women really were good for . That was the campus-attitude when I went to college some fifteen years ago , when women were still subjected to the curriculum of men 's colleges to show that they had brains . Great changes have taken place since then , and the World War hastened them . It showed that women would do almost anything if they had to , and it put a premium upon men and children . Also , the physical and mental examinations of the soldiers revealed such distressing handicaps which could have been prevented or cured in early childhood that the doctors and psychologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't their parents know better ? " Why did n't they ? Because the doctors and the psychologists twenty-one years before 1914 knew very little themselves and because , until the last five years , they made little or no effort to share their findings with the parents . But in these most recent years there has been a tremendous movement sweeping from coast to coast to educate parents to learn their trade . Although there were rumblings long before this among parents of all classes , who asked why everybody was always blaming them for everything that was wrong with their children and nobody ever told them what to do , it might have been many years before they were heardand answered but for the memorials of two philanthropic women in whose name a fortune was set aside to promote the welfare of children and the education of their mothers . The Foundations created under the will of Mrs. Lizzie Merrill Palmer in Detroit and to the memory of Mrs. Laura Spelman Rockefeller in New York have done more to further the enlightenment of parents in a comparatively short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , one of the reasons why their works are so fruitful is that they are satisfying a demand and not trying to force something upon an unwilling people . The movement for parental education is spreading not only through child-study groups , parent-teacher associations , and university-extension courses , but through the schools and colleges themselves . The Iowa Child Welfare Research Station , organized in 1917 , has been followed by Institutes for Child Welfare Research in various parts of the country where important information concerning children , their nature and their needs , is gathered by experts in hygiene , psychology , nutrition , etc. , and disseminated through various channels . At Vassar , the Department of Euthenics ( the science of efficient living ) conducted an Institute last summer which was attended by some forty-five mothers and teachers who were learning , and twenty children between the ages of seventeen months and five years who were being observed in a Nursery School rigged up for the five-weeks occasion . The cry of a baby on a college campus is an epoch-making sound , indeed ! At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women 's Interests ? a name no more complicated than its object ? to try to find some happy solutions at least for our daughters , if not for us , if we would have both careers and children . The history of the development of professional schools in this country reveals the fact that each one was developed from the apprentice system . Prospeetive doctors and lawyers , as late as the middle of the last century , attached themselves to some practicing lawyer or doctor and learned what they could by watching him work and reading what they could find to read . Engineering , architecture , journalism , and , finally , business , has each , in turn , been lifted from the plane of the trade that was learned largely by imitation and trialand-error to that of the profession with a systematic course of training covering a period of years and meriting recognition from a university . Braver souls than I have predicted that the next professional school to be developed will be that of Parenthood . Then , perhaps , the wish which Miss Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its first chief , expressed on the occasion of Vassar 's Fiftieth Anniversary in 1915 ? that the universities establish graduate departments of research in the affairs of the home ? will be realized . The revelations of the laboratory are showing us women how important are the early years of a child when we lay down the foundations of its whole personality , and that it is a thousand times easier to make good beginnings than effective reforms . When the instances of child-delinquency and of divorce increase steadily , and the age of youthful criminals and illegitimate mothers grows lower with the years , does it not seem as though the best minds might well devote some of their thinking to the causes of these things , and so affect the education that is disseminated in our land through the schools and colleges , especially their night schools , summer sessions , and extension courses , as to improve the quality of our homemaking ? It often seems as though the task that lies nearest is the one that is most easily overlooked . So ? there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ? not only in research and education , health laws and labor laws , but ? in its citadel , the home . What I have learned in ten years of being a mother in order to keep my family well and happy and our lives filled to the brim with things to do , to enjoy , and to think about is only a tithe of what I wish I might have learned , and yet it is far more than ever I put into my head in all the years of my formal education . And it is the more pleasurable , this learning , because it all seems so purposeful , so necessary , and important . Can many men or women say that of the work they do in the business world ? Never did the preparing of food to pour into ravenous little tummies seem as futile as pouring words into the bottomless pit of a newspaper often seemed when I spent my days in that occupation . Everything that makes up children 's diet is important , and even more so is everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is felt and acted upon by those tender little things we used to call hearts before the days when the mechanists lumped us all into bundles of behavior . Does n't it behoove us , therefore , to make certain that what we feed them is the right food to grow on , physically , mentally , and spiritually ? Moreover , one must consider the value in character building to the parent of staying on the job and remaining an individual unsubmerged by the demands of house and family . Anyone who has ever been chastened by the experience of being a parent will admit that it is one of life 's severest disciplines . The physical experience of bringing a child into the world is not what develops the finer qualities in women which Goethe , for one , apotheosized in the second part of " Faust " ? it is the process of being a mother " for better or for worse " through the many years and keeping free and flexible the individual mind and personality . Much will need to be done to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . Housing will have to be adapted to easier housekeeping ; ways and means will have to be found to eliminate some of the endless detail involved in providing three meals a day ; and , most important of all , husbands and children will have to learn that mothers have rights which must be respected . But by the time all these things have been made right for her , let us hope that she will have realized that there is still a great deal she owes in return , and above all that there is small satisfaction in bringing children into the world only to turn them over to other people to enjoy . VI What is there about a career that makes it the will-o ' - the- wisp so many women would pursue ? Does it seem so attractive or thrilling only in contrast with the domestic life ? Is it the money return it ' brings in ( which often diminishes in proportion as the career becomes disinterested ! ) or other worldly recognition of their powers that women want , or do they seek careers solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is the human need of doing something that is their own , something that they know muss be said or done , that drives them on in its pursuit . It is , also , the need of the I. trained mind to enjoy continuity of thought and action and to prevent its being splintered into fragments by the frittering , repetitious details of housekeeping . This sort of continuity comes only when set tasks can be carried through to completion ? to the publication of a book , the hanging of a picture , the conclusion of an experiment . As soon as women assume a professional attitude toward everything they do ? from housekeeping to business ? their problems of combining careers and motherhood will begin to adjust themselves more easily . They will have latest by which to measure their longing for something outside the domestic routine ; and if it seems to them that the home must be the scene ? for a time at least ? of their principal labors , they will have the assurance that , with all the new knowledge which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can bring to this vital task the intensity of interest and the professional skill which will make homemaking in the true sense a career . Every decision that any mother makes to engage in a career must be an individual one , depending upon innumerable factors in her own family situation ? such as , for instance , her husband 's earning capacity , his temperament , and his standard of living ; whether they live in a small town , a suburb , or a city ; and , above all , whether her talent or abilities are of sufficient magnitude to exact any sacrifice from the family to enable her to develop them . Each of us must evaluate all these factors ? and many more ? for ourselves . We must do it honestly and with an open mind as well as an unselfish spirit . That is , we must be willing to admit to ourselves ? even if we do n't want to admit it to anyone else ? what the true motive is behind our career seeking . We shall all probably have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if we do it in the spirit of the laboratory , admit when we have failed , start anew with a different set of conditions , analyze our difficulties so that we may avoid them another time , then the chances are that before long we shall arrive at some sort of an adjustment that will give every member of the family a full share of personal freedom as well as responsibility for the common good .
