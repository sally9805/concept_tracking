Having toured 5,000 miles of Europe in his " vest-pocket airplane , " the Yankee Doodle , George Kern Jr. , son of a meatpacker , retired , returned to the U. S. last fortnight to show the incredulous an air flivver which weighs only 575 pounds , costs $2,100 , flies for three cents a mile , crosses the Alps . <P> It was as he was flying across Europe in a commercial airliner recently , that Tourist Kern met , as fellow-passenger , Willibald Seypelt , German flier during the War . Enthusiastically , Pilot Seypelt told the U. S. tourist of a tiny plane made in Stuttgart , after the designs by one Hans Klemm . Together they went to Stuttgart , found a little monoplane , with long low-set wings and a short body , the latest idea in European airplane design . Only 22 feet long , it had a wingspread of 43 feet . A 29-h.p . Klemm-Daimler motor furnished the power to carry about 400 pounds . <P> Tourist Kern , enthusiastic , wrote a check ; in two and one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seypelt they set out over Europe , over nine different countries , 5,000 miles Total expenditures for gas , oil , etc. : $180 . In the U. S. , where gasoline and oil are cheaper , the cost would have been no more than one cent a mile . <P> " It performed satisfactorily in every way , " said Flier Kern . " On New Year 's Day we crossed the Alps at the point where Austria , Italy , and Jugoslavia join , making the trip from Udine , Italy , to Vienna on schedule in spite of the fact that we were advised not to undertake it by the Italian authorities . The plane had dual controls and one of its features is that it handles so easily you could land on a dime . As a matter of fact , one time coming down unexpectedly into a bora , as the strong winds of northern Italy are called , we landed within sixty feet . The Yankee Doodle carries ten gallons of gasoline and that gives it a range of about 475 miles . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting more . <P> For the first time in history , without the feverish stimulus of war , airplane factories are buzzing , lathes are churning , propellers are spinning . Safely ensconced behind the spectacular flights that jostle one another on the front pages of the newspapers , the airplane industry is humming with orders . The common people are taking to the air . <P> A survey conducted by Popular Science Monthly shows that the actual costs of flying among amateur pilots is much lower than generally supposed . Planes cost from $400 to $12,000 , with the average around $3,000 , about the cost of a Pierce-Arrow automobile . Hangar rental costs from $15 to $50 a month , with the average $25 . <P> <P> Flying cost , with upkeep included , runs from three cents a mile to 25 , with the average nine . <P> Among U. S. air-flivver owners are : <P> Automobile Dealer D. E. McDaneld , aged 48 , of Pasadena , Cal. ; he learned to fly at 45 and now goes to business by air . <P> Paul Crippen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built himself for $800 and a second he bought second-hand for $750 . <P> H. S. Hilliker , Buffalo businessman , travels in his Stinson-Detroiter , which cost him $11,000 f.o.b . Detroit .
