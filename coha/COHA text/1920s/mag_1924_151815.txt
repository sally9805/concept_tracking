Tsao-Kun , President of China and powerful Tuchun ( War Lord ) , was said to be " sick and unhappy " in his Peking palace . <P> Once men trembled at his word ; now he is a " prisoner , not permitted to see communications sent to him ... a manipulated and bossed figurehead ... in the hands of more astute and cleverer selfish men . " <P> The President rose to greatness from humble beginnings . When he was a plain Tuchun things were easier . Now he is President , " anything but a scholar " and not understanding the intricacies of politics , he is at a grave disadvantage . Instead of being surrounded by an army eager to obey his command he is surrounded by an army of " corrupt , selfish , intriguing and clever " politicians eager to command him . This is why he is " sick and unhappy . "
