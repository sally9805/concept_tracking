SENATOR BORAH has exhibited his usual U courage and insight in insisting that if President Harding does intervene in Europe he interv'erle on behalf of a genuine remedy rather than dicate on another page our own conception of the conditions to which an adequate remedy should e ? nform ( they are essentially the same as Mr. behalf of some temporary palliative . We in ? rah 's ) , but it is extremely improbable that the ProPosals of the administration will dig down to the roots of the difficulty . The chances are that the French government is not ready as yet to eacuate the Rhineland and to abandon its sane- us under the Treaty even though it secured in return a substantial sum in cash and an entire remission of its foreign debt . The administration W. %lid find itself subjected to an almost irresistible Influence to accept something less , and it would ! lost certainly yield , if by yielding it could ob Tih the credit of a superficial triumph . Neither the President nor his Secretary of State , although they have understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of tie Treaty , ty have ever understood the impossibilityof expecting anything but chaos from the attempt to write into the public law of Europe such a combination of violence and injustice . They had a wonderful opportunity in the spring of 1921 to discredit the Treaty of Versailles , but they used their influence in favor of the London Agreement which embodied all the poisons and vices of the Treaty . It is Germany 's necessarily feeble , halfhearted and insincere effort to carry out that agreement which has ruined her without benefiting any of her creditors . THE proceedings looking toward the impeachment of Attorney General Daugherty have been thoroughly discredited by Representative Keller 's petulance in refusing to continue the presentation of his charges unless the committee would permit him to read a statement denouncing its partisanship . What good such a statement would have done we can not imagine . That the committee was thoroughly partisan is clear from the dispatches . The testimony of former Attorney General Wickersham demonstrating the unfitness of W. J. Burns to , be head of the Bureau of Investigation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We read in the Times : " The committee wrangled long during Mr. Wicker-sham 's testimony as , indeed , it did all day . " The climax came when Chairman Volstead , in a personal statement , cast doubt on the good faith of the complainants , and anticipated the decision against them .. Apparently Mr. Keller , like the rest of us , was prepared for an orderly whitewashing party , but objected to having the pail of whitewash prematurely thrown in his face . THE Lausanne Conference is the most perfect example of dramatic irony as yet put on the records of diplomacy . The French have sold their historic position of defenders of the Catholics in the Levant for the mess of Syrian pottage . The English are raising one clean hand for the protection of Christian minorities and trying to conceal the other , stained with the oil of Mosul and the blood of Mesopotamia . The United States is making the usual clamor about extraterritoriality for its missionaries and the open door for its trade , all in the name of humanity , while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Turks are standing by the Fourteen Points , including freedom of the seas which is the only name for freedom of the straits . It is the Wits ' Misery and the World 's Madness . AMONG those heard in opposition to the confirmation of Pierce Butler to the Supreme Court , most certainly should be the American Association of University Professors . In the years of the persecution of teachers of wisdom and courage who tried to tell the truth about the Allies , Germany , Russia or the war profiteers no one showed greater prejudice , malice and violence against such individuals as fell under his power than Pierce Butler . If the American Professors in their corporate capacity have the self-assertion which we grant even to dormice , they will protest against the elevation to supreme judicial position of this colleague of Arthur Guy Empey in the practice of the motto , Treat ' em rough . It may be said that Mr. Butler 's behavior as regent of the University of Minnesota has no bearing on his fitness to be a Justice of the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler proved himself unworthy of the society of gentlemen is a sufficient reason to oppose his membership in that distinguished company , quite apart from the question of his judicial temperament . The Association of Professors is in a favorable position to point out to the Senate the functional uselessness of learning in some situations , when its possessor is a purblind sycophant and a cowardly bully . F the subsidy bill fails of enactment , as it probably will , it will be largely on account of a new sensitiveness to public opinion on the part of the leaders of the Republican party . Enough votes could probably be mustered under the party spur to jam the bill through . But the public is aroused as it has never been before to the indecency of putting through contentious measures by the votes of lame ducks . The subsidy bill is worse than a contentious measure . It is one that was as definitely repudiated by the voters as any measure can be under our system . For the leaders of the Republican party to rely on the letter of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present the enemies of the party with one of the best talking points they ever had . We are quite certain they will not do it . // And in a way we regret it . Nothing could happen that would more forcibly impress the public with the necessity of a constitutional amendment abbreviating the period between the elections and the transfer of legislative power to the new Congress . THE failure of the Baltic disarmament conference has been ascribed by the press to a multitude of causes , none of them the really crucial one . Russia was willing to cut her army drastically provided that Poland and the other Baltic states cut their armies proportionately . She was willing to refer all disputes , with the exception of certain minor territorial questions , to arbitration . Poland was very desirous of promoting the settlement of disputes by peaceful means . But she would not accept the proportional army reduction . She would not do it because she could not and still keep her engagements with France . The precise terms of the Franco-Polish military convention are not known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require Poland to maintain an army sufficient to be a distinct menace to Germany if any troublesome stirrings should arise in that quarter . Poland can not afford to maintain a large army . It does her no good , for however large an army she has , Russia will have a larger one . And the military competition with Russia is a distinct menace to peace . But peace is not the object of the French system of military convention . S OME weeks ago the New Republic called attention to the injustice of the action of the Methodist Conference of Nebraska in retiring the Rev. J. a M. Buckner merely because of a difference of opinion as to the orthodoxy of his published beliefs . Since then the religious press has actively discussed the case , and the action of Bishop Stuntz and the Nebraska Conference has been explained , defend ' ed and attacked . The substantial truth of the in dictment , drawn by the Rev. Mr. Buckner against his judges , remains unimpeached- , and in only one respect did the defenders of the Bishop convict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being entirely fair . Its title , Methodism vs ' Intellectual Honesty , did imply that Bishop Stunti and the Nebraska Conference represented the whole Methodist Church ; and this implication went too far . But we trust that those Methodists who protest against the attribution of responsi bility for the action of the Nebraska Conference to the whole Methodist Church will do what they can to have the Church pass upon the action of the Conference . The General Conference of the Church does not meet until May I , 1924 , but when it does meet , it has full power to review any act of a state conference and to reverse or annul it . When the next General Conference assembles , it should expressly relieve the Methodist Church from any share of responsibility for the act of the Nebraska Conference . This is the only way of dealing with the issue which will cure the injustice done to Mr. Buckner . PROBABLY the most effective and unanswerable comment passed upon Mr. Buckner 's retirement is that written by Professor Robert W. Rogers of Drew Theological Seminary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends by saying : " I am sorry about Bishop Stuntz and the Nebraska Conference . They have together done us a great disservice . I am sorry also for Mr. Buckner and his wife . They are sorely wounded . . . . But sad as the case is , let us be patient -- as Mr. Buckner is setting us the example . If we , who think his views are much like our own , are patient , we shall win through with them , if they are true . . . . The Church will Survive , us all , and let us hope that it may tomorrow have wiser servants than Bishop Stuntz and the Nebraska Conference . " This is good advice . The Reverend Mr. Buckner and his supporters should be patient , but they should also be insistent that the injustice be remedied , and even their patience might have some limits if the Methodist Church at its next general convocation does not repudiate Bishop Stuntz . THERE is a sardonic humor in the Turkish Proposal that the Christian minorities in Turkey be accorded only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities in Rumania , Pedand , Czecho-Slovakia and Jugoslavia . The Signatories of the Treaty of Versailles were less interested in the protection of minorities than in anY other part of the treaty . They consigned the duty of looking after the rights of the minor-'ties to the League of Nations , but the means at the disposal of the League are very slender . The Teague has done its best , but the expropriation and expulsion of undesired minorities has not been greatly hampered . In-commending the Christian minority to such protection as the League might give the Turks placed a disagreeable alternative before the powers . Either the Christian minorities would have to i go virtually unprotected , or the League would have to be placed in a position in ' Which it could really protect the minority nationalists ? in Central and Eastern Europe.THE address delivered by Frank A. Munsey before the American Bankers ' Association on October 4th has been reprinted and is being circulated by the author . It contains extremely interesting opinions , as the following excerpts show : The labor problem is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enough labor to carry on its work . . . . Labor , like commodities , is subject to the law of supply and demand . The wage of labor will never come down until the supply exceeds the demand . . . . The law passed by Congress soon after the war restricting immigration is wholly responsible for the present labor shortage . If this law had never gone on the statute books . . . our inflated wage scale would have been well liquidated before now . That wages would not deflate when there was a shortage of labor should have been clear to them because of the fact that America does not produce its own labor . . . . We produce no labor for the reason that there is no sympathy between the American public school and the pick and the ax . . . . This spirit is fine , admirable . ... But it leaves us without labor of our own and almost wholly dependent on foreign labor to do the plain , simple work that only human hands can do . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country should demand , and that you the bankers should demand , an immediate change in our immigration laws ? a change that will let into this country the willing workers of the Old World who are begging at our doors for admittance . MR . SHERMAN P. CUNEO once wrote a life of the President , called " From Printer to President . " Mr. Cuneo now happens to be publicity director of the government prohibition unit . He has evidently been reading about the Ku Klux Klan . He has evidently not read very deeply , for he shows a certain admiration for it . He even suggests that the Klan 's example is , on occasion , worth following . In one of his publicity statements he tells us that the Klan " has inaugurated a campaign against moonshiners , " and that in Texarkana " a dozen men , sheeted and , masked , deposited a fully equipped whisky still on the sidewalk , and wrote on the sidewalk ' Bootleggers , Beware , ' and ' Captured by the Ku Klux Klan . " ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his who has found such a good answer to his chief 's complaint that the present condition of enforcement " is the most demoralizing factor in our public life . " THE suit brought by the State of Kansas against William Allen White for daring to express an editorial opinion sympathetic with the illegal Shopmen 's Strike of last summer has apparently been dismissed . The state authorities did not dare to let it come to trial . They were undoubtedly wise in preferring discretion to valor and in vindicating Mr. White by defaulting On their own original contention . The suit itself was one of the most gross , ugly and inexcusable assaults on freedom of speech which state intoxicated American politicians have yet perpetrated . It indicates only too clearly what may be the result of imposing on political authority the duty of adjudicating strikes in spite of the fact that the social conscience is not as yet agreed upon an industrial code which would provide the basis of a judicial proceeding .
