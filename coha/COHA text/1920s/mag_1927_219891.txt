The Lords- <P> Were startled when Viscount Burnham , outstanding publicist , holder of an LL . D. from the universities of Cambridge , McGill , Athens and Perth ( West Australia ) began to speak bristling words of indignation : " The proceedings of this House now constitute a parliamentary scandal ! The House of Commons now passes what bills they please and shovel them upon us too rapidly for serious contemplation or debate . The indignities now heaped upon the House of Lords* would not have been tolerated 30 years ago . I fail to see why they are tolerated now ! " <P> Baron Carson , quavering 73-year-old Irish Life Peer : " It 's high time . . . Pause ... I say it is high time that the Lords asserted themselves ! . . . " However . . . Pause . . . some of us are to blame . . . . There are about 700 peers . . . Pause . . . and yet I notice , whenever I come here that 50 seems . . . Pause ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haldane , Scottish jurist , statesman , philosopher and educator , onetime ( 1912-15 ) Lord High Chancellor : " Nobody takes the work of this House seriously ( wagging a finger at the Marquess of Salisbury* Leader of the House of Lords ) . It is looked upon as a terrible fatality if we must continue debate after it is time for dinner . " <P> The Marquess of Salisbury : " A finger has been wagged in my direction . I fail to understand this movement . Was it admonitory ? " <P> Viscount Haldane : " It was not admonitory . " <P> Earl Russel ( closing the debate , since the time lacked but twelve minutes of six o'clock ) : " The unhappy situation of this House is due , of course , to the fact that the House of Commons has the ear of the nation and holds the nations purse strings . " <P> The Commons- <P> Voted down 271 to 146 a Liberal motion to reduce the salary of Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain . This technical procedure was intended as a motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threatening note to Soviet Russia ( TIME , March 7 ) . Paradoxically , Sir Austen , although he signed the vote as Foreign Secretary , was its chief opponent in the Cabinet . <P> Heard peace-propagating Sir Austen Chamberlain ( see above ) declare that relations would not be broken off with Soviet Russia . <P> Were buttonholed in the lobby by successive groups of 25 feminists marshalled by Lady Astor , M. P. , to lobby for the bill reducing the minimum voting age for British women from 30 to 21 . <P> *Viscount Astor , husband of famed Nancy Astor , " first woman M. P. " said recently : " A great many peers seem to regard the House of Lords as a male sanctuary or a golf club with membership restricted to retired Colonels . . . . They prefer to overlook that it is an assembly making laws for 40,000,000 people of whom half are women . . . . The House of Lords is the only public body which has not recognized that women have rights . . . . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
