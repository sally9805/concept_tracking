The Grand National Assembly passed a bill whereby any person or persons accused of acting against the sovereignty of the people , whether by word , deed or publication , shall be tried for high treason . <P> The Opposition violently opposed the motion on the ground that it would be deprived of the power of working for the restitution of the Sultanate . <P> Mohammed VI , deposed Sultan , issued ( from Cairo ) a proclamation to the Moslem world calling upon it to ignore the decree of the Angora Assembly separating the office of Caliph ( successor to the prophet ) from that of Sultan ( sovereign ) . He further declared himself still to be both Sultan and Caliph , and asserted that in fleeing from Constantinople he was following a precedent set by the Prophet , who fled from his enemies in Mecca to his friends in Medina.
