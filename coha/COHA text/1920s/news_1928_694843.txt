txt MR . DREISER AND RUSSIA . He Seems to Have Understated Emoluments of Commissars . To the Editor of The New York Times : I am afraid Mr. Dreiser 's further remarks concerning his experiences in Russia add to the misconception he has already given in his interview of certain aspects of life in the Soviet capital . To his main in ference that the members of the Government in Moscow are not grossly overpaid , there can be no question ; but is that not a fact in other capitals as well as Moscow ? Governments in general are notoriously negligent in paying their Ministers salaries commensurate with their services . I doubt whether , mutatis mutanclis , the officials in Moscow are any worse off than their counterparts in London , for Mr. Dreiser must bear in mind what apparently he did not mention in his interview  --  that a Commissar 's salary bears no relation at an to his total emoluments . As Commissar , he gets free quarters ini the Kremlin ( I do n't know where Mr. Drciser got the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an automobile , a permanent scat in the Czar 's box at the opera , and many other privileges and amenities that he richly earns ; as a member of the Communist Party most of the necessities and luxuries of life are much cheaper for him than they are for the non-Communist . The Communists are so surfeited with privileges in lieu of cash , as a matter of fact , that they are not averse to trafficking in them . For instance , when I went to the opera house to reserve a seat I was besieged at the entrance by a score of the elect anxious to sell me the tickets which , I understand , they receive by virtue of their membership of the Communist Party . As for the statement about the rent situation in Moscow , I discovered during my short stay in the Soviet capital that an unofficial subterranean system of private contract has reduced to naught the Soviet 's efforts to institute equality by nationalization and rent-fixing . Moscow there are ( comparatively ) rich and poor , badly paid workmen and better paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are fortunate in your wage or salary it is comparatively easy to obtain rooms , even in the present conditions of grievous shortage . All you have to do is to approach a poor tenant , offer him , say , a thousand rubles , and his apartment is yours . Apparently , the Government does not know anything about it ; if it does , it winks at it , for the rent continues to be paid to the Government bureau . Which all goes to prove , as Artemus Ward would say , that there is a good deal of human nature in man  --  and more so if there is a differential in the wage navment ! H. RI:LISTON .
