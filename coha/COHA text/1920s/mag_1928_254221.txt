The " Famed Four " among European Princes are : <P> Edward of Wales ( Britain ) Umberto of Piedmont ( Italy ) Alfonso of the Asturias ( Spain ) Leopold of Brabant ( Belgium ) <P> Each of these youths is heir to a Throne . Each has been mooned at and photographed ad nauseam . Therefore smart folk hailed with relief , last week , the definitive emergence of a fifth and little known prince : Charles of Flanders . Though he is not a Crown Prince , but the second son of King Albert of the Belgians , he officiated with the grace and freshness of youth , last week , at ceremonies which marked a pilgrimage to Belgium of 15,000 British Legionairies . <P> Edward of Wales had crossed the Channel for the occasion , but , though he was welcomed cordially , louder Belgian cheers rang out for Charles of Flanders . Even Britons were glad that this keen , upstanding Prince had been pushed to the fore by the fact that King Albert and Queen Elizabeth are now returning from Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <P> Many of the Legionairies , while en route to Belgium , stopped off to visit and some to picnic at Vimy Ridge , in France . Thence they proceeded to Ypres , Belgium , and assembled around the famed Menin Gate , an imposing War memorial almost covered by the inscribed names of more than 55,000 British Dead . Into a radio microphone , set up in the roadway before Menin Gate , spoke Charles of Flanders , Edward of Wales , and finally the Archbishop of York . <P> So tense grew religious and patriotic fervor , that Belgian papers reported the fainting of numerous grief-stricken British War-mothers , War-widows , and War-sisters , who were quickly revived in first aid stations provided for that purpose . Solemn and inspirational was the chanting of 0 Valiant Hearts Who to Your Glory Came ! Finally , when soft , repressed sobbing had become general , the Primate of England cried , referring to the War : " Was it all worth while ? Here at this gate let there be no faltering in the answer , ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Let the ' last post ' sound our message of remembrance to the dead ; let the ' reveille ' sound Christ 's summons to service of the living . " <P> Soon buglers sounded the calls requested by the Archbishop ; but most touching of all was the playing by Scotch bagpipers of an old lament which was the favorite of Britain 's greatest War hero , the late Field Marshal Earl Haig , Laird of Bemersyde ( TIME , Feb. 6 , 13 ) . Softly the pipers played " The Flowers of the Forest " ; and British lips repeated afterwards the motto of the House of Haig : What e 're betide , What e 're betide , Haig shall be Haig of Bemersyde ! <P> Charles of Flanders , who was but a lad when the War came , stood silent with modestly bowed head during the British singing , beside Edward of Wales , 34 , his senior by exactly a decade . Later the two princes , chatting affably , walked together the gauntlet of clicking cameras , mooning women . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose of Belgium , last week , craning their necks and peering Moonward , as she ascended for the first time in an airplane-favorite vehicle of Their Belgian Majesties who often fly cross-Channel .
