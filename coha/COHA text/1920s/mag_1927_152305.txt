In London last week a newsgatherer listened to the iconoclastic verbiage of Jacob Epstein , famed sculptor : <P> " Englishmen . . . are indifferent to art , and especially to sculpture , if their tastes can be judged by the monuments they tolerate . I am going back to America with an open mind . . . it is a friendlier country to artists than England . . . . <P> " The great cathedrals of England have stood like empty , cold barns since the Reformation-except Westminster Abbey , which is crammed to the bursting point with some of the worst sculpture ever conceived . <P> " One could overlook the King Albert memorial on a distinct promise that it would never occur again , but deliberately to repeat the crime in the Queen Victoria work and Nurse Edith Cavell monument makes one shudder . <P> " The modern War was ugly and soulless and the British sculptors have succeeded in portraying this . The War should have had no record at all in art . Modern art is all French . Italy appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . One of her bright sculptors executed a piece showing a pyramid standing on its apex . I suppose he was portraying a revolution . England has never had a sculptor . I can not speak for America until I have seen what there is . I should say , from what I know , their architecture is much better than that of England . " <P> After uttering these words , Sculptor Epstein , iconoclast , inconoplast , famed for " Rima , " a bird sculpture* in honor of famed Naturalist W. H. Hudson , boarded a boat for the U. S. , where , it is rumored , he intends to live . On his arrival , he planned to survey an exhibition in which appears his Madonna and Child ( my greatest sculpture and my best " ) ; then he will go to Buffalo , " where they have a lively interest in art . " <P> <P> * Of which critics said : " It scares away the birds . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
