The President , Mr. Cummings indicated , was in a happy humor and enlivened the conversation with several humorous anecdotes . " The President has a high opinion of Chairman White , " said Mr. Cummings , " and he is well satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. White will come to Washington from New York on Thursday or Friday and will see President Wilson . He was a student at Princeton when Mr. Wilson was a professor there .

Some people in the East have the impression that the country is opposed to the league , but they do not know of the popularity of the league in the West . Senator Harding 's statement of his expanded attitude toward the league has served to clear the situation further . He makes it plain that those who in good faith favor the League . of Nations must vote the Democratic tiel ; et .
