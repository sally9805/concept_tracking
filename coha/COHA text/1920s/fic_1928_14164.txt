The pool : a vast gray hall with a hole in the ceiling open to the sky . Broad stone steps lead up from the water on its four sides . The water is continuously restless and throws blue reflections upon the walls . The sick , the blind and the malformed are lying on the steps . The long stretches of silence and despair are broken from time to time when one or another groans and turns in his rags , or raises a fretful wail or a sudden cry of exasperation at long-continued pain . A door leads out upon the porch where the attendants of the sick are playing at dice , waiting for the call to fling their masters into the water when the angel of healing stirs the pool . Beyond the porch there is a glimpse of the fierce sunlight and the empty streets of an oriental noonday . Suddenly the Angel appears upon the top step . His face and robe shine with a color that is both silver and gold , and the wings of blue and green , tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks slowly down among the shapeless sleepers and stands gazing into the water that already trembles in anticipation of its virtue . A new invalid enters . THE NEWCOMER Come , long-expected love . Come , long-expected love . Let the sacred finger and the sacred breath stir up the pool . Here on the lowest step I wait with festering limbs , with my heart in pain . Free me , long-expected love , from this old burden . Since I can not stay , since I must return into the city , come now , renewal , come , release . ( Another invalid wakes suddenly out of a nightmare , calling : " The Angel ! The Angel has come . I am cured . " He flings himself into the pool , splashing his companions . They come to life and gaze eagerly at the water . They hang over the brink and several slide in . Then a great cry of derision rises : " The fool ! Fool ! His nightmare again . Beat him ! Drive him out into the porch . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and lie dripping disconsolately upon the steps. ) p. 3 THE MISTAKEN INVALID I dreamt that an angel stood by me and that at last I should be free of this hateful place and its company . Better a mistake and this jeering than an opportunity lost . ( He sees the Newcomer beside him and turns on him plaintively ) Aie ! You have no right to be here , at all events . You are able to walk about . You pass your days in the city . You come here only at great intervals , and it may be that by some unlucky chance you might be the first one to see the sign . You would rush into the water and a cure would be wasted . You are yourself a physician . You have restored my own children . Go back to your work and leave these miracles to us who need them . THE NEWCOMER ( Ignoring him ; under his breath ) My work grows faint . Heal me , long-expected love ; heal me that I may continue . Renewal , release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down . THE MISTAKEN INVALID I shall sit here without ever lifting my eyes from the surface of the pool . I shall be the next . Many times , even since I have been here , many times the angel has passed and has stirred the water , and hundreds have left the hall leaping and crying out with joy . I shall be the next . ( The Angel kneels down on the lowest step and meditatively holds his finger poised above the shuddering water. ) p. 4 THE ANGEL Joy and fulfilment , completion , content , rest and release have been promised . THE NEWCOMER Come , long-expected love . THE ANGEL ( Without turning makes himself apparent to the Newcomer and addresses him ) Draw back , physician , this moment is not for you . THE NEWCOMER Angelic visitor , I pray thee , listen to my prayer . THE ANGEL Healing is not for you . THE NEWCOMER Surely , surely , the angels are wise . Surely , O prince , you are not deceived by my apparent wholeness . Your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sin into which all my endeavors sink half performed can not be concealed from you . THE ANGEL I know . THE NEWCOMER It is no shame to boast to an angel of what I might yet do in love 's service were I but freed from this bondage . THE MISTAKEN INVALID Surely the water is stirring strangely today ! Surely I shall be whole ! THE ANGEL I must make haste . Already the sky is afire with the gathering host , for it is the hour of the new song among us . The earth itself feels the preparation in the skies and attempts its hymns . Children born in this hour spend all their lives in a sharper longing for the perfection that awaits them . p. 5 THE NEWCOMER Oh , in such an hour was I born , and doubly fearful to me is the flaw in my heart . Must I drag my shame , prince and singer , all my days more bowed than my neighbor ? THE ANGEL ( Stands a moment in silence ) Without your wound where would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes your low voice tremble into the hearts of men . The very angels themselves can not persuade the wretched and blundering children on earth as can one human being broken on the wheels of living . In love 's service only the wounded soldiers can serve . Draw back . ( He swiftly kneels and draws his finger through the water . The pool is presently astir with running ripples . They increase and a divine wind strikes the gay surface . The waves are flung upon the steps . The Mistaken Invalid casts himself into the pool , and the whole company lurches , rolls or hobbles in . The servants rush in from the porch . Turmoil . Finally the no-longer Mistaken Invalid emerges and leaps joyfully up the steps . The rest , coughing and sighing , follow him . The Angel smiles for a moment and disappears . ) THE MISTAKEN INVALID Look , my hand is new as a child 's . Glory be to God ! I have begun again . ( To the Newcomer )         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
