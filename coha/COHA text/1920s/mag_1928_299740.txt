A slim , excited equerry climbed and scrambled to reach Old Paul von Hindenburg , who was hunting chamois , last week , high in the Bavarian Alps . Panting , the equerry snapped to a flushed salute before the President of Germany , and held out a telegram . " Urgent ! Herr Reichs Prsident ! " he gasped . <P> Fumbling with old fingers the President unfolded the telegram . " . . . MURDERED . . . . " he read , and then a name , " . . . TSCHIRPE. . . . " - the name of an old soldier , servitor , friend . <P> When he looked up from the telegram , the President seemed to become Feldmarschall as of old . Curt orders fired rapidly at the equerry replaced the ponderous , civilian manner of Old Paul von Hindenburg . The murdered man had been his personal military servant throughout the War , and long previous . Master and servant were born on the same day-four score years ago . They grew up together in the army of Imperial Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindenburg remembered his poor old friend every year with a gift of money , on their joint birthdays . <P> The telegram told meagerly that both Servitor Tschirpe and his wife ( also old ) had been murdered , at Leuthen , near Sagan in Silesia . Soon the curtly ordered equerry panted and scrambled down with a presidential telegram which took automatic priority over every other message on the wires between Bavaria and Silesia . <P> Jumpy police officials read the demand of Hindenburg for action , justice . They acted . Soon Silesia breathed easier at the arrest of a notoriously vicious and possibly lunatic youth , who , the pouncing police charged , had murdered Herr und Frau Tschirpe-though no theory as to why he should have done so was announced last week . <P> Old Paul von Hindenburg seemed satisfied , resumed his chamois kill .
