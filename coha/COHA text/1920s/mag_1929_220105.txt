San Francisco financial circles were last week agitated over the decision of the San Francisco Grain Trade Association to establish a securities trading department . Inasmuch as San Francisco already has a Stock Exchange , a Curb and a Mining Exchange , it might appear that San Franciscans have already ample opportunity to play the market . So rapidly is the main Exchange growing , indeed , that Coast authorities claim it has passed Chicago and ranks as the second largest U. S. board . The Grain Trade Association , nevertheless , despite the opposition of its parent body , the Chamber of Commerce , has decided to organize an additional trading department , presumably modeled along the lines of the New York Produce Exchange . <P> Easterners know that Los Angeles has outstripped San Francisco in population , in recent fame . They may not know that in 1928 San Francisco bank clearings totaled more than $11,000,000 , largest west of Chicago , fifth largest in U. S. Of the 100 largest U. S. banks ( 1928 ) there were 30 in New York , 11 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy , central bank of the Giannini system . San Francisco shrugs its shoulders at cinema and citrus , argues that from the standpoint of stable commerce , of sound finance , of industrial prosperity , that the glitter of the Golden Gate is still undimmed . <P> Two among San Francisco tycoons have been thoroughly publicized . Who does not know that Robert Dollar was born in Scotland , is 85 years old , works from 12 to 16 hours a day , operates the Dollar Line , largest privately owned U. S. fleet ? Famed too is Amadeo Peter Giannini , though his banking reputation has not invariably included the facts that he is a Papal Knight , that he suffers from chronic neuritis , that he does not approve of private offices . But with Dollar , with Giannini , the list of San Francisco financiers is only begun . <P> Fleishhackers . Prominent , for example , are the Fleishhackers-Brothers Mortimer and Herbert . Lean , reserved , relatively unsocial is Mortimer , president of Anglo-California Trust Co . Sharply contrasted is Herbert , stocky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank . A poker-player , a crap-shooter is Herbert ; he plays also a talkative game of mediocre and expensive bridge . He unsuccessfully backed local horseracing and doodlebug enterprises . He once raised 600 species of orchids on a bet . The Fleishhackers have wide interests in oil , rails , utilities , industrials . <P> Kingsbury . A close friend of the Fleishhackers is smooth , dignified , impeccable Kenneth Raleigh Kingsbury , head of Standard Oil Co. of California . He has been mentioned as the Rockefeller candidate for Board Chairmanship of Standard Oil of Indiana . Once ( in 1923 ) Mr. Kingsbury , taking a cross-continental trip , was shocked to discover waiting for him at every station no less strange a present than a bag of onions . The onion-sender was Herbert Fleishhacker . Soon , at the Anglo &; London-Paris National Bank , there arrived a return present from Mr. Kingsbury . The Kingsbury gift consisted of two water-buffaloes , several crates of smaller animals , and a liveried bugler to announce the arrival of the menagerie . Buffaloes , animals , bugler were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
