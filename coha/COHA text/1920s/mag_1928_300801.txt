In the New York Evening Post , last week , Financial Moralist William Feather* wrote , piquantly : <P> " Business people . . . have temperament . Good businesses are more often ruined by idiosyncrasies of owners than by any other cause . Business men and women . . . are severely handicapped by outbursts of temper , by unreasonable demands , by stubbornness and by vanity . <P> " The indulgence of these weaknesses burdens many enterprises with thousands of dollars of unnecessary expense . . . . <P> " Few temperamental business men are cured of their follies . . . . Sometimes they can be induced to take long vacations - to play golf , to buy a yacht , to tour in foreign lands . <P> " In their absence the treasury can be fattened against the day of their return . It is a mistake to assume that a boss is neglecting his business when he is away from his desk . Often he serves best by letting his assistants do the work . " <P> *Moralist Feather is not the only financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fletcher , of the staff of the New York Herald Tribune .
