Of interest to Americans is the announcement that various works by American composers have been recommended by the American Board of the International Society to be submitted to the International Jury in Zurich in May , and performed , if accepted , the second week of August in Salzburg at the International Festival . Among the works submitted is a string quartette by Charles Martin Loeffler , an American composer whose fame is international . Mr. Loeffler has won high praise from such a well-known critic as Lawrence Gilman , recently appointed to The New York Tribune as music critic after the death of Mr. Kriebbiel.
