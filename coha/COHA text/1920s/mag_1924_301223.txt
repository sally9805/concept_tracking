Nearly 18 years have rolled by since a certain June night in 1906 when Harry K. Thaw slew Stanford White , famed architect of his time , at Madison Square Garden , Manhattan . In the months that followed , Thaw fought hard to escape the electric chair . His lawyers saved him by proving him insane and the Thaw fortune was said to have been diminished by a good round million dollars . In Philadelphia , during the past week , Harry Thaw began a new and expensive fight-a fight to be proven sane and so regain liberty . <P> The news value of a murder trial is undoubtedly great , but like all great things it can be so overdone as to assume the proportions of sheer imbecility . There is a moron class in every country to which the gruesome and exaggerated details of a murder case provide series of irresistible thrills , calculated to make little gum-chewers swallow their gum in a paroxysm of wide-eyed horror . <P> The press , which must to some extent be a reflection of public intelligence , varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper serves . Thus , some 18 years ago , while some of the press gave restrained and sober accounts of the Thaw case , the gum-chewers ' sheets ranted ad nauseum about the pitfalls on the Great White Way ; the " wages of sin " ; the wily , wicked life of White ; the uselessness of Thaw ; the warning to young girls ; the eternal law of Justice which prompted Thaw to avenge his wife 's honor ; the pathetic face of Mrs. Evelyn , etc. , etc . <P> Since that time the press has not improved . The facts of the case today are that Harry K. Thaw has begun proceedings to establish his sanity . The story is complicated by a petition for intervention on the part of Evelyn Nesbit , divorced wife of Thaw , declaring that " Harry Kendall Thaw has not fully recovered his normal mental condition and that he is still a lunatic , and that if he should be freed from restraint at the present time and his estate restored to him , he would dissipate and probably wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has . . . in the estate of his father and of his grandfather . " The petition was granted and Evelyn Nesbit 's lawyers will try to prevent Thaw 's release . <P> Evidence at the trial brought out the fact that Thaw was in 1918 on intimate terms with rabbits at the Pennsylvania Hospital for Nervous Diseases , whence he was removed during the War . He kissed them often and called them " tweedledums " and " tootsies , " then threw them 40 feet into the snow , exclaiming : " It did n't hurt them ! " Despite this evidence alienists were of the opinion that Thaw is sane . <P> Additional factors are that Thaw is worth about $5,000,000 ; Evelyn Nesbit owns the Caf El Prinkipo on the boardwalk of Atlantic City and is moderately wealthy . <P> The gum-chewers ' press is more emotional , however , and the grim seriousness of its mushy slobberings , sounds the depths of bathos . The following are random excerpts : <P> " Evelyn Nesbit , Thaw 's former wife , rose from the bed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; shook off the four griffons and the Albino Pekinese which had scrambled about her lap while she spoke ; dashed to the mirror , seized a large comb and ran it through her black hair , which hangs to her shoulders in a long straight bob . <P> " NERVOUS AS RACER
