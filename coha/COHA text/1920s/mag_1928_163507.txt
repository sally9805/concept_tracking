In Pittston , Pa. , where hard coal comes out of the earth , a Hudson closed car turned into hard-boiled Railroad Street , closely followed by a Peerless sedan . Crowding the Hudson to the gutter , the Peerless paused to belch a noisy blast of powder and lead slugs from several pump guns . Then it vanished toward the neighboring hamlet of Moosic , where it was abandoned , the occupants slipping away into a dense forest . In the shattered Hudson on Railroad Street lay Alexander Campbell , labor leader , and his friend Peter Reilly , both of them horribly dead . <P> Mayor William H. Gillespie of Pittston telegraphed President John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers of America please to come and extinguish the feuds current between mine operators , contractors and two factions of the local mine union . Two other feudists had been slaughtered , a third wounded , in the past two months . <P> His hands already , full of bituminous troubles , President Lewis wired back a disclaimer of responsibility , begged United Mine Workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pennsylvania Coal Co. , in whose No. 6 mine the feud started , agreed to reopen the mine , which had been closed for two months , to give idle hands peaceful occupation . The idle miners met , voted to stay idle .
