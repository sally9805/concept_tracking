George Grey Barnard , American sculptor , is completing a heroic group of Adam and Eve for a secluded spot in John D. Rockefeller 's estate at Pocantico Hills , N. Y. The figure of Adam is 25 feet high , and the two are said to have been cut from the largest block of Carrara marble ever brought to America . The design represents Eve issuing from the rib of Adam . Mr. Barnard has been at work on the piece several years . The legend is current in art circles that at one time the elder Rockefeller was opposed to the nude in sculpture and would have none of it in his collection . Barnard 's own superb masculine nude , The Hewer , may have had something to do with the magnate 's conversion , for Rockefeller was so struck that he bought it for his own gardens .
