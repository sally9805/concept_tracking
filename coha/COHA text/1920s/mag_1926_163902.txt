All over the U. S. they came together , 67 groups , big and little , of Boston Tech men in their own home cities ; and sat down to their dinners , heard the radios being tuned in , and pushed back their chairs , lit their cigars , waited for the big speech of the evening . The main dinner of the evening was being held in Manhattan , but it was an " All-Technology Phantom Radio Dinner " such as only technical men could imagine , devise and carry out . An interlocking chain of broadcasting stations brought them all together , from Massachusetts to California . The main speaker of the evening was not in Manhattan , as other speakers were not . Dr. Samuel Wesley Stratton , President of Technology ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) , made his speech in the Walker Memorial Building at Cambridge , Mass . General James Guthrie Harbord , President of the Radio Corporation , spoke from Washington , D. C. , as did Vice President Charles Gates Dawes . At intervals the Tech glee club tuned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country joyously joining in a widely dispersed chorus on " Take Me Back to Dear Old Tech . " The main speaker- " main " because , though they knew his good works , they had never known his voice-was at his home in Rochester , N. Y. The Tech men eagerly awaited his words , the words of George Eastman , camera man and music lover , who had contributed over 15 millions to their alma mater yet had steadfastly refused to address a Tech audience since they first began asking him in 1916 . At that , his words came from behind the barrier that space and wavelengths afford retiring natures . But to the farflung " phantom " diners they were real words .
