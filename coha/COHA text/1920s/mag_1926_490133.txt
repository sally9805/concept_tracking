THE artificializing effect of Metropolitan life is very great , but we flatter ourselves that we retain sufficient freshness to thrill at the homelier and more lovely things when we see them . Riding on a bus , our eye fell on a load of hay . Misty-eyed , we made an entry in our notebook : " Load of hay crosses Fifth Avenue at Forty-second Street at 4:12 P.M. , Wednesday , August 11 , 1926 . " " Did you see that ? " we ejaculated , turning to a fellow passenger . " Yes , " he said sourly , " but forty nude chorus girls will probably jump out from under it when it gets to Broadway . " Heaven preserve us from such cynicism as this . WE ran into a fine example of modern specialization in the Pennsylvania Hotel . Having been shouldered for ten minutes in the lobby by a convention of stone crushers , we became confused and had to inquire the way to the elevators to the roof . We asked a young man behind a desk . Pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . We quizzed him further , and he admitted he was only the manager 's assistant . The conclusion is that when they build a hotel twice as large as the Pennsylvania , not even Information will know where the roof is . T is interesting to note that although the airplanes which carry the mail across the Continent are the fastest-moving things in the country , the slowest-moving things in the streets of this city are the United States horse-drawn octogenarian-driven mail wagons . ANYBODY who ever travels the New York , New Haven and Hartford route to the Berkshires knows that it is the policy of this railroad  --  whether from choice or from necessity does n't matter  --  not to run half enough Pullmans . Scores of people who want to take the three- or four-hour trip in comfort are forced into the day coaches . With some effort we can control our irritation against a railroad which follows this discom fortto-passengers policy , but it is beyond us to keep our temper when we see its ticket agents treating passengers with contempt when they object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the least it could do would be to hire agents who would meet the outraged patrons with apologies instead of rudeness . It would n't cost much . FROM time to time we are approached by theorists who tell us that gathering flowers in the country and carrying them home is a worthy act ; that the sweet blossoms bring lightness and joy to city dwellings , that flower pickers are beauty lovers , and that the greatest people of all time have found soul-joy by this means . We are never convinced , however . Mrs. Eddy , Josephine Bonaparte , and Mrs. Alexander the Great may all have been blossom pickers . We do n't care . We think it is an immigrant 's trick . We think the country is not meant to he brought into town . We think flowers bought from florists look infinitely better .

Bait PP OST-MORTEM tales of the 1 Presidential fishpond in the Adirondacks have just reached us . Believe it or not , but the story has it not only that the Conservation Commission was called upon to stock the lake with fish so that the President could not fail to have his sport , but , moreover , that they put in about twice the usual number for a lake of the size , acting on instructions from Governor Al , who did n't want to take any chances . And news has further leaked out to the effect that the day after the President arrived with his entourage , the Commission learned , to its horror , that a big fresh-water eel had slipped into the White Pine Camp consignment . There was great excitement , since the eel was a native of the far South ! " If the President hooks that eel we 'll all be beheaded , " gasped the Commission . So to Paul Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and carte blanche . He played hide-and-seek with Mr. Coolidge , guides , and reporters for three days , but he came back with the eel ; the Honor of the State was safe . The Outer Edge AUGUST , they say , is the season when the most people , either out of curiosity or else because they " just ca n't believe " that Manhattan is an island , take the little round-the-island sight-seeing boat that leaves twice daily from the Battery Park wharf . Aside from proving to all concerned that Brooklyn and Jersey have no connection with New York , it is a pleasant , cool , enlightening , and instructive voyage . As the boat breasts the waves an agreeable man orates on points of historical and present-day interest , pointing hither and yon with his megaphone ; but his words are largely meaningless , for the metropolis hasswallowed up history and landmarks and reduced them to lifelessness . It is not landmarks that you see . What you see is thousands of boatloads of beautiful , shiny , new things being brought to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . You watch the city being fed . THE start is impressive , worthy of any picture postcard album , with the glacier wall of the city towering above Battery Park , ocean liners coming and going , mist in lower Broadway , and a hand playing on a near-by excursion boat . Gradually the Woolworth Building and the Municipal come into prominence and the verdigris satire on Prohibition , Liberty , on Bedloe 's Island , disappears as you move up the East River . The Titanic Memorial on the Snug Harbor Building vanishes ? you pass under bridges . And then as the city widens out at Delancey Street and the Williarnsburgh Bridge , the picture postcard New York ceases to count , and you become aware that the waterfront of the city is one long bathing resort . As far as the eye can reach  --  pink bodies . Pink bodies , diving , yelling , swimming , ducking , sitting on docks and barges and grain elevators and freight cars , and having a swell time . And weaving in and out among the swimmers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other elements thatmake the wheels go round ; and barges of garbage and trash again , one kind of stuff coming in , the other kind going out . For miles it is just coke , coal , lumber , sand , gypsum , garbage , and trash ; and pink bodies diving . At Twenty-third Street , the varnished part of the city pushes through to the water for a brief interval  --  and behold the New York Yacht Club garnished with yachts , with Bellevue Hospital in the background and the Metropolitan Tower in the far distance . The same thing happens at Forty-eighth Street . With Brooklyn still squatting on the right , you pass a Times paper warehouse , a yellow taxicab garage , a trash barge , and a thousand swimmers , and gaze upon the new apartment house on Beekman Place . Farther up is its brother , Sutton Place  --  both Places looking a little pathetic . Stubborn and perverse fashion prefers garbage to Riverside Drive . Here , through canyons , you see glimpses of the polite city to which all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower and the Shelton for flagpoles . Note Hell Gate ; note the prison on Blackwell 's , the asylum on Ward 's , the orphanage on Randall 's ; note the low bridges from now on , for you are in the Harlem River . Note that swimming has given way to motor boating , note High Bridge , note the Hall of Fame , if you must  --  and presently note that you crawl through Spuyten Duyvil and burst into the well known Hudson . EVERYEVERYBODY knows the ride BODY down the Hudson , which includes the Riverside Drive that fashion has jilted , and the Palisades . It is worth taking , even if you are accustomed to using the ferryboats . While the uptown and midtown sections have no new landmarks of great worth that can be seen from the river  --  except the Columbia Medical Center -- -the construction of the last few years has given the sky line a solid air it used to lack . Particularly solid is the development of Seventh Avenue below the Times Building and the new Paramount , which now figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Telephone Building heaves into sight do you see anything phenomenal from the Hudson that has not been phenomenal for several years . And then the trip is about over . If you go in the morning , a late lunch at Whyte 's restores the equilibrium . More conclusive proof that New York is an island can not be found , nor is there any easier way of learning what an immense amount of work it takes to keep Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street going . Item THE remarkable success of the sons and daughters of Man o ' War is Sam Riddle 's sole topic of conversation these days . Rear Admiral Cary Grayson tells this one about the master of Glen Riddle Farm : It seems that Mr. Riddle 's dinner partner , an evening or two ago , was a young woman whose racing knowledge had been limited to a day or two at the course on some fashionable occasion . She listened attentively most of the evening to a recounting of the glories and performances of Man o ' War 's offspring . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you think of disarmament ?

" 1926 Newport A FTER personal investigation , we I may safely say that the nice resort of Newport , like everything else this season , is enjoying one of its " fat years , " with more and more entrain as August advances . Of course , with the Astor Race and King 's Cup finished this week , Newport 's yachting season should be technically over . The first of these races , cups for which were first donated by John Jacob and are now continued by Vincent Astor to keep up family traditions , was as usual the spectacular event of the season . With still more enthusiasm , however , Newport has of late taken the interesting turn toward smaller craft of which we spoke last week . So much so , in fact , that the New York Yacht Club Cup , offered this year for the first time , will be awarded exclusively to yachts of the R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race for three days , beginning September 14 . The innovation promises to Newport a late and especially brilliant yachting season , as it is expected that not only the N.Y.Y.C but also the Eastern Yacht Club , of Marblehead , and the various Sound clubs will send boats . In fact , Boston , say the wiseacres , is very likely to win the cup . For she will have both Charles Francis Adams ' Gossoon and Dr. Morton Prince 's Bonnie Tate to her credit . New York 's best chance seems to be Donald Cowl 's iirdelle . As for tennis week ( August 23 to 28 ) , Tilden will play , despite con-flitting rumors . Johnston , Richards , and Williams are very doubtful . Meanwhile , Mrs. James D. Sawyer and Mrs. Guy Fairfax Carey are proving to be an invincible pair in the women 's tennis tournament ; and Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Tilley , guests of the Vincent Actors , are carrying off trophies in the gay world of golf . IA THICK brings us to Mr. T. Suf- V fern Tailer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention also of Mr. T. Suffern Tailer , and his private golf course . These links are decidedly the feature of Newport golf life just now . In the first place , one may play only by engraved invitation , dates carefully specified . Secondly , the course duplicates the nine most perfect golf holes in the world and cost several hundred thousand dollars . Thirdly , everything on the links is in the process of being dedicated  --  trees and wens and caddies ? so that when tired of golfing one may always attend a dedication . As for the strictly social life in Newport this year , it differs little from that of General Grant 's time , and many of the same people are to be seen . Only one outstanding affair , so far , marks the season  --  the reception for the Crown Prince of Sweden , given by the Arthur Curtis jameses soon after they were shot at by a rum chaser . Boston , this year , is particularly in evidence , with Lowells and Cabots galore ; and the Navy , as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street to Rear Admiral Cameron R. Winslow sealed tight in a limousine . Most of the noted yachts , too , have put in at one time or another , the Still-mans ' included ; and then , of course , there 's Bailey 's Beach , just as popular as ever , just as bad for swimming , just as full of cV.butantes and seaweed . Hoisted MR . EARL CARROLL has announced that the front-row opening-night seats for his new " Vanities " will cost $100 , plus tax , and when we think of the surtax the ticket agents will put on top of this we are reminded consolingly of the time the agents themselves were relieved of quite a neat sum of money just when they had expected to profit heavily . It was for a Red Cross benefit in the Metropolitan Opera House during the War , and word had gone out that tickets would be allotted to the various agencies if they would meet William Fox , chairman of the theatrical division of the drive , in a suite of offices in the Longacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents were there on the dot . Three hours later Mr. Fox came in , but during the interim none of the agents had stirred , for each was afraid the others would heat him to something . Mr. Fox then proceeded to make a speech and began to picture the need for money abroad . They were trapped and the upshot was that $27,000 was pledged . But the bombshell followed : the ticket allotments were made with the warning that if any agent sold a single ticket above its face value , he would be thrown into jail . We understand that since that time the agents have evaded all definite appointments with those high up in the theatrical world . A Quiet Ace WE visited Roosevelt Field and saw Captain Fonck 's new plane the other day , the one destined shortly to fly from New York to Paris , instead of from America to France , thus utterly and delightfully ignoring the rest of both countries  --  Boston , Boulogne , and other humdrum points . The beautifully proportioned ship , like a monstrous silver gull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features cling to its sides all day and chatter in Russian and French . The flight is scheduled for the twenty-fifth . Some of the mechanics are ex-navy and ex-army officers ; others bear titles , for Igor Sikorsky , Russian designer of the three-motor plane , recruited his workmen from unfortunate and educated fellow countrymen . All wear overalls and are able to speak several languages . To complete the racial melange , the flight is backed by an American , Robert Jackson , and commanded by a Frenchman . Mr. Jackson is president of the company , which is called The Argonauts , and comes from Concord , New Hampshire . Although not mechanically inclined , we nevertheless felt the other day a strange confidence in the plane 's success . With three 425 h.p . GnomeRhone-Jupiter motors ( the name itself is enough to inspire confidence ) , the $25,000 purse offered by Mr. Raymond Orteig ( owner of the Brevoort and Lafayette hotels and patron of aviation ) , Captain Fonck commanding and Paris as a goal , any sensible plane should go straight . SPEAKING of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietest celebrity ever to visit these shores . Premier pilot of France , he has seventy-five German planes to his credit and one British . On a foggy morning , above Dunkirk , a certain Anglo-Saxon warrior , whose zeal was greater than his eyesight , came charging from a bank of clouds onto Captain Fonck . Hence the " one British . " The French ace is a dead shot and , it is said , sees twice as far as the average man . He seldom speaks , and then quickly , and it is doubtful if he could talk at all were his hands tied . He is thirty-two years old , has never married , nor does he drink much . Originally he came from Saint-Die in the Vosges , which claims to be the first town in which a map of America was made , but now he lives in Paris in an apartment on the Boulevard Haussmann . As his name implies , Fonck is of Alsatian origin , one ancestor having been a German general and another a marshal in the army of Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the school at lons-sur-Marne in 1914 to take up his somewhat different career . Now he lives at the Hotel Roosevelt , where he takes most of his meals . His afternoons are spent working at Roosevelt Field , and his evenings at the movies rather than the theatre ( he speaks no English ) ; he never visits a night club . Although he misses wine with his lunch , his chief annoyance these days is reading in the paper the names of people of whom he has never heard , who claim to be going with him on the approaching transatlantic flight . These applicants Captain Fonck divides into two classes  --  harmless cranks and thick-skinned individuals who hope through publicity to force him into taking them . As yet Lieutenant A. P. Snody is the only American chosen to accompany the French aviator . One lady from Minneapolis , however , may hear from him . This fair unknown has just written Captain Fonck asking him immediately on his arrival in Paris to send her a letter . Her nephew , she explains , collects stamps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noted THE Great Heart of our Police Force is again demonstrated . A policeman , rounding the corner at Fifth Avenue and East Fiftieth Street early one morning recently , surprised a woman digging with a child 's sand shovel in St. Patrick 's Cathedral lawn . About to reprimand her , he discovered that she was in the act of burying her pet canary , which lay dead in a cardboard box at her side . " Go ahead , " said the blue-coated copper . " But hurry up ; we do n't want to be caught . " Identification THE hatband situation is becoming acute , we are told , because of exhaustion of the spectrum . All the prominent clubs , regiments , and fraternities have patented ( by a gentlemen 's agreement only ) their chosen bands with the leading manufacturers , but it is suspected that smaller producers have quite unwittingly duplicated or at least approximated some of the patented designs  --  there being a matter of 100 or more varieties . The fraternities alone are staggering , simple reds , greens , and yellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement being the distinguishing feature . Most of the fraternity bands have modest dark blue or black hackTHE NEW YORKER grounds , with the stripes only in color . The game of spotting colored hatbands and telling which is which , is almost as fascinating as identifying the new 1929 automobile models . Zeta Psi has wide white and yellow stripes ; Phi Sigma Kappa , one red with a white stripe either side ; Sigma Nu , two yellows and a white ; Zeta Beta Tau , two orange stripes on either border ; Sigma Alpha Epsilon , three narrow lavender stripes and a wider yellow one . . et cetera ad infinitum . If you are really interested in the sport , go into consultation with your haberdasher and he will provide you with enough data to start you off on a lively hunt . NO wonder the Racquet Club has had to change from one to two red stripes on a blue ground ; it may soon have to raise it one . St. Paul 's whose alumni are so fond of distinguishing marks , may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a white one in the center , and even the Coffee House , black with light-blue stripes , is not safe , since a color can not be actually copyrighted or patented . Squadron A bands , blue with three yellow stripes , we understand are the most popular sellers in three of the largest men 's shops . The English Regimental colors in hatbands have complicated the game still more . Brooks makes a point of carrying their bands . The King 's Royal Irish Hussars have several orange and black parallel stripes ; the Royal Scots two wide red stripes on blue ; the Third King 's Own Hussars , many narrow red and yellow stripes on blue ; and the East Lancashire Regiment , wide gray and red and blue alternating . A friend , who has made a study of hatbands , has called up many of the prominent men 's shops , but has been unable to buy anything but a college color hatband and a few unpatented prep school bands without credentials .
