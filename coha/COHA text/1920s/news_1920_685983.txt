txt For the first time the League of Nations is to have a military force to insure carrying out its decisions . A composite force is to be sent to Lithuania to maintain order and supervise the plebiscite which the League Council has decided shall be held in Vilna and the surrounding territory , to decide Whether it shall be assigned to the Poles or the Lithuanians . In addition to French , British and Belgians the Allied force will include Spanish troops . It may be recalled that the Polish General Zellgouski occupied Vilna shortly after its evacuation by the Bolshevik ' . The Lithuanians addressed a protest to ' the League , and the Council determined on a plebiscite . The sending of troops to maintain order is authorized by Article XI . of the League Covenant , which says that in danger of war the League may take such action as it thinks fit in order to keep the peace . The following communique on the subject was issued tonight : " The League has received a communication from the British Government agreeing fiat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Govern= went had also agreed to send two companies of infantry . The French and Belgian Governments had previously signified their willingness to dispatch Firench and Belgian troops . " Officials of the League are enthusiastic op the action taken . They declare it shows that the League has teeth if they are needed . It will be remembered that at the Peace Conference President Wilson answered French demands that the League have a permanent army with the argument that the members would place forces at the League 's disposal if the occasion arose . Unlikely to Admit Germany . It is now highly improbable that Germany will become a member of the League at the present assembly . This Is largely Germany 's own doing . If her application for membership had been filed when the meeting Opened on Monday it is likely that she would have received the two-thirds majority re ( mired , but her failure to apply and von Simon 's statement that she would not do so ? to say nothing of four ' days ' work here by opponents of her adrnission-have changed matters considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tacit agreement among those in a position to carry out their wishes that the question of Germany 's admission shall be deferred until another general meeting in the future .. ' If another member should apply on Germany 's behalf , it is likely to be unsuccessful , as there is a strong feeling that Germany ought to apply for herself . There is always a chance for surprises , but if Germany is elected it will be a surprise . Perhaps Germany does not want to join the League just yet . On this point Herr Schwarz , Secretary of the German League of Nations Association , made an interesting statement today . lie said that Germany preferred not to Join until the amount of the war indemnity which she must pay had been fixed . Germany signed a blank check when she signed the Peace Treaty , and , as her admission to the League would Involve her acceptance of a pledge to carry out the treaty , she would be again in a position of signing a blank check if she were admitted before she knew bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League would increase instead of diminish the presiure which the Allies could ' bring to bear Upon her . This view seems to be confirmed by ' the attitude of the German Government . Big Committees an . Obstacle . The Assembly got down to routine business today in various committees . It is felt that their size -- forty-one . members in each ? is an obstacle to rapid work , but there is no other way of satisfying the demand of small members for equal representation with the great powers . It is hoped to subdivide the big committees into smaller ones because otherwise with all the forty-one members wishing to voice opinions the delay is likely to be interminable . What : 1nskes matters worse is that all the de . cisions reached must be unanimous .

He told a moving story of the sufferings of these men of whom there had been 300,000 in Russia when the work of repatriation was begun . Nearly 200,000 , said Dr. Nansen , had got back to their homes . He paid a tribute to the work of the ? Red . Cross and the Y. M. C.

In a somewhat agitated session today I the League of ** Assembly completed its organization by the election , of six Vice Presidents , who , with the six Chairmen of the committees elected ; yesterday , form a sort of Executive The non-European nations , for whom Committee of the Assembly . much solicitude was shown yesterday , had no complaint to make , as they obtained four Vice Presidents instead of the three for which they had asked . These were Viscount Ishii of Japan ; Honorio Pueyrredon , ' Argentina ? , Sir George E. Foster , Canada , and Rodrigo Octavio , Brazil . The other Vice Presidents are II . A. van Karnabeek of Holland and Dr. Eduard Benes of Czechoslovakia . One result of the first ballot for Vice Presidents was a tie between Rodrigo Octavio , the Brazilian Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , and Dr. Gastoa da Cunha , the Brazilian ' Ambassador to France , for the sixth office of that kind . While the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an animated discussion prodidate insisting that he be allowed to withdraw in favor of the other . A second ballot was taken , resulting in Octavio 's el ion As an of courtesy , Giuseppe Mottle . President ' of the Swiss Confederation , who had delivered the address of welcome , was elected Honorary Presitient of the Assembly . The whole Assembly rose and applauded the announcement of President Motta 's elsetIon . The recipient of the demonstration thanked the Asseinbly and asked that the honor should not be considered as relieving him ( f any of his work as a delegate en the . same plane as the ether delegates . Pictereeceie features cf the session were furnished by Baron Hayashi , head the JaPpnese delegation ; Dr. Fridtjof . leansen ( h . Norway , Gustave Ador , exPresident of Switzerland , and the two leading members of the Brazilian deleEfl ton .

Ador , who is also an ex-President of the International Red Cross , had graciously replied to remarks by Dr. Nansen regarding the Red Cross . The explorer rushed down a side aisle with characteristically quick action to grasp M. Ador 's hand in a shake so warm and real that . the sentiment was communicated to the spectators . Deny Compact to Admit Germany . Rumors which had been current all the week that certain combinations had been formed ' to carry prearranged programs through the Assembly were denied today from two sources . M. Pueyrredon , for the Argentine delegation , said that it was , absolutely untrue , so far as Argentina was concerned , that South Amerl-. can republics were in an understanding with'other ex-neutrals to force the admission of Germany into the League . M. Pueyrredon declared that it was for the United States to take the initiative whenever that country might be ready to consider entering the League . When he had proposed that a formula should be found to permit the entry of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way open so that when the United States was ready finally to declare its attitude toward the League there would be no obstacle of the League 's making to prevent it . The British dominions representatives made it clear that they were here to represent their particular dominions without reference to sietgr dominions or the mother country . All the delegates appear to be satisfied with the progress made In the necessary preliminary proceedings . the work baying been accomplished with a minimum of friction , and they expect the final results to satisfy rd1 the friends of the League . Lord Robert Cecil and Hjalmar 33rantlog , at the first meeting of the Committee on Disarmament , Economic . Blockade and Mandates today , put through a motion that the session of the committee tomorrow would be open to the public , thus profiting by the latitude left by the latitude left by the Assembly for the holding of committee deliberations behind closed doors or not .

Military commissions will be instructed to examine the technical conditions involved in Danzig 's defense and report to the League . H. A : L. Fisher of the British delegation says that perfect accord had prevailed between France and Great Britain in reaching decisions . Doherty Allsanuted on Wilson . It developed that C. J. Doherty , Canadian Minister of Justice , one of the most active of the delegates to the Assembly , had become a victim of one of the hign-speed translations made during the Assembly 's proceedings , which sometimes become mistranslations .

In spite of the thrusts which had been directed at them yesterday by Delegate Millen of Australia for their lack of promptness , the ' delegates were again tardy in assembling today , less than half of their number , being present at the opening hour . These were collected in groups about the hall , commenting animatedly on yesterday 's committee elections , in which the Latin countries captured nine out of the total of twelve Chair men and Vice Chairmen . The Secretariat of the Assembly was notified that Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh , ceeded at the Brazilian bench , each canhead of the Persian delegation to the Assembly . had met a thrilling adventure with a tragic end for his secretary , while the delegation was on its way to Geneva from Teheran .
