Man 's Estate . Beatrice Blackmar and Bruce Gould have set down with strength and fidelity a story that is covered by millions of rooftops throughout the world- the story of ambition fastened to earth by the inevitable tendrils of dependence . It is their first play and it has , here and there , the gaucheries of inexperience , but it seldom loses its hold on the fundamental truth on which it is based-the fact that , in the curiously woven pattern of human life , there is no such thing as independence . <P> The story is as simple as life itself seems to be . A Midwestern youth who wants to be an architect takes his greatest satisfaction in the fact that he is free , that he may defy his drab background , and do as he pleases in becoming great . Then , one moonlit night , a girl 's arms fasten him , innocently , generously , but so tightly that he can never escape . He tries , of course , but finds that his ambition has been diluted by emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped , but sure that he will not vegetate as all the others have done before him , as even he is beginning to do as the final curtain falls . <P> The foregoing may suggest that Man 's Estate is a man 's play . It is not . Earle Larimore gives an acutely sympathetic portrait of the beaten youth , but the story mounts to its second-act crescendo through the beauty of Margalo Gillmore 's portrayal of the girl who , without wanting to , draws the youth back into the shadows of mediocrity . There are other excellent performances by Edward Pawley , Dudley Digges , Elizabeth Patterson and Armina Marshall . Mr. Digges also is to be credited with the direction . The production is flush with the Theatre Guild 's usual high level . <P> Margalo Gillmore , daughter of Frank Gillmore ( one of the founders and now President of the Actors ' Equity Association ) , began her stage career in 1917 after a course at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts . She was second woman in a Scrap of Paper , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into headlines with Richard Bennett in He Who Gets Slapped . In the last two years she has been a member of the Main Acting Company of the Theatre Guild . Unmarried , she has an apartment of her own and likes contract bridge , cats ( three at present ) , golf , swimming .
