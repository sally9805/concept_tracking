txt The prosperity of the United States can be insured in a large degree if the public will keep a cool business head and abstain from extravagant and unwarranted predictions whenever the commercial horizon becomes clouded , says T. H. Tregoe , Executive Manager of the National Association of Credit Men . " Some persons , " Mr. Tregoe says , " ask questions about the future as though they were seeking a death 's head at the feast . The worst that they can find today is a scarecrow in a cornfield . " In the past , distressing disturbances in our credit and financial affairs have been brought about by disorganized reasoning , leading to paroxysms . We failed in times gone by to keep our heads in the face of danger when the responsibilities were much lighter than they are today . " People bawl about the instalment method of selling as though it were going to smash our credit system . The worst that it can do is to smash some of those who have unwisely indulged this idea of stimulating production . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this ; country , as custodians of the largest capital ever entrusted to one people since the beginning of time , must exercise strong control . We must avoid paroxysms . " We are in the midst of difficult complexities . In pushing production , which is our present fetish , to the highest point it is but natural that we overstep here and there our consumption powers and thereby cause an interlude in business . If we commit this error let us accept the results uncomplainingly , or , better still , let us use them as guides to better ideas in production and marketing . " No one can tell what the present year will bring . Unmade crops and emergencies defy human prescience . The skies , as I see them , are free from threatening clouds . We may have some showers as the result of overproduction ; we may have a little drought because of forced marketing ; but there is blue back of the problems . " Any one who indulges paroxysms and gets his reasoning powers disorganized is extremely foolish . Much depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prom these mainsprings of action may paroxysms be absent and may well organized reasoning ocntrol public utterances . "
