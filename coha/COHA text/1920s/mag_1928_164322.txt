Professing to serve party before self , Candidate Reed last week stormed afresh at the G. O. P. in speeches through the South . At the university town of Chapel Hill , N. C. , he cried : " Senator Borah and the insurgents are all that are left of the soul of the Republican Party in Washington ! Have you ever heard from Coolidge or from any member of the Cabinet any protest against the present iniquities ? The entire crowd is tainted ! " <P> To Candidate Woollen , in Republicanly corrupt Indiana , Candidate Reed sent a telegram asking permission to go there and speak , not for delegates but to " be of service to the party . That is my sole object . " Candidate Woollen wired back : " . . . We all will gladly join in welcoming you . ... " <P> Speeding off to Milwaukee , Candidate Reed assailed Candidate Hoover for Wartime wheat-price fixing . " That distinguished expatriate , " he called his party 's foeman.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
