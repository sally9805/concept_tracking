A letter written in French by Benjamin Franklin was discovered by Professor Proquot in the private diary of the wife of Colonel le Comte Labedoyere ( who was shot for having facilitated Napoleon 's return from Elba ) . It is believed that this is the first time that this letter has ever been published , and so far the original document has not been discovered . <P> The letter was published by Le Figaro in Paris , and is headed " From Dr. Franklin to a lady friend in France . " It is a delightful and original satire on the futility of fame and the human lust for knowledge . Some excerpts : <P> " You will no doubt remember , my worthy friend , the agreeable day which we passed in the delightful gardens of the Moulin Joli in charming company . You will , perhaps , also remember that after dinner . . . I let the rest of the company proceed and remained behind alone in an alley . Here an indefinite number of dead frames of little flies had been pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations succeed one another day by day . These insects only exist for ten hours . <P> " As you are aware , I understand the different tongues of insects . . . ' Happy people , ' I said to myself , ' you must certainly live under a very just , wise and kindly government , . . . you can spend your life discussing the qualities and defects of the music of your neighbors . <P> " Turning my eyes in another direction , I saw an old , white-haired ephemary walking all alone on another leaf , talking to himself . As this monologue seemed to me of interest , I wrote it down . <P> " ' It was , ' said he , ' in the opinion of our wisest philosophers , held that the world of the Moulin Joli could only last 18 hours , and this opinion seems to me well founded . ' <P> " ' I have lived during seven hours , which is a great age , seeing that it amounts to no less than 420 minutes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am well , I can not expect to live more than seven or eight hours . What use will my work be to me ? What use will be to me those political discussions to which I have devoted my life in the design to instruct my compatriots inhabiting this bush ? <P> " ' Alas ! How slow is the progress which we make in philosophy , and , alas ! how difficult the acquisitions of knowledge while life is so short . My friends endeavor to console me by making me hope that my name will survive . . . . But of what use is a name to an ephemary who perishes ? And what will become of all history in 18 hours , when the Moulin Joli and the whole world will come to an end , when all things will be enveloped in universal ruin ? As for me , . . . one real pleasure remains , . . . and that is the conviction I have tried during my whole life to do good , and a delightful memory of having enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time listened to the divine notes of charming Madame B. , who has some-times smiled upon my endeavors .
