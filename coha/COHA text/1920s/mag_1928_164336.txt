In Chicago the Incredible , the approach of April primaries brought about a recrudescence of the sort of things that have made the city world-infamous . Politicians hurled Chicago language of stunning crudity . Gangsters hurled Chicago " pineapples . " The Chicago press hurled its disgust in a manner suitable to mass circulations . <P> Bombings . In Chicagoese , " pineapple " is a euphemism for an ugly , black , egg-shaped object known elsewhere as a hand-grenade . Since the first of the year they have been utilized 21 times by racketeers angry for one reason or another with fellow racketeers , politicians , bootleggers , gamblers . Last week " pineapples " exploded on the doorsteps of U. S. Senator Charles S. Deneen and Judge John A. Swanson . The results were mild for Chicago ; no one was killed ; only the fronts of two houses were blown to splinters . <P> Then , four days later , a thing too big to be called a " pineapple " failed to explode in the South Water Street market when wet snow snuffed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough to wipe out an entire city block . <P> Who did the above deeds and why remained a mystery-the usual Chicago bombing mystery . Posters were tacked on fences and poles throughout the city , advertising $65,000 in rewards for information concerning the Deneen and Swanson pineapplers . Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill " ) Thompson , State 's Attorney Crowe and others were sponsors of the rewards . Meanwhile , Chief of Police Michael Hughes reported : " It is almost impossible to trace bombers . There are 50 places in the city where dynamite can be purchased just as a person buys a package of cigarets. " * <P> Gang Angle . Bootleg gangsters hold Senator Deneen responsible for a recent attempt at Prohibition enforcement , in which raids were staged on eleven cabarets that considered themselves immune from such treatment . That may have inspired the bombing as well as the assassination of " Diamond Joe " Esposito , gangster , Deneen henchman of the 25th ward , flashy hero of Chicago 's Little Italy . Fortnight ago , " Diamond Joe " stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when an automobile drove up to the curb . There was a rat-tat-tat and the automobile drove away , leaving 58 slugs in the body of " Diamond Joe . " He had a fine funeral . His coffin cost $5,000 . Senator Deneen came from Washington to walk in the rain in a procession that stretched for a mile and a half .
