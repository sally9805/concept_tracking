The Ruhr The little seed of peace , given by Herr Hugo Stinnes to Premier Mussolini in Italy nearly a month ago , sown by Mussolini and Jaspar in a subsequent conference at Milan , and watered with assiduous care by M. Loucheur , unofficial diplomat of French industry , and Premier Theunis of Belgium , has at length pushed its first leaves through the earth . <P> Premier Theunis is known to have disfavored the French policy of giving Britain the cold shoulder in the now possible reparations parley . It transpires that this far-seeing statesman was in communication with the Germans , and that he was responsible for sending M. Jaspar , Belgian Foreign Secretary , to Italy to hear the Stinnes proposals . When these were communicated to him he gave Loucheur full support for his mission to England . In this way he was able to bring considerable pressure to bear on Poincar , who found himself in a quandary owing to the popularity of Loucheur 's efforts , in the recent meeting between the two premiers in Paris . <P> Signs of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible evidence . The political news from Germany points to a more conciliatory attitude . The outlines of a Franco-Belgian agreement made by Poincar and Theunis were published , and point to the fact that economic guarantees between France , Belgium and Germany will be the medium through which a cut in the reparations bill will be accepted . In a speech at London , the Marquis Curzon , British Foreign Secretary , advised Germany to make a definite offer to France and Belgium . This was received in most European capitals , as a possible basis for direct negotiations . <P> As a matter of fact , the political atmosphere in Britain , Paris and ! Berlin is none too healthy for the Governments in power . Pressure is being brought to bear on Bonar Law , Poincar and Cuno , mainly on account of Ruhr issues , by their political opponents . If the fall of these Governments is effected it would do much to clear the air and bring the Allies and Germany together in at much needed reparations conference .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
