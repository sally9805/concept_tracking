Two shots rang out in Douglas , Ga. , last week , and reverberated as far as Washington . L. S. Peterson , recently relieved of his job of postmaster for shortage in his accounts , had killed his clerk , then himself . He left a letter asserting that $2,000 had been demanded of him in five years for Federal patronage . <P> In the Senate , Georgia 's Harris declared : " Ninety per cent of the post-office appointments , I believe , are sold in my state . " Said Georgia 's George , " The sum of the exactions made would be fairly staggering . " " Ridiculous , " commented Postmaster General Harry Stewart New . Then two Florida postmasters-Alvin L. Durrance of Frostproof and Leslie D. Roberts of Avon Park-talked of paying " levy " for their posts . Postmaster General New discharged them forthwith .
