The most valuable modern painting offered for sale for a long time will be on view in New York next week . <P> It is a big picture ( 12 by 18 feet ) and is expected to bring about $100,000 . It is called Judaea Capta , or the Triumph of Titus . The painter , Iszo Koves , Hungarian , worked on it for 20 years , and spent 35 years gathering historical data . Then he died during the war , penni- less , leaving a destitute widow and children . <P> The Judaea Capta is a picture of Titus coming back to Rome with the spoils of conquered Jerusalem-including the captive daughters of Israel . Some nude Bacchantes are included for purposes of contrast . <P> One of Koves ' earlier pictures , Spinoza Before His Judges , was twice rejected for exhibition in Buda Pesth . So the angry artist hid it . in his studio , until his wife and a pupil smuggled it out and submitted it again . It was accepted and delighted the Emperor .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
