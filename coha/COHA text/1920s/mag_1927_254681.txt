Citizens of the U. S. have been wondering , ever since the last advent of M. Raymond Poincar as Premier ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) just when this firm and foxy statesman would ask the Chamber of Deputies to ratify the Franco-U . S. debt accord ( TIME , May 10 , 1926 ) . <P> The question has not been exactly pressing for two reasons : 1 ) The U. S. Congress has not ratified the accord , but will have to take the whole matter up again because this measure passed only the House ( TIME , June 14 , 1926 ) but not the Senate . 2 ) Premier Poincare has been so busy rescuing France from her financial slough of last year , doubling the value of the franc , and tentatively stabilizing it , that no one seriously expected him to make of his debt-funding plans anything but a dark state secret until stability was achieved . Now the question of ratification has begun to loom again , and M. Poincar answered it last week with characteristic flashing suddenness . <P> Responding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier rapped out : " I do not propose ratification of the Franco-British and Franco-U . S. debt-funding accords , because I expect to get better terms ; and because Parliament certainly would not agree to bind the country for the proposed term of 62 years . " <P> Can Premier Poincar obtain " better terms " from the U. S. ? One obstacle is that the U. S. Debt Funding Commission , having negotiated and signed debt-funding agreements with all nations indebted to the U. S. , has officially terminated its existence . If France ever gets better terms from the U. S. , she must get them from a new U. S. Commission especially created to give them to her by Congress . The only alternative would be to let the whole matter drop officially , and for the U. S. to accept from France , from time to time , such individual payments as she may wish to give-payments similar to the $10,000,000 recently tendered by France and accepted by the U. S. " without prejudice to ratification " ( TIME , March 14 ) . Perhaps that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he crisply affirmed : " I expect to get better terms , " and then would say no more . <P> He had let a state secret out of the bag , but kept it still on leash .
