A RE we headed for that ? The question inevitably suggests itself when we read of the acquittal of ex-Secretary Fall and Mr. Doheny and recall the escape of former Attorney General Daugherty and the former Alien Property Custodian , Thomas W. Miller , because of a " hung " jury . We admit in both cases the difficulty of proving conspiracy . That is technical and anything but easy to get over to a jury . Yet the fact remains that the Fall-Doheny jurymen were apparently moved by maudlin sentiment for a gray-haired , broken-down old promoter and his Cabinet ally , Fall , the man who had been his pal in the hard-pan days of their youth . For some days the friendliness of the jury to the defendants had been so manifest that the reporters prophesied an acquittal . The lawyer for the accused admitted that his client Fall had lied about the $100,000 note in order to protect Doheny : " Lie ? Of course he lied and every red-blooded man in New Mexico is proud of it . " There was no denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease of the naval oil reserve , or that this secret transaction about which Fall so proudly lied was anything but an above-board business deal . There was no denying that such a personal relationship between a public official and a public bidder was grossly improper and indefensible . But by means of mushy sentimentality ; the apotheosis of frontier morals ; an absurd naval scare that could never be substantiated ; an appeal to gaze upon Mrs. Fall , " daughter of the matrons of Sparta and Rome " and " a mother of the West who in the sunset of life has taken her place by the side of her husband , " and the delicate suggestion not to lift the shroud of a dead President , the jury was blinded to its duty and led to free the defendants . On both sides counsel resorted to the acts of the legal blatherskite and the government 's performers came off second best . We do not hesitate to brand this a miscarriage of justice ; for every essential issue in this case has already been adjudicated . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) that the actions of these two men were shrouded in secrecy in order to conceal them and to deceive Congress and the public ; ( 2 ) that the conspiracy between Fall and Doheny is proved ; ( 3 ) that Doheny 's company was a specially favored bidder ; ( 4 ) that Doheny and Fall were in cahoots as to the royalties . That court was clearly of the opinion  --  since upheld by the Court of Appeals , and now before the Supreme Court  --  that " the injury that has been done the nation , as well as the distrust of public officers that it has caused can not be overestimated . " What would it say now as to the extent of that injury in view of a jury 's acquitting where the facts were so clear to it and the first court of review ? We are aware , of course , that these two defendants may still be tried for bribery ( a charge , it would seem , easier to prove than conspiracy ) ? and may receive their punishment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely to increase throughout the United States the belief that there exists one kind of justice for rich men and another for the poor ; that if you only steal a large enough sum you are safe ; that if you are a poor wretch who has just stolen , for the fourth time , a sum , say , of fifty dollars you may go to jail for life , as has actually happened in New York under the Baumes law . Why should people think differently with this appalling record ? " High-grade lawyers , " it seems , can accomplish anything . Why should the people feel differently when in addition they read that in defiance of public decency and elemental morality the Governor of Illinois , himself ordered by an Illinois court to pay back $1,000,000 to the State Treasury for illegal State expenditures during his incumbency , has just appointed Senator-elect Frank L. Smith to the United States Senate to fill the brief unexpired term of the late Senator McKinley ? Warned by their own party leaders not to let this take place , both Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decency of the Senate . This man who , as chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission , " shook down " the public-utilities magnates in his State for contributions to his primary campaign funds running above a hundred thousand dollars , is not to wait until March 4 to present his credentials ; he is to be seated at once if the Governor has his way  --  as if to do the ' bidding of the man who helped him to buy his seat . He is not even to await the findings of the Senate committee headed by Senator Reed which has inquired into the circumstances of his primary campaign . The Senate and public opinion alike are to be flouted with a brazen indecency unparalleled in recent history . Well , the gauntlet is flung down and the issue is whether we are to be governed by and for and with crooks . That it is , whether Colonel Smith 's soul is as white as snow and he is so steeped in rectitude as to be unaffected by that public-utility money and its implications , or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been through an  --  orgy of corruption in high office and also of the purchasing of such office on a scale not even surpassed in the Administration of President Grant . If the Ohio gang is to go scot-free , if men about whoSe huge campaign receipts there can be no question are to be seated in the Senate , then let us at least cease to be hypocritical . Let us admit to all the world that we have sunk to as low an estate as any Central American republic . The escape of Fall , Doheny , Daugherty , and their tribe is not What matters . The nation could afford even to lose its richest oil-fields if it learned its lesson . To punish a half dozen sinners would not alter the system under which I they reached high office and aided one another in corruption . The menace lies in the fact that the nation still sleeps ; that business men feel relieved that the system has not been upset ; that jurors see nothing wrong when Cabinet secretaries secretly accept hundred-thousand-dollar gifts from old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the public lands ; that our national conscience has been numbed . Governor Small and Colonel Smith at least seem to have dug their own grave . The Washington dispatches report that if Mr. Smith presents his credentials not ten Senators will vote for him . If true , let us be grateful for that . If there is any other outcome in this and the Vare case , if juries continue to free men who have soiled the United States Cabinet itself with their corruption , let us haul down the Stars and Stripes from the Capitol , hoist the black flag with a dollar mark on it , and proclaim our shame to all the world . Epicures in Crime T HE Fall-Doheny acquittal suggests not only that we Americans have no passionate aversion to government by crooks , as indicated in an accompanying editorial , but also that we are becoming epicures in crime . We delight in ? or at least we accept complacently  --  whatever is elegant , refined , and served on silver platters , at the same time that we turn savagely upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we are nat becoming epicures  --  not to say snobs  --  in crime , how does it happen that in an era of striking public indifference toward political corruption and dishonest business transactions we are witnessing a spectacular outburst against such simple , old-fashioned crimes as burglary and highway robbery ? It is not just a case of the rich man against the poor man . When the rich man is so ill-advised as to commit an unrefined crime we pursue him as relentlessly as if he were poor , although of course his money buys a better defense , and when it comes to hanging there is undoubtedly a feeling in the average juryman 's noddle that a noose chafes a neck used to a greasy shirtband less than one coddled with a white collar . That wealth is no blanket protection against militant American morality is pr , oved by our intolerance toward the Countess Karolyi who broke our First Commandment , " Thou shalt not commit radicalism " ; and our treatment of the Countess Cathcart , who violated one of the higher numbered commandments  --  chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And above all thou shalt not be found out . " Epicures in crime ? If not that , how can Americans take so indifferently  --  even jocosely  --  the doings of our political and commercial gunmen and at the same time grow so hysterical over the acts of the old-fashioned revolver brandishers ? The New York courts have been unable to convict Daugherty and Miller , but the State recently enacted in the Baumes law a code of increased vigor against the criminal resorting to older and more vulgar methods . According to this law a judge is required to send a man to prison for life if convicted of a felony four times , without reference to any mitigating circumstances , and the prisoner is deprived of any opportunity for parole . Thus a certain Negro , amiable in his cups , who for the fourth time in his life appropriated an automobile and went off for a stolen joy ride , was sentenced to life imprisonment ; another whose record was sixty days in 1919 for third-degree burglary , sixty days in 1920 for petty larceny , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unfortunate as to get into a fight with one of his fellow-stevedores and be arrested for assault , also will spend his life in prison . These are not desperate criminals , yet they receive the sentences usually allotted to such and the State prisons now are reported to be virtually filled . Formerly it was easier to plead guilty and rely on the possible leniency of the judge ; now criminals stand trial in the hope of a jury disagreement . From June 30 to November 15 the number of indictments increased almost 100 per cent , although the same months in 1925 showed only a 10 per cent increase . The Baumes law was intended to put the fear of jail  --  if not of God  --  into the heart of the unaristocratic criminal , but six months ' experience with the above provision has called forth vigorous public disapproval from two district attorneys , several judges , and some of the leading newspapers . Yet the community at large , in violation of all that centuries of experience with penology should have taught , has been stampeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection against crime . Contemplation of this state of mind has led Heywood Braun to say in the New York World that " the community has hardened its heart against the criminal . And also , " he adds , " softened its head . " That our sudden fury against the old-fashioned criminal is unintelligent is demonstrated by the historical evidence that a reduction in crimes of violence has gone hand in hand with a lessening in the severity of punishment and an increased respect in the community for the sacredness of human life . The importance of increasing rather than lessening the respect for human life makes it especially tragic that the hysteria which in New York has led to some of the exaggerations of the Baumes law has produced agitation for the restoration of capital punishment in at least two States where it is now happily non-existent . One of the most progressive aspects of criminal law in the United States is the start that has been made toward the abolition of the death penalty . In eight States ? Michigan , Rhode Island , Wisconsin , Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital punishment no longer exists , and the complete elimination of this relic of barbarism ought to be a goal everywhere . But so far from a gain of new ground there now seems to be danger of losing some of the old in the fright and ignorance of public opinion in the face of the so-called " crime wave . " In North Dakota there is talk of restoring the death penalty and in Michigan a bill has been introduced into the legislature which would revive capital punishment in that State . Four States ? Oregon , Washington , Arizona , and Missouri  --  restored capital punishment in the hysteria against radicalism immediately following the World War ; it would be a tragedy if others stepped backward too . And-while we are in a frenzy to revive cruel and obsolete punishments it never occurs to us that a federal law limiting drastically the importation and transportation of revolvers would do more to end gunmen and banditry than all the jails and gallows ever created . Walter Damrosch Retires VV ALTER DAMROSCH is to lay down the baton after forty-two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of music  --  that is unthinkable . As long as he lives his interest in music and musical education will  --  must  --  continue . But the burden of leading the New York Symphony Orchestra he is now to shift to others after having devoted himself to it since 1903 . He confesses to sixty-four years ; it seems incredible , since it was surely only yesterday that he was " the young Damrosch , " determined to follow in the footsteps of his great father , Leopold Damrosch , one of the best of the many gifts to the United States from musical Germany . But sixty-four is a good retiring age ; Walter Damrosch deserves leisure for those other things dear to his heart which every active man puts by for the day when he retires  --  a day which for most never comes . It is true , of course , that Walter Damrosch never rose to his father 's heights and that his conducting could never be called inspired  --  it has always been uneven , at times bad . Severe criticisms of his conducting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . There was at first a feeling that the son was following his father less because of an artistic urge than because of the temptation to profit by a sire 's success which makes so many young men the law-partners of their prosperous fathers . Such feelings in regard to Walter Damrosch have long since been changed . The sincerity of the man ; his tireless industry , his growth as a conductor , his services to music outside of the concert hall , his witty speeches , his unsparing efforts to make good music available to the masses , his sponsorship of talent and genius  --  all these have been deservedly recognized , and so it was a pleasure to record a few years ago his taking of his American orchestra for a trip to Europe  --  a most happy international event rewarded by more than one government . Against his weaknesses must forever be set his service , when assistant conductor of the Metropolitan Opera , in bringing the great Anton Seidl and Lilli Lehmann to this country . If his conducting of Wagner often brought upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his works contributed enormously to their familiarization in the American musical world . As a program-maker he is of the very best . So , too , has opinion changed about his orchestra . There was a time when his alliance with Harry Harkness Flagler 's extraordinary devotion and munificent generosity to the musical art seemed to imperil the successes of other and more needed organizations  --  the Philharmonic , for instance , which early found that it could not permanently use Mr. Damrosch . Those years are long past . There is nothing more extraordinary in the spiritual and intellectual growth of America in the last twenty-five years than its new appreciation of the orchestra . The establishment of great musical organizations as far West as Oregon has had its counterpart in New York where the Philharmonic is crowded , tickets for the Philadelphia Orchestra are unavailable , and the Minneapolis , Cincinnati , Boston , and other orchestras play to increasing houses . More than one great orchestra New York certainly needs ; its musical growth has caught up with the Symphony . Whether the latter 's deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flagler became its sole supporter we do not know ; his purse has seemed limitless , and the reward has been his of anticipating and justifying a need . If the partnership with Damrosch is dissolved , it is gratifying to know that this generous citizen and patriot will continue to serve the musical world . Books and Behavior A T the bottom of the censorship question is another question which , so far as we know , has never been adequately considered . What is the effect of any book , good or bad , upon the conduct of its readers ? It is generally assumed that a " good " book is " good for " human beings ; everyone has heard it said of some work or other that " no one can rise from the reading of it without being a better man . " People over the earth have claimed as much for their bibles , whether they were Mohammedans , Buddhists , Confucianists , Mormons , Christian Scientists , Jews , or Christians . And Coleridge claimed as much for " Tom Jones , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful episode of Tom and Lady Bellaston . Are such claims legitimate , and if they are , what do they mean ? And does it follow that there are certain books the reading of which leaves one a worse or a more dangerous person ? The general question has been answered , but not adequately , by Gertrud Baumer , a member of the Democratic Party in the German Reichstag . She was writing to the Vossische Zeatung in answer to widespread criticism in the German press of a censorship bill presented to the Reichstag . The bill is designed to discourage the publication of violent and otherwise " low " fiction of the sort which , it is reported , circulates in abundance today among the youth of the new republic . Frau Baumer said : It may be true that , on the whole , no great material harm is done by acts of burglary committed by youthful gangs after reading bad detective stories . What is true is that usually much harm is done to youth by these books . The question therefore is , should bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and triumph over it ? Which is worse  --  the risk that a book which may not be regarded as 100 per cent bad may be placed by mistake on the black list or the risk that one child 's life be ruined by such a book ? Whatever the merits of this reasoning , Frau Baumer 's argument has prevailed in the Reichstag , with the result that committees of investigation will be empowered , when six of their eight members so agree , to prevent any book or illustration from appearing anywhere in Germany henceforth . A court of appeal , to be established at Leipzig , will have we know not what mollifying effect . Frau Baumer 's reasoning is probably very bad  --  or it may be perfect . We do not know or care which . The point is that we are tired of reasoning per se in this connection . Are there no facts ? Is there not a science of psychology , even one of physiology , that could throw light upon the processes set up in the mind , in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably , is important , since it is with the body that a boy goes out of the room in which his mind has been absorbed and gets a gun , points it at some unsuspecting citizen on the street , and , perhaps , pulls the trigger . That is the process which Frau Bdumer highhandedly assumes when she speaks of burglaries " committed . . . after the reading of bad detective stories . " She admits that there may be doubt concerning the amount of harm done by these burglaries ; she has never thought to ask , it would seem , whether the burglaries were caused by the books . And does she imply , by the way , that " good " detective stories would not bring about the same results ? The best detective stories we know are not about patriotism or platonic love ; if they were we should not know them . Neither Shakespeare nor the Bible is wholly occupied with virtue . If psychology and physiology could elucidate " the processes we have spoken of , and if they could establish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still be the problem of deciding what actions or thoughts are good and what are bad . Ethics would come in ' there , and ethics , fortunately or unfortunately , is so far not a science ; it changes with every decade . Doubtless it will always be difficult to know what is really " harmful " to " youth , " and after that to say for certain that society is not just as well off with a little harm going on here and there . It is all very hard . And meanwhile the censorious are always raking over books and plays in America , looking for evil , and the House of Lords is considering a bill to prevent the publication of divorce-trial proceedings in English newspapers  --  in order , says Lord Burnham , proprietor of the Daily Telegraph. , to render to the rich that protection of silence concerning their sins which is now enjoyed by the obscure poor . In England , then , they seek to leave such things to the imagination  --  which no government has thus far learned how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
