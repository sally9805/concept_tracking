DutuNG the war , in almost all the larger countries involved , there were groups of people who , for religious reasons , could not see their way clear to take part in it . These , people were sometimes members of an organized religious group , such as the Mennonites , Quakers , Seventh-Day Adventists , and the like ; but in other cases they were isolated individuals , who took the same position against war , but were not affiliated with any organization whose creed opposed participating in war . Many of these people suffered severe persecution for their beliefs . Some of them went to jail for considerable periods ; some of them died , or were killed there ; some went into noncombatant service , or into the Red Cross or relief work ; some went out on the North Sea at the extremely dangerous work of mine-sweeping ; and others undertook other work which they felt was suitable in demonstrating their beliefs . I have met and talked with a considerable number of these conscientious objectors , not only in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard their stories . I have found that my own story is apparently unique in one respect . All the conscientious objectors with whom I talked had certain beliefs ? which varied a good deal with different personalities ? concerning the Christian method of dealing with violence . For the most part , however , during the war these men were not called upon to face personal violence ? at least , not in a way to test out the various supposititious cases brought forward as arguments against the non-resistant position by people who opposed the idea of pacifism as impractical . Because , to a certain degree , my case is different from the usual run of conscientious objectors , I have been led to believe that it might be well to contribute my story , as a partial answer , at least , to these supposititious arguments . In order to do so , however , it will be necessary for me to state briefly my own position in connection with war and non-resistance . As I understand the teachings of the New Testament and the life lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first , a belief that Jesus Christ and God were , in some mysterious way , one ; that is , that the picture of personality and character demonstrated by Christ is a true picture of the personality and charactpr of God . The second basis is that absolute power and utter love , as combined in the character of Jesus Christ , are a fundamental fact , in which the man who is trying to follow Christ can trust . I other words , the man following Chris can rely upon a Divine Power whirl has power over all things . This Divine Power is fundamentally the power o utter love . These two bases are the fundamental principles on which the follower of Christ rests his belief . The working out , practically , is everyday life , of the above-mentioned ideas goes much deeper than the ordi. nary church member or religious person thinks ; and in its ultimate end it gm much farther than anybody except Jesus himself has ever put into practice . In regard to war , it means that the Christian pacifist believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hate , and that , in order to overcome evil , ? really overcome it , ? one force , and one only , can be used that is the force of love . Such a posi. tion eliminates the possibility of par . taking in war ; for war fundamentally believes in the use of evil means to attain a good end ? I must kill people in order to bring about democracy , freedom , self-determination of nations , and so forth . I must do what we all roe . ognize to be evil , and what we punish men for in times of peace , and do it in the belief that good will come from it . Such a position is a contradiction of terms to the Christian pacifist who believes that the only way of overdone . ing evil is with good . What then should I do , holding such beliefs , in the spring of 1917 , in the United States ? Many sincere men believed that the most Christian thing to do was to give their lives in the front trenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping to do away the evil of war . To hold my position honestly , and meet such men face to face , it was necessary for me to be will . ing to do something at least as disagree able and dangerous , and to do it with the motive of keeping people aloe , of bringing about reconciliation and goodwill between hostile factions , and to do it using only methods which were uplifting and helpful and beneficial to everybody concerned . I had to be willing to get killed , but to do so loving everybody and trying to help everybody , including the Germans , the Turks , and all other people . Then , and only then , could I meet the sincere men whom I knew , who were risking their lives in the trenches . My belief was that such a programme of the use of good means could produce only good results , and that all I had to do was to insist upon continuing the use of good means , refusing to use evil means . I feel more convinced now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually obtained by fighting , that my position in 1917 was correct ; and I have met a number of people who have been pretty well brought around to my point of view by the events of the last four 3ears . Such was and is my position as a Christian pacifist in regard to war . In 1917 , I frankly expressed my convictions in regard to the Christian participating in war , and found very frequently that people wanted to push me into answering supposititious cases . Two of these cases were as follows : ? 1 . ' You say you will not use evil means , even to attain a good end . Do you mean to tell me that , if you were in a room full of women and children , and some of those wild Turks and Kurds from the mountains of Turkey should come and begin to break in the door , you would stand aside , like a coward , and let them come in , refusing to fight to protect the women and children ? Would not fighting be right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the most loving thing , even toward the Kurds and Turks , by killing them to prevent their assaulting the women and children ? ' My answer to this , while I was in America , was that I felt that I was a Christian pacifist , not just a pacifist , and that I believed that , if I honestly tried to follow the teachings of Christ , God would never put me in a position where I would be unable to act in a spirit of real love toward everybody concerned , including the Kurds and the Turks . As for the killing of the latter in a spirit of love , the thing in itself is an absurdity . Nobody deliberately wills to kill those to whom his loving , affectionate heart has gone out . Love is not so constituted . I have now a small boy . I love him very much . There may come a time when my son may determine to do something wrong . As his father , I have the right and the duty to urge upon him a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in so doing , the punishment may be beneficial to him ; but everyone will admit that it would be wrong for me to kill my son , in order to prevent him from doing evil . The attitude of the Christian pacifist toward the Kurd or the Turk would not be different . My position in regard to this supposititious case was that I could not guarantee that no one would be killed or injured or assaulted : that did not rest in my power ; but I believed that , if I continued to act in a spirit of love toward the intruding Turks and Kurds , ? mind you , not in a spirit of subservience or cowardice , ? I should be using the most effective means to prevent the killing or assault from taking place . As long as I continued to use the right means , I could be sure that I was doing the very best thing that I personally could do , and I could then count on the real Divine Power of God Almighty to direct the thoughts , wills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could safely leave the situation in his hands . If we were killed or assaulted , in spite of any refusal to fight , I could then count on it thus being God 's will for us all to die or be assaulted , and that our death or injury would be more effective in bringing about the Kingdom of God on earth than any other thing we could possibly do . 2 . The second supposititious case was this : What about the drunken or crazy man running amuck ? What would you do if you saw a drunken man armed and lusting for blood in the midst of a crowded street ? Would you not be justified in killing him as you would a mad dog ? ' My reply to this case was that a man is a man and not a dog ; and that whether he is drunk , or whether he is mad , does not alter the case . He still is a man , and , if I believe in the life and death of Christ , I must believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as others . As he put it , ' I come not to bring the righteous but sinners to repentance . ' I therefore can no more picture Jesus Christ shooting down a wild , drunken madman running amuck , than I could picture him in the trenches in Flanders sticking a bayonet into the stomach of a German , or squirting liquid fire into the faces of a group of Austrians . The man Christ Jesus , as I see him in the New Testament , was not that kind of person . Moreover , I believed that there would be a better and more effective way of handling the drunken madman than by killing him ; because , when I killed him , I could do nothing more for his soul ; and fundamentally a Christian pacifist must consider loving his enemy as well as protecting his friend . II These supposititious cases were very commonly brought up , and are still commonly brought up , by those who wish to show that Christianity and war can be reconciled . I felt that the above answers to the supposititious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ; but somehow I felt called upon to give myself an opportunity of demonstrating in action that such a method of handling the cases would work . I felt that I should be an active pacifist , not a passive one ; and so I went to a friend of mine who was well posted on the Near-Eastern and the general world situation , and asked him to tell me what in his judgment was the most dangerous and disagreeable part of the world at that particular time . He at once answered me by saying , West Persia . ' At that time , 1917 , in West Persia a combination of war and a mixture of racial antipathies and reli. gious fanaticism , which had come deny through hundreds of years , existed in a marked degree . The country had been the fighting ground of the Turkish and Russian armies since the beginning of the war . Mohammedanism , with all its complications , was very strong . Massacres and flights of peoples had taken place , and were liable to occur at any time . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward in its culture , there being no sewers in the cities , no sanitation of any kind , only a fell hospitals run by American missionary doctors , and most of the worst diseases were continually present and often raging : smallpox , cholera , typhoid , para-typhoid , typhus , relapsing fever , malaria , pernicious malaria , and a number of other diseases were not only common but were a pressing concern . On top of all this , law and order were very weak in this section of the world ; and altogether I believe from expe. rience that my friend was right when he named West Persia as the worst place in the world at that time . I therefore volunteered to go to West Persia , to assist in the relief work . I agreed to pay all my own expenses and to accept no salary . I did not expect ever to come back again , as it did not seem probable that I could stay alive in such a country for more than a few months ; so I made my will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and friends , and started for Persia . This was in May , 1917 . The long journey through Norway , Sweden , Finland , across Russia , and through the Caucasus , to Persia , was slow ; but finally I arrived safely in a city of some 50,000 inhabitants in West Persia ? Urumiah . Here I was put in charge of the orphans , the industrial relief , and was made secretary of the Relief Committee . During the summer , autumn , and early winter , I a as very busy riding from village to village over the plains , visiting , classifying , and arranging for the feeding , clothing , and general care of the 500-odd orphans scattered throughout this stricken area . I organized some of the refugee Assyrians into a cloth-industry , giving several hundred women work in carding and spinning wool , and arranged for the building of twenty-five native hand-looms . I soon had them weaving the native cloth which for countless generations has been an important material for men 's clothing in the high mountains of Kurdistan . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cloth per week . ( One Turkish arshine equals 29 inches . ) Later on , as need arose , I took charge also of cleaning up the streets of the city of Urumiah ( my first and only job as street-cleaning commissioner ) . This developed , among other lines , into one very unpleasant task : namely , the collecting and reburying of bodies dug up by the dogs in the graveyards , and partly eaten . The cleaning-up and keeping clean ( as far as possible in such an unsanitary country ) of the yards filled with refugees also fell upon my shoulders , as did the complete care of the relief-transportation equipment of autos , horses , carts , harness , and the rest . All these activities kept me very busy during the remainder of 1917 , and on into the spring and summer of 1918 . In July , 1918 , the situation around Urumiah was very intense . The ill-will stirred up by the war , the persecutions , the massacres , the assaulting of women and the carrying-off of girls , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syrians and Armenians on the one hand , and the Turks , Kurds , and Moslems on the other . The country had suffered terribly from the destruction of prop , rty . There were thousands of people who had been driven from their homes an , l were refugees . By far the most destitute and miserable of these were the refugee Kurds , who were Mohammedans , in the streets of the city ; and the great majority of people throughout the region were by no means beyond the need of relief . The Russian army had been withdrawn following the Bolshevist revolt , and with their withdrawal the two factions in the city of Urumiah ? on the one hand , local Mohammedans , and on the other hand , the Armenians and Syrians ? had each determined to gain military and political control over the country . In this the Syrians and Armenians were greatly assisted by the Russians , who not only armed them but organized them into battalions , and even left some officers to drill and direct them . The Moslems also secured what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1918 , there was a clash ending in the capture of the city by the Armenians and Syrians . This control spread over the great part of the Urumiah plain and , as it spread , the most disorderly element among the Syrians and Armenians took advantage of the situation to take revenge on the Mohammedans . This resulted in so much massacre , robbery , and indiscriminate killing , that the great mass of Moslems of the surrounding regions got together an armed force , to overthrow the control of the Armenians and Syrians in the city . For months this fight kept up , the city and plain being practically surrounded by hostile Moslem bands , while , in the centre , all sorts of evil things were being perpetrated by those in control . Finally , the assistance of the regular Turkish army was obtained by the surrounding Moslems , and with their advent on the scene , with artillery and a better organized body of men , the Armenians and Syrians were finally forced out and compelled to run away to the south , hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating from Mesopotamia and Southern Persia . On the morning of July thirtieth , this great flight to the south of 75,000 to 100,000 people began , and the test of the first supposititious case took place about ten o'clock in the morning . All the Americans except Dr. and Mrs. W. A. Shedd decided to stay in Urumiah , rather than to attempt to go with the Syrians and Armenians . We had been living in the College Compound , ? an area about the size of an ordinary city block , ? surrounded by a mud wall varying in height from five to fifteen feet , and situated about two miles from the city .. Inside this area were the dwelling-houses of the missionaries and some of the native assistants , a boys ' college , and the hospital , together wills outhouses , stables , and so forth . With the exception of myself , all the Americans were missionaries , the relief work being carried on practically altogether through their efforts . Throughout most of the period when the Armenians and Syrians were in con trol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moslems , had come into the College Compound , to seek protection from the disorders which reigned outside . At the time of the flight the number of these refugees was only a few hundred . These were camped out under all sorts of shelters , or no shelter at all , in different parts of the yard . A road coming down from the mountains of Turkey passed directly in front of the College Compound and continued on to the city , When the news was telephoned out in the middle of the night that the Armenian and Syrian populations were starting to flee to the south , we Americans made what preparations we could for the coming change of control . As soon as it was daylight , I took Dr. Packard and Dr. Ellis into the city in the Ford , and left them there , busying myself by carrying food and people back and forth , until about ten o'clock , when the advance-guard of the Turkish army arrived . I had expected to bring Dr. Ellis and Dr. Packard back again before the Turks came ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first men to arrive were the Kurdish horsemen , with an occasional Turkish soldier . It was apparent that they must have been ordered to leave us , the Americans , alone , for the great majority of them rode right by the gate , and on toward the city . At this time we were assisted greatly by the Moslem refugees , who had been receiving protection in our yards for so long . Most of these Kurdish and Moslem fugitives stood at the open gate , their faces wreathed in smiles , and welcomed the oncoming horsemen with joy ; but they did not do anything to turn their attention toward the Cont- pound , but quietly allowed them to pass on toward the city . It happened , however , that a few of the Kurds gained entry through a small back gate , and it was these irregular stragglers who raided us and put me through the supposititious case number one . Dr. Dodd and I sat on the long music scat , in front of Mrs. Ellis 's piano . In the living-room with us were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two little children , and a number of native Syrian servants . Dr. Dodd and I had just come in from the yard outside , where both of us had nearly lost our lives at the hands of some of the raiding Kurds , mine being saved twice once by a Moslem hostler and once by a friendly Kurd . I did not know what was going to happen next , as things outside were in great disorder , and we could hear shooting all around us . The setting for the supposititious case was practically complete . Here I was , a Christian pacifist . In the room with me were a number of helpless women and children . Dr. Dodd had only recently got out of bed , and could scarcely be considered as an able-bodied man . I therefore was the only one present physically fit to defend this group of helpless people . At any minute the door might open and the Kurds might enter . Truly , the setting was complete . But I had been holding in my mind the fixed determination that , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either myself or others ; and I trusted that in some way I should be able so to act that the best results for all would be achieved . As Dr. Dodd and I told the ladies of our experiences of a few moments before , there suddenly came a tremendous pounding on the door leading from the dining-room , which was next to the sitting room where we were , out into the kitchen and the back yard . The it-no had arrived . The Kurds were at the door . What should I do ? The thought came into my mind that it would be better to open the door and let the Kurds in , than to stay away from it and allow them to smash their way in . If they broke down the door , they would come in in more of a rage than if we opened the door and let them in . I suggested this to Dr. Dodd , and he and I together walked into the dining-room and over toward the door leading to the kitchen . I remember , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blows of the gun-butts from without . A small bolt was all that held the door closed , and I reached over and pulled this and opened the door , saying as I did so , Buyurun ' ? meaning ' Come in . ' As the door swung open , we found ourselves looking into the business end of three rifles , backed up by the dusky faces of three Kurds . They had made themselves up , with their fringed turbans , to appear particularly ferocious , and they certainly looked the part . My judgment , however , is that they were surprised at having the door opened and being invited to come in . In any case , they did not shoot ; and , as they entered , in voices of intense excitement they demanded ' Pool ! Pool ! Pool ! ' ( money ! money ! money ! ) This was a decided relief , as we had some money , and possibly , if we gave it to them , they would go away . With this in mind , Dr. Dodd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sitting-room , where the ladies were . I remember walking as rapidly as possible , with the thought of getting the Kurds past the ladies without any unnecessary delay . This scheme worked , and we entered Dr. Ellis 's study through a little side door , leaving the ladies and the children behind us . It so happened that Dr. Dodd had the key of the top drawer of Dr. Ellis 's desk . He opened it , and I remember standing close by and watching two brown hands grab for the small bag of coin lying in the bottom of the drawer . Following this , the three Kurds began rummaging around the room , looking for valuables . I recall about this time noticing Dr. Dodd , as he slipped out of the room back to the sitting-room , to look after the ladies . This I considered as a good thing , and I then realized that it was my task to entertain the three Kurds and keep them away from the ladies . Dr. Ellis had removed to his study the relief money of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room . One was empty , while the other contained several thousand dollars in money . While the Kurds were rummaging around the room , I walked over to the safe that had the money in it , and tried to open it . Like all Russian safes , it was an iron box with a lid like a trunk , the keyhole being in the top of the lid . Finding the safe was locked , I stood there for a moment , and a horrible sinking feeling began to creep over me as the realization of the situation came to me . There was nothing to do , however , but to play the game ; and so I turned back to the Kurds , who were on the other side of the little room . They had pulled the rug off the lounge , had looked under it , had emptied some of the stuff out of the drawers of the desk ; and , as I turned , one of them suddenly threw up his rifle , covering me , and , speaking in Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I honestly did not have the key , and I looked him in the eye over the sights of his rifle and told him so . Recognizing that I was speaking the truth , he put his gun down and began to rummage around again . About this time one of them found Dr. Ellis 's Corona typewriter in its case . It was heavy and looked like a small bag or box , which , of course , led the Kurd to think that it contained coin of some sort . I moved over to open it for him ; but before I could reach him , he had thrown it on the floor and broken the box open . The three men gathered around and peered with wonder at the little metal bars and shiny parts ; and I stood there , speaking in English , and tried to demonstrate with my fingers what the typewriter was for . But in a moment they had turned away , looking elsewhere . I now realized that I must hold their attention and keep them occupied . The thought came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second mile with these men . Here they were , compelling me to go a mile with them , and now I must also go the second mile . They were taking away my coat , and must now give them my cloak also ; and so I entered into the looting myself and sincerely desired to get the safes open . With this in mind , I began aggressively to direct the attention and activities of the three men toward the opening of the safes . The thought came to me that , possibly , if we shot into the keyhole of the safe , we might spring the lock . ( The use of the word ' we ' comes perfectly natural , because I really joined their party in their efforts to smash the safe open and considered myself as one of them for the moment . ) I therefore took hold of the arm of one of the men , and shook it enough to attract his attention ; then I put my finger on the keyhole of the safe and , talking to him in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the place where I had my finger . He got the idea and raised his rifle ; I took my finger away , and he fired . All the people in tire next room , of course , hearing the shot , thought , ' Well , there goe : , Richards ? the Christian pacifist is through . ' But the lock did not spring , and the safe did not open ; so he fired a second time , at my suggestion , without result . I then tried to open the safe by pulling and overturning it ; but this did no good either . And here an interesting point arose . The Kurds were growing impatient . The safe had not opened ; and suddenly one of them , without a moment 's notice , lost control of his temper , threw up his rifle , and hit me on the shoulder with the butt of it . Then a curious thing happened . I had been honestly sincere in trying to help them open the safe ; I had joined them in their efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . This sudden blow on the shoulder , therefore , was a real surprise to me , and I remember turning and looking at the man who struck me with an expression which must have said to him , What are you hitting me for . I am doing everything I can to help you . ' I spoke no word , but he must have read my look ; for he put his gun down , and paid no further attention to me . We continued our efforts with the safe , and finally one of them fired again into the other safe , without springing that lock either . Things were getting more intense for me in my efforts to keep these three men out of the other room . With these failures to open the safes , one of the Kurds again threw his rifle up , and threatened to shoot me if I did not give up the key . But once again I looked him in the eye , and told him what was the truth , ? that I did not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , this same man came forward , reached down , and began to take off one of my shoes . Thinking that he imagined that I had money in them , I helped him , and also took the other one off for him . Much to my surprise , he took both the shoes and walked into the room where the ladies were , following his two companions who had preceded him . In order to continue to exert my influence on the Kurds against violence , it was necessary for me to continue to play the game with them ; and so I followed into the room where the ladies were , and found them all standing up and Dr. Dodd in his shirt sleeves and stocking feet . It seemed that other Kurds had followed the first three into the house , and had come in to where the ladies were , had demanded their jewelry , and had looked around for what they could carry off . One of them proceeded to go around and open the cupboards and boxes , and some of the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , helped him . The man who had taken my shoes sat down on the piano-stool , took off his own charicks ( rawhide sandals ) , and proceeded to put on my shoes . Finally , after taking a raincoat , an overcoat , Dr. Ellis 's small traveling medical case , and other odds and ends , they all went out , ? passing right by the Ellises ' sideboard , on which stood some of their silverware , ? and left us alone . It was then that I discovered that Mrs. Richards had entered the sitting-room just as Dr. Dodd and I had passed through it with the first three Kurds , on our way into the study where the safes were . I had not known where she was ; but she knew that I was in with the Kurds and , of course , had feared that the firing was directed at me . After a short time , some friendly Kurds came into the room ; and before long some of the regular Turkish soldiers appeared to take charge . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had been able to act in a general way along the plan outlined theoretically by myself before I left America , and the plan of action had worked . Mrs. Ellis , in her story of the raid , published in the Atlantic Monthly for September , 1919 , speaks of the situation in these words : I shall always be thankful that Wilder Dr. Ellis was kept in the city that morning , for I fear he might have resisted the attack , and in that event he would certainly have been killed . ' Looking back at it , it seems at least a reasonable supposition that , if I had started in to resist , I not only should have been killed myself , but that , in all probability , Dr. Dodd also would have lost his life , and in the excitement even some of the ladies might have been shot . There is another point in this connection of which I think it worth while to speak . I am temperamentally more or less hot-headed , and when asked in America whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Kurd abuse my wife , or someone whom I loved , ' without flying into a rage , I had ans wered that , being a Christian pacifist , I did not believe I should ever be called upon to endure anything beyond my moral strength . I learned after the raid was over that one of the Kurds , coming into the sitting-room while I was occupied with the three men and the safes , had pointed his rifle at Mrs. Richards and threatened her , and that another one had talked about carrying her off to the mountains with him , and had taken her wedding-ring . None of this was I called upon to witness , or even to know about until it was all past . To me this is a striking coincidence , to say the least . IV But what about the case of the drunken man , armed and lusting for blood ? this being supposititious case number two ? One day in the spring , it must have been some time in May , I was busy in the rear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . Dr. Ellis was up in the treasury-room , and we two were the only American men in the yards . Mrs. Shedd and Mrs. Richards were in their respective houses . There was the usual crowd at the big gate opening on the street ; and scattered through the yards were various people occupied with many kinds of business . Among them were the Kurdish and Moslem refugees , who here , as in the College Compound , were seeking safety from their enemies , the Syrians and Armenians . One of these refugees , a rich and prominent local Moslem , was a particularly bad character , who had aroused the special hatred of the Anne . mans and Syrians by his abuse of them three years before , when the Turks were in control . Suddenly I heard an excited roar go up from out near the gate . Leaving the horseshoeing , I ran to see what was going on , and found a panic-stricken group of Syrians and Armenians peep. ing into the large main yard through a narrow little door . From them I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed , had rushed into the yards from the street , crying that he had come to kill Agha Sader ? the wealthy refugee rascal . He had entered the main yard through the little door , everybody fleeing before him , and was now alone in the centre of it , crying out to Agha Sader to show himself . Here was supposititious case number two ? the wild drunken man running amuck . What was the Christian thing to do ? I could easily have snatched a rifle from someone in the crowd , ? a very large proportion of the people were armed , ? and shot the drunkard from behind the cover of the wall ; but that would not be a loving way of treat . ing him . He was drunk , and I was used to dealing with drunks in the rescue-mission work I had done in New York . Also , he had no grudge against me personally . If , therefore , I treated him without showing fear , and very decidedly showing friendliness , there was a good chance that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a serious chance that he might shoot ; but if I was a Christian pacifist , I could count on the power of God to control the drunken mind of the young Acmenian as long as I held nothing but love I for him in my heart . I With this in mind , I entered the little , , ate and walked quietly but directly toward my man . He was looking for Agha Bader , and holding his gun ready to shoot , crying out as he did so . To I reach him I had to walk perhaps one hundred feet in plain view . If I could get up close to him before he saw me , he would perhaps recognize me as not being an enemy . But could I get up close before he turned ? I went ahead , passing my house , and saw Mrs. Richards open the door and look out . I motioned to her to keep back as I went on . I had got about half-way to the Armenian when Mrs. Shedd , who was looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Armenian , and he swung around to see where the voice . t came from . This enabled me to come even closer Without his seeing me ; and ; when he finally turned toward me , I was only a short distance from him . I smiled and held out my hand , offering to shake hands with him . Here was the test . I strove to appear to this poor drunken mind as a friend who was not afraid . He swung around and caught sight of me , hesitated a moment , and then , drawing himself up to attention , he grounded his rifle and saluted me in unsteady , drunken seriousness . As I came up close to him , I continued to hold out my hand ; and much to my surprise , he handed me his gun , saying as he did so , ' A present . ' Taking the rifle in one hand and his arm in the other , I quietly walked with him to the gate , Dr. Ellis joining me . Next day the Armenian came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized for his conduct the day before . I had kept his rifle for him over night , and gave it back to him , along with some very straight talk . I had been through the second supposititious case . The wild , drunken mad dog ' turned out to be a man , and not a dog at all ; and instead of shooting him down the day before , I shook hands with him and we parted on excellent terms . Incidentally , throughout this entire affair , nobody was killed or even injured . In telling of these two tests , I make no pretense of claiming that they cover completely every possible detail of what might have happened , but they do , at least to a degree , cover some of the ground of the supposititious cases . They both tested out my belief in Christian pacifism ; and my theoretical answers to each supposititious case , uttered while I was in America , proved workable in practice nearly nine thousand miles away , among wild , uncivilized , and even drunken people , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold true to my ideal of action ; but so far as I was able to hold fast to the attitude of good-will toward everyone , I found from experience that the results actually obtained amply justified my faith .
