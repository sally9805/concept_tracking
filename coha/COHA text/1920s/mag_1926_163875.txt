Richard Wagner is often quoted as having said that the human voice is the foundation of all music . In the U. S. , the human voice is more than this-it is the foundation of a great and prosperous trade . Behind the famous opera stars and song recitalists ( the Rothschilds , the Astorbilts of their profession ) there is a vast soviet of vocal students , church sopranos , ballad singers , cabaret songsters , 50,000 professional singers , male and female , and 250,000 assorted aspirants . Until recently the vocal industry was without a trade journal , but a fortnight ago the first issue of Singing , The Voice Magazine ( Alfred Human , * Editor ) appeared on the newsstands , was eagerly bought and discussed by the practitioners of the trade . Singing , its first readers found , was somewhat patchily made up . It contained an article by W. J. Henderson , critic , who pooh-poohed the popular reverence for opera stars , calling Emilio de Gogorza , concert baritone , " the supreme artist of them all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians , by a blurred " Art Supplement , " and by a song entitled " A Memory " and beginning : Somehow I feel that thou art near , Though naught there is around , which the composer , one Rudolph Ganz , dedicated to Marguerite Namara , opera star . Odd corners of the large glazed pages were filled with practical workroom suggestions for young singers , with reviews of concerts and operas , and glib comment on vocal activities by one " Ariel .

Vocal students bought it eagerly . Advertisers were interested . <P> Lost and Found <P> Eccentric Ethel Leginska made one of her famed disappearances last week in Evansville , Ind . She was scheduled to play at the Coliseum there before an audience of some 3,000 . The evening of the concert came , almost the hour-no Leginska . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said : " I do n't want to ride in your old yellow cabs . I ca n't play the piano tonight . I want my symphony orchestra . " When she went to the hall to practice : " I do n't like this old barn . I wo n't play the piano in this old building . " Next day a note was discovered addressed to Manager S. E. MacMillen : " Dear Sam , I think I am going crazy . I can not play tonight . I am so sorry , but I am ill . " <P> Three days later Manager MacMillen found her in Chicago at the soda fountain of the Auditorium Hotel with her 16-year-old son , who at his mother 's bidding had run away from his grandparents ' home to join her there . She would never play again in public , she said . She would turn her mind to composition . <P> Friends spoke sorrowingly of her " nervous condition . . . .
