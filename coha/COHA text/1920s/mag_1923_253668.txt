Herbert Bayard Swope , executive editor of The New York World , is justly proud of many things , including a roving reporter , Mrs. Clare Sheridan . Her despatches to The World ( about Rudyard Kipling , Ireland , the Rhineland , Constantinople , Mussolini ) have just been published under the title West and East , and are prefaced with the remark : " I have lost my belief in the infallibility of the Anglo-Saxon race . I have ceased to believe in equality , freedom or justice . " <P> F. Opper , Hearst cartoonist , continues to depict Uncle Sam in skirts .
