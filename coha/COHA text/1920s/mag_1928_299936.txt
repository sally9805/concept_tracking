WALKER , JR . <P> South Hanover , Mass . <P> Sirs : <P> Apropos of that caballero and equestrian tycoon , William Gibbs McAdoo , recently depicted with Mexican accoutrements en grande tenue , and set forth as mounting , " up onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kindly permit the following correction ; - " Hell ! that ai nt no mare ! " <P> GEO . T. PACK , M. D. <P> New York City <P> Sirs : <P> If the Editors of TIME are not sufficiently discerning to report accurately the sex of a horse ( TIME , Aug. 20 , p. 11 , picture and text ) what credence is to be accorded their reports of more intricate matters ? <P> CRUSE CARRIEL <P> Los Angeles , Calif . <P> TIME 'S political correspondent , no horseman , was misled ; but is now able to state definitely that Mr. McAdoo was mounted upon Joaquin , an animal owned by Dwight Murphy of Santa Barbara . Joaquin , no mare , is a gelding. - ED . <P> <P> Fowl Blood <P> Sirs : <P> ... I go almost every Sunday to cockfights and I have never seen spurts of blood other than the fowl blood . <P> And as to whether cockfighting is barbarous and cruel , it is a matter of opinion : we think the same about boxing . <P> As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ridicule us , but , did you mention in your paper the tryumphs obtained by the debating team of our university when our young men visited the States last spring and won all the debates , both in Spanish and in English , over several of your colleges and universities ? <P> Of course not ! <P> EUGENTO VERA <P> Guayama , Puerto Rico
