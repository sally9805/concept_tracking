txt With the arrival of Captain AMUNDSEN and LINCOLN ELLSWORTH at King 's Bay , Spitzbergen. on Wednesday , the Start of the airship Norge for the North Pole may be made in the end of April . A mooring mast to which she will tie . when she ' comes from Leningrad is ready , and the great wooden shed where she may be housed in a gale or for the inspection of her motors Is almost completed . The plan seems to be to have the Norge sail direct to Spitzbergen without stopping at Vadsoe , where there is a mooring mast . What this means is that Captain Amur:est/sr desires to get away from Spitzbergen about May 15 , if practicable . Whatever he may say about his indifference to competition with the airplane enterprises of BYRD and Williams , he knows the value of being the first to report land on his voyage between the Pole and Point Barrow . Furthermore , May weather is more suitable for dirigible cruising in the polar regions than the weather of June . As the temperature rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned with . That seems to be the view of Captain AMUNDSEN . But there ca n't be a hard and fast rule about atmosphere in the far north . Whalers ' logbooks perhaps give the most light upon the weather in the latitudes which the ships reach . It may be supposed that kaillaTOSEN pins his faith to meteorological records kept at Ring 's Bay during a period of years . PEARY 'S experience in his dash to the Pole in April , 1909 , was so agreeable from the ' weather point of view that BYRD and WILHINS must wish that they had been ready to fly by April 1 . When PEARY found himself 133 nautical miles from his goal he sent BARTLETT back , and on the 2d began his march . At 10 A. M. on April 6 he got to the Pole or near it . His journal shows alternately clear and overcast days , the temperature minus twenty-five to forty degrees , but on one day a " bitter wind burned our faces so that they cracked .

Two days later " a brilliant day " was reported , the air nearly calm , the sun " almost hot " ? nevertheless , the temperature was below zero . The rest of the month up to April 23 , when " Crane City , " a collection of snow huts at Cape Columbia , was in sight , the weather was free from storms . " The last daseo journey before we reached shore " ( he is speaking of Grant Land ) " was made " in the same brilliant , clear , calm " weather . " It took PEARY fifty-three days to travel with his dog sledges from Cape Columbia to the Pole and back . All the time it would have been good flying weather except for one day of high winds . We know that Captain Wmicrivs in the flights he reported between Fairbanks and Point Barrow this month was fortunate .

Aniumossar doubtless prefers the milder days of May for voyaging in his hydrogen-filled ship , but he , too , must have longed for storrnless April weather , knowing the experience of PEAttY . According to the German experts , who have been predicting all kinds of confusion for him , the Norge Ms not been properly tested for so exacting an ordeal in the far north , but Count NOPILE is well satisfied with her performances and asks only a few days of fair weather to sail her to Point Barrow . The Norge is of course an experiment , but the Germans have exaggerated her defects . She may be expected at King 's Bay before the end of April or early In May . From Rome to Spitzbergen should be a sufficient proof of her airworthiness . Commander 13reD will soon be due at King 's Bay . The engines of his airplanes are being overhauled on board the Chantier , and there should be no occasion for much additional preparation for flying when he arrives .
