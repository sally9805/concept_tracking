DARK HESTER-Anne Douglas Sedgwick - Houghton Mifflin ( $2.50 ) . <P> Proverbial the jealousy between a man 's mother and his wife ; proverbial the trouble that an old love affair will cause to a new relationship . Yet Author Sedgwick takes the two threadbare situations , weaves bright new colors into the pattern . <P> Clive 's mother , Monica Wilmott , with her golden hair twisted about her head " was like a falcon , a jar of honey , a spray of rosemary . " Victorian at heart , she had , years before , rebelled against the fast vulgarity of the military set in India-but since her husband 's death she had supported herself and her son : the office , the antique shop , the millinery establishment had made her something of a modern . <P> When Clive told her he was marrying an unshackled modern , a newspaper woman , with dark hair brushed straight back like a boy , Monica was shocked , but contrived to ask lightly : ' Is anybody shackled nowadays , my dear ? ' ' Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress for dinner , I mean , and are presented at Court , and take in the " Quarterly Review " - ' <P> Monica , well bred , was exceedingly cordial to Hester ; but Hester was rude with harum-scarum honesty . She swept Clive off to her world of modernistic furniture , and noisy banter , while Monica quietly retired from London to the country . Then Hester , disturbed by the misery she felt in Clive , in Monica , could not leave well enough alone ; followed her mother-in-law , and by malicious coincidence found an old lover among Monica 's new friends . Monica , quick to recognize the situation , flared into unaccustomed wrath , disrupting the close understanding between Clive and his wife . Only by the deftest handling did she bring them together again , finding in the process a deep affection and necessity for dark Hester . <P> Without The Little French Girl 's taut loveliness , without the strange fascination of The Old Countess , Dark Hester is acute portrayal of delicately balanced human relationships , done into tight infallible prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , living in England , Author Sedgwick has a fine sense of the best elements in all three countries . In private life she is Mme. Basil de Selincourt , lives in England , tends her roses , sings Brahms and Haydn oratorios in the village choral society which her husband conducts.
