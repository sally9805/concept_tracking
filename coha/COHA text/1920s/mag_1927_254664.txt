TOMORROW MORNING - Anne Parrish - Harpers ( $2 ) . Anne Parrish and her brother Dillwyn must have had a collection of aunts , grandmothers and female neighbors all of whom they loved until it hurt but who nearly drove them insane with fuss-budgeting , shilly-shallying , dibble-dabbling , microscopic solicitude and spiritual myopia . As the young authors-to-be grew up , quick-witted , sensitive , gay , they must have talked together for hours about these people and their plight - perhaps in a meadow like the dewy one in their book Knee-High to aGrasshopper - and been consumed by that uncomfortable emotion which is a mixture of furious exasperation and profound pity . They must have compacted to make a united effort some day to sting , poke , wheedle , pat and charm all such people out of their bungalow souls into the big bright mansions of life and the world . <P> Nothing else will account for Brother Dillwyn 's recent book , that delicate crucifixion and beatification of mediocrity , Smith Everlasting ( TIME , Oct. 18 ) . Nothing else will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a duplicate of Brother Dillwyn 's with just a few more hamperfuls of old-time clothes strewn in , a few more pantryfuls of homemade soups , salads , desserts , cakes , cookies and whipped cream . <P> The story of Kate Green and her son Joe and all their relatives and neighbors in Westlake , New England , is another story of the tragically commonplace and , its eternal power of keeping on . Sister Anne is a little cheerier than Brother Dillwyn . She lets at least one character , life-loving Evelyn , young Joe 's wife , escape back to New York and Paris whence she came . She even lets her have Hope , her daughter ( the small hope of Westlake ) , and puts all the agony on Joe 's shoulders , which broaden by bearing it alone . But Kate , from the day she leaves art school to be the first Joe 's bride , from that charming but shiftless Joe 's early death in Westlake , through long years of pitying herself , loving little Joe , resolving to paint again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents and repeat clichs ( a whole encyclopedia of them ) , Kate is forever and ever to blush unseen , to live unknowing and to be almost happy - Tomorrow Morning-through it all . <P> Of the wit , the sly digs and farces and innuendoes of these young Parrishes there is no telling . No situation , nobody is safe from them , especially from Sister Anne , who talks less than Brother Dillwyn but writes more . The sugary , slap-my-wrist , mother's-boy " line " she gives her J. Hartley Harrison , scoutmaster , is one of the most innocently poisonous characterizations ever done . Some of her others are : acidulous Aunt Sarah , 99 , with parrot and enema bags ; dependable , blockheaded Charlotte , who marries Hoagland Driggs ; the fat little heir across the street ; wan , wishful Carrie , Aunt Sarah 's slave ; and-flashes-sultry , vivid Opal Mendoza , " bad girl , " the only one whose words comfort Joe at all ; squat , square , red-faced Effa , " simply killing , " a perpetual circus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells the lilacs and knows she will never have a lover .
