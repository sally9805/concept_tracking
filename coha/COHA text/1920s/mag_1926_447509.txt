' MANY readers of the Atlantic will remember the glimpse of M. Defosse which Douglas Burden afforded them , in July 1924 , in his paper , ' The Ibex and the Elephant . ' Honored by his countrymen as rempereur des forets , he is one of the two hunting guides in Indo-China , where some twenty years ' intimacy with tawny tigers has given him an unrivaled knowledge of their mode of life and an uncanny cunning for compassing their death . ' I had a young American tourist just out of college who stayed only ten days , ' writes M. Defosse , ' and as he wanted tigers more than anything else I took him to the east part of the Lagna plains , and there in six days , with one bait , he got three tigers . The first one measured nine feet , eleven inches , between pegs ; the second , nine feet , three inches ; the third , eight feet , nine inches . The two smaller ones were beautifully colored and marked . In addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seven hog deer . How is that for a ten-day trip , which , counting three days for traveling there and back , leaves only seven days for real hunting ? ' That M. Defosse responds to the throbbing life of the country is very evident . ' The Lagna plains are always the same . The elephants are still roaring for all they are worth every morning ; the muddy , deep voices of the crocodiles are still beard as they sport in the river . The hog deer whistle and the peacocks send their liquid call as they spread their beautiful tails on the sand banks . The buffaloes are always 050 grazing on the young grass or wallowing in the pools , and Mr. Tiger lurks in the reeds , seeking whom he may devour . Overhead in the blue hover the kites and the big adjutants , waiting for things to die so that they may live . Fishes splash on the river and in the pools , while hawks fall on them like a flash and fly up with a silvery body writhing in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a fine description of something . It is all very real , round me , over me , everywhere within sight or hearing . ' Strange visitors sometimes come to M. Defosse in search of sport ; he has even been known to help a lion tamer to catch tigers . ' It would be interesting work if the lion tamer were not such a timid fellow . That man , who is not afraid of entering a cage full of lions , is scared of everything here . He does not dare to stay alone in camp even in the daytime . ' Which seems rather Gil bertian . If any reader is impelled to hunt the tiger in Indo-China , let him take warning and book early , for we learn that ' people are toppling over each other to get first place , and as we are only two guides for the whole country our hands are pretty full . ' ? TAE EDITORS TELE tiger of Indo-China is a large , long-limbed , short-haired animal , very-much like the Bengal tiger , but lighter-colored . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coloring , and length of hair can be detected ? due , I suppose , to climatic conditions and environment . The weight of a full-grown animal may be anything between 350 and 600 pounds , although exceptionally big beasts will weigh even more . Two tigers of apparently the same size may show a difference in weight of over one hundred pounds , and compared with other animals they are very heavy for their size . I once shot one which four strong men , with poles , could not lift clear of the ground . A very large tiger will measure three feet ten at the shoulder , with a length of about ten feet and a half from nose to tip of tail . Larger ones have been shot , but any sportsman who kills one with a length of nine feet and a half can boast of having got a fine trophy indeed . The largest are found in the big plains of tall grass surrounded by thick jungle , where game , water , and cover are plentiful . Their hair is short but line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reddish brown . The markings also show much diversity . Those living in the swampy jungles near the sea are smaller and thinner ; their fur is poor and often mangy or scarred . Since game is scarce , their main food consists of monkeys , wild pigs , and occasionally fish . Some tigers have broad and well-defined black stripes ; others have thin marks close together with some white hairs sprinkled into them . The belly is sometimes pure snow-white , sometimes a dirty-looking sort of whitish gray . I once shot a tiger whose ground color was a bright golden yellow ; the belly was pure white and the marking very black and sharp . It was one of the finest skins I ever saw . As a rule the tigress has a finer fur , both in color and length of hair . With the exception of the more settled places near the larger towns , tigers VOL. 138 ? NO. 6 are distributed all over Indo-China . In the Lagna plains , owing to the abundance of game , cover , and water , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the grass is short , they are occasionally seen in the daytime roaming about or lying in the cool mud at the edges of the pools . In the higher country , where there are plenty of clearings interspersed with small woods and patches of thick brush , they are also fairly numerous ; but in the wide forests of tall timber they are very rare because game is scarce there . On mountains like the Dalat plateau or the Darlac range , there is a good number of tigers ; these mountains have many grassy slopes where deer of all kinds are plentiful ; and where there is game there is tiger . The thickly wooded mountain ranges contain nothing but monkeys and snakes , and consequently no tigers ; in the grassy valleys between the ranges , teeming with wild life , they are certain to be found . But they are generally shy of man and give him the right of way . That is why one sees so many tracks and so seldom meets the animals . Now and then , to prove the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle in the daytime , right in front of the herders ; they will come in to the villages , notwithstanding fires , dogs , or noise , and try to snatch a pig or a goat . When a tiger loses his natural fear of man to such an extent , he will eventually turn into a man-eater . A strong , healthy , active tiger will seldom touch cattle where game is plentiful . In the Lagna plains , where tame buffaloes belonging to Mois wander all day long , it is very rare that even a calf is killed . But when a tiger does take to cattle killing , he becomes a nuisance and must be got rid of . A few years ago a French lumberman came to me complaining that a tiger had killed five of his best buffaloes in a deleted material half the arrow in her chest was sticking out as she came on she hit the end of that arrow on a small tree trunk so that it was entirely driven into her chest , reaching the heart . This took all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered back into the bushes , pursued by two or three more arrows . After waiting a little the Mois followed her , and once inside the thicket one of diem caught sight of something yellowish moving under some rattan palms . Ile fired an arrow at it and a squeal was heard ; at the same time another man saw the tigress lying near by , quite dead . So they walked boldly on and found that what they had seen under the palms was a litter of three cubs lying in a bunch . One of them was dead , transfixed by the arrow . They caught the two others and took the whole lot , dead and alive , to their master , who reared the live cubs on condensed milk diluted with boiled water . Ile kept them for three months and then sold them to the Duke of Montpensier , but the Duke left them to the care of native servants at the hotel in Saigon and they got diarrhoea and died . The servants were probably careless about boiling the water used to dilute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule tigers are shy of man . Some experiences of my own will illustrate my point . A few years ago I was using as a bait for tigers the carcass of an elephant which I had shot . Early one morning I was creeping past an ant hill toward the blind when a deep growl startled me , and there , on my left , not three yards , away , was a big tiger facing me . I brought up my rifle at once , but the animal turned suddenly and with one jump was engulfed in the tall grass . At another time , while hunting in the Lagna plains , I was coming back to the camp at eleven o'clock in the morning , following a small footpath skirting a l rge pool . As it was so late in the clay , and as the camp was not over three hundred yards away , I did not keep a sharp lookout . In fact 1 was walking without looking ahead at all , but with my eyes on some waterfowl disporting themselves on the pond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face rose the huge head and chest of a tiger , so close that I could have struck him with my fist . I jumped back immediately , keeping my face toward the brute and disengaging my gun , which was hanging from my shoulder by the strap . The tiger could have caught me by reaching out with his paws , but he also jumped back and started running away through a fairly open space . I fired then , and an angry growl told me that I had hit , but he went on and disappeared in a bamboo thicket . I came back to the spot in the afternoon with a party of Alois and we took the blood trail , but the tiger , after crossing the patch of bamboos , had got in a flooded jungle , and , the blood giving out , it was soon impossible to track him any farther . One day sonic natives came to tell me that one of their bullocks had just been killed . It was then three o'clock in the afternoon , and I went immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . There I found that the tiger had killed the bullock in a clearing and then dragged it into a thick wood near by . I followed up with five or six Alois and we discovered the carcass only a few yards inside the thicket . We pulled it back into the open and I remained sitting behind some bushes with one of the natives , having sent the others back , talking loudly as they went . Usually when a kill is dragged back into the open the tiger comes as soon as he thinks that the ground is clear , following the tracks made by the 660 TIGER , carcass , and I expected this one to do so . I was facing the direction from which I felt pretty certain he would come . Behind me and on both sides was grass about three feet high , so that with the bushes in front and grass all round I was well hidden when sitting on the ground . I had been in that position for about half an hour when some big black ants coming from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up quietly to brush them off , leaning my rifle against the bush in front , when a deep growl coming from right behind my back made me turn round quickly , and there was the tiger ? a big brute he was , too ? standing not seven yards away , looking at me . I slowly reached down for my rifle , but with another angry snarl the animal went off at a gallop , and all I could see was his head showing up over the grass now and then as he made for the wood . I risked a shot , but it was hopeless . If I had not happened to get up to shake off the black ants , that tiger would have walked straight on top of me . III Man-eating tigers are not common in Indo-China , but they occur now and then . An old tiger , no longer active enough to catch game , will through pressure of hunger turn at last to man and , finding what easy prey a human being is , will keep on hunting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a severe wound , such as a broken leg , will also turn man-eater . It is said that young tigers deprived of their mother before they are big enough to fare for themselves may turn man-eaters , and that they are the most terrible of all , as they lose their fear of man entirely , while their strength increases all the time . In 1905 , when the railroad between Saigon and Thanthiet was being built , TIGER a man-eating tiger effectually stopped work for nearly three weeks at the point where SuOi-Kist station now stands . During that time twenty-two men were killed , most of them being carried off and devoured . The brute was very bold and at night would break through the huts where the coolies slept . He attacked also in broad daylight while the men were at work , with the result that nearly all of them ran away , leaving only the French staff on that section of the line . Breaking into a small but one night , he caught one coolie sleeping , and at the same time unknowingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the morning the second one was found dead on the floor , with just one claw marls on his neck , where the artery had been cut , probably when the tiger stepped on him to snatch his other victim . Another time he tried to break into the house of one of the French surveyors . This man was a big fat fellow and not by any means a tiger hunter . His wife , a big fat lady , was with him . For two hours the tiger walked up and down the verandah , sniffing at the doors and trying to break in here and there , while husband and wife , scared to death , kept him off by shouting and lighting all the lamps and candles they could lay their hands on . They also called to the native servants , who were in an outhouse near by , to come and drive the brute away . But the servants did not care for that kind of sport . At last the tiger turned toward the outhouse , which was much more lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard and then all was quiet . When morning came two of the three servants were found shivering on the roof ; the third was gone . Some blood and his brains spread on the ground showed that his head had been crushed in the tiger 's grip . The next day the surveyor went back to Saigon and applied to his chief to be removed to another spot ? a request which was granted . A few years later another man-cater made his appearance in the vicinity of a large Moi village , VO Dat , near the Lagna plains . That tiger killed eighteen of the villagers in less than one month . He caught some of them at night , breaking into the houses , but the greater number were seized while on the t rails or at work in the fields . A woman was killed while she was walking behind a bullock cart loaded with paddy . She had her baby strapped across her back , Moi fashion , with a blanket loosely tied in front . The tiger jumped on her and she fell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . The mother was carried off , but the child was found , unhurt , by a party of men who came up a few minutes later . The bullock-cart driver had not seen or heard anything . The baby was brought back to the village and he is a big , strong boy now ; he can boast of having had a narrow escape indeed . This same man-eater was at last wounded by a party of Laotians who were hunting in the Lagna plains near that Moi village . Three of them were looking for deer ; only one of them had a gun , an old muzzle-loading flintlock , and he shot a hog deer at the edge of a large pool . The two other men set about cutting up the deer , one of the two squatting and holding it on its back and the other one using the knife . The man with the gun was standing by with his piece unloaded . Suddenly a huge tiger came out of the belt of rushes surrounding the pool and seized the fellow squatting behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and with great courage planted his weapon between the tiger 's shoulders . Either the point of the knife was blunt or the blow was not hard enough , for it did not penetrate very deep . The tiger then hurled himself on the man who had wounded him , who struck again , but the knife glanced off the shoulder blade , making a long , shallow wound , and the poor fellow fell on the ground , where the brute made short work of him . The man with the gun ran away with his still-unloaded weapon , and that is how the story was known . Fifteen days later 1 was hunting in that very spot and shot two wild buffaloes near the pool where the two Laotians had been killed . Returning there early next morning with some coolies to skin the dead buffaloes , I saw at a distance a big tiger feeding on one of the carcasses . Leaving the coolies behind . I crept up to within fifty yards and shot him . He was very large and his head was enormous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad state and full of worms . The skin was covered with scars and the hair was falling off in patches . It was useless to try to save that skin , so I took the head and the claws and left the rest for the vultures . From that clay to this no Moi has been killed by tigers in that village . Natives have a great respect for the tiger at all times and will always call him Ong ( sir ) when mentioning him . They have many superstitions connected with the animal . For instance , they believe that when asleep the tiger hears all that is said about bins ; therefore it behooves men not to say nasty things about the striped gentleman , or revenge may overtake the offenders . Luckily when the tiger wakes up he usually yawns and stretches his limbs , and in so doing forgets all he has heard in his sleep . The Alois also believe that a man-eater is not always a real tiger , but an old sorcerer from a hostile tribe who transforms himself to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come at night outside the houses and , talking like a man , will lure the villagers out and kill them . IV There has been much controversy among sportsmen about the way a tiger kills his prey . Very few people have ever seen a tiger actually make his kill , and from an isolated instance it is impossible to infer that the thing is always done the same way . It depends , first , on the kind of animal the tiger has to deal with ? whether it is a buffalo , a bullock , a deer , or a small beast such as a dog , a pig , or a goat ; secondly , on the kind of ground ? whether it is thick jungle , tall timber , thorny shrubs , open grass , hard ground , soft mud , or water ; last , but not least , on the tiger himself ? whether he is big , heavy , strong , full-grown , old , or young . The old-time belief that the tiger springs from a distance , landing on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded . The usual method is to stalk an animal as close as possible , using any cover that may be handy , and then , with a final rush , seize it by the throat , or the fore quarters , or more often the hind quarters , and throw it down . The jaws are then fastened in the throat , if they are not already there , until death follows . But this method is not an absolute rule by any means ; it differs greatly according to the kind of animal the tiger attacks . A small beast , such as a pig , dog , or goat , is usually seized by the nape of the neck , sometimes by the middle of the back . I once lost three dogs out of four while hunting deer , and all of them had been bitten through the back . There were no claw marks on any of them , only the deep fang holes ; the tiger must have caught them as a cat catches a mouse . In thick scrub the tiger will often seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbing the rump with his forepaws and biting through the spine , while his hind feet on the ground act as braces . A long-horned animal like the buffalo is never attacked in front , but always from behind , the tiger seizing the rump or biting the hind legs to hamstring the animal . As soon as his victim is down , he always fastens his jaws in the throat . I was once an eyewitness of a fight between a tiger and a buffalo on the edge of the Lagna plains , where , accompanied by three natives , I was looking for deer . A herd of tame buffaloes , under the care of some native boys , was grazing near a large swamp . Suddenly there was a commotion among the herd and the scattered buffaloes started running toward the plain , where they gathered in a bunch and stopped , looking toward the swamp . We then saw a big buffalo bull coining out of the rushes , followed by a large tiger who was biting his hind legs , for all the world like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to get at his enemy , the tiger turned with him , always keeping behind and tearing at the legs . We started running toward the spot , which was about three or four hundred yards from us , but the tiger saw us and left his victim , which by that time had fallen to its knees . The little boy herders were yelling for all they were worth . When we got near the buffalo , we saw that the hamstring had been almost severed , but there were no other marks of any kind on the body . The poor beast tried to get up , but could hardly move . When the owner arrived I asked him to let me shoot it and use it as bait , but he would not hear of it ; he thought that he might save his buffalo , but I knew it was hopeless . He and a fen other natives dragged the animal to a small pool near by , and left it in the water while a little boy was sent to cut some grass to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up and down the mud bank of the pool for a long time , as the tracks showed the next morning , but he did not dare to attack the buffalo in the water . He did the same thing on the second night , and the next day the buffalo died . The third night the tiger dragged the carcass to the bank and devoured part of it . The nearest cover was over three hundred yards away and I went there in the morning , hoping to see the tiger in the daytime and to be able to crawl within reasonable shooting distance while he was feeding . He came back three times , but I was unable to get near enough without being detected . When night came I tried to get him with the headlight , but he was too smart for me . The following day I decided to try a shot at three hundred yards , and I took my 250-3000 Savage rifle , which has a very high velocity and a very fiat trajectory . At about nine o'clock the tiger showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his haunches like a dog , looking slowly round and facing my way . Lying down , I aimed carefully for the chest and knocked him over . A man walking is nearly always caught from behind , and instantly killed , the neck being broken or the head crushed with one bite of the powerful jaws . Men lying round a camp fire or in huts may be seized by any part of the body ; some , alive and screaming , have been dragged away by a leg or a shoulder . The tiger kills them as soon as he thinks himself at a safe distance . Tigers are not invariably victors in their attacks on strong animals . Some have been known to be killed by buffaloes or sladangs , and others have been ripped open by wild boars . An old boar is an ugly customer when enraged or fighting for its life . A tiger always drags his prey under cover if he can do so , and sometimes // to a considerable distance from where he killed it . Even a buffalo weighing nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs , down and up the banks of deep ravines . In the case of a heavy kill , such as a cow , a horse , or a buffalo , the tiger pulls it stepping backward . A deer or a calf is pulled alongside the tiger as he walks through the jungle . A small animal , such as a goat , a pig , or a dog , is carried in very much the same manner as a rat is carried by a cat . I have never seen a tiger carrying his victim on his back and I do not see how he could do so without its falling at every step . Many and careful observations of the spoors have never indicated that this manner of carrying prey has been used by the tigers in Indo-China . V It has been said , and I think it is a widespread belief , that a tiger always eats his meat when high and not before . But if a tiger happens to stumble on the bait when it is still fresh , he will start on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding on the hind quarters of his kill , and very seldom , if ever , touches the entrails . A leopard , on the contrary , tears the belly open and starts on the guts . It is therefore easy to guess what kind of cat the killer is , even when the telltale pad marks are not visible on the ground . Another of the tiger 's traits is his wonderful cleverness at hiding . A tiger 's skin made into a carpet seems gaudy enough , and one would think that the bright yellow , black , and white would be very showy . Yet they blend so well in the jungle that a tiger standing motionless in a bush so thin that one could see a squirrel in it is almost impossible to detect . The only thing that betrays him sometimes deleted material and he will come more readily in the daytime . A liJina is then built at a short distance . The boma is a sort of cage about four feet high and large enough for one man to sit in comfortably . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four posts arc driven into the ground and the poles . cut , to the proper length , are then placed crossways at a distance of a few inches from each other . Then the whole thing is carefully camouflaged with palms and green branches in such a way that when it is completed it looks just like a dense bush . A small peephole is left in front to watch and shoot through , and a door at the back allows he hunter to crawl inside . The door is then shut and camouflaged as carefully as the rest . In the rainy season a roof can be built overhead . A small path is cut through the jungle , and the dry leaves and dead twigs are carefully brushed off to prevent any noise when one comes to visit the bait . At the end of the path , at about twenty yards from the kill , a blind is built to cover the hunter 's approach . Early every morning the bait is visited to see if it has been touched overnight . If by any chance a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot from the blind . If , on the other hand , the bait has been touched and the tiger has left , the hunter gets into the boma and stays there to wait for the animal to come back . A tiger nearly always visits the bait several times during the day , unless he suspects that a man is near by . It is useless to stay in the boma as long as the bait has not been touched . But when the smell is strong and carries at a good distance , it will pay sometimes to visit the kill in the evening , just before dark . Dead elephants make splendid baits when shot in a good tiger country , even when shot in the open . In this case they should not be cut open , or the vultures will spoil them . Some people prefer a platform built on a tree to a boma on the ground . They feel safer there . They are safe , but a boma is much better for the shot . and one is not so likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accidents happening in honors . Of course the best shot of all is from the blind as one conies up early in the morning and finds the tiger still feeding on the bait . There is nothing between the hunter and the animal but a flimsy hush , and the knowledge that there may be real danger appeals to a man 's sense of sportsmanship . Three things are necessary in hunting tigers : a bait , a rifle , and plenty of patience . A restless , nervous , impatient man had better give it up . Another of the tiger 's habits is to use the trails , footpaths , and cart roads at . night . Sitting in a tree alongside such a trail , night after night when the moon is bright , one may get a shot in the end , but it is weary work and the . mosquitoes as well as the heavy clew make it unpleasant . Moreover shooting with a rifle by moonlight , almost . straight down from a tree , is very unsatisfactory , and more tigers are missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagna plains , in the middle of the day when the sun is very hot , tigers may be seen lying on the cool mud at the edge of the pools . They even lie clown in the water , with only their heads showing . By going slowly from one pool to another one can sometimes get a shot . Sometimes live baits are used , as in some parts of India . A bullock , a cow , or a buffalo is tied up near a trail where tigers are known to pass at night , and a boma or a platform is built at a short distance . But this kind of sport is very disappointing in Indo-China , and one has to wait for a long time before a kill is made . deleted material and that is where the bullet must go . It should be remembered that even a shot through the heart seldom stops an animal on the spot . Tigers have been known to run over one hundred yards with their hearts torn to pieces . The same thing is true with deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of a young officer who was killed by a tiger he had shot through the heart , the brute dying across his body . Take the head shot whenever you can do so , and never fire at a tiger until you are quite sure of the part of him you are shooting at . When a tiger falls instantly after the shot , or , when following up , you see him lying apparently dead , never rush blindly toward him . Walk slowly , with your rifle ready , and do not hesitate to put in another bullet if you sec the slightest movement . It may save your life .
