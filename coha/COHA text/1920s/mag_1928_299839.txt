Machinal . It is related that Sophie Treadwell , author of Machinal and in private life the wife of Sports-Columnist W. O. McGeehan , witnessed the murder trial of Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray ; that brooding upon it , she was able to select from the gaudy tangle a single thread on which to build her tragedy . Thus in Machinal a young woman marries , to escape the routine of work in an office , a gross and chuckling businessman . She bears him a child which she hates as she fears its father ; then , in a speakeasy , she meets a man with whom she falls in love . He tells her how , in Mexico , he killed a native by hitting him on the head with a bottle full of pebbles . When he has gone away , the woman does this to her husband and to explain his death she tells the story of " two big , dark-looking men . " In court she confesses her crime and in prison is killed for having committed it . <P> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and frightened by its machinery is related on the stage by means of episodic scenes . The girl is beautifully played by an actress new to the Manhattan stage , Zita Johann , whom the expert Arthur Hopkins has discovered among the ranks of road players and raised , as he raised Barbara Stanwyck and Pauline Lord , to stardom . George Stillwell plays the woman 's husband with a touch of burlesque that throws the role out of drawing with the true characters opposed to it . The sets , designed by Robert Edmond Jones , are changed against a cyclorama . <P> Machinal is not a play which keeps its audience always excited and interested . It slips sometimes into banality . Some scenes are ineffective . But Machinal does something far more important than provide entertainment . Sometimes it stretches taut the bare thread of its narrative , and like An American Tragedy it has moments which are so true that they are tragic . In these moments the disorderly processional of those who are born in pain to death in sorrow comes abruptly to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort to bring novelty to the musical show , Arthur Hammerstein sliced up his stage in the most extraordinary manner , running treadmills from wing to wing so that sets could be switched without new backdrops , and so that his actors , trotting briskly along to keep pace with the changing scenery , had a little bit the look of squirrels in a cage or the race horses in the last act of The Girl from Kentucky . <P> A consistent favorite on the track was Eddie Buzzell in the part of a youngster who came from the country to Manhattan where , by the simple trick of owning a doll which suggested a good number in a musical show , he made a fortune and won the heroine , impersonated by the spry and pretty Barbara Newberry . Aside from the mechanical innovations , the most noteworthy ingredient of Good Boy was Charles Butterworth , cast in the role of a cynical farm-lout . This curious and doleful personage often put his hands above his head and remarked , " Oh , the pity of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Wan na Be Loved by You , " kept bubbling out of Helen Kane . Helen Kane puts a teasing twist in her delivery of " But-dut-de-dut " or " Vo-do-de-o , " which she practiced first in a single act in vaudeville , later in Shubert musical comedy and most recently in Publix Theatres , with the inexpert assistance of Paul Ash . <P>
