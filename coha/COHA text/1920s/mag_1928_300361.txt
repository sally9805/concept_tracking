Potent and almost omnipotent is Signor Benito Mussolini , but not plural . Though he count himself up 1,000 times he must still total himself-one . Last week , however , the cheerful Dictator with the smouldering eyes and confident uplifted chin made the best of his physical singularity by turning himself into a legal majority of 7 in his cabinet of 13 . <P> When the thing had been neatly and swiftly done , Il Duce was-and is- : 1 ) Minister of Foreign Affairs ; 2 ) Interior ; 3 ) War ; 4 ) Navy ; 5 ) Air ; 6 ) Corporations ; and 7 ) Colonies . Since the Dictator has held the first six of these portfolios for many a month ( TIME , June 16 ) , he really did no more last , week than snatch for himself the Ministry of Colonies . Thus he became a One Man Majority of 7/13ths . Additionally , of course , Signor Mussolini is Head of the State ( Il Capo ) , Leader of the Fascist Party ( Il Duce ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council-now the supreme organ of State ( TIME , Nov. 26 ) . <P> Keenest Roman interest focused on the man from whom Il Capo snatched the Ministry of Colonies-Signor Luigi Federzoni . Some have called this strong and enigmatic statesman " The Soft Speaker for the Vatican . " All know that he has long been the only one of Benito Mussolini 's ministers from whom harassed King Vittorio Emanuele III has always been able to secure a countersignature for his royal acts . Constitutionally the pen scratch of His Majesty is of no effect , unless countersigned by a member of the Government . Therefore when Signor Federzoni 's ministry was snatched away , last week , the King was popped even deeper down into the depths of Benito Mussolini 's ogreish pocket . <P> <P> Federzoni 's potency was greatest shortly after Fascist bludgeon men had done to death the Socialist Deputy and millionaire Giacomo Matteoti-a deed which nearly unseated Prime Minister Benito Mussolini , himself suspected of ordering the crime ( TIME , June 23 , 1924 et seq . ) . With the Dictator for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Deputy Luigi Federzoni be made Minister of Home Affairs in charge of the police . Smart guessers think they know that Faithful Federzoni then obtained evidence which he and King Vittorio Emanuele held over Il Duce for years afterwards . Eventually however the Dictator felt strong enough to possess himself of the Ministry of Home Affairs , giving the Ministry of Colonies to Federzoni . <P> The final ounce of boldness probably came , last fortnight , when the Dictator closed and bade farewell to the last democratically elected parliament of Italy . When the new Chamber meets , next Spring , it will consist entirely of Deputies hand picked by the Fascist Grand Council . There will be no Opposition . In the words of Il Capo to the departing deputies : <P> " Critics of our Fascist regime have complained that the present Chamber is 70 per cent Fascist . Very well ! The next Chamber will be 100 per cent Fascist ! " <P> Additional acts of the Dictator , closely related to the ousting of Senator Federzoni as Minister of Colonies were :    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
