POLITICAL NOTES <P> Senator Burton K. Wheeler , smart , young Montana radical , who deserted the nominee of his Party ( Democratic ) and turned not only to support LaFollette , but to join with him on a third ticket adventure , leaves the Democrats in a peculiar position . They can not directly attack Wheeler now , because at the same time they are pointing to him with pride as the man who slew the dragon Daugherty . But with the Republicans it is different . <P> The New York Evening Post ( independent Republican ) opened , with grapeshot and Greek fire : <P> " The eye of Butte sees in Davis a creature of the red octopus , with the scarlet tentacles , that lives in Wall Street . . . . The ' great open spaces ' know him ( Wheeler ) as a political two-gun man with a cold , slate-colored eye . . . . <P> " This spare-built lawyer from Butte is looking to the future . If things go well with the ' third ticket ' there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders ? It will . Senator LaFollette is sick and aging . So Senator Wheeler shoots in the back the party that sent him to the Senate and fares forth in search of new political grass and water-courses. "
