AN it be , in any sense , possible to conjecture that the origin of dancing came from the desire to escape from one 's self , into an imaginary world ? In that case , it might also have been a form of madness , as one finds it in the Dionysian intoxication at the Attic festivals , when wine and the deities , the satyrs and the maenads , were closely linked together . Certainly , even now , one of the best means in escaping from one 's self is dancing : under fixed conditions , the only one . The question is : can one ever escape from one 's self ? There are so many means . There is , for instance , a rapture in the dance which intoxicates every sense to a point of human infinity ; that is , while one is dancing . After , comes the recoil . No rapture can ever be measured ; while one endures it , it has no limits . But , alas ! for one 's finite nature , nothing lasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the gift of " passing out of himself " at times into wild gestures and into wilder leaps in the air ; which have certain equivalents with what is mimetic in the ballet . But , in the first dances , Dionysus , again , is seen in his feasts , literally drinking the blood of goats while the travelling country show comes round with its puppets . Then there are the dances of the leaping maenads , to the sound of strange music as the phallus is carried in the procession . So , in his form of Bacchus , the Indian Inachus , fire-born , we see how , to the religious imagination of the Greeks , he was known as the spiritual form of fire and , dew . His godless gaiety , depicted by Aristophanes in the " Acharnians " with so many vivid  | touches as a thing of which civil war had deprived the villages of Attica preponderates over the wave . Then there is the form of Dionysus Zagreus , a gods who had Item ended into hell ; who , " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned the secrets of the grave , " and had kept the fallen day of the deep seas about him . " It is out of the sorrows of Dionysus , " says Pater , " ut Dionysus in winter , that all Greek tragedy grows. , out of the song of the sorrows of . Dionysus , sung at his winter teat by the chorus of satyrs , singers clad in goat skins , in memo ' v of his rural life , one and another of whom , from time to time , steps out of the company to emphasize and develop this or that circumstance of the story ; and so the song be comes dramatic . " And , as he has been always miraculous , as miraculous as the grape , as wine , as all forms of ever recurrent ecstasy , as all that fascinates us in the dark mysteries of his Rite , he is still as alive as the enormous vines of Eleu thers ? he is still as alive as the snakes that used to live somewhere in the temple court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priestesses of Dionysus would , with lights and songs and dances , awake the new-born child after his wintry sleep . Dionysus is twofold ; he is a Chtho nian god ; he has an element of sadness ; like Hades , he is hollow and devouring ; he has his mid-winter madness ; and still one 's imagination sees him storming wildly over the dark Thracian hills . Apollo , I have said somewhere , is the god of dreams . Dionysus is the god of intoxication ; the one representing for us the world of appearances , the other is , as it were , the voice of things in themselves . The chorus , then , which arose out of the hymns to Dionysus , is the lyric cry , the vital ecstasy ; the drama is the projection into vision , into a picture of the exterior , temporary world of forms . And , out of all this ? intoxication , vision , song , drama --  -- arises the Ballet . The ballet is certainly more than illusion , yet it gives one illusions ; it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of ourselves ; it can project its shadow on our inner con sciousness : there are instants when it can entice us into imagining that we are alone , alone with ourselves ; these instants pass , as swiftly as the mere dancer 's dress that sways as she dances . And again , there is something intangible in the reality which makes itself visible to our senses . As the light changes , the sense of reality changes . And it is with all our senses that we drink in these shifting forms of imaginary intoxications ; with a more ardent sense of lux ury than in tasting wine . And , it might be , if one looks on the stage , that one 's vision sees double ; as , for instance , after one has taken hashish ; and that we see , through the fumes of heat , things corrupt , tainted with sin . It matters nothing to me if those girls who dance have the least sense of shame , in their real enjoyment of what is their art . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coulisses to experience the fact that they themselves are aware that the indiscretion of their costumes , meant to appeal to the senses , is now filling them with the unconcern of long use . They know also , for one thing , that they dance to amuse us . Yet one 's imagination goes back to the exotic dancing of Salome , who , with a virginless perversity , danced off a man 's head , to the rhythm of the falling of red roses . It is Blake who wrote in one of those gaities of speech which illuminate his letters : " I doubt not yet to make such a figure in the great dance of life that shall amuse the spec tators in the sky . " I have written : " It is true that Blake was abnormal , but what was abnormal in him was his san ity . " His place is with Santa Teresa , who adored all beau tiful and evil things and beings from God to Satan , from dancing to singing , from abnormal visions to divine visions ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the gentle souls who guide the great wine-press of Love ; " who being perfect woman and perfect saint believed in everything and denied nothing . So , if there are indeed spectators in the sky , amused by our motions , what dancer  | among us are they more likely to have approved than this joyous , untired , and undistracted dancer to the eternal rhythm ? Who else , if not Santa ' I'eresa , who gives herself to God , as it were , with a great leap into his arms ? As there is invariably music with dancing , in the East ern music , there is , one imagines , the minute delicacy of Eastern ears , which can hear two hundred different tones , so finely divided that the Western ear can not distinguish them . Their note is always just above or below ours ; our music just falls into the interspaces of theirs ; or fills the space of several . What they can do is like what Velasquez or Whistler can do with color . He gives you what seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arabesques of color unwind themselves from the mass , which lives in every inch with a subtle and various life . That is how I hear Eastern music : this breathing of sound about what seems to us a note , like wind at last able to express itself in articu late sound . So , for their harmonics , they need none of our gross effects ; they can seem to keep , a level or wander from order , and be rendering a whole palette of harmonics . It is an art of subdivisions , which end as they began , having unwound their circle . Eastern dancing is something entirely different from dancing as we know it in the West . Here , all the motion comes from the legs , the body only coming into play as a sort of faint accompaniment , slightly emphasizing the rhythm of the limbs . Dancing as it is known in the East is almost entirely a rhythm of the body , and instead of requir ing a large stage , can be done , as it is in Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , on a table . Its intention , its appeal are quite distinct from the intention and the appeal of Western dancing . It is a sort of pantomime , a little solo drama , in which the spectator can divine just as much as he likes , or which he can suppose , if he pleases , to be quite meaningless . It is a species of symbolism , and symbolism has its secret for every searcher . Eastern dancing , pure and simple , is generally too explicit to leave much room for  | speculation as to its main intention , though it has its subtle ties for the more profound devotee of the cult . But that variation upon it which we see in Spain ? doubtless a survival of the Moors , with a characteristic Spanish turn of its own ? is really a more intricate and a more artisticall expressive performance . And the dance which I once saw ? done in London by Vita , of Chicago fame , is , after all , more allied to the Spanish than to the strictly Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized ( and yet , perhaps , at the same time , in another sense , attenuated ) by the introduction of a second person , a man , who is the Tannhauser to this symbolic Venus . The woman is a temptress . The man , fearing her , yet attracted by her , tries in vain to escape at once from this alluring woman and from his own impulsion . She dances before him , lingeringly , enticingly , weaving her fascinations about him , as the daughter of Herodias drew the soul of Herod into her fatal noose . And in this slow , snake-like undulation , which attracts and repels , which retreats and advances and coils into such strange curves , and unwinds with such intensity of deliberation , there is a certain human interest , the interest of a piece of acting , if but little in the woman who was in London , of the poignancy of a real Arab or a real Spaniard . I have never forgotten the troupe of Bedouin Arabs who performed at the Empire , and it is twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago ) since anything so good of the kind has been seen in England . The fourteen Arabs who composed the troupe had only arrived in Europe nine months ago , and only three or four of them spoke anything but their native language . The leader , the eldest son of the Sheikh Abdullah , a picturesque old gentleman who took a dignified interest in things from behind the scenes ? talked in a very tolerable German , an accomplishment which had doubtless been of the greatest service to him in his ' engagements at Berlin , Vienna , Dresden and Breslau . the only European towns which the troupe had yet  | visited . He told me that he and his men had traveled all over Egypt  --  " Alexandria , ( ' airu , Port Saul , everywhere ! "  - -  and if a better company of acrobats is to be found in the East , then the East must be singularly fortunate in its acrobats . Imagine fourteen brown-skinned , black haired Arabs , with vests and knickerbockers of red and green , barred and scrolled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like some Western acrobats , they have their clown ? a very Eastern clown indeed . He looks more like a demon in a Japanese grotesque than anything else I can think of ; or one might imagine him a wicked genie from the " Arabian Nights , " twirling fantastically in a fit of malicious madness . The performance begins with the simpler forms of the somersault , or what would , if done in the European wdy , be comparatively simple . But the Arabs have a way of their own of pitching on to their hands heavily , abruptly , sometimes from a height of two feet or more . They do it , as they do all their exercises , with a sort of fury ? the fury of the desert . One extraordinary tumbler went through a series of sidelong and gyrating somersaults . I can not possibly describe them in words . They are really even more difficult than the sensational feat of vaulting over a compact body of seven or eight men . After the vaulting come the pyramids , in which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round his body . Beginning with three , a trifle , we end with seven , a wonder , and I have even seen nine , which we must call a miracle . Perhaps the most effective position is that in which the supporter walks about the stage with one man on his shoulders and two others held at arms ' length . He turns round and round , swinging his human burdens like a man who practises with dumb-bells . Finally we came to the poses , in which the fourteen Arabs ranged themselves in lines and curves , three rows high , like carved and painted figures in some Eastern architecture . With their brilliant and barbarous costumes , their  |
