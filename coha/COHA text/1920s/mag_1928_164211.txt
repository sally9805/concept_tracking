Numerous aristocratic but decadent Scotch shooting lodges have been leased this year by the Cunard Line for release to rich U. S. sportsmen . <P> Despatches from Scotch sources independent of the line told , last week , that nearly all the leased lodges have had to be replumbed or plumbed for the first time and equipped with latest built-in-tub bathrooms . <P> Since the hunting lodge leases originally provided for no such " improvement , " the whole expense has had to be borne by the English Cunard Line , to the delight of Scots , many of whom will tub in their own lodges for the first time when U. S. sportsmen have left .
