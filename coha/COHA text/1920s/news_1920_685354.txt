txt About the end of this month the Supreme Court will issue its mandate to the District Court for the eastern distriEt of Pornsylyania directing it to enter a decree in the Reading case in conformity with the opinion which the /Supreme Court handed ' down April 24 . This mandate will not fix the terms and conditions for the dissolution of the Reading Co. ' s control over its railroad and coal . ' properties nor is it likely to throw ! much light upon the nature of the decree , but interested parties are hoping that it will leave the District Court a fairly wide latitude in shaping the final decree . With the reservation that . all opinion upon the outcome of the proceedings is as yet purely tentative , it may be said that in legal quarters there is no expectation that the Reading Co. will have to dissolve in the sense of ceasing to exist . The language of the Supreme Court upon this point in their opinion , requires the dissolution of the combination of the several companies " existing and maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that company . The decree , in other words , mould allow the Reading Co. to continte in existence as a bolding company , or even to become an operating company , for either the railroad nr the coal properties . except that the Philadelphia fi Reading Coal &; Iron Co. and the Lehigh &; WilkesBarTe Coal Co. would have to become separate and independent as to their control . Those most familiar with the Reading 's varied business enterprises hold that if the decree allows the Reading Co. will become a coal company . A distribution of Philadelphia &; Reading Railway stock to Reading Co. stockholders would presumably satisfy the court . Some means would in that case have to he arranged by which the railway company would acquire from the goading Co. the equipment which the latter owns and the fernier use : . The principal reason for supposing that the court will allow the Reading Co. to continue to exist is that if a bona fide separation of4the constituent companies is affected through exchanges of securities no good end would be served by wiping it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aggravated . For instance , an attempt will be made to avoid calling any mortgage issues for piyment in cash , in view of the difficulty of floating any new security issue at this time without practically doubling the interest charge . There appears to be no doubt that the preferred stocks of Reading ... Co. will share equally with the common in any distribution of assets , whether the corporation is dissolved or not . There is no disagreement among the lawyers that , under the laws of Pennsylvania and in the absence of any charter limitation of the preferred stock to its : par value , the holders of all classes of stock share alike in any distribution of a company 's assets . There is no such limitation in the Reading 's charter . It may also be taken for granted that the preferred stocks will not be retired at par . That could be done only for cash and cash is not easy to obtain in such quantities. - It is safe to say that , assuming the company to be dominated by the common stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred stocks in cash as they would gain by restricting the distribution of assets to the common stock . Moreover , the company is not so dominated , and there is the further serious question whether the Company could legally exercise its reserved power to retire the preferred stock solely for the purpose of excluding the preferred stock from the distribution of assets . Much the same thing cgin be said of the company 's charter right to convert the second preferred into half as gulch first preferred and half as much common . With the preferred stock sharing equally with the common such , a conversion would offer no advantage to anyone . Lawyers and railroad , pen doubt that the court intends to compel the permanent separation of the Reading Railway and the Central Railroad of New Jersey . They hope that at the worst the decree will not leave any lasting obstacle to the unification of these two roads through perrnisxion of the Interstate Commerce Commission , as provided in the new transportation act .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
