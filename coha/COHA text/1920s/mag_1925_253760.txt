The next President of the United States has not yet been elected . He will not be elected until , on Feb. 11 , the Senate and House in joint session count the votes of the Electoral College and proclaim the result . <P> By the mechanism prescribed by law , the electors chosen by the people at the November election meet , each group in its own state , and cast their ballots ( on the second Monday in January ) . The ballots are sent to Congress in duplicate-one set by registered mail , the other by special messenger . A third copy of the ballots is deposited with the Federal Judge of the district . If no copy has been received by the Congress , the Secretary of State sends a special messenger to get the results . <P> The messenger chosen in each state to carry the ballots to Congress is generally one of the Electors , although sometimes a prominent politician gets the job . He is paid 25 cents a mile traveling expenses by the Federal Government -a neat sum , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon Congress will be asked to appropriate $14,000 to pay the " expenses " of these messengers . Representative Cable has introduced a bill to do away with the messengers and , incidentally , to have the ballots counted by the Congress on the first Monday in December instead of the second Wednesday in February . <P> Since politicians are human , it is probable that the usual $14,000 will be appropriated.
