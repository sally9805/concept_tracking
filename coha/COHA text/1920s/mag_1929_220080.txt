Almost nobody is too poor to play in the State Lottery at Naples which is drawn every week . Though a very beggar may have but 50 centesimi ( 2 ) , one of the 150 state banks will let him risk his all . Shoals of poor people win petty sums every week . But naturally the most stupendous prizes-paid on luckiest combinations of lucky numbers-turn up only once or twice in a decade . Six years ago $2,000,000 was won on the series 8 , 65 , 90 , and ever since , with a peculiar fatalism , thousands of people in Southern Italy have been backing these same numbers every week . <P> To the question , " Do n't you know that lightning never strikes twice in the same place ? " a typical , tattered , cheerful Neapolitan will reply , " Maybe in your country , Signore ( shrug ) , that is so . " <P> Last week the 150 state banks of Naples wired to Rome , asking that fifty million lira ( $2,500,000 ) be rushed south at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrieking , delirious with joy . When the cash began to arrive in vanloads , each of the 150 banks became a scene of pandemonium . Once again 8 , 65 , 90 had won .
