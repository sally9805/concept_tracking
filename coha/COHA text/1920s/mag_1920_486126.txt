" Wraxall 's New York Indian Records , 1678-1751 , " by Charles Howard Men-wain Prof Svante ? Arrhenius , of Stockholm , announces , in view of the European situation , the postponement of distribution of the Nobel prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heretofore the formal presentation of the prizes in medicine , chemistry , physics , and literature has been held on December 10 , the anniversary of Nobel 's death . The mere anouncement of the awards will still be made on that date , the actual presentation to take place hereafter in June of the following year . Numerous books about the war must be dispatched with briefest indications of their temper and worth . Edmund von Mach 's " What Germany Wants " ( Little , Brown ; $1 net ) describes Germany as essentially pacific , but impelled by pressure of population to seek new territory and new markets " She had to find ever new markets in the world or starve . " In the quest England seemed to thwart her ; hence a sort of inevitable conflict As a statement of the perverted political psychology of the Vaterland , the bookhas a certain value . On the side of cold fact , though Germany may have felt hemmed in , she was not . No nation with a rapidly advancing commerce who imports annually some fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpopulation , or even figuratively in danger of starvation . Dr. von Mach 's book will with impartial readers increase the sense that Germany 's wants were inordinate . The general dignity and moderation of Dr. von Mach 's plea are as remarkable as its logical thinness . " The German Enigma , " by Georges Bourdon ( Dutton ) is the report of an enquAte made by a highly trained Parisian journalist in Germany last year . He interviewed , among others , Herr von Kiderlen-Waechter , von Bethmann-Hollweg , Prince Lichnowsky , Theodor Wolff of the Ta.goblatt , Sudermann , and Maximilian Harden The results of these conversations are more personally interesting than politically instructive M. Bourdon found abundant verbal friendship for France , and a universal conviction that Germany must increase her armaments . Adolf Kerr , of Pan , indulged in wholly candid expressions which have become prophetic : " There is a warlike foundation in the temperament of the race , a superfluity of animal force that requires to Vent itself . " What is most significant is that several of the publicists consulted volunteered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and that war , if it came , would be the decision of a small administrative minority . M. Bourdon 's suggestion that a neutralized Alsace-Lorraine would liberate France to avert an impending clash between Germany and Russia has a pathetically belated sound While the personal interest of a book which reports the sayings of prominent German leaders is considerable , no common tendency is discernible except that everybody felt before the war that Germany should be tremendously armed and that she would keep Peace only on the condition that her whole case be conceded . The state of mind can hardly be described as enigmatic , and M. Bourdon should not have been puzzled . John C Powys 's pamphlet , " The War and Culture " ( G. Arnold Shawl , is a reply to Professor Miinsterberg 's book . Mr. Powys goes straight to the contrasting political ideals that underlie the war , setting them forth with clearness and eloquence . An extract will give a notion of the reasoning and style of a tract which is more weighty than many of the more pretentious treatises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , by means of an omnipotent and irresistible state-machine , a certain hard , scientific , unimaginative , and efficient culture . The idea of the Allies is to protect the individual against the state , the little nations against the empires , and the drama , color , Passion , beauty , and tradition of the various races of the earth against a monotonous and murderous uniformity. - Mr. Powys is both ingenious and just in bringing apparently autocratic Russia within his general scheme . Cloudesley Brereton 's little book , " Who Is Responsible " ( Putnam ; 50 cents net ) is both an historical analysis and a forecast . The author traces clearly the hardening of ? German sympathy into unbridled national egotism under Prussian miseducation , and believes , that Germany must be beaten for her own sake . The argument is conducted with vigor . Mr. Brereton 's comment on the campaign of the peace societies deserves attention : Unfortunately , the peace societies throughout the world appear to have made an error in tactics . They have concentrated unduly on the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often ignored the vital factor of nationality . " The War in Europe : Its Cause and Consequences " ( Sully &; Klemteich ; $2 net ) is a rather large octavo full of statistical material of a political and military sort , with maps and tables , and , as well , numerous illustrations gleaned mostly from the current magazines and from standard encyclopmdic works . There is also an historical summary and a selection from the diplomatic correspondence The compilation has been made by the skilled hand of Dr. Rossiter Johnson , and the work seems well adapted to the needs of those who are limited to a single source of refer-ence " The Railway Library " for 1913 , compiled by Slason Thompson ( Bureau of Railway News and statistics ) , sustains its reputation as a valuable collection of interesting literature on the subject of railways , most of which appeared during the year . Forty-two articles are reprinted , and the list of authors includes the names of Theodore Roosevelt , Interstate Commerce Commissioner Meyer , Charles A. Prouty , Presidents Rea of the Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and W. M. Acworth . In " The Joyful Heart " ( Houghton Mifflin Co. ; $1.25 net ) Mr. Robert Haven Schaufaer has collected a number of essays originally Minted in the Atlantic Honthlw and elsewhere . It- is a book of enthusiasms . With a slight , harmless air of proprietorship it offers enthusiasm , joy , " the brimming cup , " to jaded and half-hearted humanity . " Exuberance , " it cries , " is the income yielded by a wise investment of one 's vitality . On this income , so long as it flows in regularly , the moderate . man may live in the Land of the Joyful Heart , incased in triple steel against any arrows of outrageous fortune that happen to stray in across the frontier . Immigrants to this land . . . " the passage goes on to illustrate an exuberance in speech which is characteristic of the writer . His metaphors trip on each others ' heels or are forgotten , sometimes with odd results , as in his allusion to " a crowd of unadulterated human porcupines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even with a pair of tweezers ! But to be overflowing with vitality is the main thing , to be joyously abounding in health , in spirits  --  in activity among metaphors and elsewhere . The really central idea , to which Mr. Schauffier returns again and again in these pages , is that happy achievement depends on bodily health ; and that the bodily health worth having is not a mere lack of illness , but a positive and exultant strength to will , to do , and to enjoy He pleads for physical training as the only sane basis for cheerful and useful living . " Such a regimen pays thousands of per cent . in yearly dividends . It allows one to dive in an almost continual state of exaltation rather like that which the sprinter enjoys when , after months of flawless preparation , he hurls himself through space like some winged creature too much in love with the earth to leave it , while every drop of his tingling blood makes him conscious of endless reserves of vitality . " It is out of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proceeded  --  directly from the artist , but indirectly also from those . " masters by proxy " who have given him of their surplus vitality in the form of sympathy and inspiration . And there is an even more practical variety of the " master by proxy . " Sei ; eral times in these papers Mr. Schauffier reverts to a plea for the endowment of genius The essay on " The Joyful Heart for Poets " seems to have rather more to do with pockets than with hearts . The argument is that we should spend a few thousands out of the millions we give fOr education to founding " fellowships of creative poetry , " and that it would be well now and then for a " captain of industry . . . to put his hand into his pocket  --  if only into his watch-pocket  --  or adorn his last testament with a modest codicil " ? in of some struggling young poet . Thus might vicarious glory be attained by the dullest millionaire . " Even if he finds himself quite lacking in creativeness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will relax his purse-strings . " And if he can first catch his genius ! Relaxing purse-strings is , we understand , the chief sport of millionaires , but it has its rules . What Mr. Schauffier really needs for his purpose is a captain of industry with enough of surplus vitality to enjoy investing in futures . Students of local government have long been interested in the reputed efficiency of German city administration , but hitherto there has been a surprisingly small amount of accurate information published on the subject in English The German statistical year books n , n r , , // of r1.24 ? 1-mt fi=n , nf nc ha Sr ' Pl th Pr the patience to burrow through them or the skill and experience which is necessary to interpret the results that these figures may disclose . Mr. W. H. Dawson , in " Municipal Life and Government in Germany " ( Long-mans. $3 ' 75 net ) , has , for the present at least , solved some of this difficulty . He has devoted several years to a personal investigation of German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , and getting his information at first hand . The result is a book , not written from books , but out of the mouths of men . This is not to say that the author has altogether neglected to make use of official publications ; on the contrary , he has drawn freely from such sources . But he has put flesh upon these dry bones , so that his narrative of German municipal achievement is interesting as well as accurate in its details The volume deals with the structure as well as with the functions of city government in the German Empire , although chiefly with the latter . There are good chapters on . - urban land-policy and city planning , housing , and poor rehef . Due consideration is given , and very properly , to German municipal progress in minor fields of social betterment  --  to the municipalization of pawnshops and employment agencies , for example . More than a hundred Pages are devoted to the complicated but highly important topic of municipal finances . The author 's chapters on this subject constitute the clearest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of Mr Dawson 's statements are hardly supported by the evidence adduced , but these do not seriously impair the value of a solid , careful , and readable volume . More to the point is the fact that the author has viewed everything from an intensely pro-German standpoint . He finds virtually nothing to criticise ; even the Prussian local franchise system , with all its absurdities , meets his general approval as " asserting the principle of proportional representation according to liability to taxation " ( p. 69 ) . The Abbe N. de Montfaucon de Vfilars , not very godly cleric who flourished in the third quarter of the seventeenth century . published at Paris in 1670 a curious book called - " Comte de Gabalis , on entretiens sur les sciences secretes " To the mere eye of sense , the gist of this work appears to be a somewhat playful recommendation of that " higher sensuality " which earlier in the cen-tury found favor at the court of Henrietta Maria in England under the name of " Platonic love " ? a sensuality refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alexander Pope brought the book to the attention of English readers by borrowing from it the sylph-machinery in his " Rape of the Lock , " and by commending it in his pref-ace to that poem as the best account of the Rosicrucians . Edward Gibbon , as we , are informed , once owned the copy now in the British Museum . Robert Browning also had a copy , to which he was indebted for some of the obscurities in " The Ring and the Book . " Bulwer-Lytton utilized it in his novel , " Zanon.i . " Anatole France refers to it , em-ploys it , and exposes its mystical sensual-ity to derisive laughter in the " ROtis-serie de la reine Peclauque " It is now pre-sented to us in an English translation with an elaborate mystical commentary , published by the Brothers , and to be had of Mr. Harry - L1.241 ' St-=t Ye-I- , for $2.50 . It is necessary , therefore , to add that to the illuminated eye  --  to the spiritual vision in which the writer of this note is regrettably deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries , and leads the " Pilgrim Soul " into " a new realization of God 's Omnipotence and Justice " A similar claim , we believe , was formerly advanced in behalf of Ovid 's " Ars amatoria . " Whether there is any relation between the Abbe 's text and the commentary drawn from Plato , Proclus , Porphyry , the Koran , the Cabala , Behmen , Swedenborg , and Mrs M. B. Eddy  --  this is a question which can not be answered by one who is animated by " selfish intellectualism . " As we are fairly warned at the outset , this book is only " for the student who seeks to illuminate his intelligence by the torch of his own divinity " ? for those who , as Pope put it , " quitting sense call imitating God . " Norman B. Dearie , in his " Industrial Training " ( London : King ; 10s. 6d. net ) , has given us a volume well up to the standard of previous monographs edited by the Hon. W. Pember Reeves and published under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a very thorough discussion of the existing conditions of employment of male workers in the City of London and how they have affected the industrial training of boys This discussion , with its conclusions , is based upon several years of investigation during which the facts were obtained at first hand from employers , trade-union officials , trade schools , boys engaged in various methods of learning a trade , and journeymen in the same trades .

This book is worthy of the atten Europe . The index is sadly insufficient . The tion of Americans who are working along style is clear and admirable , and the work similar lines and who desire to forestall in an absorbingly interesting human document . America conditions that have become acute elsewhere .. " A Far Journey " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $1.75 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written story of the pathway , geographical , - political , intellectual , and religious , by which the author has been led from boyhood in a Syrian village near Mt . Lebanon to a high level of intelligent citizenship in ' the United States , and from membership in the Greek Orthodox Church to the pastorate of the Church of the Disciples ' in Boston . The introductory chapters go beyond the personal fortunes of the writer and give many interesting pictures of Syrian manners and customs . That even a little Syrian village can send a child into the world with an adequate native intellectual endowment is evident from the comparative ease with which Mr Rihbany has triumphed over the disadvantage of limited educational opportunities Thwarted in his desire for a thorough college training , he has persistently sought and found an education elsewhere , and that , too , without falling into the common error of undervaluing the more formal schooling denied to him .

It was the chance of a good-natured inspector rather than the strict application of existing law that saved him from deportation without seeing more of America than is visible from New York harbor , for only a hasty loan from some of his fellow Passengers saved him from facing the ordeal of Ellis Island with no visible means of support . Whatever Mr. David Hannay writes is well worth reading , for he is saturated with his subject , and he writes with authority . His latest book , " Naval Courts-Martial " ( Putnam ; $2 50 ) , is not at all what one might reasonably expect , a compendium of famous trials . These he passes over in silence or with but scant - The present stop in excavating has been put to profit in classifying scattered remains This has led to an interesting surprise .

The Cyrenean Venus is set clown , in the somewhat curious inventory of Bengasi , at 250,000 lire , this Alexander is listed at 400,000 ( $80,000 ) Art , archaeology , and history are all interested .
