txt Professor PERRY of Harvard has an elaborately ironical article in The Atlantic Monthly on " Domestic Superstitions . " He tells us that " parents and " other adult members of the family be " long to the priestly caste . It is their " business to preach the doctrine and to " be ostentatiously on their good beha " vior " How many families of readers of The Atlantic boast of a father of a family who has been able to keep the hieratic pose , the majesty and the authority of a family father of the old stock ? Probably in the largest number of such families there are no children , or not more than two . Years ago that courtly Boston patrician , Mr. ROBERT C. WINTHROP , used to say in effect : " When " I was a child I never dared to sit down " in the presence of my parents . My " children always ' sit on ' me . " The Fall of Father has been going on for more than a generation . At best he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occasionally the equal or companion , of his one or two children . His position , social and political and domestic , has also been reduced to one of subordination to Mother . Why does Professor PERRY gloat over the fallen ? Why does he choose to imagine that Father leaves the office , longing for his fireside , for " a certain corn " fortable chair waiting for him in an " accustomed spot near a reading lamp " ? Why not near a whale-oil lamp or an " astral " ? Mother , on the contrary , is pining for " a dance or the theatre , friends , gayety and late to bed . " It is like enough that some Boston suburban fathers are " funny , " but are they so marked off from other dethroned domestic gods as that ? Are there no restaurants in Boston ? At any rate , the region hereabouts is full of fathers who have no taste for reading , and whose domestic ideal is expressed in the comicopera saying : " There 's no place like " home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This does n't mean that these unsuperstitious people neglect their children , if they have - any . It means only that Father , in spite of his decline and fall , is not without the fetch of his first ancestor . He tries to " save his face . " He leaves the hearth of an evening only . to please his wife . She knows better . Of course , there are a thousand variations of domestic habit ; and if we make large assumptions it is merely for the sake of keeping pace with the Cambridge ironist . " A man 's idea of Sunday , " he writes , " is to surround his house with barbed " wire , lock and barricade the doors and " windows , disconnect the telephone , put " on his slippers and an old suit , and " then devote the day to reading the " paper and ' puttering . ' " No golf , no motor car ? Why , even in the most bucolic parts , the household issues from the home to enjoy the revel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there no movies in Cambridge ? Slippers ? How archaic ! Does anybody wear slippers except for bathroom purposes ? Do Middlesex County papas sit about the fortress of the home in blue-flowered dressing gowns ? Professor PERRY is a mystifier . Is it permitted even to a professor to make this ironical sweeping assertion : " Why should scolding be peculiar to the home ? " If it were , who would wander from his own fireside ? Congress is rich in scolds . The pulpit is not poor in them . A thousand high-brow persons and periodicals avoid the ducking-stool only by the mistaken mildness of our laws . Professor PERRY is merely feeding his amusing theory . Home life , with its scolding ant various frictions , is a school and discipline : Both children and adults , consorting with one another in every combination of age and sex , in every condition of health , at every hour of the day , and in a great variety of moods and temperaments , exhaust the whole repertory of human relations and learn how to live together . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of it which distinguishes the bachelor , the maid , the orphan , and in some degree the only child . Many of the saints practiced patience without matriculating in the family university for that purpose . But we best appreciate Professor PERRY 'S theory of the home by quoting from it . As for the impatient , undisciplined " only child , " how many Atlantic families have more ?
