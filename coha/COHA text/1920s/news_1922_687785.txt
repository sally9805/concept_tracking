txt Disappointment over the fact that the Reading segregation must apparently go over until fall is probably in large part responsible for the fact that the common stock has declines to about the level of a year ago , after the relations of the preferred and common stocks under the plan were known . Other railroad stocks have reflected recovery from industrial depression and progress in readjusting operating conditions to such an extent that the Dow , Jones rail average is about 14 points higher than it was this time last year . Heading 's earning power is more or less obscured by the absence of late reports for its component parts and by undetermined changes in the segregation plan . As for the latter , they may shift values as between the coal and railroad properties slightly , but can hardly have any serious effect upon the total value of the properties embraced in- the ownership of the holding company .

The holding company 's report for that year showed no dividend or interest income from the coal company . Only the coal properties and their earnings are to be shared pro rata with the preferred stockholders in the pending segregation . If the net profits for the coal company , which were about ** in 1920 , be divided among preferred and common shares they equal $2.25 a share for all and bring apparent earnings on Reading common for that year up to $7.29 a share of $50 par , against $4 a share paid in dividends . ItAII.NVAN " . S UNDIVIDED SURPLUS But in 1920 the railway company paid the holding company only its regular dividends of 10.7 , or $4,249,170 , out of the year 's surplus of $9,010,790 . It could have added $3.40 a share on the common . making real earnings of $10.69 a share .

But the railway company , on present estimates , earned a surplus after charges of about $7,000,000 . Taking in the undivided surplus of the railway and issuming $5,000,000 net on the part of the coal company ( $1,600,000 less than the year before ) , it would appear that 1921 earnings on Reading . common , after dividing the coal earnings pro rata among the three classes of stock , were about $8. g0 a share , or over 10% on the present selling price . And last year was one of severe depression in railroad traffic . For the first four months of this year , the railway company reports net operating income before fixed charges of $4,967,468 , compared with $1,082,769 last year . Obviously the large gain is due in part to the pre-strike movement of coal , but it is significant that gross for the four months was about $800,000 less than in the same period of .1921 , whereas expenses were reduced by more than $4,000.000 . April gross was off $1,200,000 , or 20% , and net operating income was only $492,441 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , is earnings a deficit while the strike lasts . But the country 's anthracite requirements are practically constant , and will be made up after the strike as rapidly as the coal can be mined. ** 4. ) : 4 ; 1114.11 1-11:1.13 1111411% These figures point to the conclusion that Reading railroad stock , after segregation , can continue to pay the present dividend rate . If the rights are taken at only the minimum price made on the Curb last year , 13 , the railroad stock is selling at the equivalent of 63 , to yield on the present dividend rate . Taking them at their high price of 20 , the railway stock is selling at the equivalent of 57 , to yield 7% . Another consideration bearing on the value of Reading stock is its 52'l- equity in Central of New Jersey . The latter has sold its Lehigh &; Wilkes-Barre stock for $32 , - 500,000 , or 823,000.000 more than the bond issue under ? N.hich this coal stock was pledged . If the New Jersey road were to distribute these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise with its share , Possibly all classes of Reading stockholders would come into the distribution . It may be taken for granted , however , that Jersey Central will keep the cash in hand for various capital purposes , and in due time will make it earn satisfactory returns . Indirectly Reading 's half of these proceeds promises to accrue to Reading common stockholders.
