txt Action of directors of American Light &; Traction Co. in reducing quarterly dividend on the common from 10% in cash and 10% in stock annually to 7% cash and stock annual basis was a disappointment in some quarters , as it had been generally expected that the rate would not fall below 8% cash and stock yearly . Indications are that the decision was reached at the last minute as many directors were known to favor a 8% cash and stock dividend . A slight increase in the rate later in the year , ns soon as earnings show further improvement over the low figures touched the middle of last year , would not be surprising . Alanson P. Lathrop , president , following the meeting of the board denied that there had been any agreement with the bankers to whom the recent $6,000,000 note issue was sold whereby the dividend was required to be cut . A publication recently printed a story to this effect . Latest earnings statements published would seem to indicate that the cut was necessary as a matter of conservatism . Earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows net available for dividend requirements of $4,201,140 . Dividend requirements during diis period amounted to $5,687,447 so that it was necessary to draw on surplus to the extent of $1,486,307 . Cash dividend on the preferred stock outstanding for the twelve month period amounted to $854,172 ; cash dividend on the common to $2,4143,635 . From profit and loss surplus there is deducted $2,416,427 , representing stock dividends paid at par . The recent note issue of $6,000,000 at 6% will require an additional $360,000 for interest charges annually though Cy expected to be more than made up by the increase earnings expected from the additions to plants of subsidiaries paid for by the proceeds of the issue . On Dec. 31 , 1919 , there was $14,236.200 preferred stock outstanding and $25,047,100 common . The amount of the common stock outstanding has been further increased bs $626,000 by the payment of a 217i : % stock dividend on the junior shares since the close of last year . Dividend requirements on the amount of stock outstanding December 81 , 1919 , at the 7% annual cash and stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note issue would amount to approximately $4,721,000 . Gross earnings of subsidiary operating companies are showing steady increase , according to officials , but in the last few months the advance has not been reflected in net . This is attributed mainly to the high cost of coal which has advanced from $1.15 a von in pre-war times to well above $7 a ton to utilities at the mines . It is expected that the cost of coal to public utilities will show some decline soon .
