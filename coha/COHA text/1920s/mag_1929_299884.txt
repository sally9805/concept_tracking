Jails keep prisoners in and prisoners ' enemies out . Last week Alphonse ( " Scarface Al " ) Capone , once Chicago 's No. 1 under-worldling , now a hunted exile " on the spot , " went behind the bars of Philadelphia 's Moyamensing jail for a year 's " stretch . " Philadelphia and Chicago officials were sure that Capone had deliberately taken refuge in prison , where the only bullets he would have to worry about would come from the guards ' rifles . <P> For a week Capone , with his ever present bodyguard , Frank ( " Slippery " ) Cline , had been teasing Atlantic City police officials with his presence in that resort . He prepared to return to Chicago , motored to Philadelphia , missed the Broadway Limited , made a reservation on the Manhattan Limited . With two hours to kill , he went to a cinema . Detectives picked him up as he came out , took from him a .38 calibre revolver , courteously escorted him to police headquarters . Bail was set at $35,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemuel B.Schofield and made these statements : <P> " I went into the racket in Chicago four and a half years ago . During the last two years I 've been trying to get out . ... I want peace . I 'm willing to live and let live . I 'm tired of murders and shootings ... I 'm retired and living on my money . <P> The situation as revealed by the Grand Jury of this city Philadelphia as bad as it was , was nothing to compare to Chicago . " <P> Director Schofield asked Capone if he had met such notorious Philadelphians as Max ( " Boo Boo " ) Hoff . Replied Capone : " ; No , but I know them intimately . " <P> The next morning Capone faced the detective line-up at 9:30 a. m. , was indicted by the Grand Jury at 10:25 a. m. for carrying concealed weapons , went on trial at 11:30 a. m. , pleaded guilty ( with Cline ) at 12:15 p. m. , started a year 's sentence at 12:50 p. m . Exactly 16 hrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sentence-a record . Remarked Capone : " They work fast here . " <P> Capone told Philadelphia officials a yarn about effecting a gang truce for Chicago while in Atlantic City , whereby the Beer Racket would be peacefully divided between what remained of his old mob and that of George ( " Bugs " ) Moran . Chicago officials were skeptical of any such blessing , but , good sportsmen , they congratulated Philadelphia on putting Capone behind the bars for the first time in his notorious career . <P> State 's Attorney John A. Swanson exclaimed : " Good news . "
