In a crowded House of Commons Mr. Stanley Baldwin , Chancellor of the Exchequer , enunciated his long-expected discourse on the finances of the United Kingdom . The budget he introduced of course had its dissentients . But on the whole Parliament was pleased with the decrease in taxation and the financial outlook for the fiscal year 1923-1924 . <P> The main points in the budget are : a reduction from 5s to 4/6d in the pound on the income tax , a 50 percent reduction on corporation tax , a decrease in taxation on beer by 1d a pint , reduction of postal charges . No new taxation was introduced . The estimated revenue for the coming year is approximately $3,806,025,000 as against approximately $4,235,103,750 for last year 's estimated revenue . The expenditure is figured at the approximate figure of $3,797,264,400 against last year 's $4,235,103,750 . Thus the Treasury has a small margin for contingencies of about $8,760,600 . <P> In his peroration Mr. Baldwin said : " I have gone to the utmost limit of my power to relieve the taxpayer without impairing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation and relief to the taxpayer are in the long run inextricably interwoven . I believe that although we are still in a series of transition years we have already passed the peak load of taxation , and we may hope soon to have left behind us the calamitous years of trade depression . But our hopes may be frustrated by untoward events on the Continent or untoward events at home . Industrial peace and reduced taxation which is the offspring of peace , can do more than anything else for the trade of this country . " <P> Other facts in Mr. Baldwin 's speech : Last year 's surplus was $471,975,000 and had already been applied to a reduction of debt . The deadweight national debt at March 31,1922 , was approximately $35,460,900,000 ; at March 31 , 1923 , it stood at the approximate figure of $36,144,450,000 ; paradoxically the national debt had been decreased by about $695,000,000 , the increase being due to interior disturbing factors . The external debt stood at about $5,156,935,560 at the end of the financial year 1921-1922 ; this year it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ' interest on the United States debt , which now stands at $4,600,000,000 . In four years the external debt had been reduced by about $972,770,700.
