Arkansas . In the home state of Nominee Robinson , the Democratic primary is all that matters . Held last week , it resulted in renomination for Governor Harvey Parnell . For Commissioner of Agriculture the Arkansas voters chose Earl Page , a man with no legs ; for State Auditor , J. Oscar Humphrey , a man with no arms . <P> Ohio . With a Democratic Governor , a Democratic Senator , several Democratic Representatives and several Wet cities , the home state of seven Republican Presidents and the birth state of the Anti-Saloon League is inscrutable political ground this year . The Anti-Saloon League apparently demonstrated continued vitality in last week 's primary . Both the candidates whom it endorsed for Governor were winners-Myers Y. Cooper of Cincinnati ( Republican ) and U. S. Representative Martin L. Davey* of Kent ( Democrat ) . Both the League 's candidates for the seat of its dead champion , Senator Willis , came out ahead-U.S . Representative Theodore Elijah Burton of Cleveland ( Republican ) and U.S. Senator Cyrus Locher of Cleveland ( Democrat ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davey and Burton are famed votegetters in their own right . And the G. O. P. vote was no index to Hooverism since it contained a town-v. - country aftermath of the Hoover-Willis fight for Ohio 's delegates to the Presidential convention . Moreover , Dry Democrat Locher 's victory over Wet Democrat Graham P. Hunt of Cincinnati seemed reversed when errors were discovered in the vote-counting . It looked as if Mr. Hunt had really finished 96 votes ahead of Mr. Locher . A complete official recheck by Ohio 's 88 county election boards was necessary , a full week 's job . <P> With November in mind , Republicans took their greatest comfort from the following Ohio totals , irrespective of alcoholic content-Republican votes cast , some 625,000 ; Democratic , some 225,000 . <P> <P> *Famed " tree surgeon .
