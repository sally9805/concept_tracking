Tire adjective ' social ' is used at large , has grown diffuse , and has branched out with many meanings . My brethren of the Press use it as meaning ' of wealthy women . ' I use it here in the strict and original sense to mean the relations between the citizens of one community ? their general relations : that way of men with men which marks a national spirit . The contrast in this spirit between the American civilization and our own is the first , the most universal , the most characteristic form of contrast to be grasped . What is the essential mark of the American social spirit ? Its essential is publicity : the spirit of the marketplace . The contact of individual with individual is indefinitely more continuous and more frequent in America than east of the great water , on the farther shore . To us Europeans rudely surprising , this publicity is the note of all American things . It runs through every manifestation of American life and colors the whole . With us the market-place , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the Americans the Forum is the habit of all life . In the Old World corporation stands separate from corporation , community from community , family from rot ms ? NO. 4 family , and the rest ; among the Americans the sub-units ? individuals , families , corporations ? are possessed of a ceaseless molecular activity , as it were , and that especially of the individual ; each affecting each directly and constantly . The interaction is perpetual between each man and his neighbors of whatever category of neighborhood . It is a quality like that which our physical scientists put forward as their guess at the constitution of a gas , distinguishing it from that of a fluid , a violent rapidity of motion in the particles . It is the extension to the highest degree of what the great Greeks of antiquity called the political nature of man : his civic character . It is the extreme of what is much more falsely called , in a characteristically modern metaphor , the gregarious quality of man ; not in the sense of men 's tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd ( though that is one secondary consequence of the thing ) ; but rather in its tendency to make each man affirm his fellowship with his fellows . For intense individual contact and energy make for uniformity . Let me emphasize that very important little paradox . There is no contradiction between the intensity of individual action and an almost mechanical similarity in general action . On the contrary , the two go together ; and where the activity of the individual , his desire to depend upon himself , and his consequent energy in action , are pushed to their furthest limit , there you will have also the most repeated contact between individuals , and , as a consequence , the most uniform result . That is why the uniformity of American life is so striking for the European observer . Put a number of round smooth balls upon a billiard table . Give them each a slow and slight movement , and you will see no general movement appearing . There will be little clatter , few and rare collisions . Impart to them each a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while you raise very greatly the noise of the shocks ( which is a superficial phenomenon ) , and while you increase even more the number and frequency of collisions ( which is the cause of the noise ) , you also soon develop a resultant of all the random directions . If the sharp speed of each be maintained you will soon perceive in the movement of the whole a general swing , and all that great mass of balls will be moving in a crowd . So it is with a human society . I am not here concerned with whether this extreme of individual action and individual activity , the consequent extreme of individual contact ( that is , of publicity ) , the further result of large streams of common action and of a vast uniformity also pushed to an extreme , are good or evil ; for it is not a judgment of good and evil which I am attempting to describe , but a particular social phenomenon . I do not judge here , I only observe ; and I say that the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with our European selves , is this generalization of the individual in action ? his presence everywhere in perpetual touch with his fellows . To us Europeans coming as travelers to America the degree of the thing is so unusual and , till it is experienced , so inconceivable that it is the first shock of difference we feel between ourselves and our hosts . The American approaches and speaks to any man anywhere without previous knowledge of him , and is received as an Englishman , German , or Italian would receive a person he had known all his life . In Europe even a man urgently pressed to such action ( for instance , a man catching a train and not knowing his way to the station ) must always go through some form before he addresses another man ; and if there is no urgency , the form must be prolonged and careful . In America this form is unknown . Contact is established at once and as a matter of course ; and we of Europe feel this strange American thing subtly and continually in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shop when you ask him for goods , and that one replying to you ; one in a public office , a post office , of whom you ask information and who replies to you ; one in any of a thousand relations , which recur daily , treats you in America after a fashion unknown in Europe ; and when people are honest with themselves , their sharpest memory of the United States , especially if they remain there ( as do most traveling Europeans ) for but a moment of their lives , is that brusque relation , vivid , not to be mistaken , different from any experience in their own world . On most Europeans this novel relation acts as an acute irritant . A smaller number it amuses . To all it is enormously strange ; to me attractive . But to the American it is inconceivable that it should be strange . It is to him as normal as breathing . We call their mood a lack of privacy ; they call our mood by equally uncomplimentary names . I have heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans of a leisured sort , and more often by men already acquainted with Europe . The mass of Americans have it of nature and take it for granted . As the European visitor goes out of one of the great American cities and enters the miles of suburbs where the wealthier men have built their houses , the startling thing to his eyes is to note that there is no division between one man 's ground and another 's ? they all stand on one lawn ! The startling thing that strikes his cars is the thunder of electric cars clanging past these houses on their steel rails all day ? and all night . Wealth and opportunity in America connote the very opposites of what they do in Europe : extreme neatness , rarity of detail , a hospitable cleanliness of bath , drains , sinks ; facile communication , plenty of noise and metal ? and no seclusion . With us , wealth ? especially wealth long possessed ? is Marked by an extreme of seclusion ; a horror of noise ; a carefully acquired distance from communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture ; a mass of detail in every kind of reading and picture and chance-inherited or picked-up whatnots by the hundred ; repose , and ( especially with the English gentry ) what they call Froust ? which some of them also call Fug . It is not newness which digs this chasm between the two , for the American thing is found in families and fields two hundred and fifty years old ; it is a fathomless spiritual gulf separating two kinds of men and making it so that in the world of the one the other could not live . Individuals support the change ; but an English group , remaining English , could not ( I say ) live in America : it would breathe an alien air and die . This element of publicity , then , is everywhere . I could by way of paradox pick out a thousand examples of the apparent contrary : things on which American convention forbids discussion , but European permits it , if not fully , more freely . But these make no counter-balance , for there are an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed in Europe freely but in America universally discussed ? income , for instance , and digestion . But these examples of exception on the one hand , of exaggeration on the other , do not affect the ma in truths : that the note of American society is life under the eye and in the ear of all . I have said that this root-character of vibrating individual activity leads not only to perpetual personal contact but also to uniformity ; and I have said that there is here no contradiction , but that the one is an obvious consequence of the other . This uniformity , this second effect of publicity , is as striking to the European as the first effect , that of perpetual contact . For the contras , here also , in the matter of uniformity , is bewilderingly intense . In Europe the epigram passes round , ' Everything in America , is upon a belt ' ; by which I suppose the author of it meant that the European observes in America a lack of that high differentiation to which he is accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is awake to a set of domestic differences which the foreign visitor does not feel . But if he will compare the social manner of his own country with that of Europe he will , I think , agree with me that there is in his society not only uniformity of ideas ( compared with ours ) , but also a widespread uniformity of lesser daily action . The rapid vibration of individual life has not led to a multiplicity of private habits as a slower but progressive individual pace might have done . It has led to the contrary . It has rendered the individual typical ; a common mould exists into which men are run and their surroundings . Thus the large hotel is of identically the same structure , plan , and end where-ever you go in the United States ; and if it be objected that the hotel is naturally so , being an institution made to be in common and universal , one may reply that nothing in Europe is more personal and ' each-of-its-kind ' than our inns . One may add that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , its furniture , its reading , the very details of warming and of cooking and the rest . Every nation , and for that matter every civilization , has some uniformity in such things . There is a French house which is not Italian ; a European house which is not Asiatic . But in America uniformity is far more striking ( for it is far more exact ) than it is with us . It has a far sharper edge , it makes a far neater imprint , it is far less varied within its own genus . And the converse is true ; the traveler is certain of finding one limited set of things everywhere ; he is equally certain of lacking others . He will find the same book , the same bath , the same radiator . He will not find Chambertin or , say , Lepanto ' ? a poem , or changing soft songs . He feels a regimental effect . Upon this I know not how many other causes converge besides those I have guessed at ? the even topography ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued in a flood and destined to continue ; the delight in mechanical application . Let me illustrate this last point . A novel form of transport ? the American elevator ( lift ' in English ) ? saves a proportion of energy compared with an earlier form , a staircase . In our European world the earlier form will nearly always survive ; not precariously survive ; not slowly die out ; but survive ? continue , outlast the innovation ? and that stubbornly . So also will many other forms , earlier still . This tenacity in the survival of old instruments goes with the spirit of privacy , with the individual private , domestic , turned inward ; with the unit of the corporation , of the college , of the family , also turned inward . And with us such differentiation is not due to dullness or routine , but just the opposite . It is a mark or symbol in our society of those who hold a special and even a superior place therein . Thus the high Western civilization of France , Spain , Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russia , or the Balkans . With the Americans it is the reverse . Old forms surviving mean , there , something sluggish or poor : an inhibition . To have things about one less ' efficient ' than those of the past is , among Americans , a sign of weakness . Many a European library is proud to be so individual as to be arranged haphazard : to allow a man to browse among its books at the expense of their continual misplacing . Its members choose by discovery , and find the pleasure of such a freedom to exceed the pleasure of rapid delivery through exact order . And in such old European libraries a change of system , the closing of the shelves to such general inspection for the sake of exact order , would be thought a loss , not a gain . But in America the consequent disorder would be found intolerable . The saving of energy in any department is , in America , a progress . To waste energy for the sake of individuality , caprice , elbow-room , tradition , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their standard . This spirit of common action takes the form also of creating enormous markets even for the things of the soul . It creates on a huge scale , and as a benefit , what our urban centres in Europe also suffer from not a little , as a curse ? the ' Best Seller ' : the book which spreads like fire through dry grass , not because it makes any special appeal to individual minds , but because a crowd takes it up . Only some one book can at the same one time thus capture the universal market , but almost any book may do so . One book among a myriad gets the lead ( no one knows how ) and , immediately , its competitors fall out , and that one book sells by the million for three months ? and is forgotten in six . That is the astounding part of the affair . The appetite admits itself worthless in judgment and abdicates immediately . This spirit of common action shows itself much more importantly in the realm of ideas , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal . Thus one social doctrine ? the treatment of all religious statement and practice within a certain limit as private opinions , the persecution of all beyond that limit as intolerable ? is universal . It is unquestioned . It is taken for granted . No one may be specifically burdened for rejecting ( or accepting ) the Catholic doctrine of clerical celibacy . But no one will be tolerated who denies the Catholic doctrine of monogamy . Again , the value , sacredness , and efficacy of the vote . The conception that a majority r has a divine right to decide in any matter is universal in America , not as a conclusion of reason ' The Constitution does , in effect , often give a minority power , e.g. , through the Senate . But the majority doctrine is unquestioned. but as an accepted dogma . It is not the doctrine that society as an organism may impose its organic will ? that all humanity accepts . It is the doctrine that majority voting expresses that will ! The principle is , as all will agree after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when three rare conditions are all present together : universal interest , a common experience , a perfect machinery . Shall two lads of twenty-one and twenty-two outvote their father ? Is a family less of a social unit than a minx ? Do one million care ( or know ) more about bimetallism than 999,999 ? But the case is even worse than such unanswerable questions imply . It is clear to reason that such a conception , even if its principle be admitted , must have physical , necessary , limits . Society could not be conducted at all , and the State could no longer exist , if fifty-one out of a hundred were in all matters whatsoever free to dictate to forty-nine . It would be impossible mechanically , because the number of things to be decided is infinite . It would be intolerable in morals , because it may well be ( and usually is the case ) that the great majority are slightly opposed to something to which the minority is passionately attached : for instance , the Mass . In a word , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a divine doctrine , as something in the very nature of morals , can work only on a small field ; right or wrong , it can act only over very restricted areas . Yet the limits , until very lately at least , have been accepted only subconsciously in America ; only recently has Europe noticed the beginnings of an American discussion upon them , which discussion had hardly begun when I was a young man in America thirty years ago . It is perhaps the policy of Prohibition that has raised the issue of majority rule . I do not know . But , I repeat , the discussion has come . It will lead far ; but it will not shake that conception of the divine right of a majority . That is a universal idea in America , rooted in the public mind and as omnipresent as was in other times and places the right of the Church to impose itself exclusively in , say , the English world of the thirteenth century . Philosophers have , of course , debated the matter of majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that long before the modern organization of voting upon a very large scale was known . They at once discovered that the right of a majority thus to dictate can be based upon nothing but the absurdity of its alternative . If the majority has not the right to coerce the whole , still less has a minority . Supposing a complete identity of units and supposing an equality of interest in all those units , majority rule is merely the statement that its opposite is more absurd than itself . But that impassive way of treating the idea of decisions by majorities is not at all the way in which the American mind has received it . It has been received as a self-evident truth in morals . I know well enough that the wisdom of those who founded the American Constitution checked majority rule : limited it , and so saved the State . But my point is that this dogma , so universal , so unquestioned , so foolish , is an example of uniformity . Another example of this uniformity of social action is found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World . They change rapidly in direction and in object . That of to-day may be almost opposite in direction to that of to-morrow . The object exciting the wave of to-day may wholly differ in nature from the object exciting that of to-morrow ; but the prime mark of uniformity is never lacking . The vast mass of human beings moves as one body . Such cohesive universal action is a most formidable instrument of power . Of all the characteristics of American life which Europe respects , calls upon as an ally or dreads as an opponent , this is the chief ; and it is not unamusing to watch the clumsy efforts of European propagandists to produce these waves in the United States . Even as I write the opposing interests of the French and English are urging these peoples to attempt by print and missionary speakers the rise of such a wave ; with France it takes the form of attempting to raise an enthusiasm for her sufferings , with England it takes the form of appealing for American entry into a League of Nations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These attempts fail . For no force can raise these waves save one arising upon American soil . But when the source of an American enthusiasm is native it may have an astonishingly rapid rise and a still more astonishing vigor . Such emotions come too sudden . ly for us Europeans even to note their origins . We do not understand their nature . Among the universal ideas which M practice are thus everywhere accepted . and which stamp the public mind of the United States , Europe has in particular noted one ; and Europe ( particularh England ) has so misunderstood this one , that I hope to be excused if I at . tempt at some length to explain it I mean the money standard ? the close connection everywhere apparent in the American mind between civic value and an individual accumulation of wealth ; the use of acquired ( not in ? herited ) fortune as a test of worth . There is no point on which more acrimonious folly has been talked by foreigners than this , and all that folly proceeds from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the thing . There is an attitude toward private fortune , the private possession of wealth , which is , exactly , idolatrous ; that is , which ( a ) imputes to this dead thing living attributes , ( b ) worships this dead thing . For in these two errors combined does idolatry consist . Where that spirit of idolatry is present , where there is a worship of the wealthy man , where there is a confusion between the advantages of wealth and the objects proper for human admiration , there you have as base a corruption of the religious instinct as man can suffer . That is , very exactly , Mammon . Now at the risk of appearing paradoxical and fantastic to nearly all European readers , and even to many American readers , I will boldly say that no modern society is so free from this detestable heresy as the American . To transfer admiration from the thing possessed to its possessor ; to conceive that the mere possession of material wealth makes of its possessor a proper object for worship ; to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much as enter the American mind . To say to himself , That man is an owner of great wealth ; therefore I respect him as I would respect a great poet or a great soldier , ' is impossible to an American . In Europe this mood of Mammon is never absent . I am glad to say that even with us the degrees vary in different places and different times . It was very much worse before the war in England than it is to-day . It was very much worse just before the war than it was a generation earlier . It is worse in Paris than in any of the French provinces , and worse in the French provinces than in Italy . But throughout our long-stratified European societies there is everywhere a measure of this money-worship ; and it is detestable . You may compare the beastly thing to the smell of gas . A leak may be just strong enough to be slightly unpleasant ; or stronger and very unpleasant ; or appalling . In a few places it will make a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to Mammon , we in England live to-day complaining of that smell of gas as pretty nearly intolerable . Just before the war ( which came in to correct the thing ) it really had become intolerable . We were in a room where the leak was so bad that it drove people out . All over Europe ( even in Castilian Spain , which is the freest of all our societies from the horror ) you can smell that gas . In America you are wholly free from the faintest odor of it . Mammon is not the passion for getting money , nor the desire for what money can buy ; still less is it the envy of those who have more money than one 's self . It is the transference to the wealthy man of qualities not present in him and suggested only by the fact that he is wealthy . It is expressed in the feeling of genuine respect for a rich man and genuine contempt for a poor one ; in the attribution of virtue to the one and of vices to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul less present in the United States than in any other modern society . Mammon does not appear with the Americans in gesture , or tone of speech or glance , nor in any of those things which betray the deference of the soul . I , at least , have never seen those glances , or gestures , or heard those tones in America . With us they are universal . What , then , is it in the American attitude which has been mistaken for Mammon ? It is something quite other . It is the threefold conception ( 1 ) that success in accumulation connotes effort upon the part of any man ; ( 2 ) that American opportunity should make this equally possible for any man ; and negatively ( 3 ) that there is nothing else in the State either so easily measurable as the money-standard or so universally present . The American sees civic life as a race , entry to which is open for all . Nature around him lies still largely unexploited , new ideas of its new use arise day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entered by nearly all , and your place in it can be ? very roughly ? measured by your material achievement . It is natural that under such conditions such a test should be applied . The simplicity of the standard has its evils , and they are gross . They lead to a difference between the idea of production and the idea of accumulation . They lead to an excess of cunning , though that , again , is cunning of a simple type . But these and many other defects attaching to the conception most emphatically do not include that disgusting , that degrading element of base personal worship , and the exclusion of this evil is well worth the admission of all the rest . As to the weak side of this ' money-standard ' habit , what else would you expect to find in a society which has had for its main temporal task during three centuries the development of a vast and still unexhausted continent ? As to its strong side , it is a credit to the civic sense of Americans that they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is proof that what I say is true . In a society degraded by Mammon , those qualities in man which are inherent ( from , say , Literary Talent , which is among the lowest , to , say , Holiness , which is the highest of all ) are held to be less significant than the mere possession of money . They are more or less admired ( and that in the wrong order ) , but they are never worshiped . Worship , to parody the theological definition , ' is reserved for Money alone . ' Now among the Americans these inherent qualities not only reach their right place , but take , if anything , a place a little too high . A great soldier having saved Europe on a salary of five thousand dollars a year , the Americans are moved to receive him as he should be received . Did a poet appear nowadays ( the world is waiting for him , but he has not come ) , the Americans would receive him as he should be received . In London rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rich woman twice . The poet would , in London , be an exhibit and a trapping at her table , like the ephemeral hero of the last scandal . That is not true of America . Hostesses scramble for lions there as here . But in America the lion is more than the hostess . With us , unless the lion is the richer , the lion is the less . Or again : among people in one house-party , upon our side of the Atlantic , degrees of deference are almost entirely determined by wealth . A very rich man is , in such a party , a special and sacred being , far more to his companions than to the servants . A poor man is insignificant . Such is our chief vice . We see men through an atmosphere or colored screen of possession . In America they enjoy the corresponding virtue of seeing men as they are . In the midst of so much which spiritually weakens the New World , this virtue , which is part of its candor , permanently strengthens it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which have bred so much false judgment as to merit this long digression . The digression arose , it will be remembered , in connection with the effects of American uniformity . Now in this matter of the moral effects of American uniformity , two are worth noting before we leave it : an advantage , and a defect . The advantage is a universal courtesy , the defect is assurance . Courtesy in America never fails . It is found in all states of fortune and in all degrees of haste . That it has not our forms makes it , to those of us who care to observe , the more conspicuous . The great machine of American Uniformity needs such oil and gets it abundantly . In no community I know will you find a less number of proud , or surly , or neglectful men ; for pride and surliness and neglect are the fruits of isolation . On the other hand , there is none in which assurance ? that is , certitude based on insufficient evidence or on mere repetition ? is more rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and to the State . For example , each latest fad in the physical or historical jargon of guesswork is accepted for gospel after a fashion far more universal than with us . With us it is a mark of intelligence and reading to ridicule the successive imaginaries which are presented to us for realities ? the Cave Man , and the Nordic Race and all the rest of the ephemeral procession . To accept these things seriously and make them a basis for action , or even thought , is associated in the European mind with something imperfect in a man 's training . I have even heard them called ' suburban ' and ' middle-class ' by middle-class people in the suburbs ; and when things get as far as that it is a wonder and a sign . For instance , such ephemeral books as these , Outlines of History and the rest , have about them , in the eyes of the cultured in Europe , something comic and absurd . The musty , belated , elementary ' science ' and history of their authors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess- work , is a joke ? especially with the French , who are keenly alive to the fun of such figures . But in America I found that trumped-up stuff taken quite seriously . This assurance , doing harm within to the American , is a domestic concern of his own ; doing harm in foreign relations it is the world 's concern , and in that field it might at any moment do the greatest harm . To accept insufficient or actually false stock phrases in ethnology and history is a bad thing for society , but to accept them in international politics is ruinously dangerous , both to the acceptor and the foreign object of his judgment . Words like caveman , " natural selection , ' psychoanalysis , ' are one 's own family affair ; but Anglo-Saxon , " Latin , " Nordic , ' self-determination , ' and ' militarism ' may start a war . Luckily , two powerful checks restrain the effects of these asphyxiating tenuosities : first , the Americans have a vivid and most healthy instinct against foreign entanglements ; secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same : a tradition derived from the great founders of the American Commonwealth and fixed in memorable phrases . IV I now come to a quality in the American social spirit which can not be attached to any material cause , which is a product of ? I know not what virtue or happy accident in the origins of that society . To this quality one can give only the name of candor ; it is straightforwardness and unasking sincerity . It has a general effect ( I know not for how long this effect may endure ) of joy . I have heard innumerable judgments passed upon the American people by Europeans . But in all these judgments , favorable and unfavorable , unintelligent ( as were the great majority ) or intelligent ( as were a rare few ) , there almost always appeared with a note of envy , of surprise , of bitterness , ? or of mere regret , ? the statement that the Americans were happier than any people of the Old World . They are : much happier . It is the astonishing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that people , and telling honestly what he has seen , can hide . They are the happiest white people in the modern world . Wherever you go , in the whole of the vast territory of the States , you discover that sort of freedom in the soul which is the breeding soil of happiness . I have said that I could discover no cause ? certainly no moral cause ? for the candor which is at the root of all this happiness ; but at any rate I am sure that the cause of the happiness is candor . The American people live in truth . By this I do not mean that they have not the vices common to mankind , and the particular vices common to our Western race , and the still more particular vices which attach to their own predominant doctrines . What I mean is that the perpetual habit of repression , accompanied by an indurated falsehood of expression , which runs through and through the governing classes of Europe , is absent ; and I am fully confident that to the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a light heart . Now will this effect endure ? I return to that question . About a year ago a German traveling in America for the first time , and saying what I say , that this note of joy had struck him most , added : ' Nor is it marred by any foreknowledge of its own cessation . They do not know for how short a time this joy will last ! ' I can not pretend to this critic 's prophecy . The joy may last or it may not ; it can not last forever , it can not last , indeed , for very many generations . Every civilization that has developed upon this earth has passed rapidly enough from simplicity to doubt , and from doubt to despair , save indeed where it has been relieved , as was Rome in the fourth century , by that one sublime philosophy which alone can redeem us from despair , but can not give us back our innocence . Every civilization which has appeared upon this earth has either ended by accepting sorrow as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so destroying itself . But every civilization has also passed through an early phase of full expression and satisfaction , and in that phase the American people are to-day . So true is this , that with difficulty does any European man , acquainted as he is with the numerous and accumulated moral evil of the Old World , and haunted , as he must be ( if he is of any sufficient culture ) by the putrescent hypocrisies of those who are still , with us , in the tradition of government , convince Americans of how false our world is . There is still in the atmosphere of the United States ? and pray God it may long so remain ! ? a taking for granted of certain fundamental simplicities and sincerities in motive and action which we have overlaid with I know not how many traditional silences . Here in Europe , and particularly in England , a man who knows how government is now conducted since it ceased to be aristocratic feels himself in the presence of silent men furtively beckoning one to another . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men speaking frankly and aloud . It is the difference between foul air and fresh . I know that there is a curl of contempt against simplicity , but upon the balance , and having seen many men in many places , I for my part will give illy vote for candor ; for its fruit is happiness , and happiness is the end of man . V I will conclude this brief analysis of the Social Contrast with one other of those statements which I know will sound fantastic or , in the abused modern sense of the word , mystical ' ; and this also I am going to say because I believe it to be true . The American use of lime and space is in high contrast with that of the Old World ; by which I mean that the rhythm of life is other from our own in Europe ; quite other . Everything is in the mind . What men think of an hour or a hundred miles is the important thing in the making of their corporate lives . There are , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind holds of these things is all they are , and that they do not exist outside the mind . I will leave them at it . But without delay upon such follies it remains true that a society is wholly colored by the effect of time and space upon itself : the way in which it uses , and is affected by , those dimensions . Now , according as you use your time and space , and as they affect you , your rhythm is produced . A man who speaks at a certain rate , who in his work works half a day at a stretch , who in a short progress feels a great sense of distance , is under one rhythm . A man who speaks or thinks rapidly but otherwise has the same habits is under another rhythm . A man who speaks or thinks slowly but can work at only one thing M short bouts is under a third . The rhythm of a diverse action spread over many activities differs in quality from the rhythm of concentrated action upon one ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm , in the wave-length and the elevation of the wave , and the oscillation-ellipse of the wave , and the cross-section of the wave , and the rate of the wave , and the matter of the wave , American life and thought contrast completely with those of Europe . Nothing in all the aspects of the general contrast is more conclusive to my thesis than this . Whether that contrast proceed mainly from material conditions ( as many would say ) , or from deeper and unseen causes ( as I believe ) , it is clearly present . Men upon both sides of the ocean express their sense of this continually , but do not , I think , as a rule express it accurately . The American is rather proud of asking the European whether he is not ' rattled ' and ' hustled ' by the speed of American life . The European complains , on that suggestion , of just the things suggested to him ; and the American judging Europe will ( of all adjectives ! ) use the adjective ' slow . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not only simple but wrong . The great quality of the American rhythm is shortness of scale as applied to time and the opposite as applied to space , compared with the European rhythm . The American rhythm is more vibratory , the European more surging ; there is in the one something more metallic than in the other ; there is in the one something more mechanical and less organic . I hear in one the sound of a hammer , in the other wind through trees . Prolonged effort and effort spread over many fields of life are less consonant to the American air than to the European . So much for time : but distance , space , has a different effect upon the American mind , and an opposite one . A man going from Paris to Rome , a European , has a different spiritual experience of space from that of a man going to New York from Chicago . It is not a matter of frontiers . A man going from London to Glasgow and back subtly receives quite another effect of space from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This other-use , other-relation of space comes in by many unexpected ways . You are in ' Chicago ? a town of under three millions ? ten miles from its centre either way , and more . I do not mean only technically or legally within nominal city boundaries , but under the same conditions urban and of Chicago . Paris is much the same . London is more than double . But in twenty miles you traverse London from countryside to countryside , and Paris in far less . You carry an American town out with you indefinitely into the country . Space is less . And what is true of space spread out lengthways is also true , somewhat , of space up and down . American height seems less high . Height ( on the east coast at least , and in the middle-west ) receives , in my eyes , the same impress of reduction : why , I can not tell . Testimony to such influences is difficult to give : the modern world is warped by the idea that exact measurement is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space is not to the American what it is to us . Beauvais soars higher than the Woolworth Building , and the Palace of Avignon is bigger than the Brooklyn Bridge . This contrast in rhythm is a fundamental contrast and a permanent one . If it changes it will change only to increase . It affects the whole of life . It has all sorts of odd side effects which I perhaps exaggerate from the very fact of their strangeness , but which are certainly there . For instance , it affects the quality of repose . The European rhythm demands longer and more absolute repose ? perhaps I should say repose of a different kind . The European will say that the American city appalls him with its noise . It would be more subtle and nearer the truth to say with the quality of its noise . I have used the metaphorical word ' metallic ' of the New World ; it applies here . There is a difference between noise metallic and non-metallic , and there is no doubt whatever that the former is distressing to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first kind of man is typical of our side of the sea and the second of the other side . But this does not mean that mere repose is more necessary to the European than to the American . It is a matter of quality , not of degree . There are forms of repose less necessary to us , more necessary to them . Here I am in deeper water , for one can talk of one 's self with security , of a foreigner one must talk with hesitation ; but it seems to me that the ' short ' rhythm connotes repeated repose . If a man is disturbed by a long and complicated process of thought , and craves rather for lucidity and brevity , this , indeed , connotes a form of high activity , but it also connotes a special form of fatigue at the end of it . Of this difference in rhythm I will give an instance that comes home to all travelers across the Atlantic . Five men , illustrating in conversation some point between them , will in America develop five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . The pattern is one of five units spread over a certain short space of time , with silence for the listeners , no interruption , and an end of the affair after a few such interchanges of fixed and exactly limited expressions of thought . The same point , debated with us over a much longer space of time , uses a much larger number of units , exceeds such limits , is filled with adventitious allusion ; and this contrast I take to be a function of the contrast in rhythms of which I have spoken . For in the case of the European man , whose habit is one of lengthy concentration and correspondingly lengthy repose , the many aspects of a thing can be presented in many short statements , subject to interruption which does not mar the whole . Whereas the American man , whose concentration is intense but brief , will give all that he has to say , give it in a very limited field , but that field fully covered . And I feel no oddity in the apparent paradox that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser vocabulary , a longer unit of expression ; the longer European rhythm more inflection , shorter indi ideal speeches , and the irruption of side aspects . The one seems to be a consequence of the other , for the European manner defers repose , the American secures it at more frequent intervals and ends the whole effort sooner . When I hear a European saying that the Americans ' make speeches ' at him , or an American that the European talks in snatches and leaves the point , ' I think I understand them both , and that the mutual accusation is due to a misunderstanding parallel to the misunderstanding which the general contrast creates in every other activity . If we admit the contrast , expect it , make it our first postulate in analyzing this very distant world , we shall less misjudge ; if we ignore it we shall have what are called ' rude awakenings.
