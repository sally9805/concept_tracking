Democratic Governor Jonathan M. Davis of Kansas ( now retired-see Page 6 ) , through the State Board of Administration , ousted Dr. Ernest Hiram Lindley , Chancellor of the University of Kansas , on Dec. 27 . A verbal civil war followed . <P> Governor Davis charged the Chancellor with " incompetency , insubordination , procrastination , political activity and aloofness from the people and the student body . " He averred that the learned Doctor had spent more money than the University statutes permitted and that it had been necessary to discharge him " in order to demonstrate that the state ran the University and not the University the state . " <P> Chancellor Lindley , who successfully applied for a temporary injunction ( later quashed by the state Supreme Court ) to restrain the Governor , countercharged that he had been obliged to fight the Governor for most of the latter 's two-year term by resisting his attempts to foist upon the University his political friends at the expense of tried and faithful servants . <P> The fact that the Chancellor is a Republican , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. M. of Indiana University , Ph.D . of Clark University , LL.D . of Indiana University and State University of Iowa , sometime student at Jena , Heidelberg , Leipzig , Harvard , President of Idaho University before he went to Kansas University in 1920-focuses upon him the agitated attention of the usually peaceful town of Lawrence where the University is situated <P> A handful of students remaining in Lawrence for the vacation paraded the streets as a protest against the eviction of their Chancellor , indignantly repudiated the charge of aloofness , declaring themselves to be the best judges . Many irate Republicans wrote letters of protest to the Administration ; many a staunch Democrat backed the Governor against his agitated enemies . It was , however , bruited about that the new Governor , Ben S. Paulen , Republican to the core , would reinstate the Chancellor . Public opinion became calmer .
