txt The New York Stock Exchange has inaugurated a campaign to " fight the abuse and lies which , daily are hurled at us , " Seymour L. Cromwell , president of that institution , declared before the Clearing House Section of the American Bankers ' Association convention here yesterday . The convention proper does not start until today , when the first general session will be held on Young 's Million-Dollar bier . The principal speakers at this session will be Charles E. Mitchell , president of the National City Bank ; J. H. Puelicher , who will deliver his presidential address ; M. A. Traylor , president of the First Trust &; Savings Bank of Chicago and Stephen I. Miller , Jr. , National Educational Director of the American Institute of Banking . " We are tired of the abuse and lies concocted to make the public believe that the Stock Exchange is composed largely of a ' bucket shop ' membership , " asserted Mr. Cromwell . " Hereafter we intend to fight . We intend that every item of information in our possession which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , concerning their records , and their objects , shall be given to the public . If an offite holder stops long enough at the Grand Central Terminal in New York City to call up the president of the Exchange and tell him that he wants a certain thing done for sonic one , contrary to the rules of the Exchange , and that he wants an answer in 15 minutes because his train leaves for Albany , where he is going to look into the bill aimed at the Stock Exchange , ' we shall consider that threat an item of news and will glive the gentleman 's name and his threat to the newspapers . WARNS CERTAIN robrricrAss " The Stock Exchange will continue to fight bucket shops ant ' it will fight those affiliated with bucket shops who seek to make money out of the power given them by their political connections . Do not think I am attacking political parties or the great body of public men who are giving their time and earnest effort to the work of the government . The state of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in its other public of ? fices men equally impeccable . It is not political parties ? with which I quarrel , but political pirates and those hangers-on of politics who are mixed up with politics and interfere with law enforcement . " Public officials should know that crooks take on the protective coloration of respectable business men , hut ' in. stead of realizing this fact and realizing that crooks are creaks and merely the barnacles of decent business , decent business is attacked in the pulpits , in the magazines , in the public print . " Part of the trouble today is the indifference of the average citizen to political matters . He takes little interest in the election or selection of . his lawmakers or of his public officials . He idoes not follow their records in office and , if he votes at all , he votes negligently and with his eyes shut . In time , he will compel the sworn officers of the law to enforce the laws regularly and impartially . " The Stock Exchange is an ally of law enforcement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Stock Ex ' change has been called upon or even permitted to cooperate with law enforcement officers . In the thirty-year-old fight which the Stock Exchange waged against the bucket shops its chief obstacles have been the inertness and lack of cooperation of many public officials . The Stock Exchange destroyed through its own efforts the old ' clean chest ' bucket shops and it is bending all its energy toward ending the operations of the new type of swindle , This new bucket shop is a more sinister affair than the old . not only because it steals the people 's money ass-it was stolen in the old days , but because , in most cases , it has an underground backing of tremendous influence and weight , because it is Supported by men whose position in the community has the appearance of being free from any taint or connection with such vicious operations . " Legislation which has been proposed in recent years has been aimed not at the bucket shops or stock swindlers , but for the most part at the New ' York Stock Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been applauded by crooks and swindlers ; that the endorsers of this legislation aimed against the security of the Exchange have been men known to be engaged in bucketing business , amply justifies the suspicion with which this legislation must he regarded . " The Stock Exchange has opposed certain proposals for legislative regulation of stock trading , because such regulation would have destroyed the autonomy of the Exchange , opened its doors to the dishonest , paralyzed its Aiscipline. and unloaded a horde of politicians and potential criminals upon It . " Among the proposals of those who would regulate the New York Stock Exchange through political bureaus were licensing of brokers , examination of books , restrictions of the use of securities by firms in the matter of loans , and regulation of the issue and sale of securities . " Licensing will not eliminate the fraudulent or unscrupulous dealer in securities , but . on the other hand , it will aid the swindler . He can swindle the public more readily if he is operating in virtue of a state license , which to the undiscriminating public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of the securities offered . You can not prevent crooks or prospective crooks from obtaining a license . A ' political body issuing licenses will naturally take political references first . and general references second . " When the Stock Exchange cut off its quotations from Messrs . Hughes and Pier , a bucket shop , men of the highest political , financial and social standing wrote letters to the Exchange urging that the wires be restored ; there were personal interviews , telephones Emil every kind of pressure and solicitation from men whose names and records ' meant much in the community . The Exchange denied these demands . Would a political license bureau have done as much ? If you have been following the New York newspapers during the past few months , you may have noted the queer mixup between politicians and bucket shops . Would you give to these gentlemen ? the angels behind the bucket shops  --  the power to grant licenses to brokers ? Would you permit them to force the New York Stock Exchange to admit to its morbership men known to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
