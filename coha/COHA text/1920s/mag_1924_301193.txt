A Boy of Flanders . Poor Jackie Coogan ! If he does n't look out this little millionaire will degenerate into America 's smallest ham . Those who are now guiding his destinies are already filling him up with stagy tricks , turning him into the poor little rich boy . In his latest picture , made from Ouida 's classic , A Dog of Flanders , Jackie does just what you might expect a small-time vaudevillian to do under given circumstances . There are many points of wistful appeal in the tale of the little Dutch orphan , persecuted by the narrow village as a tiny vagabond , who wins a prize and recognition with his drawing just as the snow mounts higher and higher around his ragged clothes . He shows his amazingly facile versatility by running through all emotions , by doing a clog dance and even by doing a Julian Eltinge in girl 's clothes . But his inimitable naturalness and naivete are being crowded out by stereotyped gestures and muggings , such as no small ' boy does except at an amateur entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too big for infant roles , and too pocket-size for adult parts . Booth Tarkington should come to his rescue . <P> Nellie , the Beautiful Cloak Model . The producers have supplied in Claire Windsor a girl whose looks fit the title rle of Owen Davis 's stage thriller of 15 years ago . In other ways they have built up the veracity of the play , so that the old melodrama , with its numerous , complicated and quite mechanical thrills , becomes good fun . In the final shot the producers make it plain that this is playacting , after all . <P> The Enchanted Cottage . Sir Arthur Wing Pinero 's play has achieved more Barriesque success on the screen than it did on the stage , due to the discriminating direction of John S. Robertson , who is an old hand at his Barrie . And Richard Barthelmess returns to that enchantmemt for the public which he had in Tol'able David . <P> It is a tender , sympathetic fantasy of a shellshocked , misshapen War cripple , and a homely little governess , thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by looking through the rosy spectacles of love . May McAvoy is equally effective with Barthelmess in revealing beauty of the soul by other means than a mere change in makeup .
