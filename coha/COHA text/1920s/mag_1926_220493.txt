WINNOWED WISDOM - Stephen Leacock-Dodd , Mead ( $2 ) . <P> Economist Leacock of McGill University , whom they now blurb as " the Canadian Mark Twain , " is out with a most helpful compendium of suggestions and brief information for deepening and broadening life . He has written " The Outlines of Everything " from Shakespeare to Science , including the assurance that : " Darwin returned to Europe and wrote a book called Sartor Resartus which definitely established the descent of mankind from the avoirdupois apes , " and a careful account of how Shakesbur ( or Shaksper , Shicksper , Shagsber , or S. ) wrote Henry V with assistance from Ben Jonson , Massinger , Marlowe and a little help from Fletcher . There is a section of international documents , summing up other people 's prophecies about the next war , the oscillations of the French cabinet , weekly cable news , and tourists ' conversation upon reaching home . <P> Many an old proverb is made over , thus : " It is a very silly boy who is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the super-rich are assuaged , with instructions for amusing the butler in the evenings , getting the chauffeur 's collars starched , and so on . And the author modestly relates " How My Wife and I Built Our Home for $4.90 " after the approved manner of the American Magazine . Ladies ' culture and gents ' luncheon clubs , of which Mr. Leacock addresses a great many , will find a few genial descriptions of themselves , which may or may not move them to agree with the blurb . But if no one agrees , the author need not repine . He is most amusing most of the time and if one can not be another Mark Twain it is something , after all , to be a Stephen Leacock . <P> The Significance of this brain-scattered little book is that it may be Stephen Leacock 's last humorous publication . His wife died lately and he has been dedicating most of his time and energy to driving from the face of the earth the disease that killed her , cancer ( TIME , Feb. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " discover America " as he did England ( My Discovery of England , 1922 ) , and it would indeed be surprising if circumstances could permanently stifle the prolific originality that has spurted from his pen for 16 years , and that has lately been applied , with superb detachment , to such a grim end . <P> The Author . In 1876 Master Stephen Butler Leacock , aged seven , of Swanmoor , Hants , England , decided to accompany his parents to a farm in Ontario . He attended Canadian colleges and taught in one of them until 1899 , when he sickened of " the most dreary , the most thankless , and the worst paid profession in the world . " He pursued economics and political science in Chicago , taking his Ph . D. in 1903 . McGill University has employed him ever since . You sometimes see him in this country-a stocky , gruff , mop-headed little figure sitting in the quiet corner of a hotel dining room , or booming greetings and blocking the sidewalk with a well-met friend .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
