txt BETTER CHANCES OF LIFE . To the Editor of The New York Times : The statistics relating to the claim by Mr. Savage of the Broad Street Hospital , published in THE naval of Sunday , July 31 , that the leaders of today live longer than those in the ancient Greek and Roman times , seem to be no fair basis for comparison , The reason for this is obvious when we take Into consideration the tact that n great number of the ancient leaders , such t is these included in his list , died violent deaths . For example , Caesar , Nero and Archimedes could have lived longer if it were not for the vieissitudes of those days , RENATO CRIS ! . New York , Aug. 5 , 11 ) 21 MOUNTAIN CLIMBINB QUESTIONS . To the Editor of The New York Times : The numerous items concerning mountains , which have appeared In various papers recently , have in so many eases contained misstatements that , as a climber , I am tempted to offer a few remarks . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun , but in the shade such a reading , or anything approaching it , is quite impossible , as every experienced climber will know . Contrary to the impression which your article of July 27 gives , the hotter and drier the Summer season is , the better and safer is it from a climber 's point of view ; rock faces and ridges are then free from coverings of snow and ice , and many exceptionally difficult routes can be made which are not usually possible . Cornices and snow bridges are never Pander any circumstances entirely safe ; the former are avoided altogether , and the latter are carefully tested by every . party before it essays to cross . Referring to your article of July 2P , and Your interesting editorial article of the 30th , entitled " The Weisshorn at Sixty-five , " Major P. B. Lindsell , who is a ? expert climber and a fellow-member of the Alpine Club ( London ) , may be the oldest man who has ascended this particular peak , when he did so , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as I know from personal experience last Summer  --  this by no means constitutes an unusual record . For instance , the late E. A. Broome , a former Vice President of the Alpine Club , who died in Zermatt in August , 1920 , as late as 1919. at the age of 74 , made the traverse of the Grands Charmoz at Chamonix , which is an expedition fully as long , and technically more difficult , than the ascent of the Veisshorn . Several years previously . at the age of 65 , Mr. Broome traversed Monte Rosa Nordend from Macugnaga to Zermatt , which is one of the great super-expeditions of the Alps , and in 1912 , aged 07 , he ascended numerous of the most difficult Dolomite peaks . ( For reference , see Alpine Journal , Volume 33 , No. 222 . ) It also occurs to me that the famous old guide , Christian Almer , ascended the Wetterhorn with his wife in celebration of their golden wedding anniversary in 181 ) 0 , when he was over 70 years of age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing on or near the summit of Mont Blanc , certain papers stated that " the summit is only a jagged piece of rock . " This is quite'wreng , as 1 know from having been there In 1010 ; the summit is a large undnlating snow plateau several hundred yards in circumference . No rocks are to be found within several hundred feet of the top . The early accounts of the lamentable accident in the Canadian Rockies , In which Dr. Stone , an experienced climber and member of the American Alpine Club , lost his life , were most weird and wonderful stories , which could only be concocted by the vivid imagination of some one who knows little or nothing about mountains . To pick on just one flagrant error . 1 single out " crevices , " of which much has been written in connection with this accident , and into one of which the aviator Duro four was said to have nearly fallen , after baiting off from Mont Blanc . Now , a " crevice " is only found on rocks , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , sufficient for hand or foot hold only ; anytilling larger would be called tt much , or perhaps a chimney . and after that would come a couloir or gully . Therefore , neither man nor airplane can fall into a " ? reviee . " On the other hand , a " crevasse " is something quite different , and is found only on glaciers or nave slopes , and Is caused by the glacier ice splitting as It moves slowly forward over an uneven bed . These crevasses are somAimes bridged and more or less concealed by a covering of snow when above the snow line , but are ( mite open and apparent on the dry glacier below the snow line . Crevasses vary In size from small cracks just formed to huge taverns many feet across , perhaps a hundred or more feet deep , and sometimes extending across the glacier for hundreds of yards ; it is easily possible , in fact quite probable , that an airplane , attempting to land on a snow-covered glacier , would encounter this source of danas V. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERMANY 'S NEW DIPLOMATS . To the Editor of The New York Times : With reference to a note published in your issue of June 5 regarding the new German Foreign Minister , Dr. Friedrich Rosen , In which you say that he was the Kaiser 's chief instrument in Morocco in 1006 and that " the type of diplomacy there exhibited is hardly the sort of thing that will make friends for the German Republic , " permit me to say that unfortunately your rema  --  lc is hut too correct . The men and the spirit controlling the Foreign Office of Germany today have hardly changed as compared with the times of the monarchy . It is probably true that at the moment of the overthrow of the Kaiser 's Government there were no trained men of democratic type to take the place of those Junkers , agrarians , noblemen , counts , barons and other satellites sf the monarchy who , during the Kaiser 's regime , practically monopolized the Foreign Office , and it was but natural that a considerable time should elapse before a new generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that important branch of government . Now , however , the psychological moment has arrived when it is of utmost Importance that the German people should carefully consider the question as to who is to represent them in other countries . In particular , the German people should realize that the United States will insist on a new type Of representative in the diplomatic and consular service of her former enemies . No lorger should there be any possibility of havirg to receive men here like Count von Bernstorff with his famous military attache 's , Messrs . Boy-Ed and von Papen , and their host of spies , secret service men and propagandists . The best representatives Germany could send to this hemisphere today , and who would greatly contribute toward re-establishing mutual friendly relations , would he sincere democrats , true representatives of the German people , men of her academic , industrial or cultural professionS , particularly men with an international outlook , gained through the study and Intimate knowledge of the psychology and the ideals of those nations with whom Germany wishes to resume friendly relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1021 . GERMAN CENSOR AT WORK . To the Editor of The Nets York . Times : Bore IS an interesting instance of German censorship . In 1015 the Dent &; publishing house of Bruges was issuing the fourth volume of " ** Orations , " of which the proof had to be submitted to German censure . In his sermon to the Carmelites in 1661 13ossuet.said as follows : " This noble idea of power Is very different from that in the minds of the powerful in the world . For as it is natural for man to be more sensitive to evil than to good , so the great ones imagine that their power is more manifest by ruins than by benefits . Hence wars , carnage , great enterprises of these voyageurs of provinces by conquerors .

To the Editor of The New York Times : The Republicans are going to be sadly disappointed at the attitude of the Democrats and independent followers of the Wilsonian policies , in connection with the disarmament conference sponsored by Mr. Harding . Their disappointment will be due to their having expected all persons having Democratic sympathies to support only policies brought forward by their party chiefs  --  especially when peeve is the object in view . This is far from being the stand taken by Mr. Wilson 's followers . A great majority of the voters who expressed preference for his program will be found enthusiastically seconding any action which Mr. Hardllg " and the Senate " may take with a view to concerting world peace , disarmament or limitation of armaments , They are tired of seeing opposition to these matters made by hai ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm work will demonstrate their sincerity on this greatest issue of the day . Mr. Lodge and his followers have repeatedly decried the sincerity of their opponents , but they have not made out a good case along those lines , although they were quite successful In clouding the real issue during the last election . Those Democrats upholding the stand of the nation 's Chief Magistrate on disarmament will not , of coarse , be oblivious of the tact that he has ( Recovered no new doctrine , nor will acceptance of his plans imply even tacitly an admission that Mr. Wilson was on the wrong road . On the contrary , while feeling that Mr. Wilson 's ideas on the subject were much more advanced and very much more time and thought had been devoted to the formulation of these plans , involving less possible ill-feeling among the nations participating in the deliberations , they want to see disarmament or limitation of armaments a. reality , even if they must travel the road cautiously and auspiciously , as the Republican majority prefers to do . Certain tactics allow plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to develop . Nothing would suit them quite so well . They have a majority . and can put their wisnes into execution , and this would give them what they desire ? an opportunity to scoff at Mr. Wilson and bury the League of Nations " again . " Unfortunately for them , however , the nation is not in the least confused concerning this matter , end knows that Mr. Wilson , although tine his to carry out the very excellent program for world peace which he helped to create , will have to wait and see it put Into effect a little at a time and by his bitterest enemies . Mr. Wilson Is a bigger man than his enemies . He will be glad to see peace , no matter who wants the glory . And then , whether the party in power wills it or no , there is the Versailles Treaty , under which vigorous steps have already been taken to preserve the peace of Europe and ( Marin Germany , which . although beaten , would constitute a greater menace to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Italy and Japan together , Bat the United States must begin some time to take Part in ridding the world of useless and impossible burdens , and Mr. Harding 's plan is as good as any other just note .
