He promulgated a Constitution imperishable for all ages , and consolidated a system of government unparalleled in the world . <P> " Our Imperial father had always near his heart a reign of right and justice , and made it his constant aim to follow and brighten the path laid by his predecessor . . . . He has now passed away amidst our unbounded grief and sorrow . . . . Mournful and heavyhearted , we have now succeeded , to the Imperial line . With our limited gifts , we are mindful of the difficulty of proving ourselves equal to the great task devolved upon us . . . . <P> " Simplicity instead of vain display ; originality instead of blind imitation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up with advancing civilization ; national harmony in purpose and action ; beneficence to all classes of people and friendship to all the nations of the earth : these are cardinal aims to which our profoundest abiding solicitude is directed .
