txt Federal Judge A. N. Hand yesterday denied the ' applications for separate trials of seven of the twenty-three persons indicted with Charles W. Morse on charges of using ' the mails to defraud investors in the stock of the . United States Steamship Company . He decided that all of the defendants must face a jury at the same time . The seven who objected to being tried with Morse are William A. Barber and Stuart G. Gibhoney , lawyers ; Martin J. Gillen , formerly an employe of the United States Shipping Board ; George M. Burditt , William H. Dennis , Maurice M. O. Purdy and G. E. Wells . The seven defendants had filed pleas in abatement and demurrers which were argued on May 19 and deciiion is stilt withheld . These pleas , it was understood , would be dropped it the Court granted the seven a trial apart from Morse . During the arguments for separate trials it was asserted that con'siderable local prejudice against Morse existed , which would prevent those tried with him from obtaining justice . Judge Hand practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together , would have to - stand together the issue of a joint trial . He said he saw no basis for a severance of the defendants and that if the application was granted , all of the other defendants might make similar applications . Discussing the case of Barber and Gibboney , the two lawyers , the opinion states that they are still partners in the practice of law , and cites a letter sent by Barber to Henry Evans , in which is indicated certain acts which the United States Steamship Company intended to perform with the result that the value of its capital stock would be greatly increased . The Court also refers to a letter sent by the same defendant to the American Appraisal Company . " The Government has a right to show , " reads the opinion , " that these two statement do not agree with the facts . I think the Government has a right to connect them if it can , and if it does , they will put the defendant in a position of a party making direct representations .

" Concerning the case of Gillen , who is also charged with making inaccurate representations of the value of the stock which was offered to the public , the opinion states : " The overt act alleged against him is apparently innocent in itself and may have been performed wholly in the course of official duty . The point is that it was a direct representation as to value , and the Government will doubtless seek to show by evidence that it was a designed means of effectuating the conspiracy . " : .

Wells . according to the opinion , is accused of having filed an affidavit to the effect that Morse told him in , December , 1920 , that a letter had been sent to the stockholders bearing Wells 's name . The opinion says of this : " It was a letter urging stockholders of the United States Steamship Company to purchase stock of the corporation : states that the purpose of the late company is to acquire shipbuilding and ships , operating corporations and interests in oil properties in Central America and Mexico . This letter was signed by Wells . " All of the defendants , are charged generally with aiding the alleged conspiracy . If the Court grants the pleas in abatement the validity of the indictment will be tested before the charges of crime are tried .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
