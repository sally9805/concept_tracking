Terseness has been Calvin Coolidge 's contribution to modern political speech in the U. S. Studious , abstract prolixity has been Herbert Hoover 's . Plainness , homeliness , informality , which some called " cheapness " and others " humor , " what some called " smart " and others " clever , " what none denied had drive and excitement characterized the campaign utterances of Alfred Emanuel Smith . <P> Last week , having elaborated governmental issues as far as he thought was desired by the people he expected to vote for him , Governor Smith conducted a " cleanup " campaign of undisguised political debating . The speeches were more memorable for fragments than in full . Excerpts that will be remembered as typical Smithisms : <P> At Baltimore <P> " What gets most on my nerves is the hollow mockery of it , to raise between heaven and earth , the emblem of Christianity , as a defiance to a fellow citizen , the Executive of a great State . As far as I am concerned , I would sooner go down to ignominious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had to have-if to accomplish it I had to have the support of any group the Klan with such perverted ideas about Americanism . " <P> At Newark <P> " Why is it that Governor Hughes is not running for President ? Why did n't he take that nomination ? He is doing more work to elect the Republican President than the nominee himself . " <P> ( After repeating his Water Power stand ) " Now , I have made that perfectly clear . . . . I ask Mr. Hughes to ask his candidate the same question that he asked me . " <P> " Talking about fooling the people-let 's devote just a few minutes to this question of prohibition . . . . I know perfectly well that the President of the United States can not amend the Constitution . Mr. Hughes does not have to tell me that . I know that , and what is more , I know that he knows that I know it . " <P> " He Mr. Hughes himself was responsible for the statement made before the Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics . At the same time he says that you can not take the tariff out of politics . Now , if both statements are right , let him leave that to me . I am the man . " <P> " The Republican candidate takes the credit for everything that has happened in this country that is any good to anybody . . . . Why , he even spoke about the increased number of children in the public schools . The Republican Party was not responsible for that . Thanks be to God , everybody had a hand in doing that . In my time I did my share . " <P> " I believe that it is an insult , a coldblooded insult . . . . It is a foolish attempt to get the American workingman to believe that the Democratic Party under my leadership is going to prostrate him , drive his children out of his house and leave him helpless and homeless . What a stupid performance-of all the men in the world to urge that against a man who came up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to drive them all out of their home ! " <P> " Well , I am not a new hand in executive positions . Unlike my opponent , this is not the first time I ran for public office . "
