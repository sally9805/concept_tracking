The press was filled with reports that a pair of " Siamese twins " , born in Brooklyn , had been cut asunder so successfully that , though one died , the other would live to be a healthy man . Both infants were alleged to be perfectly formed , save that the deceased one had , instead of a right leg , a shapeless growth connecting him to the abdomen of his brother . Surgeons were said to have " hurried from all parts of the country " to see the " unprecedented result " of Dr. Philip Mininberg 's plastic surgery . <P> Surgeons and doctors who did not hurry to Brooklyn said the same sort of thing occurs frequently in every maternity hospital .
