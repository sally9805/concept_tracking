SHANTY IRISH-Jim Tully-A &; C Boni ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> " There was niver any fun in Ireland , me lad-it was always a wailin ' and a weepin ' country . Hearts full of the great sadness and stomicks empty of food-fools prayin ' to God , and starvin ' on their knays . Ireland at its bist was a hard country-we lived wit the pigs and the geese-we petted thim an ' thin we ate thim . " Grandfather Tully lived through the Great Famine " a-suckin ' the wind and drinkin ' the rain on the bogs , ' ' then migrated to Ohio there to continue his ditching , peddling , champion drinking , yarn-swapping . Whether he was better off in Ohio , who can say-his son 's possessions were " a wife , six children , two cows , one hog , a blind mare , and a sense of sad humor " ; his grandson 's a keen Irish sense of pathos , a true Irish gift of gab . <P> Grandson Jim makes good telling of his drab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Shanty Irish he attains not the strange lure of roving Beggars of Life ( recently effectively distorted for the cinema ; see TIME . Oct. 8 ) , but projects instead that charming Gaelic shiftlessness which composes , cheek by jowl with uninspired Teutonic steadiness , the U. S. formula .
