I N ERNST TOLLER 'S plays there is one conspicuous flaw , and this has nothing to do with the feeling that animates them ; the plays have body , they have social passion , they are timely ; but there is in almost all of them too great a strictness in the manipulation of the theme . And it is this , I believe , that gives them the effect of a lack of range . The plays do not merely put certain significant questions , questions which intimately concern every one of us to-day , but they set out to answer them , and chiefly in one way . Plays that overstep the bounds of common theatrical usage by indulging this uncomfortable tendency , in addition to the other dramatic elements they may disengage , thus acquire a new thrill , un eff et de plus . This tendency is of course not an innovation with us , with our age or this generation . Ibsen and Dumas recognized the full value of the play that torments , not only the unanswering sphynx , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Life-is-a-Dream type of drama antedates both Dumas and Ibsen . Northern peoples , it seems , are prepared in advance to succumb to this sort of entertainment ; northern writers easily adopt the Faust idea and so tend to make their plays a carry-all for philosophic speculation . Even Mr O'Neill has of late laboured with gargantuan ideas and recipes , and he has , in at least one instance , spoiled a good idea by hitching his dramatic chattels to a dubious nostrum . Ernst Toiler has made the same mistake ; but Mr O'Neill , trying a loftier flight , has suffered a more resounding crash . It is easy to see that in Lazarus Laughed , for example , the dramatist was not satisfied with putting questions ; he wanted , also , to answer them , and his answers are either quackery or of an appalling naivete . The panacea for the gouts and rheumatisms and raddled stomachs of this world is , according to Mr O'Neill , laughter ; this is the new evangel . It is as if he were to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tears is only a passing relief .  | But unlike Mr O'Neill , whose charge of realism is more various , Ernst Toiler has up to the present given us a continuum of but a single play . He narrows himself to one disturbing question and is not abashed to represent himself in nearly every one of his plays as the one who asks it . While the protagonist is now querulous and now strong , he never loses his title of protagonist ; he is at bottom a fighter , a dissident , an active non-conformist . Sometimes he is a poet . Toiler is at his best , indeed , when he portrays the poet 's fine sensibilities at odds with the mechanical drift and coarseness of the modern world . If he were not so good a dramatist , the tendenz speeches of his minor characters , even granting their appositeness , would be unimaginably irksome ; but Toller is careful to restrain himself in this , as though he acknowledged his native weakness . He still over-points ; he has not yet learnt spareness and suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heinous as they used to be . Mr O'Neill surpasses him in this , and both Toiler and O'Neill , one imagines , would profit a good deal by studying the dialogue method of Mr Hemingway . Crispness , parsimony in the use of words , a sense of impendingness which life has for us at certain moments ? these are some of the qualities which when added to a grasp of form , confer upon a man a brevet in this art . Thus far Toiler 's plays have been loosely built , episodic ; but he compensates for this in a measure by his strength in bringing off individual scenes , into which he can pack the profoundest emotion without having recourse to maudlin tricks . There is a certain dignity about his plays ; and this is due , curiously enough , to their seeming lack of form . They do not , however , genuinely lack form , just as a memorable or immediately telling lyric by Shelley lacks form ; it is simply that we are so carried away by the effect that we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly of the plays of Toiler are precisely these lyric effects , these trenchant individual scenes that seem to be constructed without effort and make us forget the looseness of the rest of the piece . As in Hinkemann , in The Transformation , in certain scenes in Mass Man , he is at his happiest when he puts two people on the stage and lets them talk ? not as they talk in their daily give-andtake , but as they might conceivably talk before the Maker of their  | Consciences . His crowds are not so convincing as those of Hauptmann in The Weavers ; and it is not altogether unwarranted to assume that he was betrayed into them by Reinhardt who produced Mass Man , as he has recently been persuaded to use the cinematograph by Piscator , who has put on Hopla , Wir Leben , his latest play . The strictness of Toiler 's dramatic method is clearly visible in his four important plays : Masse Mensch , Die Maschinensturmer , Hinkemann , and Hopla , Wir Leben . In so far as the people motivated before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are just and uncoloured by the political bias of the author ; no one , of course , objects to the subtle presence of coloured lenses , concealed from the eyes of the spectator , in the air that surrounds his characters and the action : this also is dramatic , un effet de plus . It is another matter when the lenses , like the cinema machine in the production of Hopla , become obstreperously visible ; it is then that the true poet is buried under the social or theatrical reformer . It is all very well , then , to fling questions at fate , at life , at society ; but to try to answer them in a play is well-nigh fatal . The characters in a play should for ever abide the question and endure it heroically ; the more heroically they endure the question , borne down by its load of agony and doubt , borne down also by the tension of the impendingness of the solution which never arrives , the more dramatic the play tends to be . In the four plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanica of our lives . The hero may be a man or a crowd , but what is mainly objectified in the course of the action is something quite different ; it is , in a word , the hurt sensibilities of the poet . The effect is not less but more impressive when we perceive that the dramatist has invested his subsidiary characters ( so poignantly alive are they to him ! ) with this human magic of poetic sensibility . Instead of seeing life through their eyes ? the usual method of the realistic writer ? Toller by main force makes them participate in his own passion , his wayward unrest , his personal Calvary . On the plane of the emotions this technique operates without strain ; on the plane of ideas , however , the characters incline to the conventional . And especially is this true when the author bluntly turns himself into a mouthpiece for his  | own generation , as he has done , notably , in The Transformation and in Hopla . But in Hinkemann , dealing with a character which could by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to evade this jeremiad obsession of his own mind and gave us the finest tragedy of the post-war years . In several particulars Hopla bears a resemblance to Hinkemann ; but whereas a burly workman maimed by the war is the hero of the latter play , Toiler himself is beyond doubt the hero of Hopla . After eight years of withdrawal from the world , spent in prison and in an insane asylum , Karl Thomas returns to what we would call normal life and finds the world topsy-turvy , mad ; he is quite unable to cope with the radical changes that have taken place in modern life . And this is not due to a sense of sterility ; on the contrary , he teems with unspent impulses which have been kept pure in solitude , he aches to become an effective unit , a creative unit . The world , however , will have nothing of him ; he is unmechanized , unregimented , but the dominating values are barren , deaf and blind automata and they rule all life . In this baffling post-bellum vortex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to observe it , namely , that men , women , and children live on their raw nerves , over-stimulated , hard-driven but unaware of their maladive condition ; the atmosphere of the cities is honeycombed with self-satisfaction , the masses are drugged with palliatives , and the spirit of vigorous protest is dead . The impulses and senses of nearly all the people he meets are like the spasmodic ganglia of a dead frog , electrified in the laboratory ; they function as if they were quite sound ; they function , that is , in the direction of the next war . Above all else , it is destiny , you might say , that is totally invalided . Accordingly , he asks , who is the Schicksalmensch , the man of destiny , nowadays , in this alien new world ? It is the man who represents the nth degree of conscienceless automatism , mirroring complacently the automatism of the rest of the world . And this man of destiny , already among us in the role of political chief , is leading the whole caboodle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight years before the opening of the play Karl Thomas had been condemned to death for the part he played in the Munich revolution . His sentence was later commuted to imprisonment in a psychic ward . He is liberated one day as presumably normal .  | What does he find ? Socialists in the saddle everywhere , but with changed political doctrines ; they are now time-servers and chauvinists ; they have adapted themselves to the new conditions . The war has become a list of meaningless dates in the school books , to be memorized parrot-like . The German masses expecting messianic prizes , chiefly through universal suffrage . The new postwar woman , cigarette-smoking , indulging in passionless flirtation , trying everything once , even drugs . The flapper does not realize it yet , but she , too , he perceives , is being subtly mobilized for the next war . A former revolutionary comrade has become a republican cabinet minister . Karl Thomas plans to revenge himself on this cruel , devitalizing civilization by shooting the renegade Communist . Before he has a chance to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for contrary reasons . Karl is caught and sent to prison , where he hangs himself a few minutes before the order for his release comes . The real assassin has been apprehended in Switzerland . In Hopla there is a key scene between Karl Thomas and an upto-date psychiatrist ; it is extremely revealing of what happens to our inordinate faith in scientific techniques , or , to be exact , what happens to science when it is perfectly assured of our faith in whatever it does . The psychiatrist has a rough-and-ready nomenclature which he flashes at the least provocation . He dismisses Karl Thomas as the usual " saviour " type , neurotic , ill-adjusted , and probably virulent ; there is nothing for it but to clap him into a padded cell . Instinctively , Karl Thomas senses that the learned new-fangled " medicine man " is not a disinterested scientist , and that probably the disinterested scientist would find it just as hard to exist in this doomed , automatic world as he , Karl Thomas . For it is clear that in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrist takes his cue from the ruling code . Toiler does not imply that his code is being diabolically handed down by a secret cabal of caricature industrialists and international capitalists . He goes so far as to make allowance for the weak stomachs of the financiers and suggests that they too are victims of the compulsive automatism of contemporary life . In this play , as in his others , Toiler claims the right for men to revolt , but I do not think that he expects the entrenched powers to give ear to his doctrine . Manifestly , the entrenched powers  | would not for long retain themselves in the saddle if they grew suddenly tolerant . Toiler does not anticipate that the poet will be less lonely ; or the revolutionist less of a pariah in any of the forms proposed for modern society . His plays are not less dramatic because they challenge our smugness or ask embarrassing questions that can not be answered . If his doctrine were to be summed up it would be , I imagine , something like Thoreau 's . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of Walden in 1854 , " spoils my walks . My thoughts are murder to the state ; I endeavor in vain to observe nature ; my thoughts involuntarily go plotting against the state . I trust all just men will conspire. "  |
