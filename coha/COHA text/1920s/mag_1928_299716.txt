Quadrennially , on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November , the U. S. people perform what they call " electing a President . " That is the effect of their performance , but not the form . What they do formally is to elect an Electoral College , which casts the actual vote for a President and Vice President . This vote is cast on the second Monday in January . It is not counted and tabulated until the second Wednesday in February , more than three months after the result has passed into history . <P> Than the Electoral College there is no more paradoxical body . It never meets as a whole . Its members are not legally bound to carry out the voters ' will . Its members are not paid for their important services , and since their names are noticed or remembered by very few voters , they are scarcely honored .

Some Legislatures used to choose the electors themselves . Elsewhere the people elected them-a small group of known , trusted , respected men who were sent to the State capitals , where each man voted for two national candidates without indicating which candidate he wanted for President , which for Vice President . The election of 1800 was thrown into the House of Representatives because no candidate had a majority of electoral votes . Aaron Burr managed to delay the election of Thomas Jefferson to the Presidency , in the House , because , though it had been agreed that Burr was the Vice Presidential candidate , no distinction was provided for in the balloting .
