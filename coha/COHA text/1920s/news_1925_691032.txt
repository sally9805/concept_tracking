txt AN IMMIGRATION EMERGENCY . There is justice in the petition to the House Committee on Immigration that aliens granted passport visas to enter this country under the old Immigration law which expired last Summer , but who failed to come in before the new law went into effect , should now be admitted . When their visas were obtained  --  and paid for  --  they had no re , q9on to think that they would be excluded . They had made the sacrifice of " pulling up stakes " oin the old country and embarking on the great adventure . Most of them had sold what earthly goods they possessed , and often had borrowed from relatives . Many had got as far as the seaports of Europe after a long journey from the interior . Some had even reached Cuba . It is true that under the old immigration law the passport visa did not of itself either entitle the alien to entry or guarantee him admission . This defect in the old law has been remedied in the new . But the presumption is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been admitted to the United States within a comparatively short time after they bad obtained the visas . But the new law intervened to make drastic cuts in the quotas  --  especially in those of the countries of Central and Southern Europe , from which most of the ten thousand now seeking admission came . Italy 's quota , for example , was reduced 90 per cent . Russia 's quota was cut from 24,000 to 2,200 . A. clear moral obligation exists on the part of the Government of the United States to make an exception in the case of these detained aliens . A resolution that they be admitted has been introduced by Congressman PERLMANN of New York . If it is passed , the immigrants should be subjected to all the restrictions except the limitation as to number Which govetn the admission of aliens under the new law . In no circumstance should exemptions be granted in any cases which do not meet all the requiremen . s as to physical ' and other fitness . At the same tome care should be taken to see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passaga of the new law , and that it be not used as a , precedent for the **26;499;TOOLONG , a aliens over.anci ! above , the present Quota limitations . It is purely an emergency case with which Congress is asked to.deal.
