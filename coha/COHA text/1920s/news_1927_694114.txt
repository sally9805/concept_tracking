txt The naval conference at Geneva is about to resume its sessions and there is no denying that its prospects are affected by the popular feeling in both Great Britain and the United States , which in some quarters approaches the acrimonious . The attitude which the meeting has created in the minds of two great friendly peoples goes to show once more , in the opinion of observers . how far away from the spirit of internationalism are the nations today and how much they are still controlled by political nationalism and individual needs , individual fears and individual aspirations . Let us take the situation today when one faces the resumption of the naval conference under difficulties which would make its success a great tribute to the mutual wisdom and perhaps the mutual forebearance and diplomacy of the two countries whose interests really dominate the three-power negotiations . As seen here America is disposed both officially and unofficially to blame England if there is no agreement . America proposes to extend the 5-5-3 ratio to cruisers and in so doing to fix on a mean between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In England on the other hand there is the feeling that if the conference fails it will be America 's fault , because while Great Britain is quite willing to accept naval parity with America , England can not allow another nation to say what ships she needs for national defense , which in this instance comes down to protection of trade routes . British Stand Known . Certainly no one will deny at this stage that it would have been better to have prepared for the conference diplomatically . That is where Charles E. Hughes showed greater prescience than Secretary Kellogg . Had Washington sounded out London more completely before the conference met it would have found that the British intended to keep the cruisers they have and America would have seen that in the last analysis w could have cruiser equality with Britain only by building more cruisers . It would then have been plain that the most tine conference could accomplish would be to get Great Britain to stand still , or nearly so . while the United States caught up . It is true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department pointed out this British attitude , but notwithstanding this it appears that the American Government started the conference with the belief that the British would scale down their cruiser strength , although prior to the meeting Downing Street told all corners , journalists as well as diploma &; that it would not do so . Might not Americans in making their judgment on the situation bear in mind that other nations find it Impossible to escape the conclusion that the United States was actuated largely by the prestige factor , that It wants a fleet as big as Britain 's and that it is going to have it one way or another ? In this contention America has not been conspicuously successful in showing that we need as large a fleet as Britain has . Maybe America does , but we have not made the rest of the world see that a self-contained United States needs as many ships as an insular Britain dependent for her daily bread on continued marine transportation . Prestige as the Stake . Therefore the United States has opened itself to the accusation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among others , it has from time to time put forward , namely , that a nation 's armament should be measured by its real needs . It may not be that prestige plays so important a role with America as others think , but in figuring the international political results of the conference Americans would do well to bear in mind that at the present stage other nations think that prestige is our controlling motive . It is obvious that if armaments are to be based on the ability of a nation to support them the United States is not moving very rapidly toward any general armament limitation . Now let us say that the prestige factor also plays an important role in Great Britain 's position , as it certainly does with the Admiralty chiefs . Has not Britain made partially an answer when she says she is quite willing that America have the same .. ize cruiser fleet as she has , only she wants her navy rather than ours to be the measurement ? It may be true that Great Britain counts on our not launching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference , which had economy as one of its motives . But after all , that does not alter the theoretical strength of the British position that Britain alone knows best what Britain needs , and if America wants the same size fleet she has only to build it . While there may be some truth in the contention , it is , nevertheless , a weak contention that in this program Britain seeks to conserve naval supremacy . Indeed , so long as she has her great merchant fleet , so long as we have not a great merchant fleet , Britain will probably retain real naval supremacy regardless of what is put on paper at Geneva . Viewed As a Nationalistic Contest . This is not an effort to say that Great Britain is right and America wrong at Geneva . Not at all . But it should be pointed out that other nations whose interests are not necessarily prejudiced see Britain 's case as at least as good as ours at Geneva . They see the contest as nationalist and in such a contest they regard the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons evoked by Washington . And , generally speaking , while no one would deny to the United States the right to build up to Britain , or to outbuild her if we wish , other nations do not sympathize with the American attitude opposing Britain 's say as to what armament she needs . And this is easy to understand , for acceptance of that precedent would open the way for an international meeting which should tell Italy and France and Poland and other countries what armies they should have . Thus it may be understood that European sympathy is with Britain 's position . Frankly , Europe has never looked on the Geneva meeting as a disarmament meeting . European observers have seen in it nothing more than an effort by Great Britain and the United States to apportion their influence on the seas , meanwhile making sure that Japan stays in the proper relative position Europe sees it as a selfish nationalist confab , and therefore turns perhaps an unjustifiably cynical ear to all the words of altruism and good-will which emanate these days from the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean that Europe is right about it . But it does mean that if the meeting breaks up without an agreement Washington is not going to get far in international circles by putting the blame on Britain , any more than there will be any large sympathy for a wronged Britain if the British Admiralty does not get the agreement it likes . The reciprocal indignation will certainly be confined to the respective domestic spheres of the two countries . Perhaps that Is a cynical view of the situation . evertheless , it is Europe 's view . Indeed , outside the limited domain of the conference there would be no tears shed , no matter what disaster might come to it . And , therefore , observers here see restricted limits to America 's opportunity to present a picture of unrequited justice should the meeting called by President Coolidge not accomplish the purposes set forth for it to accomplish . If It succeeds , America will be regarded as having done a good job for itself . If it fails America will be regarded as not having done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
