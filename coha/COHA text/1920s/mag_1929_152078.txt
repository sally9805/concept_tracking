Like soldiers , like ramrods , members of the newly elected 100% Fascist Parliament stood at attention before King Vittorio Emanuele III in the Chamber of Deputies last week , waiting to take their oaths of office . Each deputy was resplendent in dress suit and white gloves . " Gentlemen ! " boomed Prime Minister Benito Mussolini , " His Majesty the King invites you to be seated ! " They sat . He read the oath of office . He began to call the roll . Like clockwork , as each name was barked , a white-gloved hand shot up in the Fascist salute , and the deputy in question shouted " Giuro ! " ( " I swear ! " ) . Straight down the roll to " M " read Il Duce , never moving a muscle until he came to his own name . " Mussolini ! " - his right hand shot up like all the rest . " Giuro ! " - he swore allegiance to king and country . Perched on the enormous throne sat tiny King Vittorio Emanuele , looking even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast crown . When he rose to deliver the " speech from the throne " - that is to say , Mussolini 's declaration of policy-the voice of His Majesty rang loud and clear . As everyone had expected , the speech urged upon the deputies as their supreme duty ratification of the enabling legislation for the treaty and concordat recognizing Pope Pius XI as a temporal sovereign ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . Apart from that , Vittorio Emanuele touched upon only one topic of general interest , disarmament . <P> " Noble enterprises in this direction have been attempted . " said the King . " My Government has already made clear what their viewpoint is . But disarmament has remained to this day merely a generous aspiration , contradicted by continuous arming on land , on sea , and in the air . <P> " This legislature will collaborate in the future , as previous legislatures have done in the past , to secure the application of all measures suggested by my Government to render our armed forces ever more efficient .
