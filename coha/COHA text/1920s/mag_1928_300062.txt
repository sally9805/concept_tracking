Last year , A. T. &; T. viewed its experiment in trans-Atlantic telephones with misgivings . Few businessmen , tourists , picked up receivers and said " London , please , " or " New York , please . " Costly , difficult , the New York-London service seemed about to fail . <P> But last week , A. T. &; T. came to the end of its misgivings , announced it would not only continue the two present long wave circuits-but would open additional short-wave circuits from transmitting stations to be built near Trenton , N. J. Calls in the first eight months of 1928 were three times the total of Jan. - Aug. , 1927 . The 12-hour service has been lengthened to 14 hours . Now connected with the trans-Atlantic circuit are Great Britain , Germany , Switzerland , Antwerp , Brussels , Berlin , Paris , Copenhagen , Oslo , Malmo , Stockholm and eight Mexican cities . The latest extension , completed last fortnight , carries the service to Guadalajara , Mexico . <P> ... <P> When you telephone from New York to Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overheard only by operators . But when you telephone Europe , your words may be caught by any enterprising amateur radiodict who chances to tune in on A. T. &; T. 's wave length . <P> Such an amateur did overhear , last week , part of a conversation between the " biggest " National City Bank and its Berlin agent . The conversation concerned another famed banking house , Brown Bros. , with which National City was linked in a German financing deal . From the eavesdropping amateur there came to Brown Bros , a transcript of the talk . Brown Bros , did not like the National City talk . Puzzled , Brown Bros , asked explanations . National City , astonished , gave them . Still friends , still associates , the two banks resolved upon more cautious , coded communications . <P> * The voice now crosses the Atlantic eastward by radio from Rocky Pt. , L. I. ( or Deal , N. J. ) ; is received at the radio station at Cupar , Scotland ; then goes by wire to London ; from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . Westward from Europe , the answering voice is sent by radio from Rugby , England ; received in Houlton , Maine ( or Netcong , N. J. ) , then goes by wire to Manhattan ; from there anywhere in the U. S. or Canada .
