" Names make news . " Last week the following names made the following news : <P> <P> J. Pierpont Morgan , a godly man as well as a wealthy one , offered to bear the expense of issuing a new Standard Book of Common Prayer , to be presented to the 49th Episcopal convention , next October , in Washington , D. C. The revised prayer manual will omit the word obey from the marriage ceremony and it will contain a shortened form of the ten commandments . In other respects , except for perfection of minute typographical failures as far as is now known , it will conform to the revised Episcopal prayer manual which Mr. Morgan 's father paid for in 1892 , and which is now used , in elaborate or humble edition , by all Episcopalians . <P> George Bernard Shaw , author , vegetarian , made a horrid mistake in grammar while instructing people in the use of correct English on his first gramophone record for the Linguaphone Institute in London . He allowed his voice to say : " If what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must be a horrid man , ' you may be quite sure that the speed is wrong . Slow it down until you feel you are listening to an amiable old gentleman of 71 with a rather pleasant Irish voice , then that is me . All other people whom you hear at other speeds are impostors , sham Shaws , phantoms who never existed . " <P> August Heckscher , 79 , zinc , steel and real estate potentate , philanthropist , is apt to die any minute now , thought Frieda Hempel , 42 , retired soprano . So she filed application with the Manhattan Supreme Court for an order to have Mr. Heckscher testify immediately concerning his alleged agreement to pay her $48,000 a year for the rest of her life . She claims that she gave up an income of $200,000 a year on the concert stage to help Mr. Heckscher in his philanthropic work . <P> Clarence Walker Barron , 72 , plump publisher of The Wall Street Journal , was sued for slander for $100,000 by Princess Margaret Ghika of Rumania , now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " a spy ... a very dangerous woman " at a dinner party at his home in Cohasset , Mass. , last August . <P> Julius Rosenwald , chairman of the board of Sears , Roebuck &; Co. of Chicago , was the object of Negro hallelujahs throughout the U. S. when the Negro Y. M. C. A. established in his honor an annual holiday called Julius Rosenwald Day . For Negro welfare , Mr. Rosenwald has given some $20,000,000 . <P> <P> The late Sir Mortimer B. Davis , <P> Canadian tobaccoman , left an estate valued between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000 . According to his will , the principal is not to be disturbed for 50 years , but the interest goes to his widow and son , Mortimer B. Davis Jr . ( husband of Dancer Rosie Dolly ) . After 50 years , if <P> Son Mortimer is dead , 75 per cent of the principal is to be used for the founding of a Mortimer B. Davis Hospital open to all races and sects but under Jewish management ; the remainder is for other Canadian philanthropies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
