BEFORE our college days Margaret brought me up along with the children . I have before me a picture of our oldest , among twenty-one other American boys and girls ? strains of fifteen nations and a dozen creeds and races in a Manhattan schoolroom . Indian , Negro , and Turkish offspring happen to be in the group ; likewise remnants of four ancient cultures : Hindu , Jewish , Christian , Moslem . For years these twenty-two American children have been moulded there . Their social growth has been so gradual that they are unaware of ever having been brought up . And , despite their vastly varied background , they have melted into a national type unknowingly . But I was aware ? though there was no tempest in the melting pot ? when that boy of mine was being brought up ; and more so , even , when I myself was . For I was of age when my social growth suddenly started . For twenty years I had been alone , a self-sufficient child and youth , hiding myself among mature men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never getting quite hatched , socially . I was mulish when others led me . For I was a leader ? not of others , but of myself . The warm contacts of childhood and adolescence I never knew . My years at child labor in Denmark were secluded , though not at all tedious . I was 2i3always capable of entertaining myself : by watching my fingers make and break things ; by letting my senses ? they-were animal in purity ? snatch whiffs of beauty out of mother earth ; by talking to myself . My years at sea I also lived alone : in the stokehold , fighting the fires ; in the forecastle , reading the Bible and a thousand novels ; on shore leave , sightseeing . I liked my own company immensely , and lived aloof . Yet I was not a snob or a sissy . In tropical gales I was sensuous , or when I watched the galloping paws of the engine . My mates had other tastes . Twice they joshed me ; and on these two occasions I was sociable ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made a wager ? and both times I won ? that I could drink any of them under the table . After the first spree ? that took place at a coal pier in Baltimore before I was seventeen ? I even leaped overboard for a swim . Baltimore beer was the first medium , and Jamaica rum the second . To be frank , I lost my dignity after the second spree by poking my head through too small a porthole ? ' to watch a shark , ' I told the stokers later ? and finding myself thoroughly trapped . The ' sociable ' ones of the crew did their best , hauling at my legs , before the Chief came to my rescue with chisel and hacksaw . MY AMERICAN WIFE My child life in the new world was dizzy with wonders ? a full and fast and friendless life . I learned to speak American , and I learned to earn a living . But no kin shared my hopes ; no friends could I confide in ; no homes sheltered me ; nobody recognized me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an isle of three million people . But I was not lonesome . I loved myself too well for that , though my point of view was not toward my own image ? that came later as one of the means of finding myself . I can not remember many Narcissus delights . But how I did love a chat with myself ! My tongue and eyes were my pals . They entertained me . I was so self-sufficient that my love of life even made me shun sleep . Sleep was clank death ; for I never dreamed . That also came later . I lay awake , purposely , far into the night , for the sublime joy of living an extra hour . In the dark I saw too much and too little . My eyes stroked the inner walls of their lids and sockets with various speeds and curves and pressures , etching a hieroglyphic shorthand ? my private history ? into the tissue . My tongue was like a revivalist , stretching a sleek body forward and recoiling ; stamping on the floor , and hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from platform to door ; leaping clear to the roof in ecstatic frenzy . It was a revival that lifted me out of languorous sleep and back to things my eyes etched into their lids and sockets ? almost as in my first bed in the room above the maker of wooden shoes . I dozed off to death when I kept those eyes of mine steady , and also when I opened the lids in the dark . For then the world vanished . My eyes could no longer ' feel . ' Where , then , was I ? Alone , a society of one , I climbed the tree of knowledge , straddling on itsbranches . At Cooper Union applied as well as pure science allured me . And art also . When I beheld an artist make dry-point etchings , my fingers itched to dig their own story into copper . My fingers also itched to revive dead dynamos , and likewise to juggle symbols of electrical theorem . Yet a prime problem always faced me ? to keep myself alive . I climbed alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in such a manner that neither I myself nor my neighbor objected . That is to say , willing to curb an eternal hunger spark within , so that it devoured neither my neighbor nor myself . I must cat or die ; I must love or die ? but socially . First , food became the medium between myself and society ; later , love . I spent all I earned , but no more . Here is my weekly budget : ? The remaining ninety-four cents I saved , until I could buy myself a six-dollar suit , a thirty-nine-cent shirt , a pair of heelless sneakers , and my first straw hat . I had always money to spare for a weekly beer and a solid free lunch , and sometimes even a nickel for church . I darned my own socks , soled my own shoes , cut my own hair , and did my own laundry . But , though I looked quite sociable , I was alone . Then I found Margaret . Never before had I known of such ideal companionship , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another world , the world of love . Men and women became new species . I myself MY AMERICAN WIFE did . Herd habits took root in my primitive heart and sprouted vigorously . They took me by surprise , first as a vague encroachment , then as a blurring fungus growth , on my sharply focused senses , then as a merging of my tongue and eyes with the rest of myself , and finally as a merging of myself with society . There was no longer a cleavage . I lost my tongue and eyes . My own private language is almost dead . The whole of me began to talk ? and not only to myself , but to others . I metamorphosed with blinding speed , so that momentum threw me beyond the line . Perhaps it oversocialized me . Compassion almost hurled me out on a tangent . I climbed down to the ground to live my love life . A desirable fall it was ? a fall to social comfort like that of all ancestral apes . On the ground the world was less branched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense . There I grew in a world of two , and later in a larger world of love , until my ego merged with the national ego . II She had learned to speak her native language well while she worked as housemaid at the age of fourteen . It was her cultured tongue that I loved first . Later , ? at college , ? as we romped through the fields and forests of Minnesota , I often marveled at her ease among learned professors . Even our ' Proxy , ' and his hospitable wife , on two memorable Christmas Eves , delighted in conversing with her . And she chummed with the wives of two cleans . How I admired these quiet , kind , cultured Americans ! But I also fell in love with her teeth , and with her tiny hands , and with her fleet foot . She still wins the picnic races . Children worshiped her at first sight . She was faunlike ? something of a Minnehaha in form and spirit . Her laughter had a rare , joyous quality . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The loss of the clearest of fathers , ' more even than the burden put on her young shoulders thereby , gave her an understanding heart , and made her eyes and voice soothing . She brightened the boarding house from basement to garret . And her charm lasted . When I began to earn my living here in the new world , I first lived among sailors in cheap rooming houses above the saloons near the Red Hook water front , where whispers about boys being shanghaied ' often reached my ear , and where my eyes beheld the stokers on incoming steamers being plundered by runners . Later I invaded the streets that skirted Columbia Heights , and shared a parlor with many a lodger , once with a child of a crowded Polish family . These were the castaway homes of wealthy Americans ? brownstone , parlor-and-basement houses with high frescoed ceilings , Baltimore heaters , and porcelain lavatories . In one of these I rented a garret from Margaret 's mother . And it was a garret worth describing in detail , for there I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm . A long table straddled across the trapdoor above the garret stairs . I had to crawl to get into my garret . At the rear gable two chimneys , warm and blushing , met at the roof ? just the nook for my parrots , which an old stoker mate had brought from Brazil . There they lived between the chimneys , climbing a heavy wire mesh which I nailed up in front , Adam praying Spanish and Eve swearing Danish , and both singing ' In the shade of the old chim-mi-ney . ' On the floor , on a burlap carpet , the two best books in the world ? my illustrated Bible and its mate , Webster 's unabridged dictionary ? leaned on each other . A pair of quaint rockers , clone in black and orange , stood at the ends of the table , which was covered with wool-embroidered burlap , upon which flickered a red candle , stuck into a benedictine bottle . On a collar beam above , and directly under a skylight , hung a brass chandelier , with two tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran two rows of prim queen-posts , yoked above by collar beams and steadied below by struts , and meeting the rafters halfway up the roof . Shelves with yards and yards of ownerless books filled the spaces between these queen-posts and formed the sides of my garret . Along the top of the shelves a white yacht raced a tarred two-masted schooner ; and an alabaster Apollo chased Daphne within my first baby shirt ; and the purple hose of a Turkish pipe embraced a copper jardiniere brimful of dry tobacco leaves ; and the broad shoulders of a jug of Guinea Red ' carried a spherical tumbler turned upside down . Stuck into a crack on one of the shelves was a blue-and-white porcelain shard ? perhaps a part of a broken platter ? depicting , if I remember right , two lovers fleeing in a boat on the river ; and over their heads two birds , stealing kisses on the wing ; and on an isle in the river a bower ; and on the mainland a Chinese mansion with a garret ; and between the isle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tilted a weeping willow , and over which ran two armed detectives and a pigtailed judge , reading a frightful law book . In the front gable of my garret was a round window into which the lone morning star smiled like the tear in an eye ; and under it a cot . Beyond , God was in his Heaven with the angels . I repeat , the first time I put eye on Margaret was in my garret . One afternoon I hurried home for my books . which I had forgotten in the morning and which I needed at Cooper ' Mien . The house was empty , but the trapdoor of my garret was open . She was on her knees , scrubbing , and also looking at pictures in my forty-pound Bible . Her hair was fastened up with the charm of a young girl who expects no callers . I stood on the garret stairs ? under the table ? with my head above the trapdoor . And I dared not . crawl up to her , for she had not heard me climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . She turned her face toward me and stared as though I had risen from the dead . I explained my errand . ' God ! ' she gasped . ' I thought it was Father . ' I did not know then that her father was dead , or that he had fallen off a roof clown upon an iron fence . He had been a roofer . Hurriedly I fetched my books and bowed myself down under the table and clown the garret. stairs . But after our first meeting my attic was complete in beauty . My heart throve in the joy of living there . On her sixteenth birthday her mother invited the roomers and boarders to the party . I remember a young rival there , who worked as draftsman in a stoncyard , sketching details for the subway . After that night I wanted to be a draftsman . He was the gamest of sports ; and he honored me , there in public , by having me check his sketches of a circular pitch of the Hudson Terminal Station . I did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only time I ever helped to build a subway . Other men at the party became my lifelong friends : a bricklayer with a glass eye , who then and almost ever after earned more a day than I a week ; a ruddy , bald-headed baker , who bubbled over with mirth , because he was slightly soused ; a pale , emaciated peddler of spiritual pamphlets , called the Prophet , ' who literally lived on cold baths , peanuts , and prayers ; an effeminate masseur with spats on his an Ides , a lavender hand on his hat , and a watch on his wrist . Margaret 's childhood friends were also there . I remember a bright high-school boy ? ' Doe ' they called him ? who drove an ice wagon after school hours and now is a noted physician . Never shall I forget a picnic where he blistered my tongue with a wild radish . At the party Margaret 's hand touched him to the quick as he stole a. kiss . ' Starfish , ' she called him , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . Roomers and boarders grouped themselves in a parlor nook to smoke cigars and sip coffee . But I mingled with young and old , for Margaret was everywhere . I played forfeit games and told puns , threw peanut shells and sang ragtime . I gazed through a coat sleeve while ' Doc ' poured water into it . ' Suit-fishing , ' he called the game . Blindfolded I knelt on the floor and swore allegiance to the flag while I bounced my fist , until a girl slid a pan of water under it . I tore half a sleeve off Margaret 's party dress while my teeth picked a match from her puckering lips . III Margaret was warned against the sailor in the garret , but the warnings fanned her girlish curiosity into flame . I met her but seldom alone , and could not declare my intentions in front of others . When I was away she tidied my garret . The air there was full of fragrance from her scrubbing brush , her sun-bleached linen sheets , her oil mop , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fetish . Only during my absence did she crawl into my garret . The ever-toiling widow , being the wise mother of a fair ( laughter , was not a little worried about males in general and sailors in particular . She and her God brought up the five children , for there was no mother 's pension in those clays . Margaret was twelve ? and the oldest ? when one clay the idyllic home was suddenly swept away . A slip of a foot ? a grasp at a rotten shingle ? a widow ? a rooming house ? a daughter ? and a foreign sailor , who had sailed sixty-seven thousand miles to find just this garret ! What years of sorrows and of joys ? because of a rotten shingle ! One night I met Margaret on the lower stairway . I struck a match and held it over our heads . She was holding a hand on her heart . I stepped back and remarked in a tone which assured her that she was no child : ' I would never hurt you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strange mist in her eyes . The match died out . ' You do look like Father , ' she gasped , and rushed by before I had time to propose marriage . I would take no chance waiting , though I earned only a dollar a day . On another occasion I fared better . She was taking off her wraps as I entered the hall . She tried to run , but decided to stay . I approached , bowing , and implied that I would be no more intrusive than she herself allowed , giving her time to regain her poise . But I stumbled on a carpet hole and my books flew out from under my arms . She chuckled while she helped me pick them up . Then we stood eyeing each other with tacit intimacy . You like books ? ' she asked . ' Yes , I like books . Will you marry me ? ' Her hand leaped to her thumping heart . I almost dodged . The motion reminded me of ' Doc ' at the party . Without answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning I wrote her a love note , which during the day crawled under the burlap tablecloth . I wrote her a daily love note ? short , suggestive epigrams , often quite clever , not always original . It was an unreciprocated correspondence , like my previous prayers at the Holy Rollers . But she read them ? for each day they were disarranged . Then late one night I entered the house in the pitch of night , fatigued by a hard day 's work in sweatshops and by my studies at school . My heart always beat fast when I climbed those stairs . A faint rustle , as of fingers stroking a papered wall , reached my ear . I held my breath and peered into the darkness , waiting halfway up the first flight until the rumble of an ' L ' train died . I resumed the climb , smiling at myself , when my hand , sliding up the balustrade , stopped . Tiny fingers stroked my hand and hopped away ; then , like a warm , pulsating swallow , a hand nestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And then it suddenly flew away into the darkness . There was no whir of wings , nor the slightest rustle . In vain my arms groped through space , touching thick , voluptuous darkness . But in my garret I found a red rose in a vase , above my hidden notes . On an early Sunday morning I hiked through Prospect Park , where robins hopped on the green lawns , and where fishes in the ponds somersaulted to peek at spring , and where sprouting trees sparkled with dew and looked like brides . I shied off from the beaten road and found myself drifting through a path that wound into untrimmed shrubbery , down along a tall mile-long iron fence , where I met Margaret . Hand in hand we swung open the gate of Greenwood and skipped into a lane under weeping willows , whose branches chirped with birds and drooped to whisk us close together . She stopped at a grave . Out of other graves tombstone , : rose like friendly apparitions , peeking through the shrubbery , whispering a love language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man than this ' : ' There is no fear in love . ' She glanced around . Sheltered in our first embrace from the eyes of the living , our lips met . Many secret cemetery trysts did we have on early Sabbath mornings , and also on summer evenings , when the garden of the dead was bathed in moonlight , and foliage , glittering in green tints , rose along with white tombstones like a sea . Deeper into Greenwood we went , finding more secluded nooks , stumbling over hidden fences , nestling close when the hoot. of an owl scared us . Under a statue we cuddled up on polished marble steps ? Thorwaldsen 's Christ , spreading out his arms of blessing . The summer breeze carried odors of new-cut clover , lilac bushes , succulent sod , into my nostrils . But nothing was sweeter than the scent of her body . Under the stars her eyes kindled with a limpid glow as my fingers stroked her hair and my lips dabbed her cheeks and browsed in the curves of her throat . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting the strokes , racing hand in hand down the lanes , tossing gravel at our shadows . IV The following year I entered the better American homes through the kitchen door . The boarding house barely fed the widow and her children . Her rent was high . Margaret became a sales clerk at Loeser 's . But she loved housework and especially cooking , and she hired out to a wealthy Flatbush family . I remember a lonesome couple , a banker and his wife , who were fond of joining our kitchen trysts . They discussed science with inc. while Margaret looked on amused , for she always thought they were teasing . They were skillful in arousing my interest ? annoyingly so . ' Prove it ! ' was their favorite demand . I was never sure whether Margaret was right or whether their learning was limited . Two facts of physics they viewed with profound skepticism : that the same iron weight varied in heaviness between the North Pole and the Equator , and that a chunk of coal weighed the same as did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circular slide rule which I had made myself from strips of celluloid and a piece of cardboard . I could not afford to buy one . The banker put the problem to me : ' What is twenty-five dollars at eight per cent compound in seventeen years ? ' In thirty seconds I had the answer . ' Jesus , ' was all he said . The two examined the slide rule in silence . Then they vanished into their own domain . Two hours later they returned , fanning their flushed faces with a dozen sheets of close computation . You 're thirteen cents shy ! ' they yelled in chorus . Margaret answered : ' He is worse than that . He is five and a fifth cents too high . ' At their instigation I won a five-dollar wager ? and purchased Margaret a ring with a diamond chip . I warned the lonesome couple , but they insisted . The great dispute concerned the shortest crawling distance between a hungry spider and a fat fly in a room , twelve by twelve by thirty feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one foot from the ceiling and six feet from the side walls , and the fly being at the opposite end , at a point one foot from the floor and six feet from the side walls . I said forty feet ; they said forty-two . Prove it ! ' they shouted . I did . First by mathematics , met with a filibustering , then by clipping a cracker box to scale and spreading it flat . The ring was too large for Margaret 's finger . The jeweler said : ' For why you should not spend seven-fifty ? The smaller the finger , the bigger the diamond , it should be . ' She lost it in a laundry tub . All day long , she tells me , her tears rolled from her cheeks down into purring soapsuds . Some day we shall buy another but with a pearl . She hired out as cook at a country estate on the Hudson . Many a Sunday an old , old millionaire bachelor picked me up at the depot in his buggy and drove me up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apron danced among pots and pans , prodding a huge pot roast , and scooping mashed potatoes , and every so often skipping across the floor to watch me turn an ice-cream freezer . From sanctuaries beyond , a lame housekeeper , and also a buxom Swedish waitress , stole discreet glances . And the gardener 's young assistant peeked through a pane on the rear porch . Never before in my life had I tasted such morsels ; nor had the wealthy bachelor . So he told me seven times on our last ride together . Her muffins , he said , were more efficient than Timothy 's wine . And her prune sauce was rich with kernel flavors . To this day I utter the names of food with ravenous relish . For Margaret taught me English while I ate . The week long I lived on these meals , and on their names , saving up for another train fare to Cornwall on the Hudson . I was like a famished mongrel . But , No ! No ! Fold your hands . ' How grateful I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bless our bodies with my good food , and also with thine own good spirit . Amen . ' Dinner over and the dishes in the sink , we climbed out along the Hudsont , bluffs , leaping over stumps and boulders , dancing through old Indian wood paths and resting our throbbing limbs on the beach , a step from the river , on moss softer than seven Smyrna rugs . My eyes followed the rich colors of her face and my fingers touched her auburn hair , done Madonna fashion . There again she exclaimed that I looked like her father . Her fingers clung to my wrists , fiercely . But soon she returned to Cornwall on the Hudson . She put her cheek to the ground and stroked it against the moss , and murmured pensively : ' We 're lying in the hand of God . It is so soft now ? His hand is . ' She took off her shoes and stockings and stuck her foot ankle-deep into the same river which flowed at the Broadway canyon , and which had flowed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eddies caught five timid toes ; and also an ( ) flied sole and heel , bridged by a hold arch ; and also a slim ankle . In the dark of night , under the wingspread of two tall , skin catalpa trees , we lay in a hammock , bosom to bosom , pure as the purest of God 's children , strong as the strongest , her toes touching my anldes. her hair my chin , and her young body-line skipping as a shell on water . The trees waltzed , leaning on each other and parting , courting , rollicking to and fro , curtsying solemnly , whispering secrets with a thousand sibilant tongues . From the gardener 's cottage a man lilted a German lyric . The words , So hold and schon and rein , ring in my ear still . From the manor house the waitress sang a Swedish folk song , and broke the spell of night , suddenly , with a wild , despairing outburst , singing , Niir jag var sjOilan 6r ( When I was seventeen ) . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; vol. 1 sD ? NO. 1 and Margaret hummed the Cardinal 's hymn , ' Lead , kindly light . ' V In the fall she returned to Brooklyn , brown as an Indian and with a glow in her eye . She was the same child . yet her kiss was mellower . We went to Manhattan secretly and , just before closing time at City Hall , found the license bureau . There a clerk told us to return to Brooklyn . Borough Hall was the place for us . Our lips drooped . We should be too late . Could he not break the rule , please ? ' Wedding guests are coming , ' I fibbed . He led us into a private office with rugs , mahogany , and curtains , to a man whose voice was gentle , and whose eyes gleamed kindly . Pendergast was his name . I thought he was the mayor . Are we married ? ' I asked Margaret , as we stepped out , reading the license together . No . We must find a minister . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravestones . But we feared to enter , and looked for other churches , finding none . There is a church on every street of Brooklyn , ' Margaret whispered . And we ran through the canyons and through the Battery , for the ferry . There , in the Italian quarter on Dean Street , we found a puny little church and , next to it , the parson 's dwelling . ' Where are your witnesses ? ' he asked as we sat clown in his office . We have n't any . ' He looked us over sombrely . Have you a wedding ring for the bride ? ' I shook my head . He called his wife from the kitchen ? she dropped her apron on his desk ? and a young man from the street . Hurriedly he read a page from a book and filled out a large parchment scroll that swarmed with plump and pink baby angels , while the young man from His bones rattled more than did the Prophet 's , ' Margaret told me later . ' Whiskey ! ' sneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the masseur . Our secret leaked out . Margaret rushed me off to her aunt . But not until years later , when we returned from the West , college-bred , did the aunt quite forgive us our elopement . She had grown wealthy by then , and handed me a roll of brand-new hundred-dollar notes to invest in a home ? thirty-nine in all . Margaret rushed me off to old Uncle John , a rough but solid fellow . In his youth he had been cowpuncher , lumberjack , gold digger . And when the family gathered in solemn conclave to decide my doom he stuck by us . What 's the matter with the fellow ? Does he drink ? Is he sick ? Does n't he want to work ? Did n't he marry Maggie ? ' VI I went West alone ? with my toolbag and with a painting wrapped in a silk kimono . A fortnight later ? the longest in my life ? she came . In Chicago I advanced from shop to office . At sixty dollars a month ? as electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings we mailed to Florida ; though the returns netted us only a ten-acre swamp , which we never even took title to . That was my fault , however . Her budget was marvelous : ? Fuel I gathered on Artesian Avenue ? tarred paving blocks that had been replaced by asphalt . Margaret trimmed my hair . Chicago was a city of ' eats . ' Every feed was a feast , and some were sumptuous revels . The pot roasts Margaret fed me ! She always gave me tender , crackling fork nibblings ? with pumpernickel , salt , oleomargarine , raw celery ? before potatoes and gravy were done . I gobbled the juicy roast and lapped the fork she held , and begged for more until she held out another nibbling and another , at arm 's length ? to watch the sheen ' in my eyes , she said . Perch she fried for me on glowing coals at a swift stream in the outskirts , where we saved a drowning Negro , whose hold made my nose bleed beautifully . Five mud hens we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the swamps of Cicero . Fried sheep brain we ate at poor Carneille 's ? my first Chicago friend , a former priest , but then a factory hand . Plates of prune soup we sponged on broke ' clays at Sophie 's boarding house . Turkey we munched and wine we sipped on Christmas Day at old man Birn 's ? the foundry foreman . ' Wieners ' and flyspecked rolls we swallowed ? and with relish ? at a camp meeting somewhere in the woods , one stifling summer Sabbath , while Margaret charmed a bishop . Demi-tasse and pastry we tasted at the parsonage of a French Protestant church , where we went to find Cameille a job as tutor . He was the most learned man I have ever met , and such a helpless child ? son of a Polish count and a French countess , born in Paris at the Russian embassy under Alexander the Tsar . The day I went farther West he gave me a sacred book upon which he wrote , in Latin , ' We clic whenever we lose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carved brass . With both he had shriven many a dying immigrant . Gallons of coffee we cooked during the winter , when young people gathered around our kitchen stove , everybody taking turns at chopping tarred paving blocks on a padded drafting hoard . Eight wedlocks ? and lasting ones ? we promoted among mail carriers , milkmen , butchers ' and grocers ' clerks , draftsmen , and factory hands , and their respective sweethearts , that first win ter . A lake trip to Ludington stands out as the rarest of honeymoon trips . We were sent as delegates to a church convention there , with steamer fares paid , and board and room for four days free of charge . That week I ate literally barrels of Michigan peaches , which fruit farmers dumped in feeding troughs at the church . The fun we had , Margaret and I , diving for climes in cold Lake Michigan , while a score of pastors , and a hundred delegates , cheered ! And she a month with child ! On our return a storm blew up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air like a basket ball . Delegates leaped out of their berths and gathered in the crowded lounging room , singing , ' Led by Jesus , we are traveling home ! ' A seasick pastor asked me how far we were from land . Quick as a flash Margaret responded : ' I know that joke . Fifty fathoms . ' She was not even seasick in that gale , and after all those peaches . My own stomach was weak ? the first time in my life . Yes , Chicago was a city of ' eats . ' For three years ? every blessed working clay ? I had starved . She wanted a child , though she was a child herself , riding horseback atpicnics on the shoulders of our parson and bartering scandalous secrets with his daughters . During the months that followed our honeymoon trip I marveled at her spirit . I was her only nurse . Daily the pastor 's wife , God bless her , dropped in to bathe the baby . It was a cold spring . I tucked the little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the night long kept a fire that singed the basket . Once I touched his hand to feel how warm it was . He clasped my finger . What a grip ! And he would not let go . I feared to pry open his fist ? I might break his fingers . I carried basket and all to Margaret , awaking her from her first mother slumber . She freed my finger ? and asked for her breakfast . Two weeks , and she was at the ' L ' station to meet me ! The boy was riding on her right hip . Thus she always carried him , holding on to him with one arm and swinging the other . People used to stop on the street to look , when she sped by , her small energetic feet stepping with a style entirely her own , and the baby rocking on her limber hip , his back to her . Such happy chums we were , the three of us ! He was nine months old and teething when he bit his mother 's breast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did not have sense enough to wean him gradually . He always grunted before mealtime . H-r-r-u-hi H-r-r-u-h ! ' he said . In vain we fed him zwieback and milk , potatoes and gravy , bread and sugar and water . II-r-r-u-h ! H-r-r-u-h ! ' he said for hours , and looked at us as if we had betrayed him . Our growth had just begun . ' H-r-r-u-h ! H-r-r-u-h ! '
