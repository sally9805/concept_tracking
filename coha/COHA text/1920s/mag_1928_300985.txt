" To many countries of Europe we are little known . To them Canada is a country of snow , very far away . I thank the Prime Minister of Canada for having been our ambassador and having made Canada known as it should be known . . . . <P> " He comes from the other side , after a triumphant voyage , where he has done honor to Canada , our Parliament and himself . I bid him welcome in the name of Quebec . " <P> Thus spoke last week , while massed thousands throated , the Premier of Quebec , * quick , forthright , able Monsieur Louis A. Taschereau . <P> A few moments previously the S. S. Empress of Scotland had steamed into Quebec harbor , bearing home the Prime Minister of Canada , jovial , rotund , adroit Rt . Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie King . Only persons of tolerably keen memory recall that Mr. King sailed from Manhattan on the S. S. Ile de France with U. S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . <P> Since then Prime Minister King has hobnobbed through Europe , climbed several Swiss alps ( by funicular ) , and dined at Buckingham Palace . As travelers will , Canada 's King buoyantly reminisced , in Quebec last week : <P> " I would like to say how much Canada 's voice is listened to in Europe . . . . What is interesting to other nations is that Canada and the United States have already worked out the very thing that they are struggling for in Europe-namely , Canada and the United States determined , by the Rush-Bagot Treaty , that there should be no armaments on the Great Lakes , and renounced war as a means of settling differences . I pointed out over there that our Minister of Finance , in bringing down his Budget , does not consider the appropriation of a five-cent piece for defense against our neighbours . If they could come to that in Europe they would all be prosperous very soon . But their Budgets are still burdened because of fear of aggression from other nations . Europe will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can become absolutely free and prosperous as it should be . " <P> Of his visit to Buckingham Palace , Mr. King said : " His Majesty asked many questions . ... I was struck by the fact that his Majesty had been following in minute detail matters which had taken place in this Dominion . " <P> Bristling a trifle , the Prime Minister made clear that in chatting with George V he had strongly emphasized the absolute self-determination in internal affairs now enjoyed by Canada under the Crown . While on this theme , Mr. King recalled that he inaugurated in Paris the new Legation in which now resides Canada 's first Minister to France . " The opening of our Legation in Paris , " cried Mr. King to his Francophile Quebec audience , " revives old associations which link early beginnings in Canada with the present day . <P> " What some of our people in Canada do not realize is that , when it comes to dealing with Governments , the older Governments always require or like to deal with some one of a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not reach other Governments , except by courtesy or good offices of others . <P> " What the new arrangement really does is to give the Canadian representative in France equality with the Ministers of other nations .
