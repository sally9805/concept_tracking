Two sculls moved up the Thames . The two scullers were Walter Hoover of the U. S. , who had gone to London to bring home the Philadelphia Gold <P> Challenge Cup , and Jack Beresford Jr . of England . <P> For two minutes oars went back and were pulled forward . Then - bump ! Hoover 's craft hit that of Beresford . " In the heat of the race , " he afterward said , " I judged . . that Beresford was crowding in to my water and I thought : ' If you think you can get away with that , I 'm going for you . And I did . I see now I was mistaken . " <P> The craft were speedily disentangled . But Hoover found it impossible to resume rowing until Beresford 's boat had cleared out of the way of his oars . Thus did Beresford acquire a lead of over a length . Six min. 48 sec. after leaving Putney Bridge , Beresford won the 1 mile 707 yard race by three lengths . <P> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> * Beresford is without question the best man . The week previous he defeated Hoover in the Diamond Sculls of the Henley ' regatta . Previous to this the English rowing authorities had ruled that the Diamond Sculls , and not the Philadelphia Cup , is emblematic of the World 's Amateur Rowing Championship .
