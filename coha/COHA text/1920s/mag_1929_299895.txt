Each U. S. citizen going to France this summer will save $8-the price of three good dinners or 33 martini cocktails-through an agreement signed last week by the U. S. State Department and representatives of the French Government . Reciprocally , the price of French and U. S. visas has been reduced from $10 to $2 . <P> The $10 visa fee , bane of U. S. travelers abroad , started in 1920 when U. S. consuls were instructed to collect $9 , plus $1 for executing the application , from each and every foreigner who wanted a passport visaed . Delighted at finding a new source of revenue , several foreign governments instantly retaliated , charged all U. S. tourists $10 each . <P> Finding that U. S. citizens were spending millions on foreign visas - while little money was accruing from foreign tourists in the U. S. - the State Department started negotiations in 1925 to abolish or reduce the $10 charge . France last week was the 29th nation to comply . <P> Among the nations granting free visas to U. S. citizens : Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sweden , Switzerland , Japan , Russia . <P> Charging $1 to $4 : France , Bulgaria , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Czechoslovakia , Jugoslavia , Austria , Chile , Spain . <P> The Turkish Republic holds out for $6 ; while still in the $10 class are : Norway , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Rumania , Greece , Great Britain , Irish Free State . <P> Last week the London Evening Stand ard commented on the French reduction of visa fees : " France has so many advantages over Britain for the attraction of Americans that we can ill afford to put any obstacles in the way of the potential visitor . There is a tendency on this side of the Channel to imagine that all American travelers are so rich that a few extra dollars in the way of fees will not weigh one way or another . That is quite wrong . "
