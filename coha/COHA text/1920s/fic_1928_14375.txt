ON a dark night in November BLUE THUNDER is preparing to quit his cabin . He is packing his valise by the light of a squatty fat candle  --  a powerful pantherlike man , slewfooted and black , with a flashing diamond set in his front teeth . His reddish terrapin eyes are merry tonight , for something pleases him . As he ties his banjo to the side of his valise , he talks gaily to himself and ponders the story of one named MARTIN . BLUE THUNDER Yeh , a dark night , darker than this and stormy . The wind did moan and the trees bend with the black sleet falling from the skies . Shrugging his shoulders in a simulated shiver . Ooh  --  hooh . Poor nigger set by the little fire and freeze , all mommicked up inside . Uh  --  huh , what an evening . In crope a little cat . Great god , cat , what your business ? Cat set licking his paws  --  haw  --  haw  --  and winked his eye . " We cai n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle-sized cat come in next . Great God , cat , what your business ? He licked his paws  --  haw  --  haw  --  " We cai n't do nothing till Martin comes . " But wait till the big cat come in , his jaws looking like the mouth of hell . Poor niggers ' eyes run out on stems , could knock ' em off with a stick , and puddles of cold sweat stood in his shoes . He closes his eyes and roars with merriment . Need old Blue Thunder there . Who 's that ? Answering himself . The devil 's cat . Scat from here or I ram my fist down your throat and turn you wrongside outwards  --  haw  --  haw . " Cai n't do nothing , till Martin comes . " Martin been here all the time , marked on the breast with Father , Son and Holy Ghost . Singing . Blood rise up on the floor and cryMy bowels do grumble like thunder . Pulling a roll of money from his trouser pocket and running it by his thumb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crams the money deep in the breast pocket of his coat . The real is the real and the unreal the unreal . Women 's fingers are long , and they hold when they hold . Does it read that way with you , Little Stick ? Stretching out his hand . We 're on our journey now . The walking-stick in the corner comes mincing out before him with BLUE THUNDER 'S derby hung over it . He puts the derby on , takes the stick and sweeps the room with a gesture . Good-bye to the Great Popper 's home . You treated me right . Yea , scrumptious . He suddenly stops as if in a reverie and stands whistling softly to himself . After a moment he turns , picks up the candle and goes over to a pile of papers in the corner . I 'll keep the testimony . Fire for the owls and Jackmuhlantern . Let ' em get warm . Cold winter coming . He sets fire to the papers  --  singing . Freshhearted womens got no hiding , Sweetheart come rolling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turns to blow out the candle , when a woman 's voice is heard singing in answer just outside the door. p. 3 VOICE Let the rain have pity and turn to bloodWhen the coffin comes rolling and tumbling in your door . BLUE THUNDER angrily majestic.Who comes mocking Great Popper ? The door opens and three young mulatto women come in , haggard and witchlike . ONA LOU , the large one , carries a hammer and a flatiron . CHERRY , the mediumsized one , a bag of walnuts , and BESSIE , the little wiry one , an iron pick somewhat like an ice pick . THREE WOMEN with bowed heads.Hail to Great Popper ! BLUE THUNDER The king is leaving . WOMEN The brides come to say farewell . ONA LOU quietly turns and smothers the fire with her huge feet . Then the three sit down in a row , with ONA LOU in the center . CHERRY draws a walnut from the bag and passes it on to ONA LOU who cracks it with deliberate blows of her hammer and passes it on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all partaking of the bits at the same time and in the same way . Uninterruptedly they carry on in the routine of their cracking and eating . BLUE THUNDER stands in the middle of the room , looking at them with inquisitive indulgence and twirling his cane. p. 4 BLUE THUNDER Farewell . With a laughing threat . Old number tens put out my fire . Waving his cane . Make little walking-stick talk to you  --  hunh ? The women look up at him impassively . Want the hants brought on you  --  hunh ? WOMEN chanting together.Great Popper going to leave us , Somebody thinking ' bout him , The road calling him on.In the dark night our hearts struck sorry , And tears fell down like drops of rain . BLUE THUNDER Ho  --  ho . The ladies cry after me ! ONA LOU Prop open our mouths let the soul escape , Lonesome graveyard be our resting place , When the light goes out . CHERRY Blackbirds tickle inside the coffin , The devil 's blackbirds plaiting our hair , When the light goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathmaker  --  haw  --  haw . Talk on . BESSIE lifting her haggard face for an instant.Said so old death , the little black man , Driving the buzzard from door to door , Let the light go out . A sly giggle breaks from the women as BLUE THUNDER looks up in bewilderment. p. 5 WOMEN chanting.Who makes his bed crosswise of the world , Eats bitter yarbs and drinks salt tears  --  Do n't leave us alone , do n't leave us . BLUE THUNDER pondering.Little black man ? WOMEN Drive a stake through our breastsSo the mulberry witch ca n't rob our grave  --  Do n't leave us alone , do n't leave us . BLUE THUNDER smiling and talking half to himself.Maybe sometimes I talk too much . Forget it . WOMEN It 's done forgot . BLUE THUNDER Yeh , Popper leaves you now . Coming up to them and patting them kindly . Farewell . I come in the spring and find you full in the flower , I leave you in the fall with the sap and bloom all gone . You been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember you . Drawing a handful of coins from his pocket and dropping them in their laps . Pay a little something , not much , wo n't worth much . Give Little Thunders a copper at home . Saluting them with a bow . Blue Thunder shall inherit the earth . Farewell . WOMEN The ghosts will come and pull at the bedclothes , The red ball of fire run crying down the grade , Great Popper the King done gone . p. 6 BLUE THUNDER Nothing to hurt you . Go back to old husbands and your house . Stop the whining . Great Popper come like a dream and go like a dream . Coming up to them and feeling of their bodies .

See black spirits and white spirits contending in the sky , and the black spirits are destroying the white spirits . Blue Thunder giving ' em strength . Speak , Little Stick . He throws the stick down on the floor and pops his fingers at it as if petting a dog . Tchk , tchk ! The cane wriggles itself forward and clambers up to his hand . But the women go on with their cracking and eating , their heads bowed . WOMEN breaking into a low laugh.Look in a rock and see great trouble . BLUE THUNDER Get on now . I got no time . Farewell  --  brides  --  haw  --  haw , three brides . Old wore-out wives  --  scat. p. 8 BESSIE whispering . Scat . BLUE THUNDER stepping before them . All right . What you got in your heads ?

BESSIE still whispering . Burn up the world . ONA LOU We 're satisfied . BLUE THUNDER picking up the candle and starting towards the pile of papers again . All right , I smoke you out . But turning suddenly he sets the candle back on the table and looks at them . Got hold of some trick ? Conjure ? Yah . Blue Thunder the only conjure man . No power stand out against him . With gentle malevolence . Three minutes I give you . No more . Leave . Three minutes to get out alive . He pulls out a heavy fobbed watch and opens it . Then I set my house dogs on you .

Get on , the king 's in a hurry . WOMEN giggling . Power , power . Sweet , sweet meat of the walnuts , Crack little skulls and fish ' em out . BLUE THUNDER Sing ! Nah . Listen . He pulls his banjo out from its straps and begins weaving his huge flat thumb across the strings . WOMEN as if overjoyed . Great Popper gon na sing for the queen . BLUE THUNDER spitting on the floor and making a pass with his foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on top of the world ? Blue Thunder is his name.Conceived in the clouds with the thunder , Born from woman with the lightning bolt , Power of God over trees and things , And power over women all the days of his life . Hah  --  hah ! Who 's this walking in the middle of the world ? Blue Thunder is his name.Jackmuhlantern 's daddy hot from hell , Witch and windmaker , king of the tricks , And rider of the horse that flies in the moon , And dreaming when the east wind blows . Hah  --  hah ! p. 10 WOMEN chanting . And dreaming when the west wind blows . BLUE THUNDER throwing his head back and looking up . Who 's this singing at the bottom of the world ? Blue Thunder is his name.Power like the wings of a bat , Hate like the scaly dried snake 's head , The rattler 's looking-glass fang.Great King Popper is his name.Hah  --  hah ! Hah , who is this ? A man from the deep and from the high . I come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school with the alligator and learned the lesson of the crocodile . This is the old Doctor John and Doctor Alexander and old Dan Peter in one , yea a stuffed rooster and all head . Crow when you tell it . Wropped me in a shroud when I was born , the floods broke and I by myself was saved . The mark was on me , cross ' twixt a hoss and a man . Spell me my numbers  --  seven , three , nine , five , and four times four all stamped on my back . Sun wrote it with a fiery pencil and I stood it like a man . Unlucky ten can never find me . WOMEN giggling . Three minutes done gone . BLUE THUNDER dropping his banjo on the table . I turn my power loose on you ! Hesitating  --  almost sorrowfully . I give you one more chance .

Crack little skull and get big diamond . CHERRY crying out . No , no . Do n't touch it . BLUE THUNDER eyeing her . Hah ? Too late now . And all the nights you served me I do n't remember . The dollars you brung me I done forgot . The sweet dishes you piled up are far from me . The feel of your soft hands I remember no more . Spitting . And all the kisses I wipe them from me . You come to say farewell to the king , and the king says farewell to you . He waves his stick at the bed in the corner and the covers and pillow begin hopping up and down , the blankets twisting and winding themselves into a sort of bundle . The women go on with their cracking and eating , never raising their eyes . BLUE THUNDER with shining eyes shouts out . Yea , the seven years is done past away and the little black man is dead ! Blue Thunder is the king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pots and pans by the fireplace and they hop out into the room and stand dancingly before him . Then the pillow and blankets come down and join them . Try your teeth , little men . They fall to fighting savagely among themselves , belaboring one another until he touches them with his cane and stops them . Run , quick , get away ! But the women look up with a smile . Nah ? With a mad cry . Sic ' em ! The household creatures fling themselves upon him instead . Thereupon the women burst into a clamor of joy . Shrieking , BLUE THUNDER beats vainly about him with his cane , trying to keep the blankets and pillow from smothering him , and the pot and pan from biting his legs . The walking stick springs out of his hand and wraps itself chokingly around his neck . Gradually his struggles cease , he grows livid in the face , and standing for a while like a cleft tree , he shudders , and then falls heavily to the floor . In the twinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their place , the pillow and blankets on the bed , and the little cane standing innocently in the corner . For a long while the women stare at him in silence . Then with a cry CHERRY flings herself down over him. p. 12 CHERRY He told us to leave and go away ! BESSIE springing up and pulling a little bag from beneath her apron and waving it aloft . Great Popper . Yah , the little black man is the Great Popper and King . ONA LOU Long live the King ! CHERRY wiping her eyes and standing up with the roll of money . Still we take this back . This , nothing but this . ONA LOU dividing it around . Part apiece . Yea , maybe more than that . She gets down on her knees and stares intently at the dead man . Look how bright it shine . Lifting up her arm . Rise , little hammer . CHERRY Stop it ! BESSIE chuckling . Foolish woman loved the fool . Mought be a dream , but the diamond shine . ONA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blow on his teeth with the hammer . ONA LOU His teeth big and strong lak a mule 's . BESSIE Part hoss . There is a sudden flash of lightning outside. p. 13 CHERRY hiding her face with a moan . I 'm not mixed up in it . I got nothing to do with it . ONA LOU Hush ! BESSIE Let me get at it with the little pick . I 'll dig him out . The little pick is mighty good . ONA LOU raises her hammer for a second blow when the door opens gently and a little merry black man about a foot high comes jiggling in , driving a buzzard with a string . WOMEN throwing up their hands with a scream . Go back !  --  Wait !  --  Nah !  --  It 's not us ! Still smiling he comes toward them.
