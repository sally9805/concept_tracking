Forecast last November ( TIME , Nov. 26 ) , vigorously denied ever since , the sale of Germany 's Opel Motor Works to General Motors last week became a fact . As in many a domestic merger , the emphasis given denials forecast a deal of large proportions . Thus , last week , no less than three presidents journeyed to Wiesbaden* to sign the contract . They were : the President of General Motors Corp . ( Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr. ) ; the President of General Motors Export Co . ( James David Mooney ) ; the President of Fisher Bodies Corp . ( Frederick J. Fisher ) , chief of the seven money-minting Fisher brothers . <P> Immediate subjects of presidential talk en route to Wiesbaden were , of course , the mechanics of the Opel-G . M. deal . Every German motorcar maker knows that Opel 's cheap ( $650 ) standardized car last year controlled exactly half the German market ( 45,000 cars out of 90,000 total production ) . Yet G. M. executives , pondering Chevrolet 's enormous success in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a still cheaper car . Perhaps it might be the Chevrolet itself . Perhaps it might be a new make , lighter , with only 5 h. p. , to sell at 1,800 marks ( $432 ) . <P> Whatever the means , each and every itinerant President knew the end that great G.M. has in view . While the battle of Fords and Chevrolets begins again at home , Ford has flung down a challenge for European markets as well . Sir Percival Perry , English Ford generalissimo , opened hostilities when he offered especially to English investors shares of the $34,020,000 Ford Motor Co. , Ltd . Similar offerings are being made by Ford companies on the Continent . But Great Britain &; Ireland are now Ford 's key sectors ; his Manchester , Cork and Dagenham ( capacity 200,000 cars annually ; unfinished ) plants are the most important overseas units ; and Ford Motor Co. , Ltd. , is the greatest of the associated companies abroad . <P> This is a war of cheap cars , Ford v. Chevrolet . There is a surprising dearth of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not turn out a car that will undersell the Ford in France , though Fords cost 25,700 francs ( $1,008 ) , about double the American price . The cheapest Chevrolet model sells for 30,400 francs ( $1,191 ) . France 's 45% ad valorem duty largely accounts for these prices . Even with this duty , it is estimated that General Motors ' projected cheap car for the Opel Works could be sold in France at about 16,000 francs ( $627 ) . Thus the Opel-General Motors deal seriously threatens Ford in the French , as well as German , markets . <P> <P> *Oldtime watering place famed for gout and gambling .
