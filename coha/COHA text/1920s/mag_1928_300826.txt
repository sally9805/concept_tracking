Rested and notified , Nominee Hoover once more became the busy Beaver Man . He concluded his conferences with managers at Palo Alto and set out , via the Southwest , to explain further to the Midwest what he means to do about " the most important obligation of the next Administration " - farm relief . <P> Quotas . The managerial conferences ended with the impression that the Beaver Man is , more than ever , his own manager-in-chief . The Hooverlike scheme of vote quotas for each State to " shoot at " superseded Dr. Hubert Work 's idea of specialized drives among women or in the South . Returning to Colorado , his own home State , Chairman Work proceeded to lecture the local G. O. P. Unless it ceased its internal quarreling he predicted " a greatly reduced majority , if any . " He said : " You in Colorado have become careless of your party . " <P> Ballot . Of all the things a Nominee must do , one is to cast his own vote . He votes for himself , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . It is the principle of the thing , the example to others , the patriotic performance of one 's civic duty . Unfortunately , it was discovered last week , the California law will prevent Nominee Hoover from casting his vote by mail . He had planned to be in the crucial East on the eve of the election . Plans were changed . <P> Boulder Dam . At Los Angeles , Nominee Hoover had to speak out on a subject of prime importance in the Southwest . Led by Senator Hiram Johnson , southern Californians , especially in booming Los Angeles , have long sought to multiply their resources of water and waterpower by urging the Government to build and operate a $200,000,000 dam on the Colorado River . Six other States are affected by the scheme . The proposed site is at Boulder Canyon , between Arizona and Nevada . Interstate disputes have raged , arising from cultural , economic and political differences , and differences in engineering opinion . Finally , the issue between Government operation and privateering has entered . <P> So vast is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well have wished to avoid stump discussion of Boulder Dam . But Senator Johnson , his alleged ally , without whose friendship California might not be Hooverized , last fortnight cried out that " no man on earth is so sacrosanct but that his position on the Power Trust and Boulder Dam should be made plain " ( TIME , Aug. 13 ) . And so , after his multitudinous reception in Los Angeles last week , Nominee Hoover mounted the city hall steps and said : <P> " . . . There is but one limitation to the growth of Los Angeles which looms , . . . and that is adequate water supply . That can and must be assured from the Colorado River . . . . We want the greatest reservoir and the highest dam at Boulder Canyon that the engineers will recommend and I am hopeful that the project will receive favorable action from the present Congress .
