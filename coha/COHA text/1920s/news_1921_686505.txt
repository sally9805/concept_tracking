txt Equal Rights and Obligations . In this morning 's issue of your esteemed paper I read a summary of Secretary Hughes 's address at a dinner of the Society of International Law . In it he is reported as saying : " This country wants only an equal chance and a fair opportunity with others , " referring to the mandates . " It is the intent of all that mandates shall be exercised for the common benefit anti not no as to exclud.e , by monopolistic control , a fair opportunity for honest endeavor . " Now , equal rights implies equal obligations . We as a nation have explicitly refused to place ourselves under any of the obligations of a mandatory power . Even in the case of Armenia , for which nation and people we have always professed much regard , the refusal was decisive . Soldiers have to be provided and much money expended in all tile countries over whom some nation has to exercise mandate authority . We refuised to enter the League on the very ground of objecting to such expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have assumed these tremendous obligations may have an appearance of fairness ; but it is only in appearance fair , in reality it is the very opposite . A strong party in England objected to the Oovernmcnt entering upon the responsibilities involved in receiving mandates for Mesopotamia and other countries ; but as the United States firmly and prudently refused any obligation whatever , there was no other country with power and prestige ready for the undertaking . Does it not appear unreasonable that we , having refused the obligations , should now begrudge the burdened nation any small advantage accruing , which only in a very small measure diminishes the debt , and claim for ourselves equal advantage in the reward ?
