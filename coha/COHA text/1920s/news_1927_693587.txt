txt Appreciative Comment . THE TIMES editorial " The President to the Rescue " will be received by many with joy . It means a great deal more than the question of vetoing the bill . It means that your paper , having a wider influence than any other in the country , will bring to many thousands a better understanding of our President . As you say , it took courage to veto It . It Is hard for many people to believe that it IS possible occasionally to find a conscientious politici who puts his country first , Conscience is a virtue which is not usually supposed to belong to a man who has been in politics all his life . It also means that , going overseas as Tan Tams does , it will influence many in foreign lands , where a better understanding of President Coolidge Is very important , especially in these perplexing days . A. B. COOLIDGE . Boston , Mass. , Feb. 28 , 1927.                 @ @ @ @
