May Sinclair , a Guest , Is Not Blatant <P> If anyone should ask me , I would say that Miss May Sinclair was the almost perfect English visitor to these shores-and this quite aside from the fact , or perhaps you may think because of the fact-that she is one of our finest living novelists . She came unheralded by brass bands , press agents , or agents of any sort . Such reporters and interviewers as wrote to make appointments with her she saw . The dignity of these meetings was admirably reflected in their published interviews , proving that the American reporter has , after all , respect for a fine mind and a becoming presence . <P> Miss Sinclair is short , she dresses quietly and she has a countenance which , in repose , seems a bit brooding ; when her face lights she has the effect of being just a little startled , or , perhaps , amused . In her sweetness of manner and speech , she displays none of the telling irony that is so often present in her books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although May Sinclair is never betrayed into arrant sentimentalities as is too often Miss Gale . <P> There are those admirers of Miss Sinclair who recall the days of The Divine Fire and Mary Olivier with regret and find in them their favorite work of this novelist ; but , for me , the foolery of Mr. Waddington of Wyck , the perfection of detail in Ann Severn and the Fieldings , the devastating character portrayal of A Cure of Souls seem more intensely original , more characteristic of her and of her time . <P> It was a pleasure to see her , and to know that she will spend some time with us here , that she likes us as people , that she does not care to analyze us , that she has come to us a guest and a most welcome guest-and that we are honored both by her presence and her attitude . <P> J.
