txt The loss of two seats in Parliament in two days  --  followed yesterday by another , making three in all ? is naturally a pretty sharp blow , in point of prestige , for the Bonar Law Government . The misfortune was accentuated by the fact that two members of the Cabinet , in addition to the Financial Secretary of the Treasury , were the victims and have had to resign . Yet the result appears to have been very much of the nature of a political accident . It was largely the raising of a new and unexpected issue which cost the Conservatives two constituencies which theyregarded as safe.1 From all accounts , the shift of votes in each was due not to dissatisfaction with the foreign policy of the Government , but to apprehensions and resentment caused by the housing tilles-1 tion , and by the supposed intention of the Government to modify the act of 1920 Imposing restrictions on increases of rent and the rate of interest charged on real estate mortgages . Storm signals on this subject were flown by Mr. MACDONALD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on  --  the Address in the House of Corn-1 mons . He charged the Government with being indifferent to the fact that house accommodation in England was becoming a monopoly . The plans ofl Mr. Lauri ) GEOROD to break it down by doing a vast amount of building by the Government had ended in confessed failure . A great amount of money had been spent , but the working classes did not get the houses . Now the present Government proposed to " decon " trol a certain block of middle-class " houses , " but Mr. MACDONALD was certain that this would do more harm than good , and leave the tenants more than ever at the mercy of the landlords . A few days later came the majority and minority reports of the departmental committee charged with the duty of Investigating the matter . The majority recommended the removal of certain of the restrictions as early as possible , and urged that there should be entire " decontrol " by 1925 . The minority urged continwice of the restrictions , dwelt upon the " deplorable shortage " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence taken by the committee went to show that an increase of rent was certain to follow the removal of restrictions . Here was the inflammable stuff , politically speaking , thrown into the two by-elections . It seemingly did more than anything else to burn up the Conservative majority . The consequences will be twofold . The Government will think twice before going ahead with its housing , policy , and the Cabinet will be reorganized , principally , as indicated , by drawing in some of the Austen Chamberlain group . . Thus it is a mortification rather than a disaster which has overtaken Mr. BOwaa LAw , but at the same time it is a warning to him of the need of being wary in the present state of English public opinion . It is , moreover , one more illustration of the way in which an agitation of which politicians had little prevision may suddenly sweep into an electoral contest+ and threaten to upset their carefully laid plans .
