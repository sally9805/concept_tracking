Dr. Clarence True Wilson , General Secretary of the Methodist Board of Temperance , Prohibition &; Public Morals , arch-lobbyist of the U. S. Drys , Consolidated ( TIME , July 1 ) , last week hinted , in an article for Collier 's magazine , at a new way of enforcing Prohibition . Excerpts : " Every soldier and sailor has taken an oath to sustain the laws of the land . We already have a standing army ready and able to enforce all laws in every foot of the land and a man at the helm-Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy-who has taken a solemn oath to protect , defend and enforce the federal Constitution and the laws of Congress enacted thereunder . . . . <P> " Soldiers wearing the uniform of our government now leading an idle and useless life , violating their oaths and obligations , drinking and carousing even in foreign ports , would be explaining how the law had always had their respect . . . .
