FAVORED many years ago by an invitation to dine with the Round Table , a club in New York , composed in the main of men who had in some way distinguished themselves , I found my undistinguished self in a seat with John La Fargo on my right and a man whose name was as yet unknown to me on my left . Of this gentleman I observed only that he had marked features , and spoke in a low voice . La Fargo , I imagine , put all young men at their case , especially so if they were ambitious beginners in some art . Accordingly , I enjoyed his talk , and even after these years recall the substance of what he said . Presently , however , I spoke to my unknown neighbor on the left , and in so doing could not but feel ? it was apparent in his glance ? that he was a man of natural and profound reserve . He listened , indeed , seemingly with the best will in the world to his youthful neighbor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , something impenetrable . Prompted , I feel sure , by him , I found myself discussing the relation which education holds to politics . I can not pretend to recall his words , save only the substance of his opinions in a single phrase as it was spoken . He said that in his opinion it was unfortunate that Americans , the mass of them , did not much dwell on their historic past ; did not make use of it ; did not draw on their pasts for present counsel . ' I was told , in the course of the CVO-fling , that my unknown table companion was Mr. Woodrow Wilson of the University of Princeton . I am sure that I did not hazard the suggestion , as I should now , that history has become stiff reading , and is so because the spirit of science , and research , has taken it over . Thus the modern historian is first a scholar , and then an artist , if indeed he is an artist at all . No doubt there is something inevitable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times . But , whether easy or hard , we are all , I feel sure , agreed that historical reading is not one of the pleasures our citizens frequently give themselves , and that if our countrymen , taking them in the mass , can become wise only through the perusal of Mr. Rhodes , or Henry Adams , they will likely remain foolish for a very long time to come . It will be said , however , that editors , clergymen , and statesmen read ; and that , as these men are those who enlighten and direct public opinion , this is enough . But even these gentlemen dwell none too frequently in the region of history , and certainly draw very seldom on it for present counsel . And yet , clearly , we Americans need more than most people to be conversant with our own past . We need it more , for example , than the English , because of the number of the foreign-born we have invited to live with us . For we are all pretty well of one mind 109 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , on a sense of justice and the spirit of moderation . Things , it will be agreed , dear enough to the American heart of the past . But the word and what it represents are not very accurately understood . It must be remembered that tolerance is not indifference . It is not the spirit that permits any and every thing because it values nothing . Tolerance has its limits . We do not call a man intolerant who refuses to have his house burned clown or his wife taken from him . And just so we Americans have in the past been intolerant of some things . When our deeper ideals were violated we took action . For example , we did not tolerate the practice of polygamy . Perhaps this was unjust ; but clearly it was intolerant . There was a clash of ideals , and , deciding for our own , we forced the Mormons to be monogamous . In the late war the Government and the people were both intolerant of the refusal to bear arms . And if to-day any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the State we should not tolerate it . Again , we will stomach a deal of tyranny , of interference with our personal habits , but not beyond a certain point , be the re-formers formers never so native-born . It may be said that when a people is like-minded , the ideal aims not being too far apart , it tolerates much , though not all . But we are no longer like-minded . We are at variance . And accordingly the wise and the moderate among our native-born people are themselves forced into intolerance . They are ready , or not far from being ready , for extreme action . So that , at last , we are somewhat in the situation of continental Europe , where moderation is not popular , not expected , not a tradition ; where now one extreme is followed by another ; and where it is possible that at any moment force shall be employed , whether to wreck or to save from wreck the Government or the State involved . It is useless to wring our hands and ask how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our gates . We have simply to admit that this is the state of affairs and apply what . remedy we may be able to apply . But will history , our own history , avail us in the matter ? Will it , that is , help the few who read it to help those who do not ? Will it incline us to be more like-minded ? And , since individual character is so deeply involved , we may even ask the larger question : Will the reading of any portion of our historic annals awaken in the foreigner and reawaken in us the love of those virtues which are Roman , constructive . unifying , and upbuilding ? Will it make young men more eager to serve the State ? Will it indeed make them feel that the State is a worthy object of effort , and that not . to save it is , at least in some degree , a betrayal of their race ? Will such reading teach us any possible lesson , other than that of the uniform folly of mankind ? In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our past for the present emergency ? The answer comes readily enough : there are a thousand pages of our history , a thousand events , which teach us , if at all we can be taught , the immense value , the imperative necessity for a people , or nation , of like-mindedness . We may be too full of irritation and wrath , too eager in disagreement , to be willing to agree . We may want to disagree , and be resolved to do it . But if we do not close our minds to the lessons of events , and the teachings of facts , we can hardly avoid learning that only by and through like-mindedness can a nation and culture flourish and remain one . I am not unaware that many readers will doubt the actuality of any grave disagreement . among the masses of our l Others will hold that the views people . . I advance on the whole matter of the divergency of ideal aims are ludicrous and of no value . And yet others will insist that , a little easy kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . The end I have in view is , indeed . not the bringing forward of some proof that we differ profoundly and dangerously among ourselves . My purpose is simply and solely to attract , attention to the virtue , the value , the necessity of like-mindedness . And to compass this I propose to put aside the polemical spirit , with all argument ; and , leaving the irritating and dubious present , to seek in a period of the past a time and place , a state and city , where men lived and thought and felt as one ? where their agreements were profound , and where , accordingly , they were enabled to govern themselves well , and at the same time to erect a state of civilization and culture of no inconsiderable sort . And , even though we shall be so unfortunate as to be able to draw no counsel from such a study of former times , something may still accrue to us ; something of pleasure in the presence of a high degree of spiritual concord ; something , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is no longer subject to change . For the past , when it is reviewed in the recorded word or action ; when we do not throw upon it the light , or it may be the darkness , of our own minds ; when we take it as it stands , and without interpretation ? the past , or at least the nobler passages of it , so come upon , possesses the charm of art , the appeal of what is finished and permanent . The disputative spirit dies in its presence . There is no question of fact ; argument is not in point . These things were ; these inspirMg words were said ; this noble death was died , this life well lived . We see and hear , as it were , in a vision ; we contemplate and are satisfied . And all the more are we satisfied if some art of the time has wrought upon the transiency of things ; has taken over the words spoken , the feelings felt , the deeds done , and has added to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanence which comes of perfection . For the past is then , I repeat , like a statue or picture : authentic , stable , secure , changeless , and changelessly calm . And , it being so , we are enabled to look upon it with a pure mind . As I copy these words at , an Open window , the bells of St. Michael 's sound softly against the incoming sea air ? for I write in the city of Charleston , in South Carolina . The bells of the old church ring their distant peal , as I say , with an astonishing softness ; the waves glitter and wash upon the wall of the Battery ; the strong , fresh south wind blows ; the palmettos toss their green spiked fans of foliage and rustle , loud and dry ; and under the dark green of Live Oaks , on the Battery , I see and hear young people , laughing , teasing , and talking . Faint odors of acacia and orange blossoms are in the air , the flowers themselves unseen behind the high-walled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitive Northern tourist ; since , being of another time and taste than ours , they are built sideways to the street , almost as if the owners actually dared wish not to be seen by every passer-by in the most intimate moments of their leisure . But nowadays the clean , sunny streets of this end of the town arc little troubled with passers-by , and less with the noise of traction engines or motors . Indeed , the quiet is such that the whistling of a distant mocking bird floats in at the window . And what a grace and dignity the town has , with its wide bay ? to the south the low-wooded shore of the Isle of Pines , and to the northeast Sumter , looming over the turbid water , darkly blue in the haze of an April sea . Very natural , it may be thought , in Charleston and with Fort Sumter in full view , to have fallen into a train of reflection on that spirit of extremism which follows on unlike-mindedness . Natural , with these surroundings , to dwell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same spirit in the North . But happily the world is full of surprises ; and what I now seek to lay before the reader , and to interest him in , is a number of local and little-known records which in their sense are the reverse of everything extreme , bigoted , fanatical . These records are in the main memorial inscriptions and . displaying , as they do , a spirit of moderation and a great love of political justice , lead up inevitably to an historic scene which for a certain greatness of feeling would , I believe , be hard to parallel . These records , epitaphs , and inscriptions are , many of them , composed upon obscure or forgotten men . They are , however , all of a public nature , and possess the interest which attached to public memorials . And , as the reader will at once discover , they are composed in an admirable literary style . Let me dwell for a moment on the unique quality of their style , and the cause of this . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of the novelist or the lyrist . Where a man graves words on marble , or incises them on granite , he must , first of all , be brief . If the lines are to have force , their felicity must consist in the ' much in little ' of the Roman phrase ; the writer must say the main thing and have clone . Furthermore , if he is celebrating public men or public events , the tone of his celebration must itself be public . He must be general , downright , plain , and to the point . And as he is writing for those who stand , if they do not run . he will be unwise if he shall venture to be eccentric or obscure , or shall venture on what is too novel to he taken in at . a glance . Ile must speak the language of the day . And clearly he can not be subjective , intimate , and full of his own ego , however much his own ego may interest him . In short , the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , and the public occasion to which they are dedicated , condition his style ? color , or even , it may be said , create it . It must be further remembered that this art of epitaph ? the art of laudation on stone ? is highly traditional , replete with reminiscence , and special to its occasion . Thus , in the things I have such pleasure in presenting to the reader , there are whole or half lines from Simonides of Amorgos , or echoes of the great Roman memorials in prose . I must , however , not fail to add that , as we read , we feel that much of what is written is conventional ; that the praise is given in such way , for such qualities , as that expectation shall be gratified . On the other hand , the extraordinary and abiding interest of these memorial words I shall now beg to quote lies herein , that they convey the feelings of a time and a people with a great degree of felicity . It must be understood that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being greater or wiser or nobler than the people of to-day . But they were in some sort different . And this difference is full of instruction , and even of inspiration . Thus , the Southerners of that time display a profound enthusiasm for the Suite as a necessary and ideal agent . Again , they express their relish of manly virtue in the most open and candid way , reminding one in this of no one so much as Plutarch . And they lay a special emphasis of praise on habits or virtues which it would seem odd , or certainly old-fashioned , to mention in our clay , let alone cut into the cold and permanent face of a piece of marble . For example , if the president of the Connecticut Coal and Iron Company died , and , having a stone on his grave , we read on it that throughout his life he displayed the manly Virtues , ' the casual reader would feel it to be strangely said . Or if on the tombstone of an unknown youth , dying , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that ' Integrity , candour , and courtesy uniformly characterized his life and conduct , ' we should , I think , pause in mild wonder at these citizens of Newark who think so loftily of courtesy that they praise the youthful possessor of it on his very tombstone . No doubt , as I have said , these expressions are , in a measure , conventional , and conventions change . But , on the other hand , ? and this is the vital point , ? taken as praise , and when evidently sincere , these things indicate a certain general preference , in the scale of moral values , of the men who composed them , and for whom they were composed . Above all , they bear witness to the amazing like-mindedness of the Carolinians of that day . Turning directly to the records themselves , we learn at once , and from the least important of them , that a young man was , in those remote times , expected to have a public career , not solely a business one . On one humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Labours for His Townsmen . ' On another , ' His Country was his first Thought ' ; on a third , ' Successful in his Career as a Merchant , he was Liberal to the Arts , and eager in the Service of his State . ' Simple and conventional enough ; yet clearly the words reveal the general expectation that a man shall devote some measure of his time and energy to the service of the Commonwealth . In reading these epitaphs , I could not but recall the words of a Southern statesman , words spoken many years ago . He was referring to the time previous to the Civil War . ' South Carolina and Massachusetts produced so many great public men , ' he said , ' sn many more than did the other states , because in those two states young men were encouraged on all hands to aspire to a public career . It was not thought very well of a youth if he evinced no public concern . So , as soon as a young man showed he was something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us made much of him . ' It would be easy to quote a dozen epitaphs exemplifying and supporting the sense of these words . ' He was not False to the Expectation of his People ' ; ' Urged by all who knew him , he accepted Office to the detriment of his Private Fortune ' ; Fell in defence of his Country , Christ 's faithful Soldier and Servant . ' But let me turn to something larger and more important , only asking the reader to remember that lie is in the presence of one of the arts , even if a lesser art ; and that these words so carefully selected , so brief and succinct , are really a sort of free verse in prose form ; or , at all events , a prose of a highly condensed sort ? a prose from which every vague and useless word has been deleted . Dying in his ninetieth year , John Julius Pringle was , in his clay , a man of some note and performance in his ally stand on the stone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actu- in part , as follows : ? This , if conventional in form and phrase , is at all events modest , collected , and succinct ? a man 's character in brief , and chiefly his public service . The felicity of phrase is sufficiently apparent , and with this that public tone of which I have spoken . On another stone , and in a churchyard distant from Charleston , there are the following few plain and feeling words , but this time not of a man who could be active for his people or the state . The words are in remembrance of a Negro slave whose Christian name was John ? this name being the only one on the tombstone , since his surname was that of his owner . And , a little removed from and lower than this epitaph itself : ? THERE SHALL HE NEITHER BOND NOR SLAVE . A monument above Trumbull 's grave in Charleston has , with much else , the following words : ? Of another public man , whose name I omit , but a man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly fail to feel that the man who lies in that quiet grave possessed the quality of heroic persistence ; but we must remark , too , that his fellow citizens honored him for what he possessed . And with what becoming sobriety they expressed this public praise ! The Hour of Conflict , the Day of Defeat . ' It would have been easy for a conquered people , prostrate and yet indignant , to have qualified conflict ' and ' defeat ' with two violent and enfeebling adjectives ? easy to have been what is called flowery . Instead of which we have it as it stands ? brief , solid , weighty , strongly felt , well composed , and with sufficient dignity and point . It would naturally occur to a Northerner to wonder what these Southern men would have to say of less public characters . Well , the South Carolinians had a poet ; his name was Titurod ? reckoned to-day , I imagine , as a very minor poet , and accordingly in the North known chiefly to literary students . His bust stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this inscription : ? It is , I feel , not without interest that nothing is said of his poetry as achievement , nothing of his private life ; that no mention is made of fame ; that no complaint is leveled and that nothing is mourned . And how much at home we feel with these words . How much we feel that we are in the presence of a great people . It is , after all , not unworthy of remark that a people should praise its poets for their courage . In the portico of St. Michael 's Church you have on the wall : ? Facing this there is a tablet upon which the lettering runs as quoted below . The author of the couplet is unknown to me . A little below this are the following words : ? When Robert Young Hayne died , Charleston celebrated her great protagonist with this inscription : ? . There follow the many and important offices he held . South Carolina is then spoken of , and so , again , to the epitaph itself : ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , and yet it is not too much to say that the spirit of a whole people lives in the words . The character of a man is suggested ; a race is portrayed . And , once more , how much at home we feel with these lines . How inevitably they appeal to us . There is , too , that certain sobriety of statement , which I feel we can not too much admire ; and with this sobriety there is a great degree of moderation in the praise accorded . And yet what ardor of feeling for the Commonwealth in the quotation , ' Having lived long enough for his own Fame : having died too soon for his country 's Good . ' Eloquent and able a creature as Hayne was , we can not continue or revive his reputation to-day . But , for self-evident reasons , one sentence of his remains in the public memory : ' The greatest of all evils is a government of unlimited powers . ' To desert Charleston for a moment , there is in Warrenton , Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This soldier is spoken of as having labored and fought , ' not for Empire and Renown : but for Right and Commonwealth . ' A stone 's throw from this grave there is a granite shaft , and on one face of it are the lines : ? On another face is an adaptation of the famous line of Simonides : ' Go tell the VOL 138 ? NO. 2 B Southerners we lie here for the rights of their States . ' Following this is a line from Byron : ' They never fail who die in a great cause , ' and on the fourth face of the stone : ' God will.judgc the Right . ' The lines speak for themselves , but it may not be superfluous to indicate in passing that there is no argument about States ' rights . The fact that these six hundred men died for these rights is stated simply as a fact ; and we who read are touched . We may disbelieve in the advisability of the States having any rights whatever , and yet feel that a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the Heights of Abraham may regret the loss of Canada ; but if he is a man of feeling he will hardly fail to be moved , and even a good deal moved , by the brief sentence which , on that pillar of stone , celebrates at once the heroic death and the great achievement of Wolfe : - HERE LIES WOLFE : - VICTORIOUS ! The Southern people , as is well known , made up their minds after the war was over that the cause for which their soldiers had fought and died was a lost cause , and was not something which could be revived . It was done with . After Appomattox , General Lee could not be described as anything but a Union man ; and he carried the South with him . The velocity and completeness of the change were astounding , and testified to the immense common sense , the political and moral wisdom , of the people as a whole . I am frank to say I know nothing like it in history . For the Southern people ( lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they simply faced the fact that they were beaten , and therefore they must be true to the Union . And they were so . Accordingly , when they first began to raise monuments to their dead , they praised them , not for the cause they had espoused , but in the main , as we have seen , for their heroism , their sense of duty . There is , however , a monument in Columbus , upon which the words inscribed do speak of that cause , and speak of it with admirable self-restraint and dignity . The traditional style of these memorials ? that something of Roman which they have , or even , though more rarely , of Greek ? is plain enough . But there is an example , and an extraordinary one , of an epitaph deriving from another source . This occurs in the city of Savannah . There is , in one of the public squares of that beautiful and now prosperous town , a shaft of stone dedicated , once more , to the men who gave their lives to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotation from the Bible , the words being a part of the thirty-seventh chapter of Ezekiel ? that astonishing chapter in which the Hebrew Prophet endeavors to prove to the people of Israel that nothing is impossible to God , not even that He should raise the dead . The words thus quoted and engraved on the granite are these : ? In order to appreciate these words , we have , of course , to recall that they-were inscribed many years ago , at a time when the Southern States were wrecked ; their economic structure shattered , their young men dead in battle ; their civilization overthrown , and their hopes defeated ? at a time , therefore , when men 's hearts were burning , when there must have been every temptation to say much more than the brief , poignant , and imaginative sentence which the men and women of that period actually preferred . But even to-day the Southern people continues to abound in its tradition , composing its inscriptions with much the same self-restraint , much the same dignity . Its epitaphs ? in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public in tone , and as concise as those of seventy years ago . And this is not without a degree of interest , since so much of the writing in the South has been done in a florid and Corinthian tone . The words I shall now quote are modern , and were composed , I am told , within the decade . The monument which bears them stands in the cemetery at Arlington , commemorating once more the Confederate dead in battle . IV The historic event of which I spoke earlier , and to which these inscriptions very naturally lead up , was one which occurred in Charleston in the spring of that year which saw the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville . But previous to the narration of it I must speak of the man whose death was the occasion of it , and quote the lines placed upon his tombstone . There lived in Charleston before and during the first years of the Civil War a certain James Lewis Pettigru , a lawyer and a public man . Knowledge of him has for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . His grave is in the yard of St. Michael 's Church ; and , the epitaph on the stone at the head of it ? an epitaph which , I understand , has long been known and admired by the few ? awakening the interest of the present writer , he sought out among his older acquaintances in Charleston those who should give him a first-hand account of the gentleman who was the subject of it . Some few persons have seen the man in their boyhood , seen him on the street and in court ; their fathers were his personal friends . But , apart from these intimate narratives of eyewitnesses , the man 's memory floated in the general atmosphere . This could hardly be otherwise , since for more than thirty years Pettigru was active in all matters of common interest . Standing high at the bar , he spoke on almost all public occasions . In a time of eloquent men he was among the most eloquent . His probity , industry , and the powers of his mind were of such a nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have aspired . Office appears to have been little to his taste ; but he was a leader in his own way , popular with all classes in the community , rich and poor , black and white ? in short , with the whole town and state . And this is the more remarkable in that Pettigru was a wit ; and , as we all know , the power of illuminating the folly and unreason of mankind by those flashes of pure rationality which we call wit is not ordinarily a popular trait . Such men are more feared than loved , more admired than trusted . There was , however , that in this man 's make-up which brought men to his feet , and kept them there . Perhaps it was that Pettigru 's nature was open , ardent , and generous to a fault . He was outgoing and warm-hearted ; and , though he knew men for what they are , he loved them and showed it . There was , in short , nothing of repression or restraint about the man . He expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with force . And at times , his mind overcast and dark with apprehension for the future of his country , and his whole being in a storm , he loosed the powers of his invective ? those powers of irony , sarcasm , and intellectual contempt of which I made mention . Such was this man , and such his popularity . But popularity is a flower that withers overnight . Mankind in the gross mass is fickle : if the object of its liking pursues a course opposed to its ideas , its interests as it conceives them , he is reprobate and to be discarded . Not without amazement , therefore , we learn that , living and working in the very seat of Secessionist feeling , and supporting throughout his entire career , as he did , the Federal Union , Pettigru yet lost nothing of the abundant and glowing regard in which he was held by the people of his state . There were , to be sure , other men , a small but capable company of them , who were Unionists on principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , decidedly the leader of the movement ; and he led it with all his mind and all his heart . To specify his opinions , it appears that he held slavery to be wrong , and a grave misfortune to the South ; but he was not for that reason an abolitionist . He thought , apparently , that these sudden drastic and unconsidered solutions of a problem at once moral and economic create as much evil as they abolish , saddling aftertimes with a problem different , indeed , from the original one , but no less fraught with evil . He seems to have cherished a truly Anglo-Saxon respect for justice , law , precedent , and custom , and to have held the opinion that if slavery were left alone it would , in the end , abolish itself . But he was utterly opposed to the extension of the system . He spoke in public and in private , again and again , of the madness of Secession , and the infatuation of the people of his state . It is said that on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink a toast to South Carolina , and replied , in no very pacific tone , as he rose , ' Certainly . To South Carolina : and may she recover her senses ! ' Passion , it need hardly be said , ran high at the time ? the years between 1840 and the outbreak of war . Great financial interests were involved ; the system of slavery ; the fate of the Union ; the future of the South ? its prosperity , the form and character of its civilization . It might readily be imagined that such a man , a man so opposed to the popular feeling of the clay , would sooner or later have been stoned in the streets of Charleston , as Whittier was in those of Boston . Not a few of the Southern sympathizers in the North ? the gentlemen called Copperheads ? suffered at the hands of their fellow citizens of the opposite , the Union party . And Pettigru was , relatively , in the same position in South Carolina . He was , so to say , a Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might naturally be imagined that he would be deprived of office , or certainly that he would not have had office thrust upon him , previous to the outbreak of war , and assuredly not after that event . We should guess that he would live under a shadow and die neglected ; and , if he died before the close of the conflict , that his funeral would be private , and some degree of obloquy would follow him to his grave . Pettigru did indeed die before the war was ended , though not before the Secessionist Legislature had elected and appointed him , the implacable foe of Secession , to digest and codify the laws of the state . And this legislature renewed the appointment the following year . He lies , as I have said , in the yard of St. Michael 's , the stone at the head of his grave bearing the epitaph mentioned ? the spelling a little difficult to decipher now , as the years have obscured the lettering with green lichen . The epitaph reads as follows : ? This inscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in part , at least , by Northern admirers of Pettignu . As it was set up shortly after the close of the war , we may suppose that partisan passion had somewhat cooled ; and thus our wonder that such words could be placed on any stone of that city , at that time , may be somewhat diminished . Doubting a little , then , whether the lassitude and indifference of after-war days were not the cause of this permission rather than a sense of justice or a continuing , obstinate regard for the dead man , we naturally ask ourselves what happened . How was he regarded at the time of his death and funeral ? His death occurred , as his epitaph tells us , in the thick of the war , the funeral taking place March 10 , 1863 . His body was , I understand , laid out in the Court House , the face being uncovered . An immense crowd gathered and viewed the corpse . Men and women , and among them many slaves , attended the service , following the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Charleston , was this funeral . The shops were closed . Nothing further was done . Some weeks later the Charleston bar held a memorial meeting . Once more there was a great concourse of his former fellow citizens . As the room would hold but a few , the people thronged the steps of the building and extended , in their mass , into the street . The leading men of the city and state ? lawyers , statesmen , soldiers , orators ? were within doors , and spoke in praise of Pettigru . And their eulogies appear to have been as open , sincere , and unstrained as we should have expected them to be the reverse . Yet among those who spoke there must have been men pledged to the doctrine of Secession ? life-long , bitter opponents of the man they mourned , who , doubtless , had received hard blows at his capable hands . Recalling those things which would unavoidably affect , the temper and mood of the men who thus celebrated Pettigru , we must not forget that there was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at that moment anchored in Northern waters , preparing to bombard and reduce Charleston . Had the speakers of the occasion delayed but a few weeks , the town would have been on lire from shells thrown into it ; and the ringing gallop of mounted infantry detailed to extinguish the flames , with the reverberations of the concussion of bombs , would have drowned the voice of their praise . But if they were safe for the moment , and perhaps not fully informed , there were other considerations which must have saddened and embittered their minds and which could very easily have rendered them intolerant . There was no speaker present who did not well know that the issue of the prolonged struggle was uncertain . Hardly a man of them but had lost some youthful member of his family . All Charleston was in mourning , severely impoverished , cruelly anxious , straining nerve and courage to meet the prolonged trial of war and the agonies of personal loss . These were the circumstances of the time and the inevitable emotions of the hour . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dead leader of a militant minority against Secession was eulogized by the supporters of Secession . His enemies expressed their admiration and their grief . The scene is surely not lacking in greatness and magnanimity . It could . however , hardly have taken place except at a time and in a place where the people , all classes of them , cherished the same moral and political ideals . There was doubtless no one present who did not admire eloquence and value probity ; who did not believe in the State and in service to the State ; or who could find anything strange in the phrase , ' He confronted Life with antique courage and Death with Christian Hope . ' There were none there who did not believe in patriotism as they understood it ; none , doubtless , who did not respond to the sentiment , ' His People did homage to the Man who held his Conscience higher than their Praise .

But , misty and remote as it all is , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people flourishes and becomes great only when its moral unity is intact ; only , or most , when its citizens are in a high degree like-minded .
