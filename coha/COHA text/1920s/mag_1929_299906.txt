Early last Monday morning Havana 's roosters crowed in healthy unison . El Gallo* himself , the President of the Republic , General Gerardo Machado y Morales , had just gone to bed and to sleep in the presidential palace . The sun would soon be rising in the wake of the crescent moon . The General had spent the full night , as is his habit , dining , dancing , talking , enjoying himself heartily . <P> At 5 : 30 a. m. the sun was rising . Venus shone with especial brilliancy . At precisely that midhour the General woke up of his own accord . He felt refreshed , vigorous . As a revolutionary against Spain from 1895 to 1898 he had learned to sleep deeply in brief periods . He pattered to his bath , a stocky , powerful man of 57 . A secretary followed , reading to him summaries of the night 's news . The President sloshed himself , dried himself , shaved himself ( the secretary reading the while ) and dressed himself in formal morning clothes . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a day of days-the 27th anniversary of the Republic 's founding and his second Inaugural . There would be a gay time in the old town+ that day and night . <P> Soon the Cabinet officers convened at the palace . Troops and police in new , bright uniforms were ranged outdoors . The populace crowded the sidewalks . Flags of Cuba and of those two score nations which had sent special envoys to the Inaugural , fluttered everywhere . Cuba always has a breeze blowing . It makes Cuba more comfortable all the year round than is any U. S. city during the U. S. summer . <P> Among the crowds gawked a lanky , weather-beaten German , Paul Muller , 47- Columbus-wise , he had sailed a 25-foot boat across the Atlantic and arrived at Havana , fortuitously , just in time for the Inaugural . His first act in Havana was to write his German sweetheart a 24-page letter , mostly about the sea and love . Soon he had much more to write to her about , for in Havana he heard many a story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authentic stories were : The General governs with **25;10285;TOOLONG . Latin-Americans want a decisive personality at their head . They speedily take advantage of any of an executive 's weaknesses . President Machado brooks no political opposition and has logrolled Cuba 's political parties to his own support . Political opponents are told to get out of Cuba . Hence the presence in the U. S. of Cubans like Dr. Rafael Itturalde , onetime Secretary of War , and Octavio Seigle , business exile ( TIME , April 29 ) . Insurrectos are promptly squelched . <P> The most vicious of them are court-martialed , shot , dumped into the Gulf of Mexico where the sharks quickly eat their cadavers . Foreign agitators are kept in discomfort aboard the Maximo Gomez , an old battleship , until they can be deported . <P> Ordinary murder brings life imprisonment at the new farm prison on the Isle of Pines . Sometimes long-term prisoners there are prompted to escape . Then they are shot quickly and carefully in the back .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
