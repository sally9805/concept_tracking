It must have been with a great many grim thoughts that Governor General Wood , acting on behalf of the Secretary of War , opened the Insular Legislature of the Philippines . He had warred all through the previous session with the Legislature , which demanded his removal . The chief occupation of the island legislators has been to say " No " when the Governor said " Yes " and to say " Yes " when they anticipated that the Governor would say " No . " <P> Seeing the faces of his tantalizers before him , who knows but that General Wood " inwardly gnashed his teeth " ? What could he say to these people ? If they liked him personally , it made no difference , because as a matter of politics they abused his every utterance publicly . So he told the legislators that public health had been very good during the past year , that the death rate had been the lowest on record , that he would cooperate with them in enacting " constructive legislation looking toward the upbuilding of Philippine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for leasing the public domain so as to encourage rubber planting . He summarized with a great flourish : <P> " A most creditable progress and a marked advance in political development have been made , but very little has been done to encourage economic development ; but upon this and the further progress of education in the Government 's activities political development very largely depends . " <P> Unfortunately , as the Governor well knew , the Filipinos have a much greater flair for politics and political scheming than for commerce and civil engineering . Perhaps the Governor sighed . But he had really little to fear in the nature of an immediate rumpus from the Legislature , for the reason that all the real political leaders are in this country , junketing and ineffectually agitating for Insular independence .
