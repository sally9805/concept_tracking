What , precisely , are these fantastic <P> African wood carvings that have been making such a stir in London and <P> Paris and are now penetrating New <P> York ? Are they new examples of ancient art just brought to light or are they a new art , like ragtime or glee-singing-the contribution of the colored race to the present generation ? <P> They are neither . They have been exhibited for years in museums , under such captions as " Idols , war implements , and kitchen utensils of the Cyzon Congo " or " Early Hardware of the Singanbrains .

It will be exhibited shortly in New York . <P> The Metropolitan Museum acquired a portrait by the earliest known painter in America , Gustavus Hesselius , a Swede , who settled in Philadelphia in 1711 . <P> An enthusiastic tipsy Tyrolean in Zurich , falling in love with Peoppel- man 's statue of Spring in a theatre lobby , tried to carry off the maiden in his arms , but she fell and crashed to ruin .
