THE SILVER VIRGIN-Ida A. R. Wylie - Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . In the little Spanish church of the Silver Virgin , where years ago he had found Justine , Gale sought sanctuary from his well-bred kindly friends . But friends being what they are , one of them broke sanctuary ; and not knowing why Gale had left Justine , begged him to be reconciled to her . Bitterly , Gale : " Do you ever read your Apocrypha ? You should . You really should . It has some fine eloquent passages . ' Like a eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning heavily . ' What a magnificent metaphor ! Those old fellows knew how to express themselves . They did n't mince matters . They got down to the heart of things . " <P> The War had sent Gale back to his passionate young wife , a husband and yet not a husband . For several years they stuck it out , till cumulative suspicion and repression hurled Justine into the arms of a lover , and Gale to the distractions of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional scarlet-cloaked trickery , but a duel during which Gale rode bareback , crashing down gorges , wallowing through torrents , staggering up embankments , till finally he brought the bull to its knees . <P> A dramatic lapse , perhaps , but an exultant climax to the even tenor of sadness that pervades the book . Miss Wylie 's characters are extremely given to hurting each other and themselves , like the pea-feeling princess . This quality of sensitive thorough-bredness makes them immensely appealing-if just a touch fairytale . <P> The similarity between this plot and hard-boiled Ernest Hemingway 's The Sun Also Rises is great but not suspicious . Ida A. R. Wylie , author of Children of Storm , The Mad Busman , has literary stature , would never stoop to pilfer.
