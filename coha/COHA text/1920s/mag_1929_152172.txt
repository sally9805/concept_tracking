Any one who wishes to buy a railroad will soon have a chance to pick one up at a forced sale . Last week the Chicago &; Alton R. R. , in receivership since 1922 , was ordered sold by Federal Judge George A. Carpenter of the Chicago District Court . Date of the sale will not be announced until priority between conflicting creditors has been settled . The Chicago &; Alton is valued at approximately 100 million dollars . Prospective purchasers are said to be Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. and Samuel Insull . <P> Founded in 1861 , the Chicago &; Alton claims to have been first to introduce dining and sleeping cars . Its main terminals are Chicago , St. Louis , Kansas City . The road was a prosperous dividend-payer for many a year , but after E. H. Harriman purchased it from T. D. Blackstone it grew more mortgages than it could carry . In 1889 it acquired a $45,000,000 mortgage , on which it has steadily paid interest . In 1900 came a $22,000,000 mortgage , held by Farmers Loan &; Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by United States Mortgage &; Trust Co. , Manhattan . No interest was paid on the $22,000,000 mortgage after the receivership of 1922 and no interest was paid by the $18,000,000 mortgage at any time . The Federal Court decided that the Farmers Loan &; Trust claim had priority over the U. S. Mortgage &; Trust claim . It is this dispute which remains to be settled before a sale-date is named .
