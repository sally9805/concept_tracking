Parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels ' Protestant Episcopal Church , in Berwyn , Chicago suburb , last week , went to the church house for dancing lessons started by the rector 's wife . She is Dorothy Deuel , famed in Broadway musical shows , before her marriage a year ago to Rev. Henry Scott Rubel , as one of a featured sister dancing team . She hopes , she said , to be able to add to the parish funds through her classes . <P> The miserere in the Episcopalian litany used to read , " Have mercy upon us , miserable sinners . " . But the phrase " miserable sinners " has been cut out . Other similar changes have indicated that Episcopalians feel that Christians have been exaggerating their own sinfulness.
