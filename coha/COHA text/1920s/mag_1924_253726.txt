In recounting ( in its issue for June 30 ) the death and record of the late Dr. Huber Gray Buehler , headmaster of the famed Maria H. Hotchkiss School , TIME set down , as leading secondary schools of the country , Hotchkiss , Taft , The Hill , Lawrenceville , Groton , Phillips Exeter , Phillips Andover . <P> Wrote a Mercersburg Academy graduate : " I , . . . along with many fellow alumni , resent the fact that you omitted the name of Mercersburg and the mention of her headmaster , Dr. William Mann Irvine , from an article which ends with this sentence : ' These are the schools which during the last quarter-century have achieved some national repute . ' You entirely ignore Mercersburg . She 's recognized as one of the five greatest- Andover , Exeter , Lawrenceville and The Hill being the other four . She is more democratic than any other school of which you made mention - perhaps that is the reason you so tactlessly passed her by . <P> " If a school is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than even Exeter and her quarterbacks , for who will ever forget Meredith or Woodring or Keck or Caldwell ; if she is to be acclaimed only for her scholastic attainments , again she reaches forth and holds those laurels with Andover ; if her greatness lies in her wealth alone , you rightfully omitted her name , for Mercersburg does not have the money that Hill does , nor does Mercersburg teach that success and happiness come hand in hand with riches . . . . " <P> Dr. William Mann Irvine , graduate of Exeter and of Princeton , has guided the destinies of Mercersburg Academy for 31 years . While a youthful Professor of Social Science at Franklin and Marshall College , Lancaster , Pa. , he was offered the headmastership shortly after his 27th birthday . He moved to Mercersburg , Pa. , found there a few acres of weeds and one old building , his " school . " Today his personality and vision are reflected in a large ( 550 enrolment ) , firmly-founded institution with a reputation for vigor , discipline ( stiff collars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> At St. Paul 's School , Concord , N. H. , moves another figure very visible upon the educational horizon - the Rev. Samuel Smith Drury , rector . Thought of by many as a formalist because of his dignified , clerical presence and rather stiff manner in public , Dr. Drury is at heart , and in method , a humanist . He believes in atmosphere . He believes in being " one of the boys " ; walks with them ; works with them ; remembers their first names forever ; keeps abreast of their family affairs . His school is noted rather for the stamp of cultured , urbane gentility that it imparts to its graduates , than for preeminence in any special line . The alumni are known to compose one of the most devoted bodies of their kind in the country . <P> Tall , " lantern-jawed , " severe of mien , Dr. Drury little resembles Dr. Frederick Luther Gamage , head of the Pawling School at Pawling , N. Y. , who is short , grayish , kindly of appearance . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolmasters " rather than " educators . " Character-building , not marks , is their mutual aim . Dr. Gamage relinquished the headmastership of St. Paul 's School , Garden City , N. Y. , after 14 years ' tenure , took with him three close associates , founded the Pawling School in 1908.
