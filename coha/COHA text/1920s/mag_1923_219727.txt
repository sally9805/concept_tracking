The probable conquest of Rocky Mountain spotted fever , a peculiar disease , the microbe of which is transmitted by the wood tick , and which is practically confined to Montana , Idaho and other northwestern states , is forecast by the discovery of a protective vaccine against the disease by Dr. Hideyo Noguchi , the distinguished Japanese pathologist of the Rockefeller Institute , who , in collaboration with Dr. Simeon B. Wolbaeh , of Harvard Medical School , has been studying the fever at Hamilton , Montana , for several months . Nine Japanese of Missoula voluntarily submitted to injections of the vaccine , although warned that its effects might be serious .
