China 's tariff has been for centuries not a national but an international affair . Most of the loans by foreign states to China have been secured by mortgages on her tariffs . Until recently these mortgages were further secured by placing the collection of Chinese tariffs in the hands of foreign officials . Last week , however , the new Nationalist Government moved to alter this situation and announced a new tariff schedule , effective Feb. , 1929 . <P> Some months ago the Nationalists served notice that they would no longer tolerate foreign control of China 's tariff machinery ( TIME , June 25 ) ; and last week it appeared that no Great Power except Japan would challenge China 's present determination to fix her tariffs without foreign interference . The new schedules provide an average tariff of 18% , as opposed to the former 5% plus 2.5% surtax . In defending this sharp increase Finance Minister T. V.
