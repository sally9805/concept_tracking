txt Cavalry horses and army mules have long shared the fortunes of war with their human brothers in arms and taken their share of praise or blame . But it is seldom brought to public notice that in the animal personnel , so to speak , of the War Department there are numbers of dogs ann cats . They . do yeoman service for their country in guarding warehouses and arsenals against the depredations of rats and mice . Hardtack , sugar , coffee , and even sailcloth , wool for mattresses , account books and registers are tempting food for rodents and require - protection . In La Grande Revue ANDRE MOUFFLET has an article on these civil servants of the French Government who serve without pay of even a sou a day . Their proper maintenance brings up problems of discipline , finance and jurisdiction to wrinkle the brows of high staff officers . Naturally , the principal problem is that of food . In some branches of national defense an allowance of 75 centimes to 1 franc 50 per month is allowed for each cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps enough to feed the animals . The army is more exact . In Official Bulletin No. 42 , page 3,776 , they go so far as to publish a recipe for " soupe canine . " " Boil the bones left over from meat " served to the men ; add the peelings " of cabbage , carrots , turnips and " leeks , previously washed . Do not " put in scraps of starchy foods . " When poured , boiling hot , over " crusts of bread cut in thin slices , " this makes an excellent food for " dogs . " In the interest of economy the theory was advanced that the cats and terriers should live on the rats and mice they caught . But if they exterminated all the rats , they would then starve to death as a reward for efficiency . This actually happened in a Cherbourg warehouse , where only four cats out of thirteen were left after four months on duty . At present the matter of allotting a daily sum for rations to animals is left to the discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen in connection with the animal personnel . To budget their rations in the proper account has been almost impossible , Commissary , Warehouse and Public Works all seeming plausible . The warehouse keeper whose watchdog had a litter of four puppies was at his wit 's end to decide how to inventory them , and finally listed them as " objects found within the arsenal walls . " Expenses for veterinary services were charged by a clever bookkeeper to an account for " articles to be repaired because of deterioration . " In 1900 an inquiry was undertaken to find the effective minimum of cats required for arsenal service . Every arsenal defended its cat personnel with vigor , feeling that it would lose in prestige if it had to reduce the number of cats . Finally a certain number was agreed to be indispensable for artillery , naval construction , maritime prisons , &c.; This distribution presupposed that cats would stay where they were put , and not go from one storehouse to another without permission from a superior officer or for merely personal reasons . Though its discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it worthy of its rations .
