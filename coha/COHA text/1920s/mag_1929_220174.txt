What is a bad egg ? One that stinks with hydrogen sulphide , or one that contains a partially formed chick . <P> What is a good egg ? One that has a thick jelly-like white , an upstanding yolk , a firm membrane separating white and yolk , a sheen over the whole contents . <P> What is a poor egg ? One with either watery or turbid white , a yolk that flattens out or bursts because of its thinned membrane , a dull appearance throughout the contents . <P> Poor eggs are practically as edible and nourishing as good eggs , merely less pleasant to look at and hence less appetizing . <P> Cornell University has been making a study of egg deterioration and preservation . Last week Paul Francis Sharp , Cornell 's professor of dairy chemistry , who has been working on the matter with other Cornell men , wrote a preliminary report to Science . Eggs spoil , he stated , because : <P> 1 ) they contain germs caught from the hen or absorbed through the shell pores ; 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition which helps break down the membrane between yellow and white ; 3 ) they are kept at a temperature too high , which causes chemical reactions , if not the formation of embryos ; .4 ) most important and only newly discovered , the alkalinity of white and yolk has increased . <P> Alkalinity increases because carbon dioxide escapes through the shell from the white . Then the white absorbs carbon dioxide from the yolk , only to lose it again through the shell . Result of the loss is that the yolks get flabby , the whites watery . <P> These observations suggested to Professor Sharp 's group the way of preserving eggs in their newly laid condition , a way which they have found efficacious . <P> It is simple : store the eggs in a place filled with a low concentration of carbon dioxide . That keeps a carbon dioxide balance within and without the eggs . Cost is 1 per case of eggs , .03 per dozen .                   @ @
