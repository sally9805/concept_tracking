The sun has set over the great marsh , leaving a yellow-brown Flemish light upon the scene . In the midst of the mire and among the tufts of iron-grass stands an old round tower . Its lower narrow door is of green bronze , scarred with many assaults . Above the door are two small windows , behind which a gleam seems to come and go . In the half-light that hangs over the plain a man in armor stumbles through the bog to the single step before the door . He is many times wounded ; his blood flows freely to the ground . The knight blows his horn ; the landscape collects itself to listen . ROLAND I die Open the door to me . ( The landscape laughs , then falls suddenly silent . Presently its subterranean waters are again heard sucking at buried tree trunks . ) I have seen your lights here from a long way off You can not hide from me now . ( The marsh becomes animated and fully interested in the stranger . One of the windows brightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner are strangely detached and impersonal , as though she had been called away from some absorbing interest , and was eager to return to it . ) Oh , you are here ! Quick , descend to me . All my wounds are flowing . I am dying of thirst . THE GIRL Who are you to issue commands against this tower ? Some emperor , surely . p. 3 ROLAND My name is written with many another upon the sword of Charlemagne : That is enough . THE GIRL You are some king , perhaps  --  driven into the wilderness by your not too loving subjects ? ROLAND No king , but a friend and soldier of kings . THE GIRL Oh ! This is some wise counselor . If you are so wise we will quickly open the door to you . ROLAND Not wise , but often listened to in grave matters , having a voice equal with many others . THE GIRL ( Utterly untouched , lightly to someone within ) : I do believe this is some sweet singer . Let us bind on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for poets are ever our delight . ROLAND I am no singer , but one loving the string and the voice at all times . Open the door ! For the wind is cold on the marsh , and the first terrible stars are stepping into their chains . Open the door , for my veins are emptied on your sill . THE GIRL ( Leaning far out , while her red hair falls almost to his shoulders ) : Beat upon the door , Sir Knight . Many things are gained by force . ROLAND My hands are strengthless I am fallen on my knees Pity me ! ( The Girl laughs pleasantly to her companion within . ) Reach over the stars to me , Mary , Mother of God . To you I was committed in my first year , and have renewed yearly my promises . Send from thy golden mind and thy voiceless might the issue out of this difficulty . ( A second girl , dark and thoughtful , appears at the other window. ) p. 4 THE GIRL ( Intimately ) : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy . His thoughts this last hour are returning to his earliest year . THE GIRL Is it not beautiful that a knight should think of a little child ? THE DARK GIRL What brought you here , Knight-at-Arms ? ROLAND The battle passed suddenly into the west . This tower was all I could see . And here I brought my wounds . THE GIRL ( Softly ) : You see he is still able to reason ; he reasons very well . THE DARK GIRL What led you to think that we could help you ? ROLAND I know your name ! All my life I have heard of this tower . They say that on the outside you are dark and unlovely , but that within every hero stands with his fellows and the great queens step proudly on the stair . THE DARK GIRL And do you believe this ? ROLAND ( After a pause ) : Yes . ( With sudden fury ) Open the door ! There is a place for me within . Open the door , Death ! THE GIRL ( Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great man . p. 5 ROLAND Oliver ! Oliver ! Charlemagne ! I hear your voices . It is I , Roland , without , in the dark marsh . My body I cast away for you . My breath I returned to the sky in your defense . Open the door ! ( The marsh is a little put out by all this strong feeling . It lies quiet . The door slowly opens upon a hall full of drifting violet mists , some of which escape and fade over the marsh . The Girl with the red hair is seen walking away in the hall , her mocking face looking back over her shoulder . The Dark Girl , robed in gray , leans across the threshold extending a chalice to the knight 's lips. )
