The reception of the President 's message to Congress was extraordinarily nonpartisan . The Republican comment was the usual hymn of praise , a little more unanimous than usual . The Democratic comment was surprisingly mild for the comment of an opposition party . The following opinions were all expressed by Democrats : <P> Senator Swanson : " I am especially gratified with what occurs in this message relating to adherence to the Permanent Court of International Justice . Its presentation is clear , forceful and most convincing . " <P> Senator Reed of Missouri : " The President 's argument on the World Court is at war with the facts . It is at best , a specimen of special pleading , and , I think , from premise to conclusion utterly unsound . " <P> Senator Caraway : " Words . " <P> Senator King : " Rather colorless . " <P> Senator Fletcher : " Very strong document . " <P> Senator Simmons : " I thought it was one of the strongest documents the President has sent us up to this time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his recommendations as altogether sound , and I view some of them as quite fallacious , but they are all clearly and strongly presented . His tax recommendations amount to little more than an endorsement of the plan of Secretary Mellon . " <P> Representative Garner : " There may be something in the rumor that the Secretary of the Treasury , Mr. Mellon , is going to resign , since the President approves the tax bill which differs in most respects from what was advocated by Mr. Mellon , and since we did not carry out Mr. Mellon 's recommendations . " <P> Representative Hull : " The old story . " <P> Representative Crisp : " A splendid message . " <P> Representative Connolly . " First-class platform for a third term . "
