AT intervals we like to take a broad-scale view of the world to see how things are going . As we write , plans are under way to make September " safety month " for New Jersey motorists . Nathalia Crane is celebrating her fifteenth birthday and says she is not in love but is publishing another book . Gene Tunney is on an island in Maine , with photographers keeping vigil on the mainland . Three men in a florist shop in East Eighty-sixth Street are sitting in their shirt-sleeves , perspiring freely , making little Christmas trees . Steam shovels are lying in wait for Park Avenue , Julius Miller having given permission to rip it up again . President Coolidge and Dr. Cadman , in different parts of the country , are resting after writing a testimonial for Paul Block on his purchase of the Brooklyn Standard Union . ( They both approved . ) The dramatic critic of the Ilrrld has finished writing her criticism of night-before-last 's play , The window-washer on the ledge at our elbow has just poked his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . And the statue of David Farragut in Madison Square has just shifted its weight from one font to the other in contemplation of traffic . r l-IUNDER and lightning should not be allowed within the city limits . In the open country a man can either laugh at the elements or take to his heels . But in town , feel the way you may about it , lightning ferrets you out , catches you in bad moments . We were just stepping into the shower bath when the last storm broke  --  the heavens chose that moment to rend themselves apart and send noisy flashes into our secluded bathroom . Naked and for-ken , we did not know whether to get under the shower or not , because we could n't remember about that . Every time we mustered the courage to poke a tentative shoulder under the spray , a jagged bolt would come ripping in through the window , sending us toppling back out of range of the water . No amount of self-inducement sufficed . We finally dressed in noisy shame , and spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hail a cab . PERHAPS it was wise of Al Smith to challenge Dr. Straton , but we rather doubt it . Nobody can lick Dr. Straton in a debate because . he continually shifts the talk upward , toward heaven , or downward , toward hell  --  a trick of all ballyhoo experts . He has started already . lie claims to have caught Mr. Smith quoting Scripture and quoting it wrong . In his unctuous letter of August 9 to the Governor , he points out that Mr. Smith credited the advice , " Thou shalt not bear false witness , " to Christ instead of to Moses . A big help that 's going to be to the Democratic party ! Furthermore , only a few people , relatively , will follow the debate intelligently enough to weigh its merits as a political or moral issue . To millions of people it will mean nothing , except that a well-known Catholic is having a public argument with a well-known Protestant . ALTHOUGH America has almost 1 no traditions , it is true that everybody stands up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk , no corporation lawyer , no stockroom assistant would dream of transgressing that custom . They go about it in the same way that a French host goes about pouring out a little wine in his own glass before serving his guest  --  except that it 's not as much fun . We watched a game at the Polo Grounds recently . A gray-haired man on our left , noticing that we failed to rise promptly for the seventh-inning ritual , glared down at us as though we had failed to uncover for the flag . In less than a second we were on our feet , trembling slightly and vowing to be a better American . A LADY writes in to Harper 's 11.11Ia ga:Line to say that New York City has certain peculiar odors which always affect her deeply . Once , after a prolonged absence from the city , she was so overcome by the dear old smells of the subway that she wept , she says , all the way uptown . Personally we are calloused and almost never weep in public because of familiar odors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will choke us up on a hot day . It is certain sights about town that overcome us . For example , 157,71 o ? no ceiea. we never step into the elevated station at Sixth Avenue and Thirty-eighth Street but that we break down . The old place reminds us of a small railroad station  --  cuspidors , cracked stove , and all  --  where we used to descend , as a child , on our way to visit our grandaunt 's farm . Accidents WHEN a piece of scenery in the V V dentist scene of the " Vanities " wavered and started to topple the other night , W. C. Fields , sometimes known as the world 's funniest dentist , seized it in the nick of time and got it back to the perpendicular again . While the audience was wondering whether to be a little bit embarrassed about the accident , Mr. Fields settled the question for them by remarking in his regretful voice : " They do n't put up these buildings the way they used to . " Of course , the really big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the program . The picture of Dorothy Knapp , " the most beautiful girl in the world , " turned out to be not Dorothy at all , but Naomi Johnson . At first it seemed like an awful mistake . On inquiry , however , it was discovered that Naomi was the second most beautiful girl in the world . This was a pretty lucky break for the printer . One Wonderful Hour THE Byrd-Hops-Off Hour , given through the courtesy of the Tidewater Oil Company , was in some respects the high-water mark of our summer . Having been about a great deal , we have the vanity to believe we can outguess any entertainment and know what is going to happen . This was a night of surprises . We were surprised when Mayor Walker got up to speak . Not one of the two hundred persons in the gray and gold room of the National Broadcasting Company forgot himself and applauded . This definitely establishes a broadcasting room as more awesome than a church even , for Mr. Walker was applauded in a church the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his broadcasting and that was surprising . He kept turning , with his little grimaces , to his visible audience , which was behind him , and thus many of his words were lost on the twelve million persons who were , figuratively , in front of him . A nervous , tip-toeing radio man touched the mayor 's back and pushed him nearer the microphone . The mayor ventured a wisecrack about this , and fumbled it . That was surprising . If the awe-struck audience 's , immobility unsettled the mayor , the whole soft-shoe procedure unsettled the sturdy members of Byrd 's crew , his chief cook , his steward , his mechanic , all stiff and uneasy in front-row seats . Big and strong fellows , they were cowed by fussy gentlemen who directed them , by little gestures , to stand up , to say something , to shut up , to sit down . Each man bravely spoke a tremulous , albeit well-rehearsed , line over the radio and resumed his seat , frightened . The ordeal was painful . The audience stirred restlessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech in calm , easy cadences , thanking those who have aided him , thanking especially , in a neatly turned phrase , the Tidewater Oil Company , makers of Verdi ) . THE attempt to give in a soft-toned gray and gold room , the lusty , hustling effect of a crew of muscular adventurers loading their ship , did not exactly come off . A tall man in a dinner jacket kept solemnly dropping a heavy iron chain onto the floor , picking it up and dropping it again . Another man blew a deep-toned whistle . The members of the orchestra growled and murmured and said " Gangway . " A fat second-violin stomped both feet . This imitation of the loading of the Byrd ship at the Jersey docks accompanied the announcement over the radio of the inventory of the ship 's cargo , including Veedol oil . The racket was suspended at intervals for musical numbers , and fur the reading of breathless telegrams of Godspeed from Assistant Secretary of the Navy Robinson , Gene Tunney , Vice-President Shea of the Tidewater Oil Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If men must fly , women must pray , " was received without a sound one way or the other . The climax came when a colored youth in a white jacket read a speech for Matt Hansen , the negro hero who is the only survivor of Peary 's dash to the pole . The colored youth was superb . Heckled every few paragraphs by the wild gesturing of the orchestra leader , he paused each time at the right place . This gave Grieg 's " In the Hall of the Mountain King " a break . That piece accompanied the youth throughout his fifteen-minute talk except when he told , or tried to tell , about the April day when Peary planted the American flag in the ice of the North Pole . At this point hell broke loose . The man with the chain dropped it rapidly , the man with the whistle blew it loudly , a canvas wind machine was set going , a motor was turned on which flapped four strips of leather against a table leg in imitation of an airplane engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two French-horn players leaped to their feet and blared " The Stars and Stripes Forever . " No pigeons were let loose . Afterwards , on the way down in the elevator , a clerkish chap who did n't appear strong enough to do it , said he was going to get off at the thirteenth floor for the Palmolive hour , and did . Personally , we were at home , tired but happy , by 9:30 . All The Conveniences MOTORING along the Fordham Road parkway , a Manhattan attorney and his wife beheld a woman peering with a frown beneath the raised hood of a sedan parked at the roadside . The lawyer drew up , hopped out , and ran gallantly to her assistance , noting as he did so that there was an elderly woman in the back seat holding a baby . " What 's the trouble ? " asked the knight of the highway . " No trouble at all , " said the lady . " I just stopped to heat the baby 's bottle against the engine . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the concerts in the Lewisohn Stadium of summers , arrived in New York for the first time , his visiting card read " Willy van Hoogstraaten . " It was not until he appeared as conductor of the Philharmonic Orchestra at two special concerts that hr traded the juvenile " Willy " for the adult " Willem . " The elimination of the second " a " in " Hoogstraaten " was the work of a managerial assistant who thought that the young Dutch conductor 's name was too long . Van Hoogstraten came to America in the hope of finding a few concerts to conduct here and there and also , if possible , to appear as a violinist in chamber music . Since 1921 , he has conducted hundreds of concerts , but he has yet to play his fiddle in public . He invariably makes a hit at his first performance with an orchestra , and so he has been kept too busy conducting to indulge in chamber music . His &but; brought him a season at the Stadium , and he still is the resident director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared the New York Philharmonic winter season with Willem Mengel-berg , and for the past three years he has been conductor of the Portland ( Ore . ) Symphony Orchestra , which he has brought up from an experiment to a sell-out . Between times , he has conducted at the Hollywood Bowl , Philadelphia , St. Louis , Detroit , and elsewhere . When van Hoogstraten is in town he usually lives at the Great Northern Hotel . He has taken out citizenship papers and he likes anything that he considers " American . " A soda fountain is a source of fascination for him , and he always can find entertainment in newspaper headlines . He is so well versed in headline usage , in fact , that he can carry on a conversation in that verbiage , and sometimes he does . He thinks that radio broadcasting is a great institution and he likes to say a few words to the listeners-in when the Stadium concerts are broadcast . Close observation of professional announcers is responsible for his habit of beginning his radio remarks with , " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straten speaking . " His English is absolutely grammatical and colloquial , and there is only a slight Hollandish inflection to betray that he is not a native . For three years he has refrained from reading newspaper criticism of his efforts . He says that the agitation of a fellow conductor who invariably read all of the critics and tried to please all cured him of looking at reviews . Pressed , he will admit that he has broken his rule twice in these three years  --  both times to ascertain the reception of new works which he had introduced rather than to discover the verdict on his own direction of them . He likes jazz . It will be remembered that he conducted a Gcrshwin program at the Stadium last Summer . F'te Day DEOPLE have started to tell us about their vacations , unfortunate1 ly . So far , the only story we have bothered to listen to was told us by a lady whose bedroom in a Paris hotel was entered by a man one morning . He had flags and banners in his arms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and spent about half an hour noisily hanging out the flags . Then he left . Disgruntled at having been awakened , and puzzled over the reason for flags , the lady finally decided it must be Bastille Day , and went back to sleep . Later , when she went down to lunch , the concierge informed her that it was a big day in town  --  it was the convention of the American Retail Garment Makers Association . Ah , Paris . Lonely Hearts OO NE hot Saturday afternoon " The Ladder " played to an audience of four persons  --  three downstairs , one up . These warm evenings the average audience is about sixteen . In fact , the Cort Theatre is the one sanctuary in New York where a man can go to get away from people . Going is a little embarrassing , though . The box-office man smiles at the doorman as he takes your three dollars and hands you B-4 ; the doorman smiles at the usher as he tears off the stub ; the usher smiles at you as she takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Six other people , who have arrived ahead of you , turn and stare and smile . A hush is over everything . The night we went we did n't like B-4 , and journeyed back up the long empty aisle to change it . " Well , just take any seat , " the box-office man said , cheerfully . So we wandered about through the rows , trying several locations till we found something nice . Four more people arrived , slightly dazed ; soft music began to come from somewhere ; the curtain went up ; a gray-haired gentleman slumped down in a last-row scat and began picking his teeth ; and the . how was on . What always surprises us at " The Ladder " ( and we go quite often ) is thespirit of the actors . We always have the feeling that one of them is going to yawn and remark : " This is n't much fun  --  let 's start a crap game . " On the contrary , they perform superbly , slurring not one syllable . Whether they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when not even one patron turns up , no one can say . Edgar B. Davis , the guardian angel , knows the answer , but he is abroad . A renowned statistician tells us that the weekly gross is about three hundred dollars , the weekly cost about eleven thousand . There are twenty-five actors , or approximately one and one-third actor to each member of the audience . Carroll McComas , who plays the lead , is now on vacation . For us , getting in " The Ladder " was not as embarrassing as getting out . We left at ten o'clock , and it just happened that " Elmer Gantry , " directly across the street , was enjoying an intermission , and the sidewalk in front of the Playhouse was crowded . As we emerged , a solitary vagabond , through the white portals of the Curt , one of the merryandrews across the way caught sight of us . " Look , " he cried , pointing , " I see ' The Ladder ' had a good house tonight ! " A great tittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. VAN SLYKE  --  We shall call him , V1 that  --  awoke one morning to find AUGUST 1 8 , 19 28 himself in the apartment of a friend whose wife is in Maine . The friend had gone on to work , but Mr. Van Slyke had n't . He felt rather badly . The apartment was one of those old affairs with a dumb-waiter shaft . Presently up that shaft came a voice . Mr. Van Slyke arose and went to the shaft . " Milk ? " asked the milkman . " Black coffee for me , " said Mr. Van Slyke , and went back to bed . Shine FORTUNATELY for us , who would never have had the strength to get at the facts ourself , a man has told us how the shoe-shine boys make a living . His investigation was conducted in one of the eighteen Klein shoe-repair shops around town , which employ ninety colored boys . Each boy pays a dollar a day for the shoe-shining concession except on rainy days , when the charge is cut to fifty cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual tip , and hence a boy has to have twenty patrons before he begins to make any money for himself . On clear days most boys average about one hundred customers and thus earn around four dollars ( the company supplies polish and brushes ) . One out of fifty men gives a dime as a tip . A quarter tip is very rare and the boys generally keep these for lucky coins . The workers live in fear of " detectives " employed to check up on their behavior . It seems there is a great instability in help due to frequent adverse reports by these ogres . The hours arc from seven-thirty in the morning until seven-thirty in the evening . The prima donnas of the profession arc those lads who can play a sort of tap-dance on your shoes with their polishing cloth . ? SPEAKING of English addresses , as must from time to time , we have come upon this one : Bonney Bland , Sutton Bland , Bonney 's End , Charing , Kent .
