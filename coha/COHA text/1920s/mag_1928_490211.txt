To prove that it is as merry as the next organization , Western Union is offering a special Gift Order blank , by which you can transmit money to a friend as a Christmas present . Of course , while it behooves no man to look a Western Union Gift Order in the mouth , still we have been puzzling over the possible effect the specially selected messages which accompany the order might have . Take Message 25 : " I do not know what gift will please you best ; will you come to my rescue and make the choice for me ? " We know at least three people who would welcome such a message and make instantaneous reply : " Frankly , yes . And your enclosure does n't cover it . " WE disagree with the World about the Army 's blue uniforms . The TV oriel sees in them a token of peace .

Well , handsome is as handsome does : give a soldier enough plumage and before long he 's off to the wars , to seek purification by fire . THE New York Central Building , which always has a lot of automobiles up its sleeve , works pretty well on the whole . Having nothing better to do , we personally inspected the entire Grand Central zone traffic situation and found only a normal amount of congestion . Three separate and distinct policeinen told us that things have been better since the new ramps were built , and three Nrw York policemen ca n't be wrong . Although the ramps through the building and the causeway south of the terminal are narrower than the avenue which they serve , there is no bottle-neck , for the reason that about a third of the traffic turns off into crosstown streets .

Cars drive into them valiantly , three abreast , but thin out into single file getting around the corners . Well , let them . We ca n't have everything . INsome ways , we will be sorry to see the Tenement Law revised to make cooking pantries legal ; for although the law is obsolete , it has come to be as simple and lovable as the ridiculous old prohibition amendment . It just happens that we have an illegal pantry in our own modest little palace , and sometimes on mornings when we feel like it , we steal nut of bed while the cook is still asleep , just for the illicit pleasure of plugging-in the bootleg stove and setting the bootleg coffee to perking . Really , nothing is cozier on these wintry morns than an unsanctioned stove in an unventilated pantry . r-r HE pain which attends all literary composition is increased , in some cases , by the writer 's knowing how much per word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer at his work recently , and were allowed to sit quietly by while he finished his stint .

Her Stars THE dependence which many ladies place in astrologers and astrology may extend to the matter of choosing an anesthetic at the dentist 's .

It is a beautiful experience , full of the cold , swift mystery of underwater . So craftily have the specimens been staged and lighted that , instead of being just an exhibit of fish , it is a sort of submarine adventure , from which you emerge with fear in your heart and seaweed in your hair . Among the major hazards encountered in collecting the specimens was the ease with which Dr. William K. Gregory , the curator , got seasick . For a seasick ichthyologist to persevere somehow strikes us as heroism of a high order . Dr. Beebe , luckier , works without a trace of nausea . Fish are tart , predatory things , unfriendly even when they are wagging their tails ; and this gruesome and merciless quality is marvelously interpreted in the new hall . Sharks , rovers of the sea , are attacking a loggerhead turtle as you enter the room . Everywhere you go is the relentless chase , the fierce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plumy regions of the Sargasso Sea , or the unlighted floor of the deep sea where no plant can live and where a fish , to exist , must carry his own light and fight like a dragon . You will go in dark corridors and see lantern fish that swim deep by day and come to the surface at night ; you will witness the flash of the sailfish when it leaps clear with the sportsman 's Line ; you will wander where the terrible hags and the lampreys have come up from the sea to dig nests in the stony beds of little rivers . You will observe the male catfish , incubating his wife 's eggs by holding them in his mouth  --  starving himself to keep the race of catfish alive . You will see Zane Grey 's huge trophies ( he is called Dr. Grey on the charts , but do n't let that throw you off ) ; and you will see movies of undersea life by merely pressing a button .

" Miss K is had den MAUDE ADAMS bobbed up in the papers again last week , as she dues shout once a year , this time as having contributed some articles to a benefit sale for a convent . Small items of the sort are the most the papers may expect of her now . The famous actress has not been found by reporters since she came back from Europe a few years ago , and even then she insisted on being known simply as Miss Kiskadden  --  her real name  --  saying solemnly , in answer to all questions , " Maude Adams is not here . " Miss Adams ' escape into private life has been made with remarkable success . A legend persists that when she is in this city she hides away in the convent of the Cenacle of St. Regis in 141lth Street . Such indeed was her custom some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She now spends most of the year in town , and for a long time has lived in a small apartment in the Thirties , which she shares ? sith a woman companion . She has a private phone , and receives her mail at a woman 's club , where she also meets her friends  --  must of them associates of her stage days , and all of them sworn to guard the secret of her address . Her social activities are restricted to informal teas or chats , except for an annual dinner given in the Frohman offices and attended by herself , Mr. Frohman , Mrs. Fiske , William Gillette , and one or two others . She gets about town quite a lot , however , shopping , or in the interest of charity , which has always occupied much of her time . She invariably uses a taxi . She owns no car  --  not , ap-parently , because she is intimidated by contraptions of the machine age . Not long ago she went shopping for a speed boat in which she thought to commute between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would have none of a small craft which could do only thirty miles an hour , but was as delighted as a child with another which had a speed of sixty . This cost forty-five thousand dollars , and while she considered buying it , she finally deferred the purchase . She has always been careless of the importance of money . In the heyday of her career she is thought to have spent a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year for charitable purposes . She is now said to enjoy a comfortable income from investments she has made , and from a sum of money which her solicitous attorneys set aside for her some years agO . TIRTUALLY every producer in town has tried to get her to return to the stage ( in one or two cases contracts were prepared ) but she always escapes in the end . Once she went to Washington to see a Sheridan revival , at the instance of Mr. Tyler , but she refused to play in it , just as she rejected not Long ago Mr. Erlanger 's offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past eight or ten years  --  she quit the theatre in 1918 ? she has been firm in her decision never to appear in a rMe she has previously played and lately it has been apparent that she does not intend to return in any ploy at all . She gives as her reasons that she never liked the stage , that her art was no deeper than a " trick of personality , " and that she is , for once , " living importantly . " By the last , she means her five years of experimenting in color photography and her dream of producing a movie of Kipling 's " Kim , " She returns unopened all letters which look businesslike , and among those who have had letters sent backis the Governor of Utah , who wanted her to appear at a performance in Salt Lake City . She was horn in that city , of Mormon parentage , and first appeared there on the stage . She invariably returns invitations to attend theatrical performances because when she once accepted tickets and went to see Doris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was sought out and spoken to . After that experience Miss Adams remained away from Broadway for a long time . In the past year or so , however , she has seen a few plays , among them " Saturday 's Children , " which she did not like because it seemed to her a form of " obstetrics on the stage . " Samaritan AN Erie commuter tells us that one day last week , at nine in the no rning , a young man in full evening dress stood in the ' Thirty-third Street entrance to the Hudson Tubes asking the passers-by to lend him a nickel . Anyone could see that he was not a panhandler , but apparently the crowd thought he was doing it for a bet or was being initiated into some fraternity . For ten minutes he got nothing at all except a few giggles from the salesgirls hurrying to work , but several people paused to watch him , among them a middle-aged , overdressed fellow with a diamond on his finger . After a short time the elaborate gentleman approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A fellow dressed up should not ask a nickel , " he said . " You want a ride home ; go up and get a taxi . " C oupons AMAN who spends a lot of his time around cigar stores and places like that has just told us that several hawkers about town are doing a brisk business buying coupons at a discount , which they then turn in at their full value for premiums . The profit-sharing companies do n't like this very much , but there does n't seem to he anything they can do about it . Coupons , by the way , are numbered and registered so that payment can be stopped in case of theft or loss . Ordinarily , when coupons are redeemed the premiums must be chosen from a set list , but occasionally an exception is made . Not long ago a hey sent in some coupons and asked for a pair of waterwings . None could be found in the regular stock ; and finally the matter was taken to the manager , who bought a pair especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mostly for powder , lingerie , and hosiery , while the men choose razors , hairbrushes , and pocketknives . The most expensive premium is a vacuum cleaner , for which you have to have thirty-three hundred coupons . Quite a lot of people get them too . The premium-redemption people are n't exactly sure what the record is for coupons accumulated by one person but they think it 's something like ten thousand . This interested us ; and we figured out that the sum represented approximately sixteen thousand packages of twenty-cent cigarettes . One woman , we learned , came into one of the premium stores the other day with eight thousand coupons in a suitcase . She exchanged a few for some little thing and left the rest on deposit as a drawing account . Gypped y AI ST Saturday I night two gentlemen were standing in line at the " Vanities " box office when a pretty young woman came up and asked one of the men if he wanted two good seats . She said she had two in the third row , but found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a sick child at home . She held up the stubs of two tickets . Suspecting some sort of razzle-dazzle , the larger and wiser of the two men said he would buy the seats at their box-office value , if the doorman said the checks were all right . This the doorman did say , and the gentleman paid the lady fifteen dollars and forty cents for the ticket-ends . When the two men went down the aisle , their worst fears were confirmed , for in one of the appointed places sat a soft , happy , fat man . Asked by the usher for his seat check , he explained that his companion had them and had gone out to phone , but would be back soon . The news was then broken to him as gently as possible that his fair companion would never come back and that she had resold the tickets he had purchased . Uttering loud protests against women and theatres , the unfortunate fellow finally gave up his seat . This means that you should either hold on to your seat checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a sort of buddy of the Airways people . Last week they invited us to take a trip over the city again , this time at night . Whistling uncertainly , we hopped into a tri-motored plane with a dozen other persons . Our small fright abated to a feeling of ease because the man in front of us wore an opera hat and smoked a cigarette in a holder . Colonial Airways hope to make this flight , which takes place twice every clear night , popular with dinner and afterthe-theatre parties , and seem likely to succeed . The trip is a beautiful adventure . After dark the air field at Newark twinkles with small lanterns , planted at the edge of the runways . As you zoom upward these lanterns begin to move , but your eyes have deceived you , for what you now see are the lemon-colored lamps of automobiles plying the outer boulevard . Colossal patterns of lights spread out below . Brooklyn is a lovely field of incandescent lilies , and Jersey smolders in the west , an incredible fairyland . One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights which swing from the tops of their hotels . We passed over Manhattan thirty-five hundred feet high , but even so could pick out easily the Fisk Tire sign , the Tudor City lights , and half a dozen others , and although nearly a mile in the air could read the news flashing from Times Square that the Chevrolet is a great car . Broadway is a thin fuse sputtering across town and exploding the set-piece of the Forties in a burst of red and green and yellow lights . After this display has been left behind , Central Park appears like a great soft carpet , the figures in its restless design shifting dreamily with the flow of automobile lights . Here and there a short circuit has occurred in the electrical show , THE NEW YORKER especially where the East River has gone black . Its water seems to have inundated the streets , for they are black too . Of course no human forms are to be seen . The carnival has been deserted by men , who have left its machinery pulsing and winking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learned recently , has a new club for its Englishmen . For many years a small British lunch club has met regularly at 53 Broadway and there you could always see Savile Row clothes and hear the broad vowel . Now there is something more ambitious , and a complete clubhouse stands with quiet dignity among the tables d'hfite and speakeasies of Forty-ninth Street . The initials B.C.C. ( British Commonwealth Club ) are modestly displayed upon the doormat. 1Ve went there the other day as somebody 's guest ; it was quiet and very British . Nobody hailed us . We had the kind of dinner that we have not experienced since we last saw Fleet Street  --  steak and kidney pie , Brussels sprouts , apple tart , and tea . After that we sank into a big chair and read the Tatler . In one particular , however , the club breaks away from all respectable tradition . Upstairs , instead of the customary British billiard room , there is a ping-pong room . Thus does the Empire keep abreast of things . The Honor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can manage , the not inconsiderable number of our fellow townsmen who are addicted to the new-minted prose of Walter Winchell will eventually have to buy the Evening Journal . Within the last few days this chattering magpie of Broadway has signed a staggering two-year contract with that elder gazette , which , to use one of his own phrases , is very " high-bicycle " compared with his present Graphic- . The journalistic confidence that Winchell is no mere flash in the pan is indicated by the fact that the two years aforesaid may begin as late as May , 1931 , unless he can wriggle free sooner . For some time past he has been straining at the Graphic leash , and has been pouting visibly ever since its editor suppressed his rapturous review of " Animal Crackers . " Winchell had been at such pains to attend the opening performance of that harlequinade . Barred by the Messrs . Shubert , in one of whose theatres it was being produced , it became a battle of what might ( by the elasticity of our language ) be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under orders to hurl the offending journalist into the gutter , but Winchell went in on the delighted arm of Harpo Marx . Harpo had disguised him with a hump for his back and a proliferation of crepe whiskers for his chin , and plausibly introduced him to the backstage world as a long-missing uncle of the Marx Brothers . Trampled on by stage hands , and engulfed from time to time in waves of chorus girls , he saw the whale show from the wings , and was pounding out a triumphant paean of praise on his typewriter when his boss , Emil Gauvreau , warned him that impressions of the Seven Arts , when gathered in such a manner , scarcely deserved publication . " No , Walter , it wo n't do , " said Mr. Gauvreau , in words which should go down in journalistic history . " It would hardly be dignified for the Graphic . "
