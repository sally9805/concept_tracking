The annual congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution was held at Washington . At the opening session speeches were made by President Harding , Secretary Hughes and Mrs. George Maynard Minor of Connecticut , retiring President General of the organization . Patriotism and opposition to radical tendencies were the keynotes of all the speeches . <P> Said the President : " Never has mankind faced difficulties of so varied a character or on so huge a scale as is now propounded to it . ... I think it is no unseemly boast to say that America is one of the governmental models of the world-the highest type of democracy on earth ! " <P> Among the other speakers were the French Ambassador , M. Jules Jusserand ; the British Ambassador , Sir Auckland Geddes ; the Belgian Ambassador , Baron de Cartier ; and General Lord , Director of the Budget .

Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Wallace W. Hanger of Washington , wife of the vice chairman of the United States Railroad Labor Board ; Mrs. William Gumming Story of New York , former President General of the society . <P> The excitement began when anonymous letters were circulated among the delegates attacking the war record of Mrs. Cook 's son . Mrs. Cook made a direct denial of the charges , as did the Pennsylvania delegation . On the night of formal nomination Mrs. Hanger received a great ovation- three minutes of applause and two minutes of cheering . Mrs. Cook 's ovation lasted for three minutes , total . Immediately after Mrs. Story was nominated , she rose on a point of personal privilege and withdrew her nomination , releasing her delegates and asking them to vote for Mrs. Cook . The reason she gave was that she would not take part in any campaign which was carried out by defamation of character . Amid the uproar Mrs. Cook jumped to her feet . " I see no reason why Mrs. Story should withdraw in my favor , and am perfectly willing to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A wild demonstration followed , lasting three minutes . <P> At nine the next morning balloting began . Excitement ran high . The 1.800 delegates in their eagerness to vote broke through the rope that held them back . Policemen and firemen were summoned to restore order . At eight in the evening the polls closed . At eleven the count was not completed and the convention adjourned till the following day at ten a.m . The tellers were closeted counting the ballots till the early hours of the morning . Gradually news leaked out that Mrs. Cook was ahead . <P> When the official count was announced it ran : Mrs. Cook , 940 ; Mrs. Hanger , 779 . All on Mrs. Cook 's ticket were elected except the nominee for Chaplain General . Mrs. Thomas A.
