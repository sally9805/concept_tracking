Anna Putriuniate , 17 , native of Lithuania , dressmaker in Montreal , Canada , wanted to become a resident of the U. S. She paid a man $50 to show her how . He took her one Sunday night to the gorge dam at Niagara Falls , lowered her by a rope to the trestle of the Michigan Central Railroad . With little , cautious steps she walked along the cold steel girders , while the Whirlpool Rapids 250 feet below howled at her . She was shrewd enough to put her legs in trousers instead of flapping , treacherous skirts . She reached U. S. soil . Last week she was arrested with four other young women who had crossed from Canada in rowboats the night after her bridge-walk . All were held as witnesses against a band of five alien smugglers . Commented the New York World : " Perhaps , then , in wattle huts and thatched roofs , in crowded slums and picturesque villages of the old familiar parts of the world , they still think of this U. S. as the promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than strive to make it that . "
