THE SAVOUR OF LIFE-Arnold Bennett-Doubleday Doran ( $2.50 ) . Mr. Bennett has a grievance . People tell him he is a greater novelist than journalist , and he does n't like it , because he has more fun being a journalist . So he writes a great many essays on a great many subjects to prove that a good modern novelist is essentially a journalist . But the fact remains that none of his journalism is as good as Clayhanger or The Old Wives ' Tale . <P> The great many subjects in the present collection bristle with further grievances-none of them new ; flimsy partitions in European hotels ; doctors ' persistence in dealing with symptoms rather than causes ; England 's refusal to adopt the efficient decimal system ; U. S. film kings ; man 's servitude to alcohol ; young authors ( stream-of-consciousness school ) who do not write like Mr. Bennett .
