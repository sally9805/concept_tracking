Faster , faster , faster they went . Around the turn , along the back stretch , faster , faster , faster . Fifty thousand people rose to watch them finish , those eight swift-galloping horses , seven of America 's best against the best of France . Into the home stretch they swept , brown and black bodies , flashing colored silks , rising , falling , tearing through their own mad dust-cloud . <P> Up to the grandstand , past the judges ' stand they thundered , and it was seen that Sarazen led all the rest . A length and a half behind Sarazen , a nose ahead of brown Mad Play , came Epinard , runner-up a third time in the international races for which he crossed the Atlantic . Came Altawood , Princess Doreen , Little Chief , My Play , Chilowee . <P> The scene was Latonia , Kentucky ; the distance run , a mile and a quarter . <P> When the prizes were distributed , Mrs. William Kissam Vanderbilt II could not restrain a smile , several smiles . Horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a bit grimly . His Epinard had failed him again , for second money does not become " the finest horseflesh of France . "
