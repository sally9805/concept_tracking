No Springboard <P> Sirs : <P> You did me the honor to print my letter of May 23 , but again you indulged in your proclivity for footnotes , and when it comes to " foot " notes you seem to have a penchant for putting your foot in it ! <P> I turned several forward somersaults from the mat and not one from the springboard . I did somersaults backward from the springboard and from the mat . I do not know where your reporter got this information . <P> IRVING K. POND <P> P. S.-It may be interesting to you to know that such notes as you have favored me with , which are not at all uncommon in TIME , tend to make the magazine a bit tiresome and have lost it more than one of its earlier subscribers . <P> I. K. P. <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> TIME inferred that Mr. Pond had done his somersaults from a springboard because of the photograph shown above-which was widely circulated by Pacific &; Atlantic news photo service the day after Mr. Pond ( aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have turned aerial somersaults from a springboard is remarkable . For him to have turned them from the mat is all the more remarkable . TIME regrets that it unconsciously belittled Mr. Pond 's feat , joins now in loud applause . - ED . <P> <P> " Foul " Dowse <P> Sirs : <P> The term " foul " seems to be in good usage at present among the British aristocracy ; and I therefore wish to apply it with all possible emphasis to the letter appearing in your issue of June 13 , and signed by Cyril D. H. G. Dillington-Dowse of London , His insinuation that " the Yanks , a nation far removed and by no means of the first rank . . . found themselves in 1914-1918 too proud to fight " is a foul and slanderous lie . <P> It is with difficulty that I restrain myself from coupling the hyphenated name of this British " Dowse " with that of a certain unmentionable insect . <P> My only grandson was killed in action during the year 1917 . He and very many other young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too proud to fight . " <P> I mention first the insinuations of Mr. Dillington-Dowse against the people of the United States . Secondly I should like to express the opinion that his patronizing belittlement of , TIME , coupled with the ridiculous mishandling of tense in his letter , arouses in my mind the very gravest suspicions as to how he obtained the stationery bearing the imprint of the " Author 's Club , 2 Whitehall Court , S. W. 1 , London , England . " <P> CARTER WRIGHT BURNS <P> Southampton , L. I. <P> <P> Red , White , Blue <P> Sirs : <P> While so many of your readers seem to be writing detractions of your red-bordered cover TIME , Jan. 31 , Feb. 14 , April 18 . May 2 , 9 , and June 13 , I wish to offer a constructive suggestion . Your cover is already red and white , so why not print the word TIME in blue ? Then change your subhead from " The Weekly Newsmagazine " to " The National Weekly " ( this also in blue ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing power and high patriotic appeal . The thousands of school children who read TIME could not help but find this a great inspiration . Imagine a schoolroom bright with our flag , and a red , white and blue TIME on every pupil 's desk . <P> LUCY T. BUSK <P> Indianapolis , Ind .
