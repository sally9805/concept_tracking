not mean merely that wives who find themselves unhappy in marriage go out seeking the satisfaction of moneymaking . Before he began this research the examiner had long felt that money played a most important part in marriage . He believed that a great many marriages were wrecked on either the hardships of inadequate income or the lissipations of too much leisure . The ; tudy changed his opinion to a very large degree . These two hundred intimate Lutobiographies strongly suggest that fiction over money is usually a syrupDm of something else wrong with carriage . It is not necessarily the . ause of the trouble . These interesting documents have urned out , in a sense , to be studies of he child in the man . They emphasize nd re-emphasize the fact that things an happen to a boy in the first five or ix years of his life which will make it ! roost impossible for him to find a . asonably satisfying marriage . Let us ike a few instances . A boy who is instantly thwarted by his mother in ling after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct for resistig thwarters , and a conviction that all omen are principally concerned with terfering with him . He carries this : Etude over into marriage and instincvely resists his wife . Another boy gets teh a violent attachment for his mother at he can be happy only when married a duplicate of her , and then in adolesnce certain tendencies drive him to arry someone as different as possible ml the only woman he can be happy th . Other children are made to fear ; x so violently that they can not possibly ' ? e comfortably in a relationship based sex . Fathers who constantly belittreeir wives create in the infantile mind the son a contempt for women which irs his later ability to love and admire y wife ? even his neighbor 's ! The man ? or woman ? whose nature has been distorted like this in childhood will be unhappy in married life , and he will be fatally impelled to look for pegs on which to hang his dissatisfactions . He wo n't even see the fault in himself . He will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how to use the family income are some of the handiest pegs available . It is very difficult and expensive to undo after you are married the things that your mother or father did to you while you were putting your first six birthdays behind you . Even if you are lucky enough to find a very good psychiatrist it is sometimes impossible to correct the harm already done . The ideal method , of course , is to get yourself cured of those traits which keep you on the lookout for something in your marriage to be discontented about ; but , as this ideal can never be fully attained , the wise spouse will give some thought to the possibility that a good many sources of surface discontent are preventable . Since family economics is traditionally one of these sources , an analysis of what a hundred husbands and a hundred wives have to say about money has a practical bearing and perhaps a vital interest for all of us . Iv How many of the two hundred men and women , do you suppose , were living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A little over a fifth of them . Some of the forty-two were more irritated than others . Twenty-six men and women answered a short , sharp " Yes " to the question : Is there much friction between you on account of money ? " The rest said " Yes " and then hedged in the direction of a denial . But how did the men and women compare ? Which sex felt more sharply the spurs of economic pressure the male , ever occupied with the problems , dilemmas , and dangers of money-hunting , or the female , more or less sheltered from the business world and concerned with child-raising and home-making ? To an altogether astonishing degree , it was the wives who found economic friction in their married lives . Twentysix people answered an unqualified " yes " to that question , but only four of them were men . Among those who hedged the men predominated ; yet , all told , there were only seventeen husbands who admitted any kind of friction , against twenty-five wives who were unhappy over money matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even from their authors ? will inject a little human nature into these statistics . A few men penetrate the secret that domestic economics may be merely a peg on which to hang a more general complaint ; one of these says , " There has never been much friction . That has all been a by-product of other kinds of irritation . " Another man says , " Yes , there 's been friction , but the roots of the friction went down into temperamental differences between us ? in our sense of the values of life . " Most of the answers are more conventional , more limited in outlook , more typical of that insensitiveness to money matters which is commonly attributed to husbands : " I have n't been successful , and my wife ca n't forgive that . " " Right now I think money is the cause of much unhappiness , though we do n't mention it often , " " She thinks I am too much of an easy mark with other people . She complains that , when there is a party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . " " We never have any friction except about money . " " I do n't think we have any real friction , but I 'm afraid she 'd be a lot happier if I earned more money and was as thrifty as she is . " " We do n't have any friction except on the evening when I have to write checks for the month 's bills . I get peeved then , though I always realize that I have n't any right to be . " At least one woman knows that " the money friction is a reflection of other things that are wrong . " Butthe bulk of them take money very seriously , far more seriously than the men : " Money has always made for friction in some way or other . " " We do n't talk about it much , but he knows I think he ought to show more interest in making a better income . " " I 'm balled up about money . I don't. like to ask him for money for things even when he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if when I ask for money for a hat he sits down and starts reckoning his bank account . " " I am irritated that he spends as much money on clubs , cigars , and his car as would give me a servant . It made me bitter to have to scrub and do the laundry while he was living the life of a well-fixed bachelor . " " Just one thing has made friction between us and that is not having enough money . We 've both been getting frightfully sensitive about it , We had n't realized how important it was ? not just having too little money , but the uncertainty of not knowing how long it would keel up . " " There 's friction when he drop good-paying jobs and takes on non paying ones . " " I think the most in ritating thing about our marriage is th ( struggle for existence . " " There ha : been some friction , but I think there in most families with small incomes . " Now these two hundred men an ( women had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another They did not all come in couples . little more than half of the men wh. answered these questions were married t women who were also taking part in thi research in marriage . Let us explor the records of these couples and thros out the rest . Here we find the same phenomena c economically upset women and corr paratively comfortable men . Out of th fifty-five wives whose husbands ar swered the questions about financil friction , eleven said unqualifiedly the there was " much friction on account ( money . " Only two of their husbanc : were aware of it , and three more hedge ( There was only one husband who n corded friction that his wife was unable to observe . The couples bore out the significant reports of the two hundred men and women en masse . Obviously , a large number of such husbands are unable to recognize economic friction when they meet it ? or else their wives are seeing phantoms . So far as these men and women are concerned , economic friction seems to have been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men snapped out of it sooner than the women , The next question in the research shows this . While the first question asked if there were present friction , the second asked if there had ever been friction in the past . Where forty-two of the two iundred admitted more or less present ' riction , almost twice as many reported , rouble at some previous time . And iere the men stood up pretty well by comparison . There were thirty-eight nen who either answered " yes " or ' edged , and there were only forty women . But again the women were ar more ready with a downright affirmative . About a dozen of the questions pro'hied enough information for a general stimate of the number of men and ( omen who had found satisfactory carriages . There were fifty-one men rho " passed , " but only forty-five o/nen . This test provided an interestig angle on the economic frictions of carried life . Ninety-six per cent of the itisfied husbands found little or no nancial friction , against only eighty-x per cent of the satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married reported any presit friction over money , while six of the tme class of women felt that they and ieir husbands were at odds over it . V The cause of economic friction is n't isy to spot ? which ought to bear out te idea that money matters are merely convenient peg for the complaints of the unhappy . The answers that the men and women gave to questions about the extravagance of their mates were much too temperate and easy-going . The only illuminating thing about them WAS that , again , the women were much more sensitive and apprehensive than the men . The first question on this topic sought to penetrate into the extravagance of wives . The men were asked if their wives spent more for personal and household things than they considered fair , and their wives were asked if their husbands thought they did . Eightytwo of the hundred men promptly answered " no , " but only seventy-five wives were at all confident that their husbands thought them economical . In answer to the next question , eighty-seven men said their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-six women said as much for their husbands . Not one man said that his wife was generally stingy , but nine women thought their husbands were stingy . Four men said their wives were extravagant , but seventeen women thought their husbands were . Three men said their wives were erratic , and five women made the same charge . Again , the women saw a much blacker picture than the men . The most interesting angle on marital extravagance came from a question as to what each spouse thought the other thought about him or her . The examiner made the rather astonishing discovery that , although only four men had said that their wives were extravagant , no less than fifteen women went about imagining that their husbands thought them profligate in money matters . On the other hand , the men succeeded in guessing pretty accurately how many wives thought them extravagant . There are three possible explanations : Perhaps wives are more extravagant than their husbands realize , and the wives know it . Perhaps husbands try to keep their wives in check by pretending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much tenser about money matters , much more sensitive and apprehensive of criticism than any mere man appreciates . How far is economic friction due to the size of the income ? If a man earns less than five thousand dollars a year , is he more likely to be unhappy in his marriage than he would be if he earned more ? With the men of our research the size of income seemed to make very little difference . Fifty men earned more than five thousand a year , and fifty earned less . Twenty-six of the richer men turned out to have satisfactory marriages , and twenty-five of the poorer . The largest difference ? and it was n't very large ? came in the men who were separated from their wives or divorced . The pay envelope does seem to affect wives ? or at any rate the hundred wives we arc dealing with . Twentyseven wives of the richer husbands were happy in their marriages , but there were only eighteen poor but happy wives against the twenty-five poor but happy husbands . To sum it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosperous men were happily married against fifty per cent of the notso-prosperous . Among the women the figures were fifty-four per cent against thirty-six per cent . To these women there was something of importance in the pay envelope . VI The income may be large or the income may be small , yet a husband or a wife can find plenty of dissatisfaction in the way that the income is managed . A small income fairly distributed between the two of them may prove far less troublesome than twenty thousand dollars a year controlled by a niggardly husband who doles out even the household expenses grudgingly . There are three main ways of dividing a family income . One is the old-fashioned system of the husband 's takingcharge of all the money , paying all the bills , and doling out funds to the wife as she asks for them . Another is a little more modern ? the setting aside of an allowance for the wife , or perhaps the use of a complete budget system . The third is more apt to be found in coatings where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank account , or the wife handles all the money . Sixty-six of the men and women of this research ran their finances on the oldest plan ? no allowance for the wife . Seventy-three had arrangements involving some sort of allowance or budget . Fifty-four went on the joint bank account or partnership basis . There were a few who could not be easily classified . As far as the examiner could judge , the method of handling the family funds bore a certain relation ? though not a very marked relation ? to the satisfaction of these men and women in their marriages . Remembering that fifty-one per cent of the men and fortyfive per cent of the women were happily married , consider the following figures : Per cent Per Celli of men of women happily happily System of family finance married married No allowance for wife ... ... 54% 5l% Allowance or budget 54% 42% Joint account or partnership 45% 29% The old - fashioned no - allowance method easily won out over the moderr partnership method of handling domestic finances . Allowances left husbands little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men and women were equally unhappy under the partnership arrangement The only system that worked well fo : the women was the no-allowance system The only system that did n't work fo : the men was partnership . In othe : words , allowances seemed to make lite. difference , husbands and wives wht shared alike appeared less happy , am those who threw economic independency out of the window were the most con tented of all . This may merely mean , of course , that couples who are naturally and instinctively happy together wo n't bother their heads about modern methods of handling family finances . Complicated attempts to avoid unfairness and possible friction over money may be only for those who feel uncertain enough of their happiness to need it . Test out these three financial systems by what these men and women said about friction over money matters , and we get another piece of interesting evidence that money may be merely the peg for general complaints . Consider the following table which gives the happiness of the men and the women under each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under each system : Per cent Per cent happily reporting Syslent of family finance married friction MEN-WOMEN MEN-WOMEN No allowance for wife .. 54%-53% 8%-65% Allowance or budget . , . 54%-44% 17%43% Joint account or part-nership 46%-39% 44%-11% Note how the friction reported by the men increases as their happiness decreases , a perfectly obvious pattern . With the women ? as so often in this research ? it is just the opposite . A third of the women in contented economic subjection find this condition something to talk about . They may be happier than the rest , yet they are happier not because of the financial arrangement but in spite of it . Their relations to their husbands are sound on other scores . Would a joint bank account make their physical or temperamental satisfaction any less ? Incidentally , the research brought out that eighty per cent of the women kept within their allowances when they had any . A half of the men and women had used the budget system , and half of those that had used budgets found them unsuccessful or a nuisance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wife with her own income -- -earned by her own work outside the home ? is another . The common supposition these days is that a wife who earns her own living is likely to be happier personally and also happier in marriage than a wife wholly dependent on her husband . At least that is the " modern " view of it . As this research had to do with a large proportion of the kind of people who hold this view , the information on this point seems particularly significant . In discussing friction over money matters a certain number of men and women brought up troubles over the wife 's earning money . None of the men referred very heatedly to the subject , however . One said , " My wife has resented some of my activities because she has contributed to the family finances . " Another said , " There was a good deal of friction . This seems strange to me , but I think it amounted to this ? she always wished to be economically independent , and the child prevented it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part because she was n't earning souse of our income . " Here are paraphrases of two comments by women which show the very opposite sides of the problem . One said , " He thought I ought to go out and earn money . " Another said , " Shortly after we were married the necessity for my contributing anything to the family income stopped and I quit my job . Now he throws it up to me that I 'm living on his money . " It is a little hard to say just how much of an income a wife has to have to make its weight felt by the husband . A simple approach is to divide the women on the basis of no earnings at all against any earnings no matter how small . This produces a group of about thirty-five wage-earning wives and a group of about sixty-five who never earned a penny . Test these wives ? and the husbands , too ? as to how satisfied they are with their marriages , and the results are highly interesting . The ultra-feminist will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives earn nothing are far more content with their marriages than the husbands of wage-earners . Sixty-one per cent of the husbands with dependent wives are satisfied , against only fortyfour per cent of the oilier husbands . Ergo , man wants to keep woman in subjection , and he is happiest when she has n't the slightest shade of economic independence . But what about the wives ? With no regard whatever for feminist theory , they agree with the men ? and even go them one better . Sixty-three per cent of the dependent wives proved satisfied , while only twenty-five per cent of the wage-earning women found their marriages distinctly comfortable . It is particularly interesting to note that among the separated and divorced the wage-earning women lead all the rest by a very wide margin . The research provided another way of testing this matter . There were two questions which tried to learn how far men were annoyed by having their wives help them support the family . The men were asked , " Does your wife ever make you feel uncomfortable because she contributes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own ? " The women were asked if they believed they made their husbands uncomfortable by helping out financially . Thirteen of the men admitted that at one time or another they had felt uncomfortable over this , but only eight declared emphatically that they were uncomfortable at the present moment . Fifteen women believed their husbands had been made uncomfortable , and all fifteen said so emphatically , and for the present moment . Again the women were exaggerating in numbers and vehemence the replies of the men . In their actual answers the men are almost tepid on the subject . One replies , " Not a bit . I 'm rather proud that she can make money of her own . It makes her feel that she is not a mere shadow of a man . We 're each doing our share in the different activities necessary to carry on a home . " Another says , " I 'd like her to do more of it . I have no pride in wanting to furnish the money she spends . " Here is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel uncomfortable . She has her own money , and I ca n't tell her not to waste it . " Another answers , " She has contributed a great deal more than I have to the support of the family , and she has done it with a fine spirit that everything she has is mine . But I have certain feelings of injured pride because my earnings are n't enough . " And here comes the conventional he-man , " She does n't try to make me uncomfortable , I know . But I dislike very distinctly the fact that she went to work . " The replies of the women are far more variegated , sensitive , and vehement , " He has always had a fit when I got a big order . He has always had a fit over my earning anything in any way . " " I was sublimely happy during the year I worked . " " I suppose I made him uncomfortable the first few years without intending it . If the subject ever comes up I have to appear pretty disinterested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable . I think a man does feel uncomfortable if his wife helps him support the family . He 's extravagant in little things , and I hate to see him not doing his share toward supporting the family . " " I often pride myself on being able to make him uncomfortable because I can support myself . " " I thought if I did things for him he would love me more . But I think , instead , he has accepted things and resented , too . " " If I did n't have any money of my own he 'd he more ambitious . " " God knows , I 'm afraid I have made him uncomfortable . Men are so sensitive about that . You have to walk a tightrope to keep them from feeling uncomfortable . He has a theory that women expect the men to support them , and I guess that bothers him . " " I think my husband has the feministic idea about this even stronger than have . We both feel a wife ought to be contributing to her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " " My husband is very modern . Instead of feeling uncomfortable because I help , he agrees with the partnership idea . He feels that this age is unfair to men , because it gives women a monopoly of leisure . " " I should feel humiliated if I had been the one to be supported . I would n't want to be supported by a man . " I Now there were not only wage-earning wives in this research . There were also wives who contributed an inherited income to the family support but did not go out to work . From these cases we may get a suggestion as to how important the source of a woman 's income may be in affecting her husband 's happiness and her own . There were twenty women who had had unearned incomes totaling more than $500 over the period of their marriages , and twenty-four men with wives in this class . These men were happier than the husbands of wives who went out to work and only a shade below the average for the whole hundred ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay-at-home women with unearned incomes were even happier 60 per cent ? though not quite so happy as the wholly dependent women . The comparison is perhaps clearer in the following table : Per cent Per cent of happy of happy husbands wives Where wives were wholly dependent el% 63% Where wives contributed income but did not earn money so% 60% Where wives earned money 44% 25% This pattern is plain enough , It may 4e merely the pattern of a psssing generation , a generation taught in childhood that woman 's place is the home ; but , at any rate , it is the pattern of these two hundred people of the second quarter of the twentieth century . The men and women are happiest where the wives are wholly dependent financially . The men do n't object to receiving money from their wives ? for these men are average happy . The women who center their lives about the home are happy to contribute some financial aid from inherited income , and they may be happy , too , to know that they stay with their husbands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support themselves . But the women who give time and energy to money-making do not show happy homes . The difficulty seems , perhaps , to arise not from economic independence so much as from the desire to work outside the home . Economic independence seems more the consequence of an unhappy marriage than its cause , and yet we can not definitely say . Here we have the old dilemma of the hen and the egg . We can not know whether the economically independent egg hatches a dissatisfied hen , or the dissatisfied hen lays an economically independent egg . But we do know that the hen is far more interested in egg-laying than the rooster . She is quite emotional on the subject . You have heard her cackle . VIII It was rather surprising to learn that almost a third of the men and women had saved nothing during married life . It was still more surprising to discover that seven men and fifteen women did n't know whether they had saved anything . And perhaps the biggest surprise ? and the most satisfactory ? was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve women said it was the husband 's fault , and a dozen husbands admitted that it was their own fault . Six wives were equally ready to accuse themselves , but only four husbands pointed the finger of accusation at their wives . Nine men and eight women said both of the spouses were to blame . If somebody has to be blamed for the failure of these men and women to save a reasonable amount of money , the examiner believes that the fault must be laid at the door of his own profession . It is the doctor 's fault . They levy an enormously large tax on married couples . After the formal study was over the examiner extended it informally , and in the course of his inquiries he found these men and women constantly referring to the fact that they had been kept in debt by doctor 's bills . Where the average income of these couples was less than five thousand a year the doctors who treated them undoubtedly earned far more , without having any greater ability or longer apprenticeship than most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year may be no better equipped and no more able than the five-thousanddollar college professor , or the engineers , artists , teachers , and writers among the hundred men of this investigation . The question whether men and women who save are more happily married than those who do not showed the same result as most of the other questions involved in the economic side of this research . The women exaggerated the conclusions of the men . Not so many of the happily married were to be found among the men and women who had saved nothing . Less than thirty-seven per cent of the men who had n't saved could be listed as satisfied with their marriages . And the women whose husbands had n't saved showed a still smaller percentage thirty-two per cent . Lack of saving appeared to be tied up with marital unhappiness , and the women exaggerated this more than the men . IX By andlarge , this research seems to show three things about money and marriage , It shows , first of all , that money is a less important factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows , in the second place , that women put much more store by money than men do . Apart from the general impression that you must have gained from the evidence , another collection of figures certainly suggests that wives are more likely to go on loving men who bring home the bacon . Fifty-five per cent of the women married to business men were happy , while no other class came nearer than forty-five per cent , and the average of all the rest was still lower . It shows , further ? and here is where husbands can learn something of practical value from the research ? that women arc far more sensitive than men to all these matters of money . They are more conscious of friction over finances . They are unhappier over small incomes and the threat of poverty . They are absurdly apprehensive that their husbands think them extravagant . They arc sensitive about economic dependence and yet money-earning seems to make them unhappier in marriage than their husbands . They are unhappier over the failure to save money and they are readier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every husband should take to heart ? is not that the old economic order is the only possible order in marriage . It is rather that a hundred other things ? some far back in the past ? are making trouble which men and women blame on money , and that men must exert the greatest amount of thought and consideration to do away with all the irritations over money which go to complicate man and woman 's already very complicated difficulties over marriage . There is no general recipe . Every case is a special case , especially created by a father or a mother a generation ago . THE TWO BUSINESS MEN A STORY BY MARY JOHNSTON " I aIwuz liked dead people en done all I could for ' cm . " ? Huckleberry Finn OR a tired teacher of mathematics in a small woman 's college ( small college ; the girls were average ) , without much money and scrimpy with teachers , Fisherman 's Luck proved the round hole for the round peg .

It had called unto itself offspring in the shape of three or four detached cabins : happy , old-time , log ones , buried in hemlock and white pine and mountain linden and such . The guests at Fisherman 's Luck , or Berry 's , as it was mostly called , were hardly what you call fashionable , though they were solid enough , some of them . Once a man tired of staggering under big business found this place out , and he told three or four others in a like predicament . Year after year they came to Berry 's for a few weeks and wiped off the world . As near as might be , that is . Fisherman 's Luck , or Berry 's , lived two thousand and odd feet above the sea and in untrammeled mountains , ten miles from a railroad , and with some peculiarity in the sunshine . It had a spring of ice-cold sulphur water jetting from a cliff hung with ferns and topped by Judas tree and shad bush and rhododendron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Woman Creek and Calico Creek .

So did three or four other teachers , men and women , and a poet from New York , and a mighty fisherman from Kentucky , and old Colonel Corbin and his daughter-inlaw and her children , and a botanist who was making a botany , and his offspring , two young rapscallions , boy and girl , and the Reverend Mr. Birdsong , and Miss Watkins the librarian , and a few others who are dimmer in my mind . The food was good . After the second day , no matter how many colleges were behind you , in walked mountain appetite . Thin , sun-packed mountain air , right exercise , and a kind of diffused peace-on-earth sensation ? that was Berry 's . The proprietors were Mr. and Mrs. Berry , Mr. Berry born on the spot , sixty years earlier , Mrs. Berry his cousin . They had a daughter , Lucinda Berry , the sunny side of forty and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom and Luke , pretty good , tall , lank young fellows , completed the family . Each summer half a dozen colored folk came from the nearest town , lived in two or three shacks down by a small , abandoned saw mill , and furnished service of kinds . Fisherman 's Luck was a primitive place , all right . but , Lord ! how we liked it and looked forward through all the grind of the year to getting up there each slimmer . I know I looked forward to it , and the business men did , for they told me so . They were big business , miles away from any ideas that the rest of us at Berry 's could entertain . My first three summers there were four of them . Then I missed a year , having to teach mathematics at a summer school . The next June I was back again , and glad enough to be there . But this year I found only three big business men . The other one had died in the winter .

The river that was very clear and quiet with great sycamores slanting over it and alder and willow and maple and the rest of it made my heart ache with pleasure after college . A boat passed , a man fishing , a darky rowing . It went over to the other side under the willows , and we walked without Mr. Arnold seeing us . " He is n't like himself this summer , " said Miss Watkins . " I suppose it 's Mr. Beckwith 's death . " Arnold was Iron and Steel . Beckwith had been Railroads .

" He has n't fished here at all this summer , " said Miss Watkins . " But Mr. Allworthy and Major Jackson seem to consider that it would be indelicate for them to step in just yet . Captain Schloss also seems to have some feeling about it . Come to think of it , no onedoes fish here this summer , not even the boys . " My Lord , it was clear and peaceful and sweet !

But Major Jackson told Captain Schloss that Mr. Beckwith died at the beginning or in the middle , he did n't know which , of a big misunderstanding or quarrel or feud between him and Mr. Arnold . Captain Schloss it was that called it a feud . He did n't say whether it had come to laying for each other with guns behind corn shocks and worm fences . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! before they could settle it . He told Captain Schloss that nobody really understands it , for it was n't like either of them . He said that there ought to be a provision of nature against dying with things unexplained , but there is n't . It was a quarrel , all right . And he says Mr. Arnold ca n't digest it or get rid of it and it 's that that makes him gloomy . " In a week 's time my newness wore off and we all settled into our own ways . Winter school and summer school and other things had worn me down . I wanted just rest in solitude for at least half the time . I walked a good deal , but chiefly at last I came to lie on the banks of Winding River . It seemed to be sufficient . At last I settled down to the shore of that pool where no one fished this Summer . I liked the sycamore , I liked the pine : ree , I liked the little horn of sand and aebbIes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side the river juts , and lines of late had gathered earth upon them and ) ecome islets and peninsulas , miniature end fairy , with mint on them and some aromatic yellow flower , and tall stems d Joe-Pye with large heads of feathery , moke-pink bloom . Mr. Arnold , Mr. , Allworthy , and Major Jackson no longer fished up Vinding . But there were plenty of places below this boat , down river . ' hey used , on the days they were after ass , to bring in good strings . Other ays they fished for trout in the two wely creeks . That is , Mr. Allworthy nd Major Jackson did . Mr. Arnold miained faithful to Winding and his wn company . Just he and old black ' eter in a boat to themselves , but they ! ways went down river . Captain chloss tried the old pool . But he had o luck . " I never knew it before ! " he Ailed , passing the sycamore and mein his boat . " Never in twenty years ! Besides ? do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't come any more . One day I met Peter going from the river to the kitchen with Mr. Arnold 's catch . We stood to talk . " Where did you get them ? " " This side Walter 's Mill , sah . But the bes ' fishing in Winding , sah , is Black Bass Pool where Mr. Arnold wo n't go no more . " " He wo n't go because he thinks of Mr. Beckwith there . And Mr. Al ! worthy and Major Jackson do n't take it over because of a feeling of delicacy . But Captain Schloss says . . . " " Yaas . . . " said Peter . His old eyes , deep in his charcoal black face , fixed an oriole in a tulip tree . " What is it , Peter ? Do you think Mr. Beckwith likes it still ? " " That oriole sho makes a fine nest . . . . Mr. Grymes , you is a noticin ' pusson , sah . I knowed that the minute I fust set eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' don ' want anybody to come er-fishin ' there but Mr. Arnold , en ' he don ' want ter go . He stop likin ' Mr. Beckwith befo ' he daid , en ' he got all the reminderin ' he want . He say he thought he try it , comin ' back heah this year , but he aiu ' gwine come back nex ' year . . . Yaaas , ma'am ! Yaas , Miss Jinny , I'se comin ' ! " The following day , down at the sulphur spring , I came upon Mr. Arnold . He was drinking the ice-cold water out of one of the three gourds kept hanging in a row in the arbor over the spring . There never was such water . Mr. Arnold said so now , " There never was such water ! " " No . It 's cold and light and there 's just enough and not too much sulphur . The ferns about it help it out , and this dark hillside . " " When I first tasted it ? the first summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , ' I said . ' This is good enough for me ! ' " He hung the gourd carefully
