Continents 0UT of the wreckage of that tidal wave of European contact that overwhelmed the Indian civilizations of this continent , there are left two incomparably precious records : the ' compilations of Father Sahagun of the customs and rituals of the Aztecs , and the Jesuit " Relations " of their dealings with the Indians of North America . Sahagun is still largely in manuscript , and no part of it is translated into English , but with the account of the . . Jesuits we have been more fortunate . Parkman , in his " Jesuits in . North America , " made their story a household word , and when , more than twenty-five years ago , that long seventy-three-volume row of Thwaites ' " Jesuit Relations " began to appear on the shelves of far-between and fortunate libraries , there was opened up an almost inexhaustible enjoyment . Everything of which we had had foretaste was there , the mellowness of its original phrasing Unimpaired , and there were , besides , documents upon documents hitherto unpublished . It was one of those perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , private letters , and Jesuit files had been ransacked to make the record complete ; the notes were authoritative ; the translation was accurate , and it had , to heap the measure , the leisurely charm of the original . Thwaites ' edition , however , is rather more than an entire five-foot allowance of literature , and the seven hundred and fifty sets to which the edition was limited , . not to mention the price , made of it no fireside companion , but a difficult book of reference . Miss Kenton has now , for the first time , in an admirable selection , made it available to its best audience : those who take pleasure in the by-Ways of history and the royal road of adventure . She has seen to it that her selection is no less useful for reference ; With commendable restraint she has retained the Thwaites text , even indicating his pagination , and has drawn freely from his notes . ' Wherever there was need of further comment to make the text intelligible to a larger audience , she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection which , from every point of view , could hardly be bettered . The Jesuits of the seventeenth century , driven by their Passion for souls , traveled the length and breadth of the then-known continent of North America . They established themselves faint Louisiana to Labrador , and they penetrated as far west as the Mississippi . It was no cursory exploration that contented them . From the first they set themselves in the midst of indifferent and often hostile . ' . ' 4 ? tages , to learn his language , eat his food , live in his ' shelters . When famine pressed , they ate the dried eel-skins With which they had girded up their Jesuit robes . When the Iroquois overcame their Indians , they distributed absolu- 1 and baptism within the stockade , and when all was lost they died with their Hock in the fiendish tortures the Iroquois devised for their most honored enemies . - They set themselves to know and match every rule and custom of this wilderness . They were excellent observers , ' 1111d the people among whom their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best efforts . Nothing could be better than Brebeuf 's description of the great Huron feast of the ' dead when , once in twelve years , all the bones of those who had died in that interval were disinterred , dressed in collars of wampum and in beaver skins , wept over afresh , displayed as " souls " on a great scaffold together , and buried at last in one great tomb to the accompaniment of a noise so deafening and so desperate the Fathers named it the din of bell . The best raconteurs , as it happened , were stationed among the great Iroquois group , which included also the Hurons with whom the Five Nations were at war , and those Eastern Algonkin who had been influenced by Iro- quois customs . Through all this region there ran , in their beliefs and practices , that fantastic strand ; the obligation to repeat in waking life the events of which one dreamed . " It would be cruelty , nay , murder , not to give a man the subject of his dream . " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian conversion ; drunkenness , dreams and impurity , and of these the dream was the most sinister . " It is the god of this country . " At all costs the dream , must be fa ' filled . The braves dreamed of eating human flesh , and the family had to provide a woman for the sacrifice . They dreamed of being tortured by the enemy , and the village set up the stake and fed the fire till the dreamer 's legs were half-roasted to the thighs . For this dominant emergency of fulfilling the drcam , the Iroquois could count on the lavished resources of his tribe and the loyalty , even to death , of his friends . One of them dreamed of ten men who dived into a hole in the ice and came up at one beyond . He called his friends , and ten meg went out to make the attempt . Nine succeeded , but the last drowned miserably , having lost his way under the ice ! The Iroquois dreamed of the Jesuits ' black robes , of marlY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fun , Julian , or abdicating chieftainship , but not once does the talc , record that they dreamed of a woman and by this means brought a courtship to a successful conclusion . There be selection in the dreams any people ITRIC of , and the Iroquois ignored those dreams by which our own culture rediscovered the seriousness of di ? iniing ? There are accounts of the practices of the med ine men , ' of every-day affection in families , of eloquent councils or the sachems . There is no other account ' of the Indian of while they were still masters in their own country that makes them live for us in the flesh as these old reports of the Jesuits . Their missions , certainly the ones which cap- ture our imaginations in the " Relations , " vanished with ; 11 a trace ; as the story is recorded , all this devotThn with out issue . And , so that we might keep failure , we would gladly forget all the boasted triumphsof those centuries . the men ; yasof Professor Karsten 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different order . It need not lia , v been so . Professor Karsten has spent five years among the South American natives , and his observations on the iba ? ? of Ecuador have been published in anthropological journals i : - in Danish , Spanish , German , French and English . all the length of the present volume , there is no Page fivesotiv gives us back the lively mirror of native life and m an that seems in the " Relations " of the Jesuits so simple a act of grace : ? Professor Karsten has a theory . His study consists , ? Ileac. ' pigeon-holing native customs under his own But ings ; it results in a rather dull herbarium . It is not 13sr chology from the inside out ; it is from the outside in . Pr ) a thesis is that art , raiment , and the cutting of the hair main . ? is and nails have their origin in magic practices , chiefly of protection against supernatural evil . There are studies in clothing , ornament , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couvade , explaining them all in terms of magical practices . We may instantly grant to Professor Karsten that there is no field of thought or activity Which is not saturated with animism among the Indians of either continent ; that is not to say that magic practices any more " produce " Peruvian art than the need for a label on the back of a book " produces " the triumphs of the art of book-binding . To discuss the origin of ornamental art and ignore technique and the developing canons of art is to beg the question . His method , at its worst , may be illustrated by his theory that to the native the efficacy of tattooing lies in the magical - effect of the ashes which are rubbed into the abraded skin . Ashes , he says , are associated with fire , which is commonly of supernatural import ; they are used by the Fuegian medieine man to cover his head while he is practising ; they are mentioned in the myth of the Magic Flight . He gives no word of testimony from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . At its best , his method is a generalization of a state of mind which is certainly specific for certain of the tribes with which Professor Karsten is Personally acquainted . With the Tobas of Bolivia , the-Most extravagant magical practices against evil are a com ' inonplace . On the death of his mother , the eldest son cut off one of his nails and hung it around the neck of a dog , which he then drove away . Otherwise the spirit of his dead mother , entering the nail of her son , would kill him , in- the shape of a tiger whose form she would take upon herself . Is this an ambivalence toward one 's mother which is here institutionalized at her death , or are the Tobas as extravagant in their fear of all their dead ? Professor Karsten has been through all the diffuse and scattered literature of the South American Indians , and he has recorded in the course of his arguments many facts of curious or wide-spread observance .
