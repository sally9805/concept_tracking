txt Secretary Glass , in a letter sent to the Ways and Means Committee today , appealed for an appropriation of $1:4000,000 to aid the starving . inhabitants of Poland , Armenia and Austria , giving a vivid picture of the distressing situation existing in these countries . Norman Davis , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , . pre. : sented additional details of conditions which , he said , must be remedied to prevent actual starvation and the spread of Bolshevism . He read to the committee excerpts from private reports received from American agents which bore out his statements . Secretary Glass , appreciating the opposition to extending direct financial aid to the war-torn countries , recommended that the assistance go through the grain corporation , which could use its fund of nearly $1,000,000,000 to extend aid through credits or gifts where necessary . This recommendation seemed to meet with the approval of the committee , which will probably authorize the Grain Corporation to expend $150 , - 000,000 of its fund in aid of these countrieA . The fund and food would be divided as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities at a cost of $500 , - 000 monthly ; Austria , $100,000,000 , with a probable reduction to 870,000,000 due to assistance by Great Britain ; Poland , 300,000 tons ? of grain at a cost of $50,000,000 ; other parts of Europe , $25,000,000 . Norman Davis told the committee that this country must continue to supply food to these three countries until the next harvest . Austria and Poland , he said , could furnish satisfactory security for food furnished them , but in the case of Armenia the aid must be in the nature of charity as that country is without funds or means of establishing credits . Food is also needed in parts of Italy , Hungary and Czechoslovakia- he said . " The United States has a surplus of food and is the only nation that can prevent the famine , " added Mr. Davis . " Great Britain in a formal ' note to the United States has promised to co-operate to the full extent of its ability , which probably will be mainly in supplying ships to transport the supplies , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria $48,000,000 . Would Mortgage Natural Resources . " The condition in Austria is so desperate ' that she is willing to mortgage her forests , the tobacco monopoly , the water power facilities , and even the collection of customs , to obtain food . The Treasury does riot believe that customs should be taken because it would cause great delay to economic rehabilitation . Vienna has 2,500,000 people , and it is probable that many of these will have to leave because the surrounding country , since the separation of Hungary , will not support them . Poland deserves help because she is rendering great service to the world fighting the BbiSheviki . " Secretary Glass in his letter summarizes conditions in the respective countries as follows : " POLAND  --  According to the best information obtainable , the minimum grain requirement necessary to carry Poland until the next harvest , and which can not be filled anywhere but in the United States , is 300,000 tons . This deficiency is due to a partial failure of the wheat crop and to a lack of fuel for threshing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime , which can be remedied only by a steady flow of imports from the only available Surplus stocks of food , namely , those in the United States . " The potato crop , which is the staple food of the poorer classes , has been destroyed by frosts to the extent of 50 per cent . In many districts , as it is impossible properly to Care for potatoes in transit . Due to delays in transportation , Poland has been unable to procure clothing since the beginning of the war , and the result is that during the past five years practically , all clothing has been worn out and has not yet been replaced . " . The food situation in , Poland is so serious that the European Children 's Re- lief Fund has Celt obliged to loan Poland small quantities of flour from , the stocks intended for child feeding . The assistance to the children of Poland rendered through this fund , Which feeds 1,300,000 children daily , is claimed by its administrators there to have been a powerful means of averting revolutions up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government properly to ration its adult population has already caused demonstrations by the Reds in Warsaw . The cost of supplying the 300,000 ton grain minimum would be approximately $50,000 , - 000 . It is possible that a portion of this requirement may be met through private charity , and that the British Government may be able to supply some tonnage for the transportation of this gram from the United States . In so far as this outside ald is received , the assistance to be furnished by the United States would be diminished . " Acute Misery in Austria . " AUSTRIA  --  In Austria the acute misery and suffering are probably greater than in Poland . Two-tenths only of the present Austrian State are self-sup-I , porting in food , and the remaining eight-tenths , even before the war , produced food to supply themselves for six months of the year at most , and were dependent for the remaining six months upon importations . Consequently , the situation today , especially in Vienna , has become exceedingly grave , due to a shortage of coal and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded immedietely the population can not withstand the strain of conditions that are already well nigh Intolerable . What the effect of a general social breakdown in Austria would be can , of ? course , only be conjectured . That it would be confined to Austria , however , seems highly improbable , . and if it spread to Germany , . Poland and possibly all of Europe the result would be no , less than a general disintegration of political cohesion in Western Europe , Such an event , would be fraught with the most serious consequences for the iTnlited States , and would certainly leave in its wake severe suffering and thousands of deaths am , ong the poorer classes of the people , The British Government has definitely proposed to join to the eittent of its ability , with the United States Government in furhisiling relief to Austria . The British Government has explained , however , that with the present depreciation in its exchange , it could not supply dollars for the purchase of food in the United States , but it can no doubt supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Kingdom . The total estimated requirements for Austrian relief are $100,000 , - 000 , but the British participation should reduce the amount of relief to be supplied from the United States to Austria to about $70,000,000 . " Armenia in Desperate Straits . " ARMENIA  --  Although the population of Armenia is small , the situation there is desperate , and the Winter season will see many deaths unless adequate food , medical supplies and clothing are received from outside sources . It has been estimated that a bare minimum program of 7,500 tons of flour , together with other necessities amounting to $500,000 monthly , will he required to meet the situation , and If deliveries are not maintained after the severe Winter sets in , orphanages will close and great numbers of deaths will result . At present there are 700,000 destitute people being kept alive by this program and partial aid is being furnished to many others . " As there are private charitable funds available for Armenia , it is probable that the amount of relief which the United States Government would be called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the three above-mentioned countries or territories where the requirements are most urgent , it may be necessary to furnish some supplies to other sections of Europe ( outside the boundaries of Germany ) where the situation is not now so desperate , but where food supplies will be required to carry them through until . the next harvest . It is estimated that $25,000,000 would suffice for this purpose . After this summary Mr. Glass concludes with this recommendatioe : " In conclusion I may say that while it is impossible now to estitnate definitely just what will be required , I am of the opinion , from the information so far obtainable , that a minimum of $125,000. - 000 and a maximum of $200,000,000 would suffice to supply the portion of relief to be assumed by this Government , provided Congress should grant the necessary authorization to participate in alleviating this serous and desperate situation . Would Avoid Food Rise Here . " As any reliefs undertaken , so far as concerns the United States , would be primarily a question of supplying food , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be handled and co-ordinated in such a manner as not to increase the prices of food in the United States , I am recommending in the proposed legislation that the United States Grain Corporation be empowered to purchase , sell , and deliver food and relief supplies for Europe up to the amount of $150,000,000 and that for the supplies so furnished credit may be extended by the . Grain Corporation . If this amount proves Insufficient to meet the minimum requirements , the Treasury will again submit the matter to Congress for sucn action as it may deem expedient . " Secretary Glass , while the committee was in session , submitted late reports of Investigations made by agents for this Government and from other sources , as to conditions in the different countries , These reports were given in confidence , but Chairman Forceney ordered a number of excerpts to he made public , As to Austria , the confidential report from a big American official says : " On the end of the present month , the Austrian people literally will perish by cold and starvation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solely the hope that the powers would do so holds up yet to a certain extent the morale of the suffering people .
