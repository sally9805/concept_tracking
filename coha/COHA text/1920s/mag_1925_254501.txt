The Mount Wilson Observatory announced that it had completed measurement of the variable star Mira and found it to be , by angular measurement , .06 of a second of arc - about 25% larger than Betelgeuse . It is believed to be about 165 light years distant , which makes its diameter about 250,000,000 miles . Only one larger star , Antares , has been measured. * Therefore , if the centre of Mira were where the center of our Sun is , the orbit of the Earth would be some 25,000,000 miles inside the surface of Mira . <P> The star Mira was discovered to vary in intensity by the astronomer Fabricus in 1596 . It is a deep red color and fluctuates in periods of eleven months - is sometimes 200 times brighter at maximum than at minimum light . Mira has a companion star very close to it , which was discovered at Lick Observatory in 1923 . <P> <P> *Diameter 400,000,000 miles .
