Mussolini has discovered a new way of getting rid of members of his Cabinet : <P> Two ministerial Departments , the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce , were abolished by Mussolini . <P> He then formed a new " Ministry of National Economy " to replace the two former Departments . A new Minister , Signor Moiet , was appointed to take over the " Ministry of National Economy . " <P> Signori di Capitani and Rossi , Ministers of Ministries which no longer existed , handed in their resignations . Which were accepted . Both gentlemen were suspected of anti-Fascist sympathy . Their resignation leaves Mussolini a Cabinet composed almost exclusively of loyal Fascisti.
