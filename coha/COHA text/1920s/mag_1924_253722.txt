A Buddhist priest , representing a league of 6,000,000 Japanese , traveled to Washington to see the President . <P> He arrived on a day of death , wrote a letter , departed . <P> THE HONORABLE CALVIN COOLIDGE <P> Sir : It would be highly impudent of me , a stranger from across the sea , to address the President of the United States , were it not for the fact that I have traveled many thousands of miles only to deliver to him a message which millions upon millions , who believe in the Buddhist teachings of mercy and tolerance as expounded by the great Saint Nichiren , of Japan , wish me to deliver . <P> That message it was my hope and desire to deliver personally to you . Upon my arrival in Washington , however , I was profoundly grieved to hear of the demise of your beloved son . It would be an inexcusable intrusion on my part to ask for an audience with you at such a time . . . . <P> Speaking for the followers of the teachings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you their heartfelt gratitude for your and your countrymen 's magnificent generosity . . . . <P> Love is supreme . Its voice can never be drowned by the tumult of politics . Of all times this is the Mme when the followers of Nichiren should unflinchingly and steadfastly stand by his eternal doctrine of tolerance , love and righteousness . My second duty , then , is to convey to you , and through you to the American people , the humble assurance that we who endeavor to follow Nichiren will do all in our power to convince our countrymen that the way to set American-Japanese relations aright is to walk in the footsteps of the Great Saint . . . . <P> The third message , then , which 1 am asked to deliver to you is that the followers of Saint Niehiren humbly ask you and your fellow citizens to join with them in a common prayer , invoking love , tolerance and justice-you in the words of Christ , and we in the language of Nichiren . . . . <P> May I conclude this humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praying and will continue to pray for you and your people , as they pray for their own people , so that the hands of love will guide the two nations in their endeavor to keep the peace of the Pacific . <P> Respectfully yours , <P> ( Signed ) SENTARO HONDA , Representing the Buddhist Salvation League of Japan .
