The loves , deeds , progeny , businesses of all Biblical characters who amounted to anything-they have been properly set down at last by the Rev. E. Fletcher Allen , M. A. , in a book with a cover as blue as the Sea of Galilee entitled Who 's Who in the Bible* <P> From Aaron " who began his career well , as brother of Moses , but made the fatal mistake of trying to combine the goldsmith 's craft with religion , " to Zipporah , " the Midianite wife of Moses , " this book embraces many characters that appear in the modern Who 's Who under a different guise ; several names , indeed , may be found in both books . In the Rev. Allen 's , the name of Baruch belongs to " a young nobleman " ; Cain , says Author Allen , is the same name as Smith . David gets the most space , nigh four pages ; Paul is second , Moses third . Goliath who , says the author , " was probably ten feet high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor do Og , Gog and Magog , those hairy monsters , rate more . Noah is " accredited with having discovered the process of making wine . " Joseph is referred to with consummate discretion : " Presumably being attractive of person , he suffered from a malicious and entirely unfounded accusation leveled at him by Potiphar 's wife - whose passion Joseph did not share . " Obadiah , says Author Allen , " is a very common name in the Scriptures and none of its bearers has any claim to particular distinction . " Neither , it may be added , has Author Allen 's book . It is entertaining , harmless , perhaps useful . <P> *Published by Putnam , $2.00.
