txt Colonel JOHN CALVIN COOLIDGE , the President 's father , has all that reserve , habit of understatement , dislike of gush and ironic depreciation of compliment that characterize the old Yankee stock . A Yankee is naturally non-committal , except for sufficient cause . He likes to qualify his praise . Excess is hateful to him . A schoolmate of the late H. H. ROGERS said , when the latter was in his financial prime : " Yes , I 'm told HENRY has n't made out so bad , considerin ' . " There is an evident dry humor in this habit of depreciation ; but the Yankee rather resents questions . He prefers to disclose his full opinion at his own time . As he says of certain cows , he is " a hard milker . " . " I think he 'll do fairly well , " the Colonel says of his son . " He did fairly " well as Governor , and I guess he 'll " do fairly well as President . " That . tempered " fairly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from such a source , than any flamboyant string of superlatives . For nearly three hundred years these Coolidges have been trained to work and to endure . There has been , it alight almost be said . " hard sledding , " what would be called a " crisis " in the more emotional West , among the Yankee farmers most of the time . They work hard and shut up . In better fortune they do the same . Prosperity and distinction they take as undemonstratively as they take a refractory soil , bad crops , the weather or the bull calf " actin ' like all possessed . " It wo n't do for a Vermont father to reveal the pride he has in his son 's achievements . That would be contrary to the rugged discipline of labor and duty , the silent but understood encouragement . the personal self-respect that never permits itself to be dazzled ; and " . boys , " of whatever age . must n't be " spiled . " So Colonel COOLIDGE does n't think of his son as President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'll do his " best with any job given him . He " always has been that way , and I " guess he always will be . " CALVIN was n't precocious or extraordinary . He did his work at school and at home . " He was- a great hand on the farm . " He was n't brought up to any system of rules . " If there are rules , " says the father shrewdly , " it " gives a boy a chance to break them . " I told CALVIN always to do his job " well . And he always did . That 's " what my father taught me and " that 's what his father taught him . " CALVIN COOLIDGE has always done his job well , done his best in every employment . He was brought up to do his best and say little about it . He begins his enormous task at Washington without flutter or elation . The nation knows that he will do his best and " guesses , " with hip father , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means excellently well , as may be expected of a man of trained intelligence and judgment , honest , efficient . fearless , " dreading praise , not blame .
