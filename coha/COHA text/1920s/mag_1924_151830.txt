To a public wet and shivering , cold and snuffling , waiting for a reluctant Spring , came the news that a " new pneumonia serum " had been discovered by one Dr. Lloyd B. Felton , of the Harvard Medical School . <P> Horses . The " horse serum , " in use heretofore , had been regarded by many as worse than the disease it was meant to cure . It is made by injecting pneumonia germs ( called pneumococci ) into the blood of a horse . The horse then develops in his blood a substance which aids in destroying or digesting these germs . This substance-the so-called " antibody " - is known to be carried in the serum , or " clear liquid " of the blood . The remedial method in using the " horse serum " was to inject a large quantity of highly diluted serum into the human patient . This serum generally brought along with it chills , fever and the so-called " serum sickness . " It usually caused violent reactions ; many physicians discarded it as the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felton since the general influenza epidemic of 1918-19 has been working with a commission organized by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. in an attempt to find a remedy for influenza . Although he has not conquered influenza , he has found a serum for the most dreaded concomitant of that disease-the pneumonia which often put a fatal termination to a case of influenza . <P> In his research work Dr. Felton took the unpurified serum as it was drawn from the blood of a horse . He filtered it , treated it electrically and chemically , tried always to extract rom it a pure solution of antibodies , ree from the injurious by-products that hitherto had rendered the horse serum nearly valueless . Eventually Dr. Felton found that when one part of the horse serum was mixed with ten parts water a white , fluffy precipitate appeared . He collected this precipitate , purified it , found that it dried into a white crystalline powder which he suspected contained the antibodies in highly concentrated form . Mice . Dr. Felton experimented with the newly , found powder . Two groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then injected with the white powder . These recovered . Every member of Group B died . A more rigorous test was then made on one mouse . Into his body were injected enough germs " to kill a million mice . " He was given the white powder-and quickly recovered . These experiments on mice continued until Dr. Felton was positive he had found a remedy for pneumonia . At least he was certain the new substance was in no way harmful . He then determined the exact potency of the new serum , distributed small quantities of it among hospitals in Boston , New York , Brooklyn . Humans . Thereupon the substance was injected into the veins of 120 persons , suffering from pneumonia . In not one case was there any unfavorable reaction . On the basis of these tests it was predicted that 25% to 50% of the cases of pneumonia can be cured . Injection is always made in the veins ; subcutaneous injection has not proved effective .                 @ @ @ @
