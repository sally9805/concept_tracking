txt American Smelting &; Refining Co. ' s earnings for the first half year were at the annual rate of approximate $15 ' a share on the 609,980 shares of common stock after taxes , bond interest , preferred dividends , depreciation , depletion and all charges . This compares with $12.60 a share in 1924 . Washout in February , by torrential rains , of the railroad connecting company 's Peruvian property with the sea coast held back shipments from that subsidiary , while neees , ity of rebuilding company 's reverberatory furnaces because of the Carson patent decision also interfered somewhat with earnings in the first half yearCompany is finding that the Carson litigation was a blessing in disguise , as it gave the company an opportunity to try out several furnace modificatioich company 's metallurgists had under consideration . After some experimenting a form of furnace in no way infringing the Carson patents has been adopted and all but a few reverberatories kept for comparison purposes have been changed to the new type . MARNINGS OUTLOOK . What American Smelting earnings will be for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prices prevailing upon lead , zinc andsilver . Outlook is that lead prices will probably average somewhat over 8 cents a pound New York for the second half year . Zinc prices should average as high as they have for the first half year , or around 714 cents a pound St. Louis , while silver outlook also is good . Copper prices promise to be better than the average of 14% cents delivered for the first six months . Earnings for the second half year of the Rosita project should be larger because much of this installation was not operating until well along in the middle of the first half . year . The new San Luis Potosi copper smelter should be completed and in operation by September , s Peruvian earnings should be somewhat larger and the TaNmine at Parral should be earning more in the second half year .

PLANTS OPERATING AT MGM RATE American Smelting is often viewed as a copper company , but the prices of lead , silver and zinc are much more important to the company than that of copper , as it is the amount of copper and copper ore being produced and sent to its smelters and refineries that really affects its copper earnings rather than price of the metal . Fortunately practically all the ore and concentrates that it treats come from low Cost producers . At its Baltimore refinery it has some spare refining capacity , so that in case copper consumption shows the improvement expected in the second half year , especially in Europe , much of the increase in refinery output in 1926 will be at the Baltimore plant . Other than for its Baltimore copper refinery , and its Murray lead smelter in Utah , its United States and Mexican plants are operating at close to capacity . There is a little spare smelting capacity still left at the Tacoma smelter , but the refinery end is operating at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copper 's output to be raised to 22,000,000 pounds a month . The Ray and the El Paso smelters both can treat additional tonnages from those mines . The company is installing Cottrel treaters for decreasing fume loss of the metals , and these Cottrel treaters are helping considerably in cutting down metal losses . Due to the large sums expended during the last few years in rebuilding old plants and in erecting new ones , the company 's properties are in many ways in the best condition in which they have been for many years . keep the company 's quarterly dividend rate at $1.50 a High rate of American Smelting 's earnings naturally share on the common stock and pay at the end of the year brings up the matter of an increase in the dividend rate . an extra dividend according to how good the company 's Probably there is no industry in which it pays better to earnings have been for the period .
