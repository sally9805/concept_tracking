AN illumination of the darkness discloses the edge of a tobacco field on a late afternoon in spring . At the back is a hedgerow of dogwood bushes , sassafras shrubs and wild flowers glowing with a medley of colors in the slanting sun . A sandy road runs parallel beyond the hedge , and farther back a forest of lob-lolly pines stretches away . Inside the hedge a narrow wired-off plot encloses two graves marked by small white tombstones . The wire fence is half-buried in honeysuckle and trumpet vine , and the ground before is carpeted with a thick growth of green broomstraw . LORA GRAHAM comes in from the right , dressed in the rough outdoor clothes of a farm girl . She is about seventeen years old . LORA Calling softly behind her . I 'm going down the hedge to pick some flowers ! She moves up to the wire fence with a peculiar gliding grace and stands looking down at the graves . They fade quick with the days getting hot .

One of our folks , they tell , was a hand for it  --  Sir Hughie Graham  --  they called it Grime then , and there was a song about him . Grandmuh knew it all by heart , more'n twenty verses . He fought ten men at once backed up against a tree and all because they accused him of stealing a mare . Reciting in a sing-song voice . " Sir Hugh of the Grime 's condemned to die , And of his friends he had no lack ; Fourteen foot he leaped in his cell , His hands tied fast on his back . Then he looked over his left shoulder , To see who he could see or spy ; Then was he aware of his father dear , Come tearing his hair most pitifully . " He goes over to the plot , and stands looking down at the two graves. p. 10 SPENCE In a low voice . What in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before . JONES You 'll see worse . SPENCE Violently .

JONES We 'll go git em . p. 11 OSCAR Walking back and forth at the end of the rows . He 's come  --  come back from the darkness and the grave . Seven years gone and no word from him  --  nothing . Across the field I saw him standing on the back-porch . The sun was shining on him . And then my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and rest . We 'll finish . OSCAR I cai n't get the dream out'n my head . I was coming up the lane with everything dark around me but the road . The road was like a furrow of light ploughed on before me . I come along near the house and I looked and the house was all black , and a thin frame of a woman all dressed in black was standing before it with her head hid under a great big black bonnet . Then I heard somebody wailing inside , and it was Lora . And away off in the wood back of the house I heard them two Throwing out his hand towards the gravescalling so lonesome it 'd eat your heart out . When I come up at the woodpile I asked the black woman what she was doing , but she would n't say nothing , just stood there high as a stake . And I heard the sparrows talking in the elm trees , fluttering and whispering and looking at me with big hollow eyes , and they were sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away his head . JONES Wonderingly . A dream  --  p. 12 OSCAR It skeared me , skeared me to death nearly . In the yard everything was dark , like the eclipse . The cow was lowing way off and the sound seemed to run across the sky like a roll of thunder in August . It died away and I heard my daddy calling the hogs up at the mulberry orchard the way he useter . Every time he called a kind of jarring run right through me into the ground . Then Florie and Minna begun to call the hogs with him . They 'd call the little ones and he 'd call the big ones . The calling changed from the hogs to me  --  " Oscar , where are you , Oscar ? " he would say , and they 'd say , " Father , father , come get us , we 're lost up here under this big clay-root . We 're stifling to death in the dirt . " And all of a sudden my daddy hollered to me to let him come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair at the table and eat some roas'n ears . He was a great hand for young corn . I was skeared to death , I tell ye , and called back and told him not to come . Then Lora run to the window and leant out and begged me to make Florie and Minna go back to their graves . " Make em go back , make em go back ! " she 'd say . And I looked at the thin woman in the yard , and she turned and went up the road to run em back in their graves . There come a mournful wailing up at the pasture when she put em back in the ground . All of a sudden I heard Lora screaming around the house . I run and met her and Edward was walking behind smiling , his lips pulled back from his teeth like a dog . And he 'd took a hot iron and burnt Lora 's face all black . Beating his hands together . I woke up and it was day . p. 13 JONES A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telegram come from him saying he 'd be here soon . And he 's here now , Tapley , there at the house . JONES Then everybody 'll be glad . OSCAR Ye  --  will she be glad , Tapley ? JONES After seven long years . OSCAR Ah ! Listen to her singing there . Aye , happy . Is anybody happy except the good ?

OSCAR Ye could take the farm after me , ye and her . Beseechingly . She 's got to have somebody to protect her , Colin . I wo n't be here long to do it .

SPENCE No , he wo n't , never . LORA is seen entering the road from the forest . She stands listening to the wailing with a thoughtful face a moment and then comes on through the hedge , carrying an armful of late dogwood sprays and wild flowers . LORA Gently . Why do they do that ? OSCAR Sorrowing for their dead . LORA Tommy !  --  Ca n't you go down the road and make em stop it ? OSCAR Looking up at the sky . Grief is the way to be purified . LORA I 'm ready to go back to work . Starting . Have you heard anything else from Brother ? Clutching his arm . Has he come ?

Vanity OSCAR Vanity of vanities saith the preacher . LORA I ca n't see  --  OSCAR Softly . Minna and Florie done like that . LORA Oh ! OSCAR Ye 're one of the redeemed now . LORA Yes . OSCAR And things that decorate and make ye purty , leave em alone , leave em all alone . Put not your heart in that . LORA Childishly . Put it in Jesus . OSCAR In Jesus . He will save ye and protect ye from the adversary . p. 16 LORA He is my hope and my salvation . OSCAR And all the things of this world are vanity and vexation of spirit . LORA All is vanity . OSCAR Like the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile hovering on his lips. , whirling about continually , no rest , no peace . LORA In the grave whither thou goest . OSCAR Amen . They stand a moment silent . TAPLEY and COLIN move around in embarrassment . LORA What is it ? OSCAR Tearfully . Ye 're so good , Lora . Ye are good , ai n't ye , child ? LORA I try to be . OSCAR To himself . Let the dream go now , pass from my mind . LORA A dream ? OSCAR I 've dreamed of ye in your white robes , like a saint of God . LORA With wings and all . OSCAR Lora , ye do feel saved and consecrated ? LORA Putting her hand on her breast . I do , Father , you know I do . p. 17 OSCAR And ye do love the Lord ? LORA And I always will OSCAR Through him we walk in the new Jerusalem and rest by the river of life . LORA Still repeating like a child . He set us free from the wages of sin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , a smile fluttering in her face . I love the Lord better than everything . Her voice rising in a chant . He died for the sins of the world . He is the lamb whose blood was shed for sinful man . All of us so pitiful and black in the corruption of the world can be washed in that precious blood  --  like a great sea of blood the way the sunset is  --  all of us can be made as white as snow , white like these dogwood blossoms . OSCAR Though our sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow . LORA With lifted face . And we shall walk upon the mountain . OSCAR Amen ! LORA Bursting into sobs . I believe in him and love him and worship him . I bow down and worship him . Father , do n't talk so . p. 18 OSCAR Aye , aye , my daughter . He bends and kisses her and puts his hand on her head . May God be with thee like Jacob of old . LORA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I 'm afraid of God . OSCAR Uncertainly . God is good , he is love . LORA I see him at night and he scares me  --  I 'm afraid of God , with his beard . OSCAR Then keep your little heart on his son . Hark ! LORA Her face flushed.  --  He so young and beautiful hanging there on the cross and the mean people spitting on him . I close my eyes and see his face and the tears pouring down it , so wonderful and white , and it looks like brother 's picture before t was burned up long ago . OSCAR Sharply . He was not of this world . LORA Why did God let them drive nails through his soft hands ? Shuddering . I dream about it till it gets all in my head . It was mean and cruel and I can see his long white fingers twisting and twisting . The lamentation of the mourning Negroes draws nearer . The two farm helpers move over to the hedge and stare up the road to the right. p. 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So do it and ye 'll hold the old Bad Boy away from your pure soul . LORA And I do n't let him tempt me . Last night he came and begged me to go into a dark woods . He showed me the woods and said it was purty there . And flowers shone out like little new lamps  --  so beautiful . I wanted to go , but I was afraid and I began to say parts of the Bible by heart , and he went away . It was so strange . He looked ugly with hoofs and horns , and then he became beautiful like brother 's picture , but older . OSCAR Ah . LORA Oh , me ! OSCAR God may try ye soon , child . LORA He may !  --  OSCAR He tries everyone , do n't he , Tapley ? JONES Reckon he does , he does . OSCAR Trying poor Mack and Jennie there with their dead boy . In a fierce voice . Ye 've got to be strong , Lora ! LORA Starting back and letting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , gnawing and grinding ! LORA Go home and rest . Gathering her flowers together . And now I 'll put these flowers there for em . And I 'll tell em to pray for us all to be saved , Colin and Tapley and everybody in the world . p. 20 OSCAR Twisting his hands . Will they answer ye , Lora ? LORA I hear em in the air and sometimes behind the hedgerow . OSCAR Ah ye better quit coming up here at night . He turns and strides off to the left and then returns . Colin do ye ever pay any mind to what I asked ye about him ? LORA Please OSCAR He 'd be good to ye . LORA Please , please OSCAR He would  --  and that 's all right . SPENCE Sump'n moving in that bonnet . JONES Hanh ? SPENCE Jumping back . Goodness , it 's a snake ! He reaches for his tobacco peg . LORA Snatching up the bonnet and revealing a small glittering green snake . I caught him on a vine out there . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake down ! She drops the snake and watches it wriggle away in the grass. p. 21 JONES Great guns , she put her hands on him , she did ! LORA Smiling naively . He was so purty and gentle playing there . He stuck out his little red tongue at me teasing . OSCAR Whirling abruptly around . I 'll be right back with the plants , Tapley . Ye all meet me up there at the other end of the rows Oh , God ! He puts his hands to his head and goes heavily out at the left . LORA In distress . Father JONES I du n no , I do n't . COLIN suddenly begins beating in the grass with his tobacco peg . LORA Flying at him . Do n't you hurt him , do n't you hit that little snake ! He holds the dead snake aloft . SPENCE That thing bite you , and it 'll kill you . LORA snatches the snake from him and falls on the ground , sobbing and crooning over it . JONES Now SPENCE Hush ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far into the woods. p. 22 LORA Gasping . Do n't you put your ugly hands on me . SPENCE But you do what your father said . With suppressed sobs she goes over to the hedge and stands leaning against a dogwood bush . The moaning and beating of the Negroes draw nearer . JONES Holler like that all the way to the graveyard ! LORA With sudden calmness . Do you believe in God ? JONES I reckon so . LORA Did God kill little Tommy  --  like the little snake ? JONES In a way he done it , he did . The funeral procession is heard near at hand , with a background of chanting and song , interspersed with moans and wails and the dull thud of beaten breasts . The mournful lamentation rises to the sky , led by a woman 's piercing voice . " Dark was de night and cold de groundIn which my Saviour laid ! " SPENCE He stepped on a nail and the lockjaw killed him . JONES Anh , he 'd be in the field ploughing this very minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 23 LORA Vehemently . Then Jesus brought death on himself . JONES He had to die for us all ! LORA God would n't let it happen if he could . SPENCE All 's for a purpose ! LORA He would n't let it happen if he could . Mockingly . Ha , I bet I know why he did n't help it . " De bones in de grave cried CalvaryDe night my Jesus died . " The head of the cortge comes slowly in at the right , and the two men take off their hats . A Negro preacher goes before , beating on his breast with a Bible and swaying his bare head from side to side . Following him come four moaning Negro farmers carrying a rude pine box between them ; then the parents , and behind , several turbaned Negro women , men and children . The slow procession shows above the hedge in a queer nodding minstrelsy , moving forward with the jerky steps of instinctive puppets , their faces set in a wooden stare . " In de resurrection , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it , King Jesus said , Gwine putt de new man on . " LORA begins to sway like the Negroes . She snatches up an armful of flowers and rushes through the hedge. p. 24 LORA Tommy , Tommy ! She falls in with the mourners , throwing bouquets on the coffin . The wailing bursts forth in a redoubled howl : " Dark was de night and cold de groundIn which my Saviour laid.De bones in de grave cried Calvary , De night my Jesus died . " LORA flings herself down in the road rocking and weeping , and the procession passes on . JONES They carry on , they do . SPENCE Niggers . LORA Behind the hedge . There 's Tommy dead and stiff . JONES Listen at her . LORA The little puppies I buried had worms in em three days after . I dug em up and saw it . SPENCE Lora ! JONES What 's she saying ? SPENCE Sharply . Hush up . Presently a low cold laugh is heard behind the hedge . JONES For God 's sake , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge and lifts LORA from the ground . SPENCE Come on and go home , Lora. p. 25 LORA Breaking from him . Let me loose . Do n't you put your cold hands on me ! She turns upon them with a queer light in her eyes . The trees become gold and the field there turned like a great bowl of sunshine . I heard their wailing inside of my head and I could see little Tommy way off there like a little black stick , stretched out stiff , same as a black nail in a bed of coals . She breaks into a cold sardonic laugh . JONES Merciful heavens ! LORA Huskily . Jesus , and I love Jesus . They spit on him and put nails in him , nails like little Tommy stuck in his foot  --  rusty nails . She approaches TAPLEY and COLIN , staring at them . And Jesus cried to God and God did n't answer . They stuck a hole in his side and a black cloud came down to hide it all . He said let the cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks up and down with the steps of the Negro mourners  --  there in the garden  --  there on the mountain . But the cup could n't pass  --  could n't pass . God could n't answer , nobody could answer  --  he had to die  --  had to suffer  --  everybody 's got to die  --  got to suffer . Waving her hands over her head . Minna and Florie had to suffer and die  --  I have to suffer and die  --  p. 26 SPENCE Seizing her arm . Hush that . LORA Beating off his hands . I love Jesus but I hate God  --  I hate whatever it is SPENCE Stop that before the ground swallows you up . She drops her head and stands gazing down at the earth , shivering and seeming to shrink under her clothes . What has happened to her ? JONES The niggers passing mebbe . SPENCE Good Mr. Graham did n't hear you , Lora . LORA Her face suddenly blanched with terror as she stares across the fields to the right . Look ! I see something standing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JONES Lord a-mercy ! Hanh , ai n't nothing there Colin ? SPENCE Ai n't nothing . LORA drops down upon the grass hiding her face in her hands . Lora , Lora JONES Heaving a deep sigh . Look at them tobacco plants out there ? They stand up proud and straight like little soldiers . The dew 's begun to fall on em and started em growing . p. 27 SPENCE Softly . Yeh Flea bugs short it in two , who knows ? JONES My rows look fresher'n yourn , they do . They ai n't nothing better'n this old finger for putting em in the ground . Spitting . I would n't have one o them there pegs . SPENCE Monotonously . Yeh , wear your fingernail off to the roots if you want to . JONES Shrugging his shoulders . We better git on up there to the other end . SPENCE Bitterly . Yeh , let 's go on . JONES Be so dark in a minute you cai n't see how to set . We 're ready to go , Lora . SPENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JONES Jerking his thumb over his shoulder . Now what you got to say ? SPENCE Whining in smouldering fury . Do n't you say another word about it , I tell you ! His shoulders heave with restrained sobs as he lurches off at the left . TAPLEY gazes about him , blinking his eyes in stupefaction . With a grunt he goes off after him . By this time the sun has set and the thin mist of dusk has overspread the scene . Bullbats are braying in the sky and the whippoorwill is heard in the woods . Above the pines at the rear a thin new moon has come out . And from the neighboring countryside the sounds of evening move one after the other across the scene  --  farmers calling their pigs , the tinkle of cowbells , a country lad whistling to his dog , the high song of a laborer going home . Presently LORA gathers the scattered sprays and flowers in her arms , passes within the enclosure , and begins placing them on the graves. p. 28 LORA These are purty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet . I got em in the woods all around . You 've never seen so many flowers  --  everywhere ,  --  violets and pinks and bluets . I put some of em in my hair , but father made me take em out . It 's wrong for me to wear em , but he do n't care if you do . He 's glad for you to , yes he is . It 's vanity for me , but when I die it 'll be all right . They 'll put a lot of flowers on me and dress me in a white dress . Bending over the tombstones . And I caught a purty little green snake and Colin killed him . He killed him with a peg and threw him away in the woods . Minna and Florie , I do n't like Colin , and his hands  --  I ca n't stand them . Little Tommy 's gone now , they carried him by to the graveyard . You heard em all passing , I know you did . It was pitiful . Is it bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Bad Boy  --  and I 'm afraid of him . She takes up several trinkets from the graves  --  little glass slippers , cups , shells and the like  --  and refills them with fresh flowers . She bends her head to one of the tombstones and whispers . He 's not come yet . They said he was coming back to us , but he 's not come yet . Will he come , will he come to us ? Jubilantly . I 'm so glad , I 'm so glad ! A young man comes quietly along the road behind the hedge at the right . He is bareheaded , with a shock of yellow hair , and dressed in the uniform of an army lieutenant . He comes quietly up to the hedge and stands looking over at her , his face filled with a slumbrous brooding sadness . Let him come back to me , and then I 'll die . I want to be with you , yes , yes . I 'm afraid of father and mother , too . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , we 'd all be happy . Is it purty up there ? The preacher says it is , and father says so . If you could tell me about Jesus , for he is there . You 're there with him , I know . You did n't drown yourselves in the pond , I know you did n't . Why do n't you tell me you did n't ? It 's not wrong if you did , is it ? It 's better to be in heaven , everybody says so . Let brother come back to me , and then I 'll do it too , I 'll hide under the water , I 'm not afraid . Brother , brother ! p. 29 EDWARD In a low voice . Who is she ? LORA Who is that ? EDWARD Lora ?

She drops down on her knees and bows her head in her lap . Edward , Edward  --  Laughing . Think of my saying that name out loud to him and he 's standing there hearing my words . p. 30 EDWARD Say it again . LORA Hide quick , father 's up yonder in the field .

He slowly pulls her up from the ground. p. 32 LORA Then stay here . EDWARD And I will leave you . LORA Her face shining out in the dusk . I 'm not afraid , not like them . I would die and not mind it . EDWARD There 's a tree in the forest and the pinks and violets grew there under our feet . Pointing over his shoulder . When the moon was there , we 'd meet . And round and round , their hair flying behind them LORA Holding up her hand . I found Florie 's ring there . EDWARD Their hair was dark and their cheeks like maple buds . LORA Somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours and long  --  longer than theirs . She loosens her hair and lets it roll down over her shoulders . And I could dance and run faster than they . I go there alone in the moonlight sometimes . And I 've seen them peeping at me behind the big poplar . EDWARD They were too beautiful to die , and you And so good-bye . LORA You sha n't go away . I 'll go with you . EDWARD You 're beautiful , Lora , more beautiful than they . p. 33 LORA If you leave me I will go and be with them . EDWARD And the moon would not come up tomorrow night , the sun and the stars would go out forever . She leans against him and he touches her hair gently with his lips Presently he draws his shoulders back and lifts his head in a military posture . Can you hear it ? LORA I hear the crickets in the hedge , and everything drowsy like . EDWARD It comes in at my ears and beats behind my eyes . LORA Whispering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going behind the sky somewhere , everything lifting up like a yellow curtain and leaving us alone in the world . In a queer hypnotic voice . You are the world somehow . EDWARD It beats behind my eyes . The air is full of honeysuckle , coming through the roots out of their graves , and going up to the moon . Softly as if seeing a scene far off . One-two-three-four  --  One-two-three-four . LORA Wildly . You 'll not leave me  --  Now you 're here , you 've come back . I can hardly believe it but it 's true , you 're here with me . You 'll never leave me any more . Seizing his hands and kissing them . Your hands are wonderful and sad like your poor face , they 're like his hands where they drove the nails . His face was like yours . They burned the picture to keep me from seeing you , but I saw you in my mind , more wonderful than he was . And they nailed him on the cross , and made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Jesus was not afraid and you 're like him  --  you are the light of the world . Her breath comes through her lips like a gasp as she clings to him . He kisses her shyly , then pushes her from him. p. 34 EDWARD Good-bye His face set and hard , he turns away . LORA At first I could n't understand , and now I do . EDWARD Lora ! GRAHAM 'S voice is heard calling her in the fields . LORA Snatching up handsful of flowers . You said I was  --  their eyes and their hair was black but you said  --  say it again  --  EDWARD You are , you are .

New moon , new moon , Mr. New Moon ! LORA Crazy moon . EDWARD We 'll put out your light , yellow moon . LORA Wildly . Yellow moon , funny moon ! " She hurries through the hedge and he follows her . OSCAR Coming in from the left . God have mercy ! They are engulfed in the shadow of the forest . For a moment he stands crushed and stupefied , and then raises his head towards the sky . Thy will not mine be done . He runs through the hedge after them . Presently a pistol shot is fired , followed by a scream . In a few minutes he returns leading LORA by the hand . She walks stiffly and mechanically like a puppet . GRAHAM is babbling idiotically . He done it hisself , he snatched it out'n my hand and stuck it in his breast . He done it , I did n't do it . He killed hisself . Old TAPLEY and COLIN hurry in. p. 35 JONES Wetting his lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods dead  --  The slayed  --  weltering in his own blood , as it was foretold about the beast under seven seals . Leading LORA off towards the right . Let 's go home , supper is ready . Smacking his lips . Supper  --  eat  --  eat .  --  Let the ants and flies tear him off bit by bit . Let him rot  --  and the buzzards hollow his heart and eyes out . JONES Striking himself with his hat . Great God ! OSCAR Going off at the right with LORA . Turn the earth dark with shame . God said destroy , destroy utterly . The adversary is abroad in the land  --  kill him , kill him . A blight come into the world . Like him of old I curse my mother now . For let that day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it is said there is a man child conceived They pass out at the right , his voice dying away . Let that day be darkness ; let not God regard it from above , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the woods and see p. 36 SPENCE Bursting into sobs . I 'm gon na leave here . He dashes through the hedge and down the road at the left . Old TAPLEY hesitates a moment and them stumbles after him . The scene disappears in darkness . Several minutes pass , and then the light comes up again , showing a bedroom in the Graham farmhouse . It is a cloudy late afternoon three days later . The light that trickles in from the doorway to the right leaves the room to the left shadowed in a gray semi-darkness . Above the mantel is a faded oil portrait of a courtier in the time of Elizabeth . A coffin draped in a United States flag is placed in the center of the room before the fireplace , its two ends resting on chairs . A YOUNG PREACHER stands at the head reading from a Bible ; and at the foot , a SOLDIER , erect and stiff , looks before him with unseeing eyes . GRAHAM and his wife , dressed in crude mourning , sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black sits nearby , her head slightly bent , with a white flower on her breast . Her clenched hands continually beat a tattoo on her knees . Near the door at the right COLIN and TAPLEY with several other farmers stand bowed in an attitude of respect . Through the door the faces of neighbors are seen , curious and reverent . PREACHER Reading . Wilt thou hide thyself forever ? Shall thy wrath burn like fire ? Remember how short my time is : wherefore hast thou made all men in vain ? What man is he that liveth and shall not see death ? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ? Lord , where are thy former loving-kindnesses , which thou swarest unto David in thy truth ? Remember , Lord , the reproach of thy servants ; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people ; wherewith thine enemies have reproached , O Lord ; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed . Blessed be the name of the Lord forever . Amen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of the lesson according to the Psalms . Wiping his face with his handkerchief . I passed a cornfield in the spring and near the road a hill of corn was withered and dead . A mole ploughed under it . It put forth its strength in the sun and dew to die in the early days of its life . Death is everywhere and we do n't understand it . Books tell us how one nation has to kill off neighboring nations in order to live . And still God says thou shalt not kill . I do n't understand it . We see the morning and the evening go by , the trees and plants around us die , and it makes us feel the tragedy of this young man 's passing away . The old man like a ripening apple fulfills his season , lives out his years and goes to his everlasting home . But this young man was cut down in the bloom of his days , in the very budding of his spring  --  cut down without knowing what it is to live to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice chokes , and MRS . GRAHAM sobs in her handkerchief . The atheist and the infidel say yes there is no God and there is no hope . A man is no more than a flower , a beast of the field led to slaughter , a leaf flickering down under the winter snow . Laying his hand reverently on the Bible . But blessed be the name of the Lord , we have a hope . Let the days and seasons change and man 's poor life be forfeit , we still have a hope in the Word . It says all things are possible with God . His ways are not like our ways , and everything works for the good of those who love him . Even in the case of this young man who so suddenly took his own life  --  there is a hope . And I say to the father and mother and the dear sister , let not your hearts be troubled , for I know the Redeemer liveth and he will not desert his own . He closes his eyes a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who wish may look at the dead . The service will be concluded at the grave . There is a low murmur and stirring in the hall as the SOLDIER lifts back the flag and raises the lid . Presently a chorus of rough untrained voices , men and women , begin singing . " In the land of fadeless dayLies a city four-square , And it ne'er shall pass away , For there is no night there . " Neighbors begin to go slowly by the coffin , their faces heavy and sad . A country woman comes in with her little son and lifts him up. p. 37 WOMAN Softly . Kin ye see , sonny ? BOY Loudly . He 's got curly hair , mammy ! They pass on and out through a door at the right rear . Others come in as the music continues  --  farmers and their wives , and children , some young and others bent and toilworn . A little girl and her small brother come in . LITTLE GIRL Whispering loudly . He 's the purtiest corpse I ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare down in the coffin a moment and then with a poignant look at each other stuff their handkerchiefs to their lips and go out weeping . The music from the hall hesitates and drags as some of the singers enter and go by  --  " God shall wipe away all tears , There 's no death , no pain nor tears  --  And they count not time by years , For there is no night there . " The farmers at the door pass by . JONES Wanter see him , Colin ? SPENCE Do n't want to . TAPLEY goes , the last of the procession , looks and returns quietly to his place , tapping his fingers against his trousers . PREACHER If there 's no one else , I 'll ask that the lid be closed . p. 38 LORA Suddenly starting up from the bed . I 'll put a flower on his lips , a little flower . There is a stir of craning necks and faces in the hall . JONES To the men around him . Anh , she does thataway . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's a good Christian girl . MAN 'S VOICE Like her father and mother . A GIRL The best one of em all . WOMAN 'S VOICE Her pore mind 's cracked about wi grief . LORA I 'll put a flower on him to remember me by . She moves across the room with the steps of the Negro mourners , and taking the flower from her breast places it in the coffin . She turns and looks strangely around her . I will arise now and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him . PREACHER Taking her kindly by the shoulders . Do n't cry , child , do n't cry . FARMER Anh , her heart 's broke in two . PREACHER Leading her back to her seat . You can put it all on Jesus . He is waiting to bear our griefs he understands Ask God to p. 39 LORA Dully . There is no God . There 's no one but Jesus . He is Jesus and they killed him . Brother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The SOLDIER closes down the lid . OSCAR Crying out . Hide that sinful woman from me ! PREACHER Our Father  --  OSCAR Standing up as a murmur of horror runs down the hall . I shot him and killed him there in the woods . Take me away , put my eyes out , cut my tongue from its roots and bury me in the ground . MRS . GRAHAM screams and stares at him in terror . GRAHAM points at LORA . Out of my loins has come forth the seed of hell . Neighbors will rise up and curse me while the world do stand . Take me away and kill me ! He rushes out and is heard crying and cursing himself in the distance . THIRD FARMER Awestruck . They must be a curse on em all . FOURTH FARMER He said he killed him . THIRD FARMER Too good a man fer that . The SOLDIER as if unconcerned removes the flowers from the coffin , hands them to several girls , and motions to the men to bear the body out . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move forward and take up the coffin . LORA breaks away from the preacher and rushes toward them. p. 40 LORA They sha n't take you away from me , never as long as I live . JONES Lifting her firmly to her seat . Be quiet now . LORA Do n't give him to them ! JONES Pushing her back . Stop and be easy . MRS . GRAHAM gets up and totters into the hall . Hands are stretched through the door to support her . The men go out slowly with the body , the PREACHER walking ahead and the SOLDIER behind . The crowd follows through the hall and the noise of their going gradually dies up the road . TAPLEY and COLIN remain by the door , as LORA crouches moaning in her chair . SPENCE Coming up to her . Let me help you to lie down now , you 're sick . They pick her up and place her on the bed . COLIN bends tenderly over her , in a catchy voice . Lora , Lora , you jest wring my heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , please let me do something , Lora . LORA And I 'll come to you . JONES Colin , we better go look for him , his face was quare p. 41 SPENCE She 's about to go to sleep . JONES Nervously . So much has happened I 'm all foolish . Colin , he mought harm hisself SPENCE I got to watch her . TAPLEY goes out at the right . LORA Starting up in the bed , her face transfigured . I can see you ! SPENCE Laying her gently back . Sleep now , sleep right quiet and easy . LORA In a happy voice . They wo n't ever be able to part us again . SPENCE Bending over her a moment and then sitting down by the bed . Oh , I wisht you could sleep till day after tomorrow . Ye ai n't slept a wink since it happened . Pore thing  --  worry , worry , worry ! Rest yourself , please rest yourself . Oh , Lora Lora , honey child ! Several minutes pass and then TAPLEY comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SPENCE Asleep  --  ssh ! JONES In a hushed voice .

Tapping his fingers against his trousers . Never was sech a day in the world . SPENCE Standing sharply up . My God A'mighty ! JONES Hunh ? SPENCE Ah , it 's been eating in hyuh since that night there in the field . Half-whispering . I been saying all the time to myself they wo n't nothing to it . But it was all that made him do it JONES Peering at him . What you saying ? SPENCE With an abandoned gesture . Him and her there JONES I 've knowed her from a baby .

I ai n't gon na believe nothing ! p. 43 JONES She 's quiet He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing his hat . His gaze travels around the room as if he wanted to ask somebody a question . Finally his eyes stop on COLIN . She 's gone , Colin , dead ! SPENCE Lora ! Burying his face in the bed beside her . She was purty as a angel and now she 's dead , that 's what she is . He seizes her hands and kisses them crazily  --  softly . You useter work in the fields with me , and at night when I 'd lay down I thought about you . And when I got up in the morning the sky was purty when I thought about you . Rocking himself in grief . I did n't treat you right . I killed your little snake and made you feel bad . He springs up and seizes TAPLEY by the arms . You did n't like her , you talked about her mean . JONES Lordy mercy ! SPENCE Helplessly . Now I wo n't have nothing to think on , nothing no more .

I 'm gon na quit , gon na go away to public work . I 'll leave here . I 'm gon na leave  --  p. 44 JONES Looking at the walls queerly . They 's a hand somewhere . He stares fearfully around him . Nothing else kin happen . He touches COLIN on the shoulder and they go slowly out at the right . In the distance a bugle blows . The courtier above the mantel whose face resembles Edward 's looks quietly before him as if he had nothing at all to do , with such things , nothing at all .
