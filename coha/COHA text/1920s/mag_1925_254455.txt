Mr. Dawes was resting . The proceedings of the Senate had wearied him . The nomination of Charles B. Warren of Michigan to be Attorney General was under consideration . Senator Cummins of Iowa had begun a four hour speech defending the nominee . Senator Reed of Missouri and Senator Walsh* had each made a lengthly speech attacking Mr. Warren ; the Vice President had been assured that there would be nothing but talk for the rest of the day . <P> So he left the Senate , turned the gavel over to President pro tempore Moses and retired up Pennsylvania Ave . to his rooms in the Willard Hotel . It was presumed that he was reclining en d shabill . He had telephoned to the Capitol twice during the afternoon to find out whether his presence was required and the answer had been : " No . " <P> But , as he reclined , there came a telephone message to say that the Senate had sent out a call for a quorum . Mr. Dawes donned his clothes , went downstairs . He summoned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took eight minutes to reach the Capitol . <P> Senator Cameron of Arizona and his secretary were waiting outside . They seized the General by both arms and hurried him upstairs- but it was too late . <P> The Nomination . Some weeks ago , Mr. Coolidge nominated Charles B. Warren , former Ambassador to Japan and , until a few months ago , Ambassador to Mexico , to be Attorney General . There was argument in the Senate and Mr. Warren 's nomination was the only one not acted on by the Senate of the 68th Congress before it adjourned on Mar. 4 . Hence the nomination remained over for the new Senate to act upon . <P> The Argument . The opponents of Mr. Warren declared that he had been implicated in improper relations with the " Sugar Trust . " Some 20 years ago , he acted as agent for the American Sugar Refining Co. in acquiring stock in a number of Michigan sugar refineries . Lately , he has been President of the Michigan Sugar Refining Co. , a consolidation which came out of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust " was investigated by Congress . Senator Reed of Missouri and Senator Walsh had cross-examined Mr. Warren on that occasion . They brought up the former investigation in their speeches . Senator Reed was particularly bitter . Said he : <P> I trust that a sufficient number of Senators who have not been seduced to political apostasy by the family sap bucket , or gorged into stupefaction by buckwheat cakes and Vermont maple syrup , or lulled to moral insensibility by the melody of waves breaking against the prow of the Mayflower- I trust there are enough left to vote against delivering the Department of Justice into the hands of the Sugar Trust . <P> To appoint Charles Beecher Warren to enforce the trust laws against himself and his associates is as wicked as to appoint Albert Fall special prosecutor of Harry Sinclair . Fall could be bought . Warren is owned in advance . <P> Fall hoped to escape prosecution . Warren will be assured against punishment . Fall aided others to commit crime . Warren connived and assisted in the execution of crime . Fall 's unlawful purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
