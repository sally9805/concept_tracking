Scorching sun beat from a hot October sky on opening games . Players were carried from fields uninjured ; helpless with heat exhaustion . Larger universities used three and four teams to relieve the strain ; small colleges with little squads saw their men suffer far more than they will from any snow storms of November . <P> Famed Notre Dame produced a green but agile team and defeated Coe 28-7 as scouts from later season enemies ( Army , Navy , Indiana , Minnesota , Detroit ) watched narrowly , scribbled notes . <P> The highest score of early games was made by Temple ( Philadelphia university of 6,000 students ) which ripped Blue Ridge to ribbons , 110-0 . Blue Ridge is a tiny Maryland institution ; enrollment about 180 , including girls . So hot was the Philadelphia afternoon that final periods were shortened to 5 minutes . Blue Ridge ran out of substitutes ; borrowed three from Temple . <P> Bradley Polytechnic Institute brought a record of 25 straight victories ( including the two-time championship of the " Little 19 " of Illinois ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning streak 19-0 . <P> Alonzo A. Stagg 's University of Chicago squad opened unevenly , losing to Oklahoma 7-13 . <P> In the far west , Oregon won from Pacific 32-6 ; Southern California from Santa Clara , 52 to 12 ; while famed Stanford lost to St. Mary 's 16-0 . <P> Prospectively redoubtable Army was none too redoubtable against Boston University and Detroit on its first two Saturdays . Thirteen points against the former and a mere 6 against the latter was all the team ( most of it ) that played the great Navy team to a memorable tie last season could produce . Defense was strong ; the opposition failed to score . <P> Navy opened against the none-too-potent Davis &; Elkins . Principally with whiplash forward passes , the government eleven took a 27-0 victory . <P> Pennsylvania , Cornell , Syracuse , Dartmouth , Brown , New York university , Penn State , showing expected prowess , clambered rapidly and often across goal lines of small college elevens . <P> Princeton had usual difficulty with Amherst . A 60-yard touchdown and a forward pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were essential in a 14-0 victory . <P> Harvard was one of few conspicuous teams to try the new lateral passing game . Swift sidewise tactics bewildered Vermont ; forward thrusts scored 21 points to 3 . <P> At New Haven Bowdoin pushed feebly against a heavy Bulldog . Yale 41 , Bowdoin 0 . <P> College of the City of New York experimented . Under the white rays of 33,000 watts of electric flood lights they defeated an alumni eleven 5-0 in a night game . Spectators followed the open plays ; were puzzled by shadows in line plunges . The traditional grandstand background of spectators , girls , coonskin coats was blotted out . The experiment was deemed unsatisfactory for important games . A white ball was used .
