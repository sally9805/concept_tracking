Despair <P> In Brooklyn , small Murray Folkoy , 6 , was playing in the street as he had been told not to do . When the principal of the public school where Murray Folkoy attended kindergarten called him into her study on the third floor , Murray Folkoy was scared . He did not expect her to beat him , he did not even know whether she would speak severely or not . But he did know vaguely that whatever she said would break the gay delight he had discovered in going to kindergarten ; it could never be so merry and beautiful again . Finally , miserable , full of an unexplainable despair , small Murray Folkoy jumped out of the window . In the hospital , where doctors said he might recover from a broken leg and other injuries , his mother sat by his bed , his friends sent up messages , even the principal came to see how he was getting along . <P> Death of a Young Man <P> Until they die , dying must remain for people a wild and impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contemplate death as they approach it . The result of the mind 's bouncing , like a tennis ball , between the racquets of Life and Death , is usually expressed completely , inarticulately , paradoxically , in the trite phrase : " What does it all matter ? " Having reached this point , normal people have breakfast ; abnormal people kill themselves . <P> In Manhattan , John Franklin Chattin , 24 , art student , committed suicide . In his room the landlady found some old sketches , mostly grotesque faces , an essay that fumbled with sad puerility at a definition of mortality , a note saying : " What does it all matter anyhow ? " and a copy of Death of a Young Man by W. L. Rivers ( see p. 38 for a review ) . <P> <P> Lesson <P> The terror of darkness is the first and so the deepest of all fears . It was a thing that made a little three-year-old girl in Juliette , Ga. , lie shaking in bed at night , kept awake by a troop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her a nest of horrors ; great cats crouched on the shelves , snakes writhed among the shoes on the floor ; if you put your ear to the keyhole when the door was shut , you could hear them mewing and hissing , but no matter how suddenly you looked in , the wise , hungry creatures could hide before you saw them . Cupboards were all right when the door was open , so people forgot about the darkness in them when the door was shut . If anybody ever got locked in one-the snakes would get her . <P> The three-year-old girl told her mother , Mrs. Raymond Gunn , about this awful secret and advised her to be careful . Mrs. Gunn , who often had to go five times to her daughter 's room to say goodnight , who had often had to quiet a mighty fear by leaving a crack in the door to the lighted hall , listened carefully . Then she said : " You come with me . I 'm going to teach you a lesson . " She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked it , listened to her daughter 's screams and walked away .
