He enjoys the confidence of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands whose Foreign Minister he is . Straight and yet portly of figure , his manner is stiff-necked and blunt . His arrival to dine heavily at one of the smart , white-painted mansions at The Hague , is announced by flunkies , unctuously intoning : " Jonkheer Dr. F. Beelaerts van Blokland ! " <P> Last week " Blunt Beelaerts , " as scurrilous U. S. correspondents term him , consented to receive the press , an infrequent condescension . Evidently his breakfast eggs , toast , cheese , preserves and cups of chocolate had been especially satisfying , for " Blunt Beelaerts " proceeded to open with a Dutch pleasantry . <P> " A country is like a woman , " he gruffed . " A respectable woman is uninteresting . So is a country which minds its own business , pays its debts , and does n't quarrel with its neighbors . " <P> Though the jest seemed a trifle obscure , it had its elements of daring , for the Foreign Minister might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neither . On the whole , Jonkheer Beelaerts appeared content with his pleasantry , for he plunged at once into crisp , forthright comment : " True , gentlemen , we are adjusting a frontier dispute with our good Belgian friends . ... If I may say so without offense , it is the product of the War mentality . Belgium is claiming the two provinces lying south of the Scheldt river on the ground , that it would give them the control of the Scheldt and free the port of Antwerp from the fear of any interference in case of war . They have suggested that we take a part of Germany in compensation , but the Dutch do not desire that way . The only case in which our ownership of these provinces , which we have owned ever since Holland had a separate existence , could embarrass Belgium is in case of war between the two countries , which is unthinkable . We rely on the good sense of both sides for an eventual settlement . We expect no trouble . " <P> Concluding with a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we obtained an American loan of $40,000,000 which will be repaid in 1929 . That loan was raised in America not because we could not get money in Holland , but as a matter of deliberate policy . <P> " Currencies were crashing all around us , and while the guilder held firm at about 40 we did n't know what might happen . . . . We decided that America 's indorsement of our solvency would be of great value , and went to America for money . Since then most of that loan has been bought back by Dutch investors . Our finance , gentlemen , is sound . "
