HER KNIGHT COMES RIDING-John V. A. Weaver-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> Setting down in slang the petty thought and emotion of lower-class America , John Weaver 's verse , " In America " was a success . His success was partly due to simple spelling ( Milt Gross 's anagrams are too difficult ) , but also to his bright reflection of the city-dweller 's curious combination of cynicism and sentimentality . The Brooklyn girl of his first novel has not enough of the cynicism to guard her against too much sentimentality , so she flounders miserably through a crush on the high school football hero , a passionate affair with a marine sergeant ( 1916 ) , and a restful flirtation with a traveled gentleman , until finally she contracts a commonplace marriage with the silent man who had loved her all along . Adventures with football star , hearty marine and grey-haired oldster fell drably short of the tales of knights and ladies , her childhood favorites . But , after all , the lady , though golden-haired , was a stenographer . Author Weaver* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces it out with stilted paragraphs of unlikely philosophy and extraneous sophisticated opinion . <P> <P> * His wife is Actress Peggy Wood of The Clinging Vine ( musical show ) , Merchant of Venice ( Portia ) , and Candida fame . Since becoming Mrs. John V. A. Weaver she has burst into print ( Saturday Evening Post ) with advice to would-be actors .
