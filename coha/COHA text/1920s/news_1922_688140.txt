txt Any one uttering sentiments like those which Clare Sheridan attributed to Rudyard Kipling is " crassly ignorant , villainously malicious , or just a fool . " lin the words of Sir Auckland Geddes , the British Ambassador , who spoke last night at the dinner of the National Police Conference at the Waldorf-Astoria. 1 Paying a warm tribute to the part or America in the war , warning the people of the allied countries of the propaganda of michief-makers , the Britisih representative specifically handled the Kipling incident in these words : " I saw in the press the other day words attributed by a beautiful and charming sculptress and artist to Mr. Rudyard Kipling , which I have no doubt you saw also . " I am glad that Mr. Kipling has emphatically denied having uttered the words attributed to him . If he had uttered them , he would not have spoken as a representative of British thought . 1 He would not have spoken as a man who ' I knew what he was talking about . " I shall never forget standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came tramping down the street : young , strong , fresh , as our men had ? been in 1914 , but as in 1917 they were no. longer . I shall never forget seeing the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes flying together on the most official of official flagstaffs , that flagstaff of the Houses of Parliament . That was a moment never to be forgotten . coming as it did after a long period of anxiety , after a long period during which we had seen our closest friend go to the front by thousands , never to return again . America , alblIng into the war when sne did , played a great part in ending the war . Wnrns of Foolish Words . " The man or woman who says otherwise is one of three  --  either crassly ignorant , villainously malicious or just a fool . " Believe me , people stimulated by all sorts of influences will go on saing things like , that , doubt not , for many years to come . Sometimes a foolish remark will be made by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , will be made by an American . I have heard some foolish remarks on this very same subject made by Americans , written by Americans , published by Americans , and I doubt not that sometimes foolish remarks will fall from the lips of a Belgian , Frenchman or Italian . " You have got to realize that there is an atmosphere , a body of suggestion at the present moment which is apt to catch a mind that is not strongly balanced and founded on concrete things . Such a mind : nay be led to believe things which are not , and that body of suspicion will be , in fact surely is , created through deliberate malice , created with a desire to separate those who fought together , who struggled together and who. worked together for a common victory . Be on your guard . And what is the guard ? Co-operation . Contact . Just so much co-operation , just so much contact as we can obtain . And so , your Honor ( addressing the Mayor ) and Mr. Commissioner ( addressing Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called at this time because you have brought together in close personal contact in this great metropolitan city those who are working together for a ' common end . " Before dealing specifically with the Sheridan episode , the Ambassador had led up to the subject in more general tuns , saying : Pleads for Allied Amity . " This night it is a peculiar and special I pleasure to me to nave that telegram ( an official telegram from the British Secretary of State to the conference ) to read , because it refers to a period when our two nations were co-operating closely , straining every nerve to achieve a common victory , straining every nerve as the other allied and associated powers were straining every nerve to achieve a common victory . " I believe , and I speak from a depth of strong conviction that never was it eo important as it is today that your nation and my nation , that the great nations of France and Italy and all the nations that were associated in the war should stand together , shoulder to shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do stand together , the difficulties which face the world at the present time . " Believe me , the world situation is not without difficulty . Believe me , too , there are people who seek , for their own ends , to raise feelings of doubt , feelings of suspicion , feelings of dislike , in the minds of one or other of these nations wit regard to one or all of the others . " Make no mistake , people exist who would like to see suspicion , hatred , malice separating your nation and mine , and mine.and France , and France . and , yours . There are those who seek to fish in troubled waters , and they think that by developing suspicions the ' waters will be more easily troubled . ? Believe me , the heart and the mind fon the British peoples  --  whether they inhabit the antipodean ' dominions , Australia and New Zealand , or the great Dominion , your immediate neighbor to ? the north , or South Africa , or whether they live in India or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they happen to be . the people of the British Isles  --  believe me , there is none but a hopeless and despicable minority that fails to realize what your country and what other countries with which we were associated in the war did toward the winning of the war . Recalls War Days . " During the years from 1918 to 1917 and 1918 , I happened to have the honor and the privilege of holding the responsible post of Director-General of National Service , and was responsible for 5,000,000 of men to replace the casualties of the British armies . We also kept a4 a guide to ourselves records of the strength , the numbers of men available in France and in Italy and in the other countries that were actively engaged in the war , and when you came in we kept records of your resources also . " No man could have known more directly , more at first hand , than I what the cost of fighting in the years 1914. 1915 and 1918 and through 1917 to the beginning of 1918 ? no man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terrible toll of life that our people have suffered . " It is no secret that in that last year , 1018 , that we had completed the raising out of our population of all available men , that we were at the end of our military resources . We had reached the end of the men between eighteen years and fifty years who were physically sit , and we had left nothing but the men between ' fifty and fifty : five and the boys of eighteen or who were becoming eighteen . ' Here the Ambassador proceeded with his reference to the repudiated Clare Sheridan interview . with . Kipling . " Remember , " said the Ambassador in conclusion , speaking . of the British all over the world , " that those peoples seek , long for and pray for co-operation with you and with their late Allies . " They pray that the day may not be far removed when it will be possible , reasonably and rightly possible , to cooperate with those who were enemies . We look forward as a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation , as a commonwealth of nations , ? toward co-operation , toward understanding among the peoples of the earth . We are not trying to assess what we did , what you did , what France did and what Italy did for victory . We only know that collectively , each doing the best , we shared commonly in the victory and we want , to go forward , co-operating with all our friends , feeling envious of none , fearing none . We want to go forward as friends among friends to the better future for which countless men , yes and women and children , gave their lives , and we seek to be true to the trust which they left with us . " John W. Davis , formerly Ambassador to Great Britain , who followed Sir Auckland Geddes as a speaker , also referred to the Kipling incident . " I am glad to hear that the great poet has denied the words which were attributed to him , " he . said . " Even it he had made such a statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority of the British people , and , as I know him , he would not be responding to what I know are the diotates of his heart and mind .
