COMMONWEALTH <P> ( British Commonwealth of Nations ) <P> The Lords- <P> Gathered excitedly in unusual numbers and commenced august debate when the Conservative Government of Premier Stanley Baldwin suddenly put forward its long mooted and highly reactionary proposal to " reform " the House of Lords . <P> The Lord Chancellor , Rt . Hon. George , Viscount Cave , broached the Government 's program in carefully generalized terms . He called for three major " reforms " : <P> I. The number of members in the House of Lords to be reduced from the present 740 peers to 350. * <P> II . The House of Commons to have no power to pass any act altering the Constitution or the powers of the House of Lords . <P> III . The House of Lords to resume a portion of its onetime competence over " money bills . " + <P> Alan Ian Percy , Eighth Duke of Northumberland , Earl Percy , stoutly voiced the attitude of the landed peerage , saying : " The House of Lords is the last line of defense against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly to leave the Constitution of the House of Lords indefensible as it now is . " <P> Richard Burden Haldane , First Viscount Haldane ( " Labor Peer " ) , took exactly the opposite stand , saying ominously : " If you try to strengthen the House of Lords , we part from you . We will fight you as long as we are here . " <P> Charles Richard John Spencer-Churchill , Ninth Duke of Marlborough , Prince of the Holy Roman Empire , Prince of Mindelheim in Suabia , 55 , twice a baron , twice an earl , divorced husband of onetime Consuelo Vanderbilt , owner of estates totaling 19,685 acres , exhibited last week toward the proposed reforms an attitude of flippancy . <P> " Any scheme to reform the House , " said he , " must fail to arouse public interest , while so many of its members pass the time on their estates upholding the traditions of British sportsmanship . " <P> Reprovingly replied Earl Selborne , a director of Lloyd 's Bank : " By far the most potent reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is they can no longer afford to come to London very often . They gave all they had to the country during the War and they are now suffering the burden of taxation . " <P> Debate on the " reform " proposals was very largely attended last week , became the leading political topic , roused Labor orators throughout Britain to violent protest . There seemed little chance , however , that the projected Reform Act can be drawn up , much less presented to Parliament , before next year . <P> The Commons- <P> Passed by a majority of 215 the Conservative Government 's highly reactionary Trade Unions Bill ( TIME , May 30 ) , drafted to prevent the recurrence of the British General Strike ( TIME , May 10 to Nov. 29 , 1926 , et seq . ) . <P> Attorney General Sir Douglas McGarel Hogg , sponsor of the Trade Unions Bill , was called during the final debate , " You blackguard ! You liar ! " by Laborite James Maxton , whom the Speaker forthwith suspended . <P> During debate the Laborite Opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had the floor , cried : <P> " I do n't wish to cast my pearls before significant pause-those who do n't want them .
