" They will often ' hold the Government in their hand . That will be the best preparation for the assumption of power by the Labor Party at the election after thc next one . " It may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into pov. - ? r at the next election , but the party is not yet prepared to cope with the proble:n6 of credit , paper money and other financial questions .

He declared that " the emotion of nationalism " has been exploited in blocking th , e movement toward a more social economic system . He made a plea for open and tolerant-discussion of fundamental principles and issues .
