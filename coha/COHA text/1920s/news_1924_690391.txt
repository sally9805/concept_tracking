txt BtOad , ' 8:treet G ? ssip - The Care , Portc-m Back in 1901 when the United States Corp . started business the views of the board did not always harmonize . Gary was for publicity-in all things , but the Rockefeller interests at that time believed in giving the shareholders and the public so much and no more . Since then Standard Oil-interests have made radical changes in their publicity policy and certain of the companies are as liberal in giving information to the public as U. S. SteeL At one time the Rockefeller companies , so called , were a closed book to sae putuic . Years ago there were several members of the Standard Oil board who advocated a broader scope of publicity , but they were in the minority . One was E. T. Bedford , president of the Corn Products Refining Co . Long before the Standard Oil company broke its years of silence , E. T. Bedford did not hesitate to enlighten the . public on matters that came under the head of his department . Another was S- C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. of New Jersey . Dodd was one of the greatest corporation lawyers in his time . In his prime he won case after case for Standard Oil . Dodd had no ambitions for great wealth and died poor , compared with many other Standard Oil interests who got in on the ground floor . AMERICAN SMELTING American Smelting &; Refining is well supplied with cash . In fact , it has more cash than actually required in its business . Thelast annual report showed cash holdings , investments and call loans of $22,600,000 . Of that amount , all but $3,050,000 was in investment securities and call loans . Cash and investments were equivalent to nearly 38% to total common stock of $60,000,000 . A. COMEDY IN POLITICS Bryan ? " We wish to free the country from the dominating influences of Wall Street . " New York Times , ' Saturday , July 5 ? " Bernard Baruch and Thomas L. Chadbourne , two of the most influential of Mr. 's supporters , visited Governor Smith in the Manhattan Club , in what was said to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIM - vacations- eiriConireasn-icia will begin March-If " Lb. &; do n't nominate someone soon the convention news will loon be relegated to tlim inside pages of the newspapers . If is a piogiessive , as Bryan states , 1. hen he moat be in reverse . Japan is becoming more Americanized every day . The elections held in May are understood to have cost close to $20,000,000 . People who heard all of the big noise at Madison Square Garden will now find riding on the subway a little more pleasant . ? The rail stocks were strong , particularly Baltimore &; Ohio . Four rails made new highs for all time . General Electric reached a new high of 141% . Power stocks were again strong . There was little doing in the oil , steel and copper shares . Floor traders are still bullish and look for higher prices today . MILLION SHAME DAYS In the first six months of this year there were 28 million-share days on the Exchange , compared with a total of 60 in the full year 1923 . There is every indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1923 . One has to go back to 1922 to . find a 2 , - CT0,000 ' share day . In 1920 there was one ; in 1919 , two ; 1927 , one ; 1907 , three ; 1906 , two , and 1901 , eleven . Since 1897 there was only one year in which daily transactions exceeded 3,000,000 shares , this was in 1901 when there were two . Commenting on transactions of recent years , a broker who has been in Wall Street for more than thirty years , made a wager that before the end of the current year there would be recorded more than three 2,000,000-share days . But he declined to wager there would be any 3,000,000-share days this year . RIGHT ON THF. soli A tobacco company that does millions of dollars of business annually does n't leave even a pebble unturned in promoting its business . It is after business day and night and is anxious to convince the shareholders that they are the company and that officers and employes are working for them on salary . Here is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco company in question to the shareholders : " We respectfully urge our stockholders to familiarize themselves with the products of their company , and to give preference to them when buying tobacco products . " One person 's purchases of cigarettes or tobacco may seem insignificant to you , but our business is built on the purchases of individuals as a unit ; and the total purchases of our stockholders would represent a highly desirable addition to our sales volume , while the effect of your example on friends or employes would again operate to widen our field of customers . " Beyond mere volume , however , it would be a source of personal satisfaction to your executive officers , and in fact to our whole organization , to know that our stockholders approve and share our enthusiasm . We know that these products can not be excelled either in quality of leaf tobaccos , in the skill of their blending , or quality of workmanship ; and there is adequate variety in our list of brands to satisfy each individual difference of taste . " ? riti. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel says : " La Follette says the trusts are our masters . I am a holder of U. S. Steel common and preferred . This great trust , the greatest of them all ; has 180,000 shareholders , among them 75,000 employes of the corporation . I am perfectly willing to continue as a part of this trust for I am sure if La Follette had anything to say in the management of U. S. Steel we would all go bust . " TIT VI ' TREASURY SO ROLES That Treasury surplus of $500,000,000 which continues to grow like a well nourished baby , is going to bother the reactionaries up to the November election . Coolidge and Mellon , with the assistance of Dawes , are doing business in black ink . They have little use for any kind of a red mixture . N'EURN AT I ON Ai. count-wriest International Combustion has failed to advance in the face of record breaking earnings , thereby giving support to the claim that its business was not susceptible to general depression . April made a new high in earnings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . Two or three weeks ago a large block of stock was taken over by a syndicate around 2:31 , S. and rumors were current that the sale of the last hundred shares would mark the beginning of an upward movement , but the stock has done nothing marketwise . RIG AND I. ETTI , E1 olEq From a current market letter : " We realize that big men with big resources are making this market . We also realize that big men can make big mistakes , at times . We do not think it will pay to hold most speculative industrial stocks up much longer . The Political factor will bear watching . It is , in our opinion , not dominant . " It 's funny how these big men who can make big mistakes can get big positions ! Their mistakes are n't in it with the big mistakes that little men in little positions make or with possibilities of big mistakes by little men in big positions . And if the political factor is not dominant , why watch it so carefully ? HOARD ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed
