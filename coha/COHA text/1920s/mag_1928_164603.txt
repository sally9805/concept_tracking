There is a saying in New York State that Governor Smith was four times elected by the stupidity of his opponents . Loudest of his opponents was Theodore Roosevelt the younger . Last week , notwithstanding Chairman Work 's announcement that the Hoover campaign would not indulge in personal attacks , Theodore Roosevelt the younger spoke at Rochester , N.Y. , a speech he had learned by heart during previous anti-Smith campaigns . He elaborately explained that no man would question Governor Smith 's personal integrity . Then he juxtaposed the Smith name with a sewer scandal , a gambling pool , a milk scandal , and with the oldtime sins of Tammany Hall .
