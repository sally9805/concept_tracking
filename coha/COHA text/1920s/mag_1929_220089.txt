Katerina . This latest addition to the programs of Eva Le Gallienne 's Civic Repertory Theatre is further justification for the rediscovery of Alia Nazimova . It is more . Leonid Andreyev 's play has been left behind by changing social codes but it retains a turbulent glow which shines through its drenching melancholy . <P> The playwright 's Katerina is a wife unjustly suspected at the start . Her husband attempts to kill her because of his belief that she is unfaithful . The shots stir in her a spirit of rebellion which sends her out , in spite of a reconciliation , to defy him . In the playwright 's mind she sinks lower and lower . That , however , is against a background of Victorian moral standards . What would happen to Katerina in real life in 1929 would make an entirely different play . Andreyev deals with the Russia of before the War . That Russia is gone , so much of his play vanishes , too , <P> Nazimova , except for moments when she is too much the actress , gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the play 's tensity with the real genius of a tragedienne and she sinks into its swamps of woe with equal effectiveness . There are also excellent characterizations by Leona Roberts , as a mother , and Walter Beck , as the husband . <P> The return of Nazimova to her rightful position among the great of the speaking stage is another achievement of the amazing Miss Le Gallienne . Nazimova was born in the Crimea in 1879 . Her cultured parents sent her to Moscow to study music , eventually to take up drama as a pupil of Stanislavsky . She excelled almost immediately . She reached New York in 1905 with a Russian company that played East Side theatres and eventually stranded . <P> Nazimova mastered English and a year later appeared in an Ibsen repertory that immediately won her a place among the stars . She played opposite Walter Hampden in his U. S. debut ( The Comtesse Coquette ) in 1907 . Followed several years of triumph in the U. S. and on the Continent . Then cinema claimed her , then vaudeville . Miss Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cherry Orchard and she bloomed again , unfaded at 49 . <P> Meet the Prince . A. A. Milne has n't been quite the same since he took to hanging out at Pooh Corner . There was a time when he used acids that ate their way through the softness of his whimsy . Now he has gone completely dolce far niente . It may be Pooh Corner , but it is not life . <P> In the latest of his plays to reach Broadway he starts with an excellent idea . He evidently is bent on making fun of the snobbish folk who bow to royalty . So he spins the plausible tale of a restless adventurer who , for want of a better occupation , created himself a prince of a non-existent buffer state . The kowtowing proceeds until he meets his deserted wife who brings him back to earth . All is well while Mr. Milne is making fun of snobbery , but when he dips into romance he starts unwittingly to make fun of himself .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
