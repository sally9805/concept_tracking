Some two months ago M. Christian G. Rakovsky , then Soviet Ambassador to Great Britain , and M. Leonid Krassin , who occupied the same office in France , ware exchanged between these two posts by order of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union . <P> M. Krassin left France without ever having received the custom-sanctioned honor of hearing the national anthem of his country played when he visited President Doumergue . For 50 days M. Rakovsky has been vowing that he would never call on M. le Prsident at all unless assured that the " Internationale " would blare from the Elyse at his approach . <P> Last week the diplomatic pressure from both sides eased off into a prolonged flourish of bugles , which may or may not have contained a note or two from the bourgeois-terrifying " Internationale . " M. Rakovsky accepted the deafening blast ordered by M. Doumergue at its full tonal value . Smiling , he nodded to the buglers as he entered the palace of the President to present his credentials .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
