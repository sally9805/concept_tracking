Although the return 's of the Irish Free State election ( TIME , June 20 ) have left President William T. Cosgrave still at the head of the largest single party in the Bail , he threatened last week to refuse to carry on as President ( Premier ) . <P> Mr. Cosgrave 's purpose was to force the split factions of famed Eamonn de Valera and Miss Mary MacSwiney to join forces and enter the Dail . This they have refused to do , alleging their unwillingness to take the oath of fealty to George V , required of every deputy before he can legally take his seat . At present Mr. De Valera stands at the head of 44 Fianna Fail or " Republican " deputies ; and Miss MacSwiney is one of six deputies comprising the much blighted and withered Sinn Fein party to which De Valera formerly belonged . Thus , these 50 deputies if they should stand together , would outnumber the 46 supporters of Mr. Cosgrave in a Dail completed by 56 other deputies of comparatively " neutral " stand . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responsibility for carrying on the Government falls upon the majority in the Dail . It is not my duty nor within my power to provide them with a means of escape from that responsibility . " <P> This was a flat challenge to Mr. De Valera and Miss MacSwiney . Would they accept , enter the Dail , stand together ? Soon famed Eamon de Valera replied : <P> " I want it known , finally that under no circumstances whatever will Fianna Fail deputies take the oath . " <P> Observers awaited eagerly the assembly of the new Dail . There was always the chance that Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail deputies would try to enter without taking the oath-a move often threatened never attempted , and sure to lead to many a cracked Irish crown . Sober-minded Irishmen hoped that Mr. Cosgrave would consent to carry on , as before , with the readily obtainable support of the " neutral " parties .
