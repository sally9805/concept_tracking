The modern automobile is a cranky , fussy thing . Like cranky , fussy old men , it makes a great to-do over its middle parts . While the motor functions regularly and the wheels go round obediently , the gears between them demand constant nursing . Before the car can run smoothly , these gears must be coaxed from first speed to second , then to third , and in some makes , even into a fourth forward speed . Before they will yield to coaxing , the clutch must be pushed down and let up , the foot accelerator released and pressed down again and the shift lever wiggled about delicately . In addition to causing heavy wear on the parts , all this diddling is a great nuisance to the driver , who in a Utopian state of locomotion would be concerned with only two things : 1 ) to make the car go at desired speed , 2 ) to make the car stop when necessary . What the world needs , in short , is an easygoing , shiftless automobile . <P> Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew this . Since then , he has been tampering , tinkering , planning , pondering and putting together bits of metal which in final form turn out to be a sensible automotive vehicle with no middle parts to fuss over at all . The motor transmits propulsive force directly to the rear end without intercession of transmission gears . <P> Lubricants are reduced . Jerks &; shocks incidental to clumsy shifting are eliminated . Lazy drivers , who neglect to shift into slower ( and consequently more powerful ) speeds while running up hills , are rendered harmless . <P> Such a car , tested , proved that it could ascend a 20% grade , accelerating briskly , stop in the middle of the grade , then proceed again without necessity of manual gear shifting .
