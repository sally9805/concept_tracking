While a wind from the Lake blew little spirals of grey dust across the clay courts of the Chicago Town and Tennis Club William Tatem Tilden II served balls that traveled like gunshots toward a little figure hunched far back of the opposite baseline . The crashing serves generally came back gently , accurately ; the little figure , Tamio Abe , champion of Japan , moved quickly from side to side , rarely forward-he knew he could n't take the net against Tilden 's drives , that the best he could do would be to take advantage of errors . Twice Tilden made double-faults and Abe broke through his service but after the first set Tilden 's long arms flailed faster and he ran the match out , 6-2 , 6-3 , 6-0 . Another Japanese , Yoshiro Ohta , small as a bellboy but accurate as a sewing-machine , carried Hennessy to a deuce set before he went down , 8-6 , 6-3 , 6-3 . Next day Tilden and Lott ended the Davis Cup series in the west by beating Abe and Toba . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-finals of the international hardcourt championship . She beat a nervous Dutch girl by the name of Rollin Couquerque who weighed nearly 200 pounds and made twelve double-faults . With Francis T. Hunter for partner Miss Wills played an exhibition match in Paris against Eileen Bennet ( England ) and Henri Cochet . All four played at top speed , laughed when they missed , congratulated each other , made jokes , and agreed with the umpire . Bennet and Cochet won . <P> Later , Cochet , in the more serious Auteuil finals , played against Rene Lacoste . As usual , he lost the first match , and as has been as usual recently , won the match . Cochet is champion of France and England , Lacoste of the U. S. <P> Miss Wills played Miss Bennet in the Auteuil finals , and won easily . Miss Wills is champion of the U. S. , England and France .
