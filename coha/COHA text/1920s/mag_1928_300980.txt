The sixth birthday of the Fascist Rgime in Italy has just been celebrated ( TIME , , Nov. 5 ) . Czechoslovakia was ten years old last week , and the Turkish Republic was five . Today there are eleven red candles on the cake of Soviet Russia . Therefore last week birthdays loomed as potent news : <P> Five-Year-Old . On the fifth birthday of the Turkish Republic , last week , every State and Municipal official was examined to see whether he knew his ABC 's . Scared and trembling like so many toddling five-year-olds , more than 1,000 potent functionaries submitted willy nilly to the test . Those who flunked out would be demoted or dismissed . Such were the orders of the President of Turkey , stern and ruthless Mustafa Kemal Pasha , called Ghazi , ' ' The Victorious .

But of course every Czech and Slovak knows that the Father of Czechoslovakia is Professor Thomas Garrigue Masaryk , first and still President of the Republic . <P> Professor Masaryk 's egotism is as titanic as his achievements . Single-handed he built up the marvelous organization of propagandists , spies and deserters who finally erected themselves into the nucleus of a state . True , Professor Masaryk was indispensably assisted by Dr. Edouard Benes , now Foreign Minister , but none the less Professor Masaryk is the Father of Czechoslovakia . His propagandists are become statesmen , his spies heroes , his deserters officers in the Army of the Republic .
