Said the Butte ( Mont . ) Miner , editorially , last week : <P> " The history of journalism in Montana would read like the history of ... the most ancient of professions . Its history of late years is a most sordid and ugly record of daily newspapers owned and controlled by The Big Company and prostituted to its dirty work of controlling public opinion . These are the scarlet creatures of Montana journalism . The circulation and advertising of the Butte Miner have increased surprisingly since it announced its independence and appealed to the people to make a stand against further inroads on their rights by- <P> - The Anaconda Company . " <P> Said the New York Times , in its news columns , last week : <P> " A contest that rocked the copper mining area of Montana a generation ago came to a formal close yesterday with the sale of the mineral , timber and banking properties of the late Senator W. A. Clark to the Anaconda Copper Mining Co . . . . The Butte Miner , a newspaper owned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also was sold . . . . " <P> Amazed by the violence of the Butte Miner 's invective , and also amazed by the assumption of the Times that the contest was " closed , " U. S. coppermen reviewed 50 years of fierce warfare over the mines at Butte , Montana , greatest of the world 's copper camps . <P> Copper Camp . California roared in the ' 40s , but Montana did its roaring while the East was enjoying the elegant ' 80s . In 1870 , only 241 men and women were staking their fortunes on the 6-foot pit in the earth which two prospectors had discovered six years earlier . They were tapping surface veins of gold and silver . They did not suspect that the real wealth of Montana 's barren hills lay deeper in the earth . <P> But two years later , a little man , almost buried in a great shock of hair and beard , came up from Colorado and began to deepen the Butte pits . William A. Clark learned his trade in a quartz mine and lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dug for copper . Gold miners , seeing his wagons start out on their 400-mile trek to the nearest railroad at Corinne , Utah , laughed aloud . " There go Clark 's rocks , " they jeered . And they were 98.37% right . Only 1.63% of the gray copper ore can be reduced to valuable metal . But it was enough to build the little man a $100,000,000 fortune . <P> Miner Clark was the first to discover the Butte copper veins . The first to develop them on a large scale was blatant , uncouth Marcus Daly . In 1879 , a reduction plant was erected near Butte , saving the 400-mile overland haul . The next year , Irishman Daly began to make Butte roar . His men probed the earth night and day . Smoke poured out from 100 furnaces . Lumberjacks hacked down whole forests for timber to hold up excavations and tunnels . <P> Butte became certainly the ugliest town in the world , surrounded by mountains of gray-green refuse and black slag . Within the mines , men faced the imminent dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became ignited there was no hazarding when the fire might end . The St. Lawrence mine at Butte caught fire in 1899 . Last week , it was still burning . And when miners were not meeting underground dangers , they kept one hand on their guns . Strangers in Butte spoke softly . Painted women learned it was safer to laugh than to talk . <P> Deeper and deeper went the shafts.
