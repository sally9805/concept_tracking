What child is not , at one time or another , regarded as a prodigy ? Let any baby spend an hour taking a twelve-jeweled watch apart , and no parent can fail to perceive in him the seed of potential engineering genius ; let him draw in pencil on the nursery wall and his mother-unless she be crass indeed-will recognize that his painting may some day amaze the world . Thus every U. S. home has its potential Mozart . But a year ago , to a startled public , was revealed the most extraordinary prodigy of them all-Nathalia Crane , 11-year-old poet , " The Baby Browning of Brooklyn , " whose first volume of verse , The Janitor 's Boy , was heralded by critics to be a work of genius . <P> Such words as " blastoderm " , " sindoc , " " peris , " " parasang , " " sarcenet , " " teazel , " " nullah , " " cantatrice , " " barracan , " " sistrum , " writhed and hissed in her verses . One poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others cantered with a Eugene Fieldian humor ; still others coldly glowed with the passion-weary detachment of a woman who has had her fill of life and its motley follies . Critic-Poet Louis Untermeyer chortled with elation . Poet William Rose Bent wrote a preface . The English Society of Authors and Playwrights ( of which Thomas Hardy is President ) asked Nathalia Crane to join them . <P> Now among those who did not lift their voices to welcome the prodigy was Edwin Markham , Honorary President of the Poetry Society of America . Poet Markham is old ; a snow white beard depends from his chin ; perhaps because his long experience has rendered him dubious of prodigies , he examined the little Crane girl 's poems with critical attention . Of The Janitor 's Boy he said nothing . But last week , when he read her second volume , Lava Lane , he hinted a courteous skepticism . Last week he said to a newspaper reporter : <P> " It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated viewpoint of sex . . . knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind . . . . " <P> How , then , did he think they had been written ? That was what reporters wanted to know . Poet Markham winked . He expressed his confidence in the facility of Louis Untermeyer , of William Rose Benet , of Edna St. Vincent Millay , of other poets who dine together from time to time , all sitting around a table in a Manhattan grill while the elbows of the knowing onlookers dig the ribs of the innocent ones and murmurs float above the clatter of the table d'hte : " There 's Oontermeyer ! " " There 's Bennett ! " One afternoon , after the coffee , suggested Poet Markham , a joke went round the company ; pencils flashed from waistcoat pockets , and the Child Genius , Nathalia Crane , was born upon the back of a menu-card . <P> To Brooklyn rushed reporters . They interviewed the prodigy-a spindling girl of twelve , physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shrill treble voice . Her father explained how inspiration comes to her :
