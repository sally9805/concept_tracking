Galena , 111. , is subject to floods and very wet weather . So Secretary Mellon thought the Treasury was justified in furnishing rubber boots , coats and hats to Postoffice and Custom House employes stationed there . Then Secretary Mellon wrote a memorandum to Comptroller General McCarl , watchdog of the Treasury , saying that the Galena officials received small salaries and he deemed it only fair to classify rubber boots , etc. , as " necessary equipment , " not as " wearing apparel " ( which must be paid for by the men themselves ) . <P> Mr. McCarl shook his head , overruled Mr. Mellon.
