N. J v. N. Y. <P> Which state has prior right to water that rises in one , flows through the other ? Can one state prevent another state from depositing its refuse in the sea ? To settle these questions . New Jersey last week filed two suits in the Supreme Court . <P> First Suit . Five tributaries of the Delaware River , which flows through New Jersey , rise in New York . New York , declares New Jersey , is now planning to construct dams and reservoirs to turn much of the water from those five tributaries to its own use . New Jersey would prevent New York from so doing . <P> Second Suit . New York City deposits its rubbish , its refuse , its garbage in the Atlantic Ocean , most of which eventually reaches New Jersey 's shoals , white-sand beaches . New Jersey would prevent New York from so littering its bathing grounds .
