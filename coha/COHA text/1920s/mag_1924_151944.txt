At Columbia , quiet sun-filled capital of South Carolina , a Negro preacher died last week . During the half hour before his funeral , no business was transacted in the city . White and black paid tribute , by proclamation of the Mayor . <P> Rev. Charles Jaggers , born a slave in the first half of the 19th Century , began preaching from fence corners , always on one text : " Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus " ( Philippians 2:5 ) . With some contributions , he established a mission ; with others he took the gospel to the chain gangs . At the end of each year he took one cent salary . He was wont to say : " My services belong to God . "
