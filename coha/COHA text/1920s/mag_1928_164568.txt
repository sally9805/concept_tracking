The Strange Case of Captain Ramper . The world had decided that Captain Ramper was dead . No word had been heard from him since he left Germany to fly through the Arctic circle . But he was alive and insane in the frozen wilderness ; his plane had been forced down and his mechanic had committed suicide after three years of hardships . Twelve more years passed ; Captain Ramper 's hair grew long , covered his body ; he lost the power of articulate speech . Then some fishermen discovered him . They thought that he was a strange breed of polar ape . He was clapped into a cage , taken back to Germany , sold to a dime museum . A Professor Barbazin suspects that there is a human spark beneath the coat of fur , so he buys Captain Ramper . Speech and sanity are restored by shrewd operations ; fur is shaved off electrically ; and Captain Ramper becomes a man again , a popular hero . But the hurly-burly life of urban man disturbs him so much that he denounces civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by First National Pictures with a German cast . Paul Wegener as Captain Ramper is proficient , though his racoon-skin costume has a collegiate twist . Original , entertaining . <P> Fazil . Charles Farrell is a capable cinemactor , particularly in the role of an earnest young man . But here he is greased up like the late Rudolph Valentino and made to register Arabian passion under the erogenous name of Prince Fazil . The also warm Greta Nissen , as a Parisian blonde called Fabienne , spends many film feet in his arms and on his lips-be the place Paris or Venice or the desert sands . They get married , quarrel , make up , etc . And finally , DEATH-Prince Fazil , mortally wounded by bandits , takes off his poison ring and lovingly punctures the white finger of Fabienne . <P> The Drag Net . A city gang leader is on trial for murder . A stoolpigeon takes the stand to testify against him . In a hotel room opposite the courtroom , a man is toying with a golf club ; good-naturedly , he steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stoolpigeon . That is the beginning of a lusty underworld melodrama written by Oliver H. P. Garrett , onetime reporter for the New York World , produced by Paramount , acted by George Bancroft , Evelyn Brent , William Powell . <P> The Street of Sin . Basher Bill seizes an egg , bashes it against his own forehead , rips off the shell , swallows the nutritious portion whole . He grabs another , and another , - until he has consumed twelve ( 12 ) eggs . The eggs are hardboiled ; so is Basher Bill as played by Emil ( " Slow Motion " ) Jannings . Paramount 's publicity man swears that Mr. Jannings actually ate those twelve eggs . Well , good for him ; for there is little else to egg one on in The Street of Sin . Basher Bill lives in the slums of London with a blonde harlot who loves him . His occasional business is thuggery &; robbery . But , one day , his eyes light on a Salvation Army lass ( Fay Wray ) and he soon gives up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police raid ; and Basher Bill is shot while trying to protect the babies . As he dies , the Army lass sheds tears of joy because the blonde harlot renounces sin in favor of the Army . Mr. Jannings , ponderous though he is , is capable of better cinema .
