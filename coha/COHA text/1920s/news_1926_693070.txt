txt With the work of drafting a tentativ Democratic State platform already in progress , some light * ? as gained yesterday regarding the probable trend of the pronouncement on prombi n . Contrary to the belief in some quarters , the Democratic prohibition plank is likely to be rather mild . Some Democrats have urged that , to preserve the solidarity of the wet vote and get it for the Democratic candidates , it would be necessary for the part- , in view of the stand taken by Senator James W. Wadsworth Jr. , who is seeking re-election , to come out flatly in the platform for repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment , although that measure came before Congress originally under Democratic auspices . There is not the slightest probability , however , that anything so drastic will be written into the Democratic State platform this year , and it is even doubtful that the customary advocacy of Volstead law amendments to legalize traffic in light wines and beer under restrictions will be found iii At . Anything calculated to turn dry Democratic sentiment in other States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided . To " Abide by Referendum . " According to information that beta= available yesterday , the Democrats will virtually content themselves with repeating the Republican slogan , " Abide by the referendum , " most recently sounded by Senator Wadsworth in turning aside the proposal for an enforcement- plank fr. the Republican State platform . The Democratic plank , there is reason to believe , will point to the referendum as In line with the policy of the Democratic Party rather than the Republican opposition ; it will congratulate Governor Smith upon having given his approval to the Karle-Phelps bill drafted by Elihu Root , thus preparing the way for the first public expression on the Volstead lavi/ in this State . The plan is to urge the voters generally to avail themselves of this opportunity , but will not , it was learned , seek to influence them in any way to vote in the affirmative on the question carried in the referendum . Popular Vote on Amendments . The Democratic platform will go a step further , it was said , and pledge the party , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the enactnient of a measure under which a popular vote would be required before a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution can be taken u for ratification by the State Legisla re . This ast proposal is in strict accord with Governor Smith 's . program . For some years the Governor in his annual message has urged upon the lawmaking body such a measure . The fact that one has not been passed will be attributed in the platform to Republican opposition . In connection with this it watt ) recalled that in l919 , when the Eigh- ' teenth Amendment came before the Legislature for ratification , Governor Smith advised the Republican leaders , who coqtrolled both branches of the Legislature , to submit the proposal to ratify to the voters at the next general election . At that time there was not in the Republican Senate a sufficient number of votes for the ratification of the amendment and it was found necessary subsequently to make ratification the subject of a caucus , which was taken with the result that the twenty-sixth vote was cast by a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform and who as a consequence found it advisable not to become a candidate for re-election at the end of his term . Smith 4indorses Wagner . Governor Smith has given his approval to Robert F. Wagner , Justice of the Appellate Division , as a candidate for United States Senator against Senator Wadsworth . Up-State Democratic leaders without exception have expressed themselves In favor of his nomination , and Justice Wagner himself , while not seeking the honor , has given substantial assurance to Tammany Leader George W. Olvany that , if named , he will run . This information was gleaned in Democratic quarters , where Justice Wagner is regarded as the candidate best fitted to hold the party vote in this city and up-State , as well as against a Republican candidate as popular as Senator Wadsworth is with the wet Democrats , owing to the position he has taken in favor of repealing the Eighteenth Amendment and , pending such action , to modify the Volstead law to give the States a measure of " home rule " in their enforcement of the prohibition amendment . J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Corporation Counsel of the City of Troy , it was learned yesterday , will in all probability be proposed by the Democrats as their candidate for Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals , to succeed Judge Chester B. , who will reire under the age limit at the end of this year . The proposal will require sanction from the Republicans to render effective the plan for a nonpartisan Cciurt of Appeals ticket urged by the Bar Associations throughout the State . Strong demand has come from certain quarters for the nomination of a Catholic for one of the Court of Appeals vacancies , there now being no one professing that faith on the Court of Appeals bench . Mr. Norton is a Roman Catholic . In one respect he does not meet the requirement established by a special committee representing State bar associations which was appointed during the Summer to bring about inter-party agreement in favor of a noh-partisan ticket . This committee adopted a resolution calling for the nomination for . fudge place of a Justice now sitting in an Appellate Division . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , who would have met this requirement but who , it is understood , was dropped from consideration for other reasons . Another Troy Democrat , former Supreme Court Justice James V. Coffey , has been under consideration for the nomination . Mr. Coffey has served on the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial District by appointment from Governor Smith , who named him to fill a vacancy which arose through the retirement , more than a year ago , of Supreme Court Justice Wesley 0 . Howard of Troy . Mr. Coffey was a candidate for this place in the last election , but was defeated by a small majority by Pierce M. Russel of Troy , the Republican candidate , who at the time of his nomination was a County Judge in Rensselaer . He is only 42 and , according to a report , was thought too young for the nomination . Mr. Norton 's Record . Mr. Norton was a member of the Assembly in 1895 and 1896 . He was the Democratic nominee for Secretary of State in 1900 . He served the City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1911 he was appointed Deputy Attorney General under Thomas Carmody and served in that capacity until 1914 when he became legal adviser to Governor Glynn . He was the Democratic candidate for Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals in 1916 and in that election , though defeated , ran 180,000 votes ahead of his ticket . It was said yesterday that Mr. Norton had the endorsement of the Rensselaer County Democratic organization and of the Judges in the Third Judicial District . Former Deputy Attorney General Irving I. Goldsmith of Saratoga , it was learned , will be a contender for the Democratic nomination for Attorney General . He was endorsed by , Saratoga delegation to the Democatic State Convention at a meeting held on Aug. 28 . In 1922 Mr. Goldsmith was prominently mentioned for the nomination for Secretary of State . Quiet prevailed yesterday in the Republican camp . Further developments in the quest for a candidate for Governor and a decision with regard to the form the Republican prohibition plank is to await the arrival of Senator Wadsworth . Mr. Wadsworth is due here on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
