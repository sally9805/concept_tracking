COMMONWEALTH ( British Commonwealth of Nations ) <P> Great Britain entered the throes of the third general election in two years . <P> Sedition . Last August it was brought to the attention of St. Patrick Hastings , Attorney General , * that the Workers ' Weekly , Communist journal , had printed a seditious article ( TIME , Oct. 13 ) , the headlines of which ran : <P> SOLDIERS , SAILORS , AIRMEN ! WILL YOU KILL YOUR MATES ? REMEMBER-YOU ARE WORKERS ! THE BOSSES ARE YOUR ENEMIES . <P> DO N'T SHOOT SINKERS ! THEY ARE WORKERS LIKE YOU . THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR A DECENT LIVING FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR WOMEN AND KIDS . IF THE PROFITEERING CAPITALISTS , THROUGH THEIR AGENTS-YOUR OFFICERS - TELL YOU TO MURDER BRITISH WORKERS-DO N'T SHOOT . <P> Prosecution . Sir Patrick frowned beneath his wig . His strong features hardened as he came to a decision : The article was sedition and under a law passed during the reign of George III the editor must be prosecuted . <P> Discharge . J. Ross Campbell , American-born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at the Bow Street Police Court to answer to the charge of inciting His Majesty 's forces to mutiny . The Public Prosecutor , acting upon instructions from Attorney-General Sir Patrick , sent his representative to say that the article was after all only a criticism of a State for using armed force to quell industrial disputes . The Magistrate declared that there was no evidence to hold Campbell and accordingly discharged him . <P> Attack . There the matter might have ended but for an article in the Workers ' Weekly : <P> " The Political Bureau of the Communist Party desires to make it clear that no effort was made by Comrade Campbell to provide a defense . Arrangements had been made to ask for an adjournment in order that Mr. MacDonald , the Prime Minister , Mr. Henderson , Mr. Clynes and several others would be subpoenaed as witnesses for the defense . . . . We wish to state that the withdrawal of the charge was made on the sole responsibility of the Labor Government . . . . <P> " The Communist Party claims that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workers , but at the same time one that will arouse the vicious hostility of the reactionary elements within and without the Labor movement . " <P> This subtle attack was backed with blunt words . The Communist journal declared that the Labor Government " for the first time since taking office had been compelled to act as a Labor Government should , " that " it had definitely responded to the Labor movement as a whole . " <P> Politics . A cry went up from the Conservatives and Liberals . In the words of The Times of London , the Government 's withdrawal of the charges against Campbell was " an act of unwarrantable interference on the part of the executive with the course of justice . "
