WE have just read another prophecy of what the city will be in fifty years . The general impression is of vast white towers hi a golden haze . You push a button and summon health , wealth , and happiness . We have been hearing that sort of thing ever since telegraph poles were on Broadway . The fact is that in 1979 it will take half an hour to get through the theatre district at 110th Street . There will be puddles in the sidewalk , talk of tearing down the " L , " and another subway will he projected . About this time a helicopter taxi will sideswipe a triplane coal cart and everybody at Fifty-third Street and Eighth rr ? Avenue will get hit on the head with coal . In the rush hour on the East Side dirigible line , the crowd on the platform will push a man off and he will fall into the East River . Hotel clerks will be more uncivil than ever , the beaches as dirty , telephones will give wrong numbers , the streets will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what they are saying now , as they were fifty years ago , and the town wo n't seem what it used to be in the old days . Maybe the liquor will he better by that time , but the same kind of elevator boy is going to carry you a hundred stories past your floor and be just as haughty about it . Prophets always leave out the eternal mud . SOMETIMES we wish that the immigration laws required the maintenance of native costumes by our visitors . We are sure that for many months no lady who has passed under the noses of the library lions was so lovely is the one we saw the other day in orange Hindu garments feeding the pigeons on the terrace . IFyou think it over , the model restau- rant they have opened in the Museum of Natural History has fabulous possibilities . We used to look untroubled at the meteorites and the caveman carvings , in an erudite way , but now we cock our ear , half expecting a guard to march through the aisles shouting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what an oxtail soup a dinosaur would make . They could run the restaurant as those places are run where gourmets see their fish alive in a tank . At the museum they have to offer the tempting things of all space and all time  --  retelbirds , tastily displayed in their native habitat , whales such as were served in Chaucer 's time with a sauce made from violets . The varieties of twenty million years are there to tease an appetite for shellfish . A ptarmigan in polar snow , or that other bird from the equator ? A ? mastodon steak , such as the Siberians are said to relish today , after it has been fifteen thousand years in ice ? How about roast dodo , and for dessert the iridescent Portuguese man-of-war that looks like an elfin confection ? The birds and beasts are there , every kind that has ever been eaten and more besides  --  and the museum at the moment has many expeditions in the field . It is too much ; one falls back with relish on the braised lamb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Life Insurance Presidents , in whom we have such faith that we have n't even bothered to check the figures , announces that Americans are now insured for one hundred billion dollars , which is thirty-two times as much as other people in the world . This statement , as might he suspected , proves something . To the insurance 32 x presidents it proves that Americans are thirty-two times as prosperous , thirty-two times as virtuous and industrious as anybody else , and love their wives and children thirty-two times as much . Perhaps , however , it merely proves that Americans are thirty-two times as much bothered by telephone solicitations , personal visits , and selling arguments as other people , and are therefore thirty-two times as jumpy and apprehensive , and have only one thirty-second of anybody else 's sales resistance . Boy Wonder J an HARRIS , who , one way or an- other , HARRIS , has been a major phenomenon of Broadway the past few years , has retired from business  --  aged 30 , weight 120 . He closed his office some weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for England . His anSEIPTEMIDER 2 , I 9 2 nounced plan was to buy a house in London , lay in a library , and do several years of reading . If he got around to it he might write some hooks , having several in mind . He had long been an admirer of England , it was known . For one thing , as he pointed out , it produced great men in comparatively large numbers , whereas America did n't . The Harris retirement talk had been in the air for a year or snore , but nobody believed that a young man who in his twenties had built up a business rewarding him with wide public acclaim and several hundred thousand dollars a year could be serious in such chatter . Nevertheless he has gone . It 's hard to believe , and those who knew him are half expecting him to come tearing back across the ocean with several scripts in his hand and start hiring casts and renting theatres again . He is a noted mind-changer . He has been known to change plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back that there was a complication over the title of the house he had intended to buy in London and that he has decided to make Italy the background of his retirement . One change already . Harris was horn Horowitz in Newark , one of a large Jewish family . After his public schooling he went to Yale . There he was little in evidence , even in his classes . It turned out later that he spent most of his time reading ? omnivorously , fiercely , ravenously ? philosophy , history , biography , literature , and everything else . At the end of two years he decided he did n't like Yale . He decided moreover that , having got as much as he had of life academically , he would now get some actually . He became a hobo . He heat his way from New Haven to Denver , having many adventures en route . In Denver he ran into a citizen who aspired to get out a weekly publication devoted to news of the arts . Harris talked this gentleman into hiring him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new clothes , the ones he had being pretty tattered by that time successful in Denver but denly after four months , returning East by blind baggage . He rode on trains to Albany and a man gave him a ride to New York in an automobile . Then he went to Europe , stoking coal for his passage , hummed around , and returned . It was at this point that he went into the theatrical business . His first jobs were minor , and many . Poor or rich he was always scrappy and full of fireworks , and in those days , with four dollars in his pocket , he would walk out of a sixtyfive-dollar-a-week job because the place was n't run to suit him as quickly as , later , he would scratch the eyes out of a Shubert over a ten-thousand-dollar item in a booking contract . Finally he announced himself as a producer and , getting a few thousand dollars together , presented " Love ' Em and Leave ' Em . " This was only fairly successful , but he followed with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family , " and " The Front Page , " all sensations , and two or three others that were n't really bad . He was n't only the producer of these but had his finger deep in the casting , directing , and the writing too . At one time ( when Harris was twenty-eight ) , he had seven productions , counting road companies , running at once . His income exceeded $40,000 a week . Over his brief career only the old-established Theatre Guild bettered him in total number of productions . Nobody bettered him in profits . He had plans for a repertory company with Ina Claire , Holbrook Blinn , Ruth Gordon , and others . Blinn died . Shortly thereafter two shows in which he planned to present Miss Claire and Miss Gordon did n't come up to expectations in tryouts and he closed them out of town . Perhaps this caused him to lose interest in the theatre . At any rate he is out of it now . He always spoke of it as a temporary means of expressing his various talents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a boyish conclusion reached while at Yale . He said that , reflecting one evening upon what he would do when he got out of college , he realized that if he could n't make good at anything else he could produce plays . He had seen all the offerings in New Haven over a period of two years and knew he could put on better shows . At least he could do that . Penny Prothalamion FVEN young love has been affected by the mechanistic times . Stroll ing along the Palisades , where once the young man fired by his fancy and hands ' with a pocket-knife would carve his lady 's and his own initials on a tree trunk and entwine them within a heart ? strolling along the Palisades , a gentleman came upon an oak to which had been tacked a small aluminum disc , of the kind punched out for a penny at Coney Island and in railroad stations , bearing the inscription , " Julia G. and Bill Red Stronghold MR . WILLIAM J. BURNS and the vigilantes of eight or ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not up to date on the subject , that the Red Stronghold of the city is now the Proletcos Cooperative Cafeteria on the east side of Union Square . It is , as anyone connected with the place will readily tell you , the only successful communistic cafeteria in this country . It is dedicated to the proposition that workers must eat cheap and talk . At any hour of the day scores of workers may be found sitting inside eating and talking , or just talking . Twice as many more are outside on the sidewalk , knotted in endless arguments , so that passers-by on capitalistic errands have to detour into the street to get by . Ordinarily these debates are peaceful , but there have been times , as last spring during the fur strike , when mobs gather , cops charge about , and heads get broken . The restaurant has none of the back-cellar atmosphere generally associated with communism . That idea is old-fashioned now , and pretty outmoded . Proletcos ( an anonymous garment worker made up the word by combining " proletarian " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , brass railing , and paper napkins as a Thompson 's Lunch . The menu is about the same as that of any cafeteria , as are the prices , except that shareholders get a ten-per-cent reduction on anything they buy . Shareholders total six hundred , all workers . One of the great problems that keep popping up at their meetings is what to do with the profits . Being committed to the theory that money should not make money they can not pay themselves dividends . This makes it hard to get rid of surplus cash . Recently they enlarged the place , installed modernistic lighting fixtures and commissioned Hugo Gellert to do a magnificent fresco on the walls .

All the drawers of his desk were kept open so they could serve as racks for his law books . No clerk ever helped him with his briefs . He looked up everything himself and months afterward could name the pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trained by his mother , who made him , as a child , read chapters of books to her and then recite as much as he could recall . In college he was held a genius in memory tests . It was this that enabled him to finish law school in half the allotted time . He had a vast law library in his home and often worked in it all night . So devoutly did the noted lawyer revere the Constitution that he regarded anyone who broke an amendment , including the Eighteenth , as practically guilty of treason . A die-hard Republican , he would defend anyone of any party if it were on constitutional grounds . Thus he was one of the first to come to the defence of the Socialists ousted from the New York Assembly . He had no use for Socialists but he did for their constitutional rights . He defended the Civil Liberties Union . Often he took such cases without a fee , and once he said he would he willing to pay for the privilege . Marshall had a secret leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were published anonymously . He occasionally wrote humorous sketches in dialect and read them to friends . He read books in half a dozen languages . He liked few contemporary American authors except Dreiser . He considered " Sister Carrie " one of the great novels of all time . Walter Hampden was one of the few actors he found time to see in plays . He loved the Adirondacks and opposed all efforts to industrialize them by power companies and others . He was an authority on trees and wildflowers . Usually kindly , even jovial , his profanity was matchless when aroused . He sometimes even startled banquets and luncheons with purple phrases . Once he caused a furore at a dinner given to the Rumanian Minister of Finance , here to arrange a loan , by denouncing Rumania as a country which did n't deserve a loan until it became civilized . The loan was n't made . Although the jurist was for the Constitution always , there was one victory in his career which he half regretted , a decision he won which kept John Hylan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , it also kept Hylan in public life . Mr. Lorelei ABURLY trackman on the Sixth Avenue " L " provided a full five minutes of entertainment , from the time he produced a large ivory hand mirror from his hip pocket . He would putter around for a while , examining this and that connection and then thrust the mirror down beneath the ties and peer into it . Inspecting bolts , we realized . Straightening up from one of these examinations , he settled back against a cross-piece , gave himself up to long and earnest study of his own reflection in the glass . He turned his head from side to side , frowned , smiled , adjusted his tie , and critically examined the results of his shave . Then , as though he might have thought " Not so bad , " he wiped the glass on the seat of his overalls , and went back to his study of the bolt situation . Lost Art nECAUSE a snuffbox was found 1 -- 11 on the sidewalk after a shooting affray in Brooklyn , the police are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the affair . Au contraire . Our tobacconist , whose knowledge is extensive , says that snuff is still manufactured in this country , it being one of the very oldest of American industries , but that it is used now almost wholly by a comparatively few people in the South and Middle lArest , Norwegian seafaring men along South Street , a few foreigners , and New England salts ; and few of these sniff it . They place a pinch in the mouth between the cheek and gum and get the flavor that way . Some of the hardier ones , alas , chew it . As for THE NEW YORKER the ladies who " manipulated jewelled snuffboxes to shew their diamond rings , handsome hands , and snowy arms , " they now reach for a Lucky , or a sweet , or something . Many of the tobacco shops in the Avenue district carry snuff , and in three different flavors , but they do n't get a call for it once a month . The George W. Helme Company has a big snuff factory over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to 1760 via what is now Bronx Park . Up there still stands an old snuff mill , erected in that year , which passed from the Lordlards , its first owners , to the Helme company . The Helme company abandoned it years ago when it consolidated its several factories at Helmetta . The city has preserved it as a landmark . Feet of Clay THE Colonel Lindherghs landed in a plane the other day , about as might any other couple , except that a movie man was there with a camera  --  and a microphone concealed under his coat . He got a film of what happened and also , secretly , such noises and words as there were , and scurried off exultantly . He had been pretty excited and did n't realize until he had got to the studio and developed the sound part of the film , or whatever they do to it , that he had caught the nation 's hero reproving his wife for not having worn a petticoat . The management , realizing the enormity of their servant 's act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film and say nothing about it . WHEN Mrs. Lindbergh travels in her husband 's plane , there is little room for tea-gowns and frills . In Cleveland for the air races , she had to borrow an evening wrap from her hostess , Mrs. Parmely Herrick . She explained that she could t a k e along only one evening dress , and that an extra wrap was out of the question . Aerial transport has n't solved that problem up to now . At the home of the Charles Otises in Cleveland , Lindbergh 's hosts discovered a new way of entertaining him . One of the guests found some small pegs and , more humorously than otherwise , suggested a game of mumblety-peg . Lindbergh took to this idea at once . The part y therefore solemnly went out into the yard and played . Lindbergh was the best . Runners WE 'VE lately learned something we did n't know about Wall Street messenger boys . Not even their employers seem to know it . It 's this : the bright-eyed couriers have discovered that fleetness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by doing less running and more fraternizing with other messengers , they can get more errands run . It 's the old American principle of the merger or the combine . The messengers , meeting each other in the course of their journeys , trade errands according to localities . Instead of rushing five or six blocks with a million dollars ' worth of securities , a messenger will casually hand them to a runner who 's going in that direction , and take something from him in return . By skillful manipulation , boys sometimes hold down jobs with two or three financial houses , instead of just one . They 're not supposed to , but they do . Instead of earning fifteen dollars a week , they earn forty-five .
