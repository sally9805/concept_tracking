Charles Gates Dawes rushed into the vice presidency on March 4 , 1925 , with a crackling , headline-snatching lecture to the Senate on its antiquated rules of procedure . Calvin Coolidge grew red in the face as he listened to that outburst . <P> Last week in the same manner Gen. Dawes rushed out of the vice presidency with a farewell speech in which he swung his arms , shot his cuffs and shouted that he took back nothing he had said about the Senate rules . This time it was Charles Curtis and his little vice presidential speech that the Dawesian diatribe dwarfed . But where embarrassment was four years ago , there was only laughter this time . It was a self-burlesque , a Dawesian jape.
