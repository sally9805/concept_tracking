Intelligent is a device for planes to land on roofs , ships and similar small areas , described last week by R. James Gibbons , Brooklyn construction engineer and a member of the Guggenheim School of Aeronautics ' advisory board . <P> It consists of a platform 210 x 60 ft. which turns on a swivel base 40 ft. in diameter to keep the length parallel with the direction of the wind . This swiveling is essential because planes can properly land or take off only against the wind . The platform also tilts up or down . The departing plane can coast down it ; the arriving plane must roll up , constantly losing speed until it stops . Spring cables along the platform also retard the speed of the landing plane .
