Crane 's timely and interesting article on Lafayette 's visit to America in 1824 would bo more complete did it refer to the address made by Dr. Peter Van Pelt , when Lafayette landed on Staten Island and became Governor Tompkins 's guest at Fort Richmond . The dominie of the old Dutch Church , having been appointed by Governor Tompkins to make an address of welcome to the great hero , did so in graceful and dignified phrasing , to which Lafayette made happy and appreciative reply . The two venerable men then sat down . side by side , on a sofa in Governor Tompkins 's house and conversed amiably on the Revolutionary heroes , the happy fortune of the Republic and the misfortunes of France . A record of these addresses and of this conversation has been preserved . Several years ago the Daughters of the Revolution placed a memorial tablet on the wall of the old Dutch Church of Port Richmond to commemorate the public service and the unselfish ministry of Dr. Van Pelt .
