Viscount Shimpei Goto , onetime Mayor of Tokyo , arrived diffidently at Moscow . Cornered by correspondents , he protested : " I came here on no political , economic or indeed any specific mission . " Pumped by a U. S. correspondent , he said : <P> " I. have always opposed the hotheads who claim that the interests of Japan and America are conflicting . The loss of our silk trade with America alone would paralyze Japan . I maintain that the two great Pacific nations must be mutually friendly . The same applies to the Soviet Union , which is now retaking its place as a world power . "
