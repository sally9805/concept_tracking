The tremendous activity on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 10 , when the " bull market " in automobile shares collapsed violently , established a new high record for all time in the number of shares sold in a single day . <P> Three previous times in the history of the Stock Exchange there had been " 3,000,000-share days . " The first was the record " bull day " for all time on April 30 , 1901 ; the second , the " Northern Pacific corner " day on May 9 , 1901 ; and the third the " peace leak " day in December , 1916 . Of these the second held the record at 3,336,695 shares . Nov. 10 , 1925 , however , surpassed this 24-year record by seeing 3,448,747 shares sold in the Exchange open market . According to some financial scribes , this was the worst break in the market on record , but most old-timers in Wall Street considered it a slight matter beside the terrific activity of the Northern Pacific corner . <P> The stock market , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months and a reaction was obviously overdue . In such a situation , as has often been proved , the crash in prices can be and usually is attributed to almost any event whether it has any close bearing on the stock market or not . In this particular case it was raising of the rediscount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from 3% to 4%-a step occasioned by purely local conditions . Speculators in stocks , dealing in a market which had grown top-heavy of its own accord , evidently feared a similar rise in the rate of the New York Reserve Bank and threw overboard their motor shares in haste .
