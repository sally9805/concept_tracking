Down a sunny street in St. Augustine , Fla. , sped an automobile excitedly tooting and towing a fantastic bicycle . Fourteen-foot wings flapped great currents of air on either side of it . Flushed , intense , George White sat optimistically astride his invention . He pedalled furiously to force the wings to a rate of 100 flaps per minute , cast off from the car , rose gracefully in air . Like some prehistoric monster , the ornithopter , wings glistening in sunlight , described a gigantic parabola and came , back to earth . It had traveled eight-tenths of a mile in one minute and 36 seconds ( rate of 30 m.p.h . ) . <P> Inventor White , satisfied , took the machine back to his laboratory for further study . A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , army aviator and flying instructor , his stern mistress is aerodynamics . Quietly , persistently he has worked to prove his theory that a bicycle , like a bird , can gain forward momentum by upward strokes of wings . <P> His bicycle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light , beautifully tempered metal whose high value was discovered during the War , which has become important in airplane construction . This framework is covered with noninflammable celluloid upon the surface of which are distributed many " feathers " ( strips of the molybdenum ) . The whole machine weighs 117 pounds , can be built for $350 . <P> The problem of flying through the air by foot power , for a minute and a half at least , seems solved . There remains the problem of how to get started . At present the automobile acts as starter . Later Inventor White plans to take off from hillsides after installing a two and a half horsepower compressed air motor to get him up and give the 100 " wing flaps per minute necessary for flight .
