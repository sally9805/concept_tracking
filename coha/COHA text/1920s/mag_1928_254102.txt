Every year certain things happen in Indianapolis . Some of them happen at the same time . Automobiles race in the 500-mile sweepstakes out at the speedway . Lots of visitors come to town and after the race there is a dance at the Broadmoor Country Club . <P> All these things happened last week in Indianapolis . Other things happened also . Four men in an old car , for instance , drove up to the Broadmoor Club and parked near the door , leaving the engine running . The orchestra was playing " Dear , On A Night Like This " as the four men came into the ballroom and fired at the floor . Three of them stood guard over the line of 200 ladies and gentlemen while a fourth went down the line with a canvas bag into which the guests dropped their money and jewels . . . . <P> Several hours before they were robbed at the Broadmoor Club the ladies and gentlemen of Indianapolis had seen the checkered flag go down at the end of the race . They had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lopsided and awkward , whirl round the track . A Duesenberg Special with Jimmy Gleason driving led most of the way with Tony Gullota in a Stutz Special giving him a fight . Going into the last fifty miles the pit called in Gullota , and he stopped on his next runaround . " Gas line clogged ! " he shouted , jumping out . Gleason signalled that motor trouble was forcing him to stop for gas . A big red car with " 39 " painted on the hood and tail was in front now . By looking at the programs the people in the stands made out that the driver was someone named Lou Meyer . Gullota who had gotten started again was a close second . <P> Smiling and sitting back in the seat of the boiling car Meyer shook all the hands he could reach . A few days before a friend had lent him money enough to buy his car , an overhauled Miller Special . A year ago he rode a few laps as relief driver for Wilbur Shaw . <P> But in the stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing cars when they were younger . Of these the richest and most noted was a gentleman of French descent with a spike of a mustache , a lined face , thick neck , and popping black eyes-Louis Chevrolet , godfather of an automobile . <P> Like Henry Ford , Alexander Winton , R. C. Durant , and Eddie Rickenbacker , Louis Chevrolet drove racing cars before he gave his name to an automobile company . A name is also the only connection that Louis Chevrolet has with the Chevrolet Motor Company . The name suggested speed , the company wanted it , so Chevrolet sold it in 1913 . <P> Louis Chevrolet is the oldest of three brothers , motor musketeers . Arthur was the second brother . A woman cured him of racing . Death cured the third brother , Gaston , in a collision on the Los Angeles speedway in 1920 . On the Memorial Day before his death he won his greatest race-the Indianapolis Sweepstakes . <P> Louis Chevrolet came to the U. S. in 1902 . He still talks with a French accent . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1917 in a Frontenac he broke the world 's record for a hundred miles . <P> " Racing ? " says Louis Chevrolet , " No , I am through from racing . " He says he wants to start an airplane company in Indianapolis .
