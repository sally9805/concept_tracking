Last week the Ways and Means Committee of the House drove ahead and practically completed the tax bill which it will offer to the House early in December . The preparation of the bill was almost a record for speed and efficiency . The reason for this unusual procedure was simple ; the Democrats on the Committee cooperated in drafting the bill instead of trying to oppose every proposition put forward by the majority . It is one of the few important bills in recent years aside from War measures , which the opposition party , whether Democratic or Republican , has not tried to use as an excuse for bedeviling its opponents . The credit for this achievement , so far as it goes , must be awarded to the Democrats , although the Administration forces . must share it in some degree for having made proposals which the Democrats considered it unwise or unsound to oppose as a whole . <P> Details . Most of the detailed decisions as to surtaxes , estate taxes and " nuisance taxes " were worked out last week . Surtaxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 13% on $42,000 were left the same as at present ; but over $42,000 they were tapered off to 20% on $100,000 and more . Estate taxes were altered similarly in the higher brackets , beginning at 1% after a $50,000 exemption and grading up to 20% on amounts over $10,000,000 . <P> Taxes abolished included those on jewelry , firearms ( except pistols ) and ammunition , mah jong sets , pipes , cameras , films , art works , yachts , slot machines , brokers , pawnbrokers , etc. , deeds and conveyances . <P> Taxes reduced included cigars , alcohol , automobiles . <P> The Total Reduction . After striking off some taxes and reducing others , a calculation was made of what the total loss in revenue would be . It was itemized as follows : <P> Personal <P> Taxes Lost Revenue <P> Income taxes $193,574,564 <P> Gift tax 1,000,000 <P> Excise Taxes <P> Cigars and tobacco $12,000,000 <P> Alcohol 4,000,000 <P> Auto trucks and wagons 7,807,811 <P> Other automobiles , <P> motor cycles 37,656,619 <P> Tires , accessories 22,737,384 <P> Cameras , lenses 653,544 <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,164,124 <P> Cigar-holders , etc 65,243 <P> Coin machines 950,549 <P> Mah jong sets 20,220 <P> Sculpture , etc 821,518 <P> Jewelry 9,673,475 <P> Occupational Taxes <P> Brokers , pawnbrokers , <P> ship brokers and Custom <P> House brokers $1,326,657 <P> Billiards , bowling 2,289,831 <P> Shooting galleries 16,525 <P> Riding academies 12,015 <P> Automobiles for hire 1,865,065 <P> Tobacco manufacturers ' tax 1,125,000 <P> Yachts 301,455 <P> Opium license tax <P> ( physicians ) 311,000 <P> Stamp Taxes <P> Deeds and conveyances 2,000,000 <P> Grand total $304,249,334 <P> This total does not include the reduction in the estate tax , which will not be felt for a year or two . Then it will amount to perhaps $20,000,000 additional . Nor does it include all of the reduction in the tax on alcohol , which becomes effective half on Jan. 1 , 1927 , and half on Jan. 1 , 1928 . <P> Such in substance is tax reduction as proposed by the Ways and Means Committee of the House .                    @
