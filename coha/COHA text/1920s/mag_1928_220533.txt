Boom ! Above the basso of the bombs blood spurted fortissimo . Boom ! Mangled flesh and splintered bones crescendoed high . BOOM ! <P> British correspondents cabled that the beings bombed were " only animals . " Cows had been mangled in humane preference to mangling their tribesmen owners . Reason : some of the tribesmen were suspected of murdering recently British District Commander Captain Ferguson . Result : 34 chiefs of the Lau tribe surrendered , last week , to a small British land force . The chiefs , cowed , were then obliged to watch while British bombers completely demolished their sacred shrine , the Pyramid of Dengkur , long a place of idolatrous , witch-doctoring worship . <P> Simultaneously , last week , French airplanes soared over rebellious Riff tribes in Morocco . The Riff have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scatter , after stampeding their cattle in all directions . Therefore the French chose , last week , a market day and scattered what were described as " light bombs " among the thronging market crowds of several rebel villages .
