Citizens of the U. S. have forgotten with what dread their revolutionary ancestors heard that Newfoundland had been made the war base of the British fleet . Soon the harbor of St. Johns teemed with captured U. S. merchantmen . In those days George Washington worried about what was happening in Newfoundland . Last week it was George V who worried . <P> A sufficient cause for Royal qualms was the Newfoundland Parliamentary Election of last week . Swept out of power was Conservative Prime Minister Frederick Alderdice ; and swept in was Liberal Sir Richard Anderson Squires . The " Liberality " of Sir Richard is such that his principal henchman , Sir William Ford Coaker , has said : <P> " The true destiny of Newfoundland , with her fisheries , her forests , and her mineral wealth lies in the direction of the United States . . . . The Dominion of Newfoundland is coming around to the idea of choosing to become one of the States . ... At present if a referendum were taken on this subject it would carry by a 75% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten the old flag , but because the tendency of the times is to consider dollars and cents first . . . . Ten per cent of our population are continually going to and coming from the United States . . . . " <P> Fortunately for the peace of mind of George V , these evolutionary if not revolutionary sentiments do not yet represent the overt policy of Sir Richard Squires , victor in last week 's contest . This quiet , sharp-featured businessman affects collars with rounded ( " Hoover " ) points , spectacles , and a reassuring air of being no revolutionary . <P> The avowed policy of Sir Richard Squires is to bring to Newfoundland both Canadian and U. S. " dollars and cents , " by fostering exploitation of the illimitable Labrador forests , whence comes most of the wood pulp for Canadian and U. S. news organs , magazines , books . Ostensibly Sir Richard is perfectly willing that the Labrador forests should be transferred to the Dominion of Canada-for a sufficiently stiff price . But the exceedingly harmonious relations existing between him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Richard thinks a stiffer price can be got from Wall Street . The blatant nonsense about merging Newfoundland with the U. S. is probably a mere advance guard of publicity to prepare Newfoundlanders for U. S. dollar penetration . <P> The political upset of last week is unquestionably attributable to the depressed condition of Newfoundland fisheries and other industries .
