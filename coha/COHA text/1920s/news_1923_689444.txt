txt John G. Age-r . President of the Association for the Protection of the Adirondecks , issued a call yesterday to the voters of New Rochelle , his home , to reject the Farris amendment which is to be submitted at the general election next month . In a resolution adopted by , the New Rochelle Chamber of Commerce at the instance of Mr. Agar it was contended that the ratification of the Ferris amendment would give to private electric corporations a perpetual grant of State lands to exploit for hyrdoeleatric work . The adoption of the amendment by the people , Mr. Agar pointed out , would lead to the destruction of the valuable Adirondack forests and would permanently injure the water supply of communities adjoining the territories in which several electric corporations intend to establish hydro-electric plants . It was further contended that the establishment of the plants would destroy the natural resources and beauty of health resorts located in thee Adirondacks which have been dedicated as public parks at a cost of millions of dollars . A different point of view on the socalled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry M. Sage , who as Chairman of the Board of Hudson River Itegu.ation District at Albany , has studied such projects closely . He said that he would vote for the amendment . He defended the amendment as aimed to furnish electric power as a coal substitute . " The proposed constitutional amendment , " said Mr. Sage , " to be voted on Nov. 6 allows the use of public lands for the development of water power for the public benefit . It provides due safeguards for such use , and also that such Power shall not be used for manufacturing or business purposes on State lands , within the forest preserves . Such development may be by the State , or by a lessee of the State , under a lease for a term not exceeding fifty years , to be secured pursuant to law on such terms as will best protect the public interest , and transmission lines may also be constructed , maintained and operated on such lands by the State or by such a lease of the . State on like terms . Such works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision and regulation . " There is further provision that not more than 3 per cent . of the forest preserves shall be used for all purposes provided for by law under this section . Not one foot more of the public domain is invaded . " My interest in this subject Is intense . I have not a cent of investment in ? nor am I even remotely affiliated with any power project , power company , lumber company . but I am a member of the Hudson River Regulating District board , which board has the duty under the law to proceed to build dams on the upper Hudson for the purposes of water storage and flood regulation . There is no question that the cities of Albany , Troy , Watervliet , those cities and villages north of the so-called Capitol district , and even many south of Albany , will be greatly benefited both through flood prevention and year round regulation of stream flow ; ' out the greatest benefit will accrue to the potential users of hydro-electric energy . " Even if no power has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river at the points where ? hydro-electric development already exists will ? give a tremendously increased efficiency to such developments . Consequently and properly , it is probable that between 90 and 95 per cent . of the cost of this great work will be assessed on and paid by the power companies . The cities and towns on the Hudson will be directly benefited by flood prevention and improved health conditions far in excess of their proportionate expense . and indirectly benefited enormously by a greatly increased supply of hydro-electric energy , which can . be produced at a greatly decreased cost . " We have just passed through another crisis in the coal industry , but such a crisis will occur again , and the discomfort and suffering of the past Winter fro mthe same cause is not yet forgotten . Hydro-electric energy is the coming power and those communities and States which have it are going to forge ahead in the industrial race with those who have not . Every one knows that during the last frigid season , and all during the days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belonging to the State of New York , should no longer be allowed to run to waste . Owing to the two theories of development and operation , one by the State itself , and the other by lessees &; of the State under State supervision , year has followed year with nothing accomLished . The first real step forward was taken when the law passed creating river regulating districts . Two such districts are now formed and their boards functioning the Black River and Hudson River districts , and another is contemplated for th ' ? Mohawk River . These listrict boards , as above explained , will , totheY function properly , not only regulate flood conditions , but incident to flood prevention , tremendously increase the potential and usable energy of the ? rettuns . Now , are we , after this is lone , to sit still and see our white coal Ps to waste . as in the past ?
