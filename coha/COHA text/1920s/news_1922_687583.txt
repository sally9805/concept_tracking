txt School authorities in various parts of these.1 states are for prohibition of bobbed hair . It would I bo interesting to know the grounds of objection . That would throw some light on what we call education . Is the objection moralistic or based on a stand and of taste or deportment ? If it is moralistic what is the moral consequence of bobbing the hair ; Does it disclose any part of the anatomy that ought to be concealed ? Does it incite evil thoughts or passion ? If the objection Is from the viewpoint of deportment , and cutting the hair leads to glddi ? ness of conduct , the Supremo court ought to be barred from the barber . As for taste , what is the authority of school boards in this wide field ? Our observation of school trustees , by and large , has not impressed us with their fitness to make esthetic statutes . In the absence of a statement from these official I protestants , it is our guess that the objection to bobbed hair Is moralistic . Young ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the duty of the sex to make themselves as easy to look upon as possible , and their judgment may be relied upon in most cases . But to be fair is to be tempting , and this our alarmed moralists must resist on behalf of that weak masculine for whom more and more beneficent laws are being contrived . It is not , therefore , that bobbed hair is an offense against taste , but that it is a now device of Eve to entangle the young man 's fancy and distract his thoughts from grave instruction . But the prohibition of bobbed hair is a Mere beginning . We look forward to other regulations In the field of protective coloration , etc . For example , red hair , which is the adornment of all heroines in contemporary romance , should be prohibited . For the stronger sex the school boards seem to have no fears , yet It might be advisable to make assurance doubly sure by checking license in cuffed trousers , striped socks , and neckwear of inflammatory tendency . If the world is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the perils besetting the ' flapper.
