other hand , ran on for almost endless pages and into almost endless detail . What , possibly , can account for this amazing difference in emphasis ? One factor we have touched upon : the greater interest in the story of one man as against the story of a crowd of men . A second factor lies in the essential character of news as Dana 's definition sums it up : a departure from routine . For the Carolina story was the story of a mine disaster , " happening every day " ; Collins was the average man who risked death of his own accord . But there is also this additional factor : the Carolina story was over in three days , and from the start only one end to it seemed possible ; the Collins story ran on for fifteen days before it was even dis ? covered whether the man was dead or living , and in that space of time the reporters had him many times saved and many times despaired of . In short , the reporters wrote a thriller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surer fire . In some form and at some point the element of suspense enters into every great news story : sus ? pense as to the story 's end in life or death , in vic ? tory or defeat , in honor or demotion . Gunner Kas ? son , Caillaux and a coal strike ? the PN-9 , Colonel Mitchell and a battle for the oil reserves : each time interest lies not only in an event which has already signalized itself in action but in a denouement which has still to come . The best news story , like the most successful fiction in the magazines , leaves its reader counting hours for the next edition . We arrive , then , at this point : that the great first-page story , as it is reflected in the news of 1925 , is the story of a personal fight between well identified antagonists which involves the element of suspense . This definition is broad enough . Yet some light , I think , its does throw upon certain phases of the relationship between press and public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press that the press is wilfully destructive : that it will print anything derogatory to any man on its first page , and anything commendatory to him on page twenty . Thus , for example , the case of William Brassfield , a Negro arrested in New York City for the murder of a Miss Florence Kane . Brassfield 's arrest was first-page news . The New York Times , for instance , carried the story there , with two full columns of newsprint and a six-galleyed headline . Then Brassfield was exonerated . What happened ? The Times buried this second piece of news on page twenty-one , with three inches of type and a microscopic headline . Was the Times out to do Brassfield as much harm as possible ? I doubt it . The trouble with Brassfield 's exoneration was this : with no fight and no suspense it did not make a story . Do not look to the press for exonerations . Look to it for stories . 2 : It is charged by the public against the press that there is a touch-and-go quality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly de ? structive to the making of any picture of reality upon which men can act . M. Caillaux 's visit ends : immediately the American press , which has been spreading the French debt lavishly over its first pages , drops the French debt as if it were a hot potato . Yet plainly the French debt has not ceased miraculously to exist ; all of the problems in its payment are still present , still ebbing and . flowing with new developments . What hope is there , with emphasis in the press flashing like a drunken searchlight in the dark , for the creation of an in ? telligent opinion in America regarding French obligations ? ? Such criticism ignores one point . Caillaux is gone ; for the first page , that ends it . A personal fight which is no longer personal and no longer a fight , is no longer a story . 3 . Finally , it is charged by the public against the press that its dominating interest is in sex and crime . I think this is to misread motives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in sex and crime because sex and crime , by the standards we have been discussing , so often fur ? nish the best story . For here , compact and vivid , is the personal fight with the well-identified antag ? onists and the stage set for suspense . And-if the ? ology and religion envy sex and crime , and sigh for first-page space , all that theology and religion need to do is to produce a good personal encounter . Witness Dayton , Tennessee . The quest of the press is in search of battle . And the same great mechanism of news gathering which was put at work in Dayton can be put at work and has been put at work to report prizefights , execu-. tions , Republican conventions and Rhinelander divorce trials . Eagerly , with the same elaborate planning , the same remarkable economy in time , the same outlay in money and the same energy and talent of many men , the press turns from a Leo ? pold and Loeb to the excommunication of a Bishop .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
