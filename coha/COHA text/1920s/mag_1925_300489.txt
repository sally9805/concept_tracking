The Senate Committee investigating the Bureau of Internal Revenue , of which committee Senator Couzens of Michigan is chairman , having last spring made public some 15 volumes of evidence , last week made public a few volumes more . The volumes deal with the technical administration of the income tax unit , and criticize the Treasury 's allowance for depreciation , " discovery values " of oil wells , and other technical decisions by which it is claimed that in specific instances the Government lost $5,000,000 in taxes here and $25,000 there , and $10,000,000 somewhere else-with the inference that if these cases show some losses , the entire group of tax collections show much greater losses . <P> One of the more interesting cases is that of the Gulf Oil Co. , in which Secretary Mellon is or was interested . The company paid taxes of over $10,000,000 for 1915-19 and got a refund of nearly $4,000,000 . The case was settled in about a week after amended returns were filed in February , 1921 , although in many cases such settlements drag out for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only have had no refund , but should have paid $600,000 additional . In the warfare between Senator Couzens and Secretary Mellon , the case has only an indirect bearing , however , since it was settled at Secretary Mellon 's request before he took office . <P> Another case the committee called to attention is that of " Black and Simon . " Black owned one-third of a certain oil property , and Simon one-quarter of the same property . The taxes were computed at separate times and apparently by different Treasury experts , whose judgments differed . The result was that Simon 's tax was larger than Black 's . The Treasury has not , however , closed the case .
