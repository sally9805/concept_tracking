txt Moyor John F. HYlan dent a letter yes= terday to Corporation Counsel George Nicholson complimenting him upon the : work his office is doing in opposition to ' . the increased ' rental demanded by thr3-Pennsylvania Railroad for terminal cilities used by the Long Island Railroad ' : in Manhattan. , The Mayor suggested that. his idea of the - solution of the Long " Island 's problem of congestion lay IS ; the enlargement , at a cost of about ' $2,500,000 , of the facilities of the old ; Bushwick station in Brooklyn . ? This , lit ; said , would mean a real economy to the Long Island and would permit an . crease of 33 per cent . in its total passen- , ger terminal facilities . The Mayor 's letter follows : City of New York . Office of the Mayor . Sent .. 22 , 1924 . George P. Nicholson , Esq. , Corporation Counsel , City of New York . I Dear Mr. Nicholson : I wish to commend you upon the splendid and vigorous manner in which you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania Railroad for an increase in rental for the Long Island Railroad 's use of terminal facilities of the Pennsylvania Station , Manhattan . Certainly , if the Pennsylvania Railroad secures permission from the ' Transit Commission o increase the rental from $300,000 a year to $1,300 , - 000 a year , I greatly fear that the , same Transit Commission will grant an increased fare for commuters on the Long Island system . It seems to me an outrageous thing . that the Pennsylvania Railroad should try to compel the Long Island Railroad to pay 65 per cent . of the total cost of their monumental station when the Long Island Railroad only uses 3 per cent . of area of station facilities . Calls It All One System . It would seem to me that some way might be devised to convince the Transit Commission , if they are susceptible to convincing , that the Long Island Railroad Company is part and parcel of the Pennsylvania system . which now comprehends 12,037. route miles , of which the Long Island Railroad is only 393 , or about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thought in mind , it seems to me that the Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan should be treated just the same in their accounting as they treat a station in Newark . Elizabeth . Philadelphia or any other city located along its lines , and since all money goes into the w.me treasury all expenses for operation arid upkeep should be paid , out of . the same treasury . It occurs to me that much thought could be given to a suggestion made by Transit Commissioner John F. O'Ryan , who , during the course of the examination at the hearing on Wednesday , stated thathe thong:it consideration should be given by the Long ' Island Railroad to increasing its Pac:1-ides outside of the Pennsylvania Station for the use of Long Island passengers . It seems to me that , in this regard , it might be well for the Corporation Counsel 's office to look Into the matter of possible improvements and plans for ' increasin .. passenger facilities at the Pushwiekterminal of the Long Island Railroad , located at Bushwick and Montrose Avenues , Brooklyn , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section to Union Square , Manhattan , and points up and down town . It was this same Transit Commission , you will recall , that authorized the Long Island Railroad to discontinue the small passenger service from Bushwick terminal to Fresh Pond ' Road . As little as their shuttle service gave , yet a considerable number of passengers were accommodated who felt the convenience of service to Bushwick terminal . This terminal , not many years ago , was the most important station in Brooklyn of the Long Island Railroad . But since the railroad apparently has adopted the policy of concentrating and giving as little Service as possible to passengers , this - station has fallen into disuse and the yari ? are used for freight . If my memory serves me correctly , it was a little over a year ago that the Transit Commission made a study of this situation and , although the Information was not given to the public , I believe that their report showed that a two-track road could be built and electrified from the Bushwick station to the Montauk Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating expenses would run to about $750,000 for five-car trains on a five-minute headway . A Shorter Route Here . With Bushwick station developed to its fullest . cipacity , Long Island passengers would find a shorter route to the , heart of Manhattan for a lower commutation fare than at present . with a five-cent subway fare from Bushwick terminal to any part of Manhattan below Fifty-ninth Street . The full operetta ! ' of the Bushwick station would relieve the Pennsylvania Station fully 50 per cent . and at the - same time provide better and more comfortable facilities for passengers using the Pennsylvania Station and reduce space needed by the Long Island Railroad . At the same time the lower operating expenses , through the utilization of the Bushwick terminal , would mean economy to the Long Island Railroad . Company if it really wanted to give better service , and it would permit thirty trains per hour more than at present operated , or an increase ; of 33 1-3 per cent . of the total passenger terminal facilities of the - Long Island Railroad , and yet permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal their Ares ; ent service if the traffic so warranted . I think this will be worth looking into and should be made a point in your very active prosecution of this ca:e for the benefit of the people , as it would result in a lowering of over -- -head expenses for the railroad , meaning thereby lower fares and better accommodations .
