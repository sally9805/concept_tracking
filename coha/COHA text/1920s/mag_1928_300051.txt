The American Chemical Society met. last week , at Swampscott , Mass. , for their 76th convention . Members discussed : <P> Chemistry 's Value . Samuel Wilson Parr , 71 , preceptor of the group of brilliant chemists and physicists at the University of Illinois , and president of the chemistry society , opened the meeting with the survey usual at such affairs : " Output of chemical products in this country have advanced in 50 years from an insignificant sum to more than $2,000,000,000 annually at present . . . . This is a chemical age , and we live , move and have our physical being as a result of chemical processes . Whether we travel on foot in chrome-tanned shoes and rayon stockings or roll to work on rubber wheels and concrete roads , we travel in comfort by chemical grace and goodwill . If we land in the hospital , the chemist has anticipated our coming . He is there before us with antiseptics , anesthetics and remedial agents for the relief of suffering and the restoration of health . " <P> Pea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midsummer Night 's Dream . enjoy eating peas , pods and all . Other live stock also find them delectable . Humans like the green seeds , but not the pods . Yet the pods contain valuable sugar and proteins . How to make them humanly palatable is a job which the U. S. Department of Agriculture 's bureau of chemistry has set for itself . <P> Pituitary Hormones . Pituitrin , extract of the hazelnut-like gland at the underside of the brain , does three things to a body : 1 ) it causes powerful contractions of the pregnant uterus at term ( its oxytocic effect ) ; 2 ) it makes blood pressure ( its pressor effect ) ; 3 ) it increases urinary flow where urine is scanty and decreases it where the flow is inordinately great , as in diabetes insipidus ( its diuretic-anti-diuretic effect ) . So there must be more than one hormone in the pituitary gland , decided Dr. Oliver Kamm , director of Parke . Davis &; Co. ' s research laboratories . By tedious fractional precipitation of pituitrin he has been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in keeping up normal blood pressure during certain operations , useful too against diabetes insipidus . Dr. Kamm reasons that the danger from burns comes from the boiling of water out of the skin and flesh , and the failure of the body to replace that water effectively . His vasopressin he believes may stimulate the body to repair the water shortage of burns . <P> Tuberculosis . Some tentative research done on tuberculosis bacteria at Yale may have deep importance towards wiping out the disease . The chemists there have made a fatty acid from living tubercle bacilli . The acid is new to science . When it is injected into rabbits it produces in their bodies the nodules peculiar as symptoms of tuberculosis , but of no other disease . Said R. J. Anderson of Yale : " This discovery that a nonliving substance may be the cause ot tubercular growth , opens up an entirely new mode of approach in the search for an immunizing agent . In the past there has been no way of proving whether the growth of the tubercle in tubercular organisms was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
