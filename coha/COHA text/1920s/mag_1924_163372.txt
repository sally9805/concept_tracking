The venerable savants of the French Academy decided to admit the following Anglo-Saxon sporting terms into the French language : challenge , camping , bookmaker , cricket , Boy Scout , champion , bridge . The words canter , crack and crawl were rejected . <P> Although the French have in the past borrowed many other sporting words from the English and the American languages , it does not necessarily follow that they are pronounced in the same way . For example , sport is pronounced spor , knock-out as knookoot , etc.
