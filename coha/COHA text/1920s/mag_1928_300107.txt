In the " Place of Awe , " in the Kashi-kodokoro , where rests the sacred metal mirror of the Divine Ancestress , they married . <P> The spirits of 123 dead emperors were watching , and the Sun Goddess Amaterasu-0-Makimi listened to the young Prince as he spoke the name of his bride . Then Prince and bride exchanged the San-san-kudo , the " three times three , " each drinking three times of sak ( rice wine ) from each of three divine cups . Then they spoke to the ancestors , and the marriage was complete . <P> Thereafter Prince and Princess stepped from the holy quiet of the Kashikodo-koro , ( where only the ancestors , the Emperor , and a few of the Imperial House may enter ) into the sudden blazing sunshine of the city , Tokyo . A joyous roar of Banzai greeted them , for 60,000 persons had stood impatient in the heat , waiting to cheer . <P> All Japan paid joyous homage , for the bridegroom is Yasuhito , Chichibu-No-Miya , 26 , - Prince and heir-presumptive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , daughter of popular Tsuneo Matsudaira , who was Japan 's Ambassador at Washington until he went home for the Imperial Marriage . <P> The Imperial couple 's new home , with its high roof , its stucco walls , its stone front , is more an English mansion than a Japanese residence . Within , awaiting them , were the ancient customary gifts : the Tai , king of fishes , the cask of purified sak , the hemp , incense , seaweed . There also was the bride 's elaborate trousseau , including many a Parisian gown . Throughout the house sprawled electricity , plumbing . And further , Prince and Princess had gone to live in their very own home , not in the old fashioned way to the home of the bridegroom 's parents . Further the Princess is not of imperial blood which formerly would have made her unfit for the Prince 's hand . For these reasons and because they had married for love , like the reigning Emperor Hirohito ( TIME , Feb. 4 , 1924 ) , the new Imperial couple symbolize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to the rising sun of modernity in Japan . <P> Although by their marriage last week the Prince and his Princess seemed elevated above the rank of ordinary mortals , both are well known and popular in Europe and the U. S. <P> Prince Chichibu , short , lithe , athletic , sallow-skinned , once studied at Oxford . During his vacations he scampered up Swiss Alps , peered from mountain tops through his owlish tortoise shell spectacles . <P> Princess Setsuko was a bright student at a Quaker school in Washington . Often she sped in her automobile on Washington 's broad avenues . She played tennis or swam at exclusive country clubs . Often she dances . She likes jazz . <P> <P> *Because Prince Chichibu is the next in line to Emperor Hirohito who has no male issue .
