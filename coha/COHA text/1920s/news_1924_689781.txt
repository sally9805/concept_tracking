txt Declaring that vice is glorified and virtue , sobriety and observance of the law made unattractive in many films ; the New York State Motion Picture Censorship Commission tonight submitted its annual re- : port to Governor Smith . The report asserts that the " motion pictures can be made a wonderful force ' with the education of our people , and under proper regulations will acCom-1 plish great good . " Pointing out that the penal law Jegulating legitimate theatrical performances can not be applied to motion pictures , the report says that " undoubtedly the greatest evil is the exhibition of pictures showing the method of committing crime and escaping punishment " It continues : " Others are intended to appeal to sex instincts . It has . been said that the motion picture gives a false idea of life . People living in Immoral relations are shown to be surrounded with luxuries which girls and boys who have to work for a living can not afford . In this manner the life of the American people is Misrepresented , Vice is glorified and virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Difficulties in Regulation . " The claim is often made that the law concerning the regulation of theatrical performances is adequate to punish those who produce and exhibit objectionable motion pictures . It has , however , been clearly proven that the motion picture can not be regulated through the same agencies as the ordinary theatres . The universal demand for regulation all over the world is a sufficient answer to this argument . " If it were possible to prevent the exhibition of objectionable films , through the agencies which exist without a general statute , some locality in the country would have been able to do so . Again , the ordinary processes of the law are so slow that before a picture could be suppressed it would have a long run , and much notoriety and great harm would result . " The commission found it necessary to make 2.881 eliminations in 586 films , dropping or rearranging* 2,260 scenes and eliminating 621 titles . Twenty-nine scenes or titles were regarded as sacrilegious and 26 as obscene . In 382 instances the commission decided that a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated as inhuman , The report points out that the total receipts ' collected by the commission during the three years of its existence were $478,233.06 . The total amount exPetided by the State to maintain the cominission ' for the same period ' was $200 ; 288.28 , leaving a net profit for the State of $275,044.78 . Found Immoral Foreign Pictures . " During the year there seems to have been a great influx of foreign pictures , " the  --  report said . " There is , no agency which has any jurisdiction over them exvept our commission , and many of them contain indecent , immoral and sometimes sacrilegious matter . In fact , in some of them , assaults have been made upon religious sects . The majority of the producers and exhibitors , we are satisfied , have sought to co-operate with the commission and its work , and the violations detected have been comparatively few when it is taken into consideration that there are about 1,700 theatres in the State and that daily exhibitions are given in them . " Many objectionable films are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares . " Foreigners . by reason of films of this character being shown . are given a false impression as to our country and its institutions . Frequent complaints have been made to this commission concerning abuses of this character . Poland . through its officials , claims that it was necessary for that country to enact a censorship law for the reason that the American films are very attractive to their people and had a tendency to incite them to crime . An agitation was started in Mexico to prevent the exhibition of our films due to the fact that the Mexican is always represented as a bandit or outlaw . " These facts are not presented with the idea of indicting the industry as a whole for these abuses , but the fact that they should be remedied still remains . The majority of the producers , we are satisfied , are appreciative Of their responsibility to the public , but in an industry of this character , which attracts such a variety of people , it is not strange that persons of questionable character should attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cre , upon the screen is the dissemination of propaganda which is inimical to our institutions . The Department of Jugtice at Washington has taken cognizance of this fact , and is vigilant in watching particularly the foreign films which teach lessons which are destructive of the fundamentals of our Government . We have no power to prevent their manufacture without our borders but should prevent their exhibition within . " The favorite argument that the regulation of the motion picture is destructive of the liberties of people and tends to restrict art has long since , in this State particularly , been proven to be without foundation . Only those portions of films which clearly violate the law are deleted . No State or country would have ever passed laws regulating the motion picture industry unless . as conceded by all reputable pro- . ducers , abuses had crept into the industry and a necessity existed foratheir being remedied . " The board asked the amendment of ex fisting laws so that the commission could impose in cases of willful violation an adequate penalty . Removal of the present uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films was asked . No mention is made of cases involv-1 ing motion picture actors or actresses , but the commission suggests that power be given it to prevent exhibition of pictures in which " criminals or persons recognized to be of a debased character appear .
