t0 my way of thinking , truth demands the admission that , although Harvard is superior to most colleges , she is not meeting the situation as she should . The college man is altogether too little interested in the life the fundamentals of which he is supposed to be learning . Elections come and go ; international complications arise and blow over ; a great book is written ? and as far as most of us are concerned , these events might just as well not have happened . Now and then , of course , a tremendous happening such as the great War occurs and does produce a mighty stir among us . But the ordinary things of life , the ordinary matters of importance , are simply beyond the ken of the average undergraduate . Discussion groups and forums have been tried and failed miserably . Lectures seem to draw only when the speaker is picturesque or so prominent that to be absent will bring the suggestion of having " missed it . " There can be no doubt as to the conclusion . Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them directly after commencement . ? William S. Holbrook , Jr. , Class Orator of the Senior Class at Harvard , June , 1921 . There is a spirit of unrest , of discontent , of extravagance , of idleness , of expected perfection , and impatience when we should remember that perfection and success are not immediately within one 's grasp . There has developed out of this a noisy effort by a relatively small number of people to upset and dislocate the established order of things and to " Fly to evils that we know not of . " What are called Radicalism , Socialism , Sovietism , and Bolshevism are advocated , and too many people who should know better lend a receptive ear to those foolish , yet dangerous , doctrines and thus encourage the ignorant , the thoughtless and the wicked . In schools , colleges and even in our beloved Harvard , there is some of this atmosphere , and it is disturbing many of the best friends of education and progress in the country .  | In giving young people their physical nourishment we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Eat what you like whether it agrees with you or not . " We know that the physical machine can absorb only a certain amount and that all else is waste and trash , with the result that bodies are poisoned and weakened . In giving mental nourishment , why lay before young and impressionable men and women un-American doctrines and ideas that take mental time and energy from the study and consideration of the great fundamentals and eternal truths , fill the mind with unprofitable mental trash which , with some , result only in sewing the seeds of discontent and unrest ? And which can result only in absolute life failure , spiritual and material . Take the case of a young woman endowed with a marvelous voice and ambitious to be a prima donna in grand opera . If she attempts to train herself or receives her instruction and inspiration from those who have a half-knowledge of the great science of music , with little experience in the musical world , she will fail . The only way she can obtain the highest success within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the best and most experienced musical masters . Just so with young men and young women who , through false teachings , are carried away with the doctrines of Socialism and Bolshevism . After they get into the real world it takes them considerable time to become convinced that certain laws controlling social and material affairs are as unchangeable as the law of gravitation , and some never learn it ; that in many instances they have wasted their time on studies that are of no use and have been taken off their feet by altruistic theories based on false idealism and a bastard materialism. ? Howard Elliott , C. E. , L.L. D. , former President of the Northern Pacific Railway Company and of The New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad Company , Overseer of Harvard and formerly President of The Alumni Association of Harvard University ; ? from the address of Mr. Elliott to his Class of 1881 , Univer sity Club , Boston , June 22 , 1921 . Mr. Holbrook in his Harvard Class utterance will be credited with stating a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds that the lectures at Harvard draw only when the speaker is picturesque he , perhaps uncon sciously , suggests a remedy ; and I am to enjoy the privilege , after talks with many in financial and business life , to attempt to point a way to either minimize or to meet favorably the so-called radicalism in our colleges . Mr. Elliott suggests a remedy which has received wide commendation , but on the other hand , not a few in the business world have  | suggested another line of procedure . AIr . Elliott has had vast experience in financial and railroad life . Contrary to the accepted belief , he was a poor boy in college . During vacations he worked on various railroads as a level rodnian , a very humble civil engineering place and his wages were fifteen dollars a month and " grub " ? the phrase of that day . He has become one of the powers in the railroad world , and is a publicist and writer of distinctir , n on subjects affecting the welfare of our country . I feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit in our universities and colleges and free intercourse of ideas . My experience as a newspaper man impressed me with the thought that it is idle to attack the mental antics of college students , idle to attack their radicalism ? these are always the qualities of immaturity . There are those who believe that the radical propaganda which is being worked in our colleges and universities , together with a mild Bolshevism in art , science , religion , economics and sociology , are driving through American traditions and landmarks of our race of students , and that these are assisted by professors and clergymen whose thinking has been dislocated by unsound , even ignorant , subversive influences in theology and sociology . The stone-wall fact remains , however , that Intercollegiate Liberal Leagues are established in nearly all of our colleges , the purpose evidently being to give students the thrill of believing that they are taking part in the beginning of a great new movement comparable even to the winning of our national independence or the abolition of slavery . It is well known that facts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dull the imagination , while distortion stimulates it . From the foundation of our country there has been a class of college students who must have mental recreation or , as it were , a vent . In former days this vent took the shape of savage discussions on theology , on the various religious sects of the country , pre-destination , hell-fire and eternal damnation , natural selection , Brahmanism , Buddhism , de- hates on all the great religions of the %vnrld , the food and bad of the French Revolution , ditto the English Reformation . Then came fierce talks over mathematics , and natural phenomena . Later on came wine and beer parties , and still later came the theatrical bombardments of favorite musical comedy heroines , quite a number of elopements with favorite chorus girls , interspersed by the era of athletics . All these portrayed the natural , perhaps unconscious hunger of immaturity for a vent . The brain and tongue must have a regular vent or random explosions come . Nations , like individuals , must have a vent . Our volcanoes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young men in the first exhilarating months of intellectual freedom are being seized with promissory doctrines , the source and consequences of which they do not see . There is a natural rebelliousness of youth , which promises progress ; there is a natural venturesomeness to play free with ancient faiths ; both of which are ebullitions of the spirit and significant of dawning mental virility . It is during the periods when these adolescent expansions are in process that the youth is captured by influences which deliberately lie in wait for him in the colleges . True , in after years a large proportion come to their senses sufficiently to be able " to sit on the fence and see themselves go by , " and they come back to sanity . They find that " free love " doctrines make exhilarating club topics , but that the Family ? the genesis , foundation , keystone and arch of a strong nation ? the old-fashioned loyalty of one man and one woman to each other and their children is the basis , not only of society , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while a delightful subject for fiery debates and an excellent stimulant in the feeling of supermanlikeness , is nevertheless not the process of progress . Miss Patty S. Hill , of the Teachers ' College , New York City , in a recent address at Detroit , stated : " It is worse to have germs on the mind than on the body . " What is the remedy for removing these germs of radicalism from the minds of our university and college students ?  | The Intercollegiate Liberal Leagues in our colleges arc a new effort in student activities , organized at the 11arvard Union several months ago . The conference attending the formation of these leagues was explained to represent an ex pression of the aspirations of a great number of college stu dents to participate more actively than formerly in the activ ities of their generation . The purpose of the conference was to bring together men and women from the various colleges with a view to founding an intercollegiate liberal organiza tion whose scope shall be national , and whose aim shall be to cultivate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward social , industrial and political ques tions . This was the first spontaneous movement of the kind in the United States . Its importance was illustrated by the fact that at least twenty-three colleges were represented . These included practically all of the large universities of the East , as well as theological institutions and smaller colleges . The credit of bringing together this convention was chiefly due to the work of the students of Harvard and Rad cliffe . They secured some of the most prominent liberals in the country as speakers , as well as men who are recog nized as among the foremost educators . Among those who addressed the conference were Dean L. B. R. Briggs of Harvard , Walter Lippman of the New Republic , Presi dent-Emeritus Eliot , of Harvard , Senator Ladd of North Dakota , John Haynes Holmes , head of the Community Church , and President H. N. MacCracken of Vassar . J. P. Batdorf , ' 21 , represented Wesleyan at this conference , the result of which will undoubtedly be the securing of several prominent speakers on economics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. C. H. Holmes , a Harvard alumnus , speaking of that conference at the Harvard Union , said : " During the last few years Harvard , as well as most other universites and colleges , has solicited her graduates and people at large to subscribe to an endowment fund for  | the put pose of insuring ing salaries for her professors and instructors . ily own small subscription represented the limit of my ability to help support an institution front which I have always been proud to have been graduated , and to further a movement that seemed vital to the future education in this country . I had no intention of helping support a Rand School . " The study of liberalism is one thing , but for an institution chartered and helped by the state , and so a quasi arm of the government , to encourage theorists whose one intelligible common aim is to break down the existing order of things , seems hardly ethical . Do we commonly give our support to men whom we know to be continually knocking us ? constantly plotting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students , forsooth , that the way to amount to something is to identify themselves to the limit with the labor world . ' Why a higher education at all if labor is the only thing ? If we all pump the organ who will play ? Russia today is a beautiful example of a performance by workers alone . " Harry W. Laidler wants to resist all attempts to muzzle professors . ' And why not muzzle ' people who are biting the hand that feeds them ? " Read over the list of speakers and then tell me if I am not warranted in asking whether the authorities of a college to which I owe much and to which I have hoped to send my boy , indorsed these ultra radicals by officially offering them a forum and encouraging them in their propaganda . " I asked Mr. Edward Grant Buckland , alumnus of Washburn College , Topeka , Kansas , formerly Professor of Law at Yale , for an expression of opinion on this question of radicalism in our universities and colleges , and especially as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college students as to what is going on in our colleges , and Mr. Buckland was good enough to say : " The basis of my comment on this subject is a paraphrase of a saying which Edmund Burke once made , I have con- Iidcncc in the ultimate common sense ut the Engl.h people , ' Modernizing that and using as my text : I have confidence in the ultimate common sense of college undergraduates , I say this deliberately after an almost continuous knowledge of undergraduate sentiment at Yale for more than thirty years , and an intimate connection with the undergraduate body during a considerable period of that time . " The average college man wishes to think straight , but he believes , and so do I , that straight thinking conics nut through coddling , but as a result of a knowledge of the facts and an interplay of argument based upon it . The undergraduate has always wished to know all sides of a proposition . Today he demands it more than ever because he has seen and in many instances shared personally in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eager to know whether there is any new rule by which society may live and prosper more than that which resulted in the horrible travesty enacted between 1914 and 1918 . Advan tage has been taken of this state of mind among people generally , and among undergraduate students particularly , by propagandists , some of whom are sincere though mis chievous , and others who are both mischievous and insin cere . Generally they are plausible in their arguments and rather fascinating in the presentation of their subjects . If they are not permitted to present them they will claim that freedom of speech is abridged . " Now my theory is just this : College authorities should allow the utmost freedom of speech so long as it is within the well-recognized limits of decency and loyalty , but they should recognize that propagandists are likely to commu nicate a mental infection to their listeners for which an antitoxin should be provided . Therefore , wherever a propa gandist presents arguments of this sort he should be made to understand that he must make good his argument against men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stu dent should be privileged to hear either contemporaneously with , or immediately after the propagandist , a presentation  | by a person of equal ability and of equal facility of speech and personal magnetism . " Right here comes a real difficulty . The average lec turer uses such technical phrases that the undergraduate loses interest . With all our boasted teaching of English in universities , college men , as a class , do not express themselves with the directness or the clarity with which the average soap-box orator expresses himself on the street cor ner . Most of our so-called English teaching is not a teach ing of the English language , but is a teaching of historical English literature , which is a very different thing . It is not so essential that my son should know what Macbeth thought when he first saw Macduff , as it is that he should be able to convey orally or by written word his thought in clear and forceful English . To meet these propagandists , therefore , I would seriously suggest that the colleges cultivate in their English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a better term , a class in soap box oratory , by which stu dents will be able to meet and refute in like language the arguments which the Pinks and Reds and Bolsheviki are continually presenting . In the meantime present to these students in the vernacular a picture of how these theories have worked among peoples in by-gone days , and show them that from the time of the Children of Israel , and farther back for all I know , there have been repeated attempts to get peopre to work together and contribute all they produced to a common treasury ; that each time it has failed for the simple reason that there was no penalty visited upon the idler , the slacker , or the spendthrift , and no reward for the industrious , the initiative and the thrifty . Tell them the experiment would have worked in the Plymouth Colony if anywhere , and that it utterly failed there in two or three years . Read them the reasons why in the quaint language of that day . " Socialism , the eight-hour day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to the world in the thought that they are new , when , in fact , they are old , dis credited , and discarded theories , as the history of society  | will easily demonstrate . As to these theories I have no fear that the college undergraduate will think straight , talk straight , and act straight when he has heard all sides , and that he will be stronger than one who has been shielded from the propagandists . If , as has sometimes happened , an instructor is found who persists in teaching this sort of thing , if I were in authority in a college , I would not demand his resignation , but by a presentation of the facts to the students show the utter absurdity of his arguments through the means which I have just outlined , and make him so ridiculous and so uncomfortable that he would rather be anywhere else than in the class or lecture room . " It is nonsense to say that the colleges of this country are not at least as able as the propagandists , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ingenuity to devise ways and means of meeting this propaganda . In this way we shall hear less of the rumor that colleges are pink and becoming red , and more of what is the fact that the colleges are the repositories of straight living , straight thinking and straight acting . " In my opinion Mr. Buckland advances a very real , a downright practical remedy , to offset the teachings . of the propagandists of radicalism . Let me go a little further in that direction . In the vernacular of the day , we should have from the outside world public speakers and writers to contradict by counterproof the type of speaker now infesting our colleges as propagandists and who are known in the outside world as " Chaw-Mouths " and " Hell-Roaring Jakes . " I have noticed that many of the radical propagandists use rather strong , sometimes vitriolic language . The gentlemen I am to . name as factors in a suggested remedy would not demean themselves by such utterances , for they know full well that good nature and good sense are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of Demosthenes ? " To find fault , someone may say is easy , and in every man 's power ; but to point out the proper course to be pursued in the present circumstances , that is  | the proof of a wise counselor . " And the gentlemen I am to name could be very wise counselors in these rather dis turbed college conditions . I suggest that the anti-radicals should have speakers to attend our colleges and use the language so familiar to the man on the street . They should have practical financial and business experience in order to be able to point out the fallacies advanced by the radical propagandists . Men in this very material business and professional world are usu ally measured by their merits ; their talents to accomplish practical results , their real powers of productivity . In this connection , I am reminded of placards I recently saw tacked to the walls of a university town which read , " Motormen get sixty cents an hour , professors eighteen cents an hour . " I can easily recall a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lecture to the undergraduates of Yale . His topic was the Plumb Plan to govern the railroads . As he proceeded it was patent to all that Herr Lasker knew little or nothing whatever of the effects , if put in operation , of the Plumb Plan on the fifty-five millions of our people who are directly or indirectly , through work and investments , interested in the railroads of our country ; even upon the advocates of the Plumb Plan . Finally , questioned by Mr. Bukland , Herr Lasker broke down and admitted that he knew absolutely nothing of the practical workings of the proposed plan . I am very glad to note that within the last several years , since the foundation of the Boston Trade Union College , the list of similar institutions has grown long . Arthur Glea son 's pamphlet on workers ' education , dated June twenty fifth , describes the Trade Union College of Washington , D. C. , the Workers ' College of Seattle , and the Rochester Labor College , founded in 1919 ; and the Baltimore Labor Class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Union College , the Workers ' University of Cleveland , the Workers ' College of Minneapolis , and the St. Paul Labor College , dating from 1920 . In addition ,  | there must be mentioned the classes of the International Ladies ' Garment Workers , the workers ' classes in small Pennsylvania cities , the Amherst classes , and schools with a special foundation , like one for Finnish workers in Duluth . About ten thousand American workers are now regularly studying in their own higher institutions . Many will regret , probably , the organization of these labor colleges on the ground that they tend to the education of a class when it is the plain intent of the polity of Americanism to do away with classes of our citizens in order to make the nation completely democratic . Many contend that we are a nation of racial eddies , that there is no real melting pot , that our many different races do not intermingle or intermarry . This may be true to a certain extent in a social way but as a nation we are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great War . Many wise men who have written and thought of our affairs as a nation deprecate any step in the direction of racial exclusiveness , or class restrictions or domination . We do not want an oligarchy of labor any more than we want an oligarchy of capital , and the higher education of our people should be in the direction of a merging of all interests , economic , financial and social , for the benefit of the entire nation . I have in mind a plan which would carry further the basis of Mr. Buckland 's thought as to rebuttal argument of the college radical propagandist . Glance over the list of overseers of Harvard , the trustees of the University of Chicago , the regents of the University of Wisconsin , the trustees of Columbia University , the fellows of Yale University , the overseers of Williams College , the trustees of Cornell University , the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania , and the trustees of the Leland Stanford University . I have selected these lists as representing territorially the great college thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers , financiers , railroad executives , judges , statesmen , engineers , merchants , manufacturers , real estate men and newspaper editors , business men ,  | capitalists , surgeons , publicists , coal operators , geologists , all familiar with the practical workings of life , all busy men , all interested hourly and daily in the great rivalries of business and professional life . All are men of keen intel ligence , many are very excellent speakers , quite a number are writers of renown , and all have made their mark in the great world and made it through understanding the prac ticalities of the great world , not only in this country , but in foreign countries . Take the overseers of Harvard , as an instance . Among them are Mr. John Pierpont Morgan , Mr. Howard Elliott , and Mr. Thomas W. Lamont , who could explain to the students at Harvard Union the real truth about the fundamentals and the practical workings of finance and railroads and constituent subjects . Mr. Harold F. McCormick and Mr. Julius Rosenwald could do the same for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Kohler could speak to the students of the Univer sity of Wisconsin . Mr. William Barclay Parsons , Mr. M. Hartley Dodge , Mr. A. Barton Hepburn , and Mr. Robert S. Lovett could do the same for Columbia University . Mr. Charles Hopkins Clark , Mr. Otto T. Bannard , and Mr. Howell Cheney could do the same for Yale . Mr. Alfred C. Chapin , Mr. Hale Holden and Mr. Solomon B. Griffin could do the same for Williams . Mr. Ira A. Place , Mr. Robert H. Treni , an , and Mr. Charles M. Schwab could do the same for Cornell . Mr. Edward Townsend Stotesbury and Mr. Joseph E. Widener could do the same for the Uni versity of Pennsylvania . Mr. Joseph Donohue Grant and Mr. Frank Bartow Anderson could do the same for Leland Stanford . And I could name many other gentlemen who are interested in the university and college life of our coun try who could give the students the facts as to the workings of fundamental and practical financial and business life , and in this list are Mr. Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearson , and Mr. Paul M. Warburg , and men of that type who are good writers and excellent speakers . One could n't very well imagine the gentlemen I have mentioned  | and others whom I have in mind as becoming " ChawMouths " or " Hell-Roaring Jakes . " Nevertheless , they could meet the theoretical and very often ignorant propa gandists of radicalism on their own ground and overcome them by their real , fine , high , practical knowledge of world affairs . This treatment would be rather homeopathic , sim ilia similibus , or better still , as Mr. Buckland puts it , antitoxin , but it would be very effective , I believe . I am not advocat ing the suppression of the propagandists or the dismissal of misguided and recalcitrant professors . I am the stoutest advocate of free speech . Our magazines and newspapers , in the free discussion of all subjects affecting the welfare of the country , have done mighty service for the good of the people ; and I believe the same service could be performed for our undergraduates if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind could give of their very valu able time to contradict in the Harvard Union and elsewhere the theories and fallacies which are misleading our undergraduates . These gentlemen know the world as it has been for a thousand years , as it is , as it promises to be for the next few generations , if not for the next thousand years ; and they have made great success from every standpoint in world affairs . They would be listened to intently and the indif ference of students at lectures of which Dr. Holbrook speaks would give place to an enlightened and keen interest . And the graduates of our universities and colleges would not have so much to unlearn when they got out into the busy , practical , work-a-day world .  |
