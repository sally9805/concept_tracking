When she died in 1920 , aged 69 , few of her readers thought to ask if she was survived by a Mr. Humphry Ward . For all that most of them knew , he might have been an anonymous consort to a nom de plume . Last week the ignorant were enlightened . Cables heralded the release of Widower Ward 's latest literary opus , a history of the Athenaeum Club , famed and venerable bulwark of British conservatism . <P> It was recalled that Mr. Ward once brought out an edition of The English Poets ; once saw his son elected to Parliament .

His circle of acquaintanceships is wide . The fact that he has just celebrated his 80th birthday will preclude all possibility of immature reflections .
