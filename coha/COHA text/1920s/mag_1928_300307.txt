When Calvin Coolidge became President of the U. S. it was known that he had been an attorney and the governor of a state and was a man of abstemious habits . The same things are known about Senor Emilio Portes Gil ( pronounced " Heel " ) , who became President of Mexico last week . Moreover Emilio Portes Gil , like Calvin Coolidge , was enabled to reach highest office by Death. - But there the resemblance ends . <P> People who watched the pompous inaugural ceremonies of last week saw that President Portes Gil is a stocky man of sturdy frame and strong , squarish face . Vigorous and athletic , he either horseback rides or swims each day , usually before breakfast , and was a potent baseball batsman in his youth . The boom of his great voice is loud and clear , rather than hearty . But with traditional Mexican courtesy he is ever ready to clap mightily upon the back and kiss soundly upon both cheeks any man who is favorably introduced-even bashful U. S. correspondents . Last week the massive personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration took place in the great bowl of Mexico City 's athletic stadium . There the National Congress sat in extraordinary open air session . Sat also 25,000 spectators . Cannon boomed a 24-gun salute as Senor Fortes Gil strode in with the retiring President of Mexico , Plutarco Elias Calles . Although General Calles admittedly possessed the powers of a Dictator and could easily have succeeded himself he deliberately chose to step down ( TIME , Sept. 10 ) and movingly announced that by so doing he hoped to end the vicious circle of Mexican military dictatorships . It is almost the chief distinction of the new President that he is no soldier but a simple civilian , described in official papers as " Citizen Attorney E. Fortes Gil . " <P> The Dictator , Plutarco Elias Calles. symbolized his abnegation by insisting that the President-Elect should don the presidential cordon immediately before his inauguration . Legally the new President did not become such until the stroke of midnight after his inauguration . The oath of office , as taken by Sefior Fortes Gil , rang loudly and distinctly thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political Constitution of the United States of Mexico and all laws emanating therefrom , and loyally and patriotically to fulfill the office of President of the Republic , which the nation has conferred upon me , always seeking the good and prosperity of the union . Should I fail , then may the nation call me to account . " <P> No sooner had the echoes died than President Fortes Gil indulged in the unprecedented innovation of making , then and there , a formal declaration of his policies . This was primarily an assurance that the policies of retiring President Calles would continue unchanged , and secondarily an expression of confidence that national solidarity and order would prevail during the coming electoral campaign . " I hold firm in my intention , " boomed President Fortes Gil , " not to restrict liberty of expression , oral or written ! The liberty to criticize me will have all the attributes of impunity . " <P> Since Senor Fortes Gil , as Governor of the State of Tamaulipas ( 1925-28 ) , actually did maintain the right of free expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week had greatest weight .
