Germans read in the Berliner Tageblatt last week an unofficial message from the Chairman of the U. S. Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee : * <P> " I hope to see the sole War guilt deception rejected once and for all . It is to nobody 's advantage to maintain a false benefit , which only serves to preserve rancor and to retard the confidence and friendly relations which we should seek to further and restore in every way . There is no sole guilt for the War . " <P> Yet Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles reads in part : <P> " The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the War imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies . " <P> <P> *Senator William Edgar Borah.
