When long-jawed , saturnine Alexey Ivanovich Rykov , Chairman of the Council of People 's Commissars , leader of the Right Wing conservative group in the Communist Party , presented a bill to the Congress of Soviets last week , another of the most cherished ideas of the early Bolshevik leaders was headed quietly for the shelf . <P> Violent anti-religious propaganda has been as intrinsic a part of Communism as anti-capitalist propaganda . However , active persecution of the Greek Orthodox Church ceased in Russia two years ago . Perceiving that harsh tactics had , if anything , a stimulating effect upon oldtime religion among the peasants , the Soviets ignored secret services and the hiding of ikons in closets , the wearing of beads under shirts , and adopted subtler methods .

It was drawn as an amendment to the Soviet Constitution and it proposed to grant the Russian people the right to practice religion freely . At face value , this seemed a tremendous step away from the Redness of the Founding Fathers . But long-jawed Rykov explained that it was meant , not as a defense of religion , but as a new , supremely subtle combative measure . Said he to the Commissars : <P> " Remove the stimulus of persecution , and the churches will languish . . . The fight against religion can only succeed if linked with mass progress and deep penetration in the masses of scientific knowledge and culture . " <P> Opposed , though not too openly , to the policies of the Soviet 's " Man of Steel , " Josef Vissarionovich Stalin , subtle Comrade Rykov also hopes soon to give Russian citizens the right of private trading under conditions similar to those already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
