It has long been known that Edward S. Jordan , President of Jordan Motors , writes his company 's advertisements . Unlike many another captain of industry , he can scan The Saturday Evening Post and glow with a feeling of authorship . Against his occasional detractors he launches the modest battle cry : " I do n't think much of Jordan advertising myself , but I love to write it . It 's the only fun I have . " <P> Sneer the intelligensia , George Jean Nathanwise : " If Mr. Jordan were a baker , would he varnish his own pretzels ? " Opine rival auto advertising writers : " He deserves most of the credit for tapping a new source of auto advertising appeal-the ' red blooded youth ' racket . " <P> A specimen : " It the Jordan ' Playboy ' Roadster is a wonderful companion for a wonderful girl and a wonderful boy . . . . It 's a shame to call it a roadster . . . . This brawny thing with the vigor of boyhood and morning ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month 's Printer 's Ink Monthly : <P> " Of course the best piece of copy ever written for an automobile was written for the Cadillac and it was entitled ' The Penalty of Leadership . ' <P> " That was the best piece that I ever saw from the standpoint of real copy . The Cadillac is good enough in quality , reputation and character to sustain it . <P> " Of course the most convincing advertisement of an entirely different character is the Roll Call of The White Company , published about once a year . <P> " If any man is thinking of buying a truck and he reads that advertisement listing the hundreds of concerns using from ten to two thousand White trucks , he certainly can not help reaching the conviction that there must be something behind the White truck . It spells service . "
