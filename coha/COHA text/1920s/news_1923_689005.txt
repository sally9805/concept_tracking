txt There are two times when Washington correspondents and other writers on politics are roused to intense activity . One is when there is a great deal of exciting news . The other is When there is n't any . The fewer and slighter the actual events , the . fuller the streams of invention . Hot weather and dull times in the political world seem to . have a remarkably stimulating effect upon the oracles of'parties and the prophets of coming changes . More amusement than instruction is to be got out of their efforts , but some of the latter are worth noting . Much credit is due to those alert Minds that produced the story about ex-President WiLsorc having sent a letter and " a large contribution " to the Democratic National Committee . This opens a fthe line of speculation and rumor . What was the nature or the letter ? Did it lay down the true policy for the party ? Why did Chairman HULL " suppress " it ? He cruelly denies that any such letter was ever received . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large contribution . To assert or to imply that the Democratic Committee suppressed ' or , refused an offer of money , is to tax human credulity even when the high thermometer makes one ready to believe anything . Plainly , this discussion must - go on , unless something more piquant turns up . Spekiez of Democratic , politics , notice . must be taken of the way in which our neighbor The World is amusing itself by trying to bring the Democratic National Convention to this city next year . If there ever was a shadowy chance that it might come here , - that has been killed by Governor Smrrn 's signing of the bill repealing State enforcement of prohibition . Democratic committeemen would ? shudder at the thought of exposing their party to the New York taint . They would no more think of selecting this city for their convention than they would of taking it to Tombstone . Uf course , The World knows this , and every politician knows it , but so long as there is a dearth of interesting political topics there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion for solemn interviews and grave predictions . In the hot-weather list of passing political fancies a prominent place must be given to Mr. ? HENRY FORD and the Presidency . Immense importance is attached to the fact that his name leads all the rest in a " poll " that is being taken direct from producer to consumer . And Mr. HEARST , who has taken a hand in the pleasant little game of electing Mr. FORD President , can not refrain from adding his bit to the gayety by announcing his views from Mexico City . He is still persuaded that Mr. FORD is too good a man for either of the great parties to accept , and that there is no hope for him  - -  except as the head of an independent party . To make the humor of the thing complete , Mr. HEARST adds : " As to his fitness , that is another question for another time . " It would be hard for even the most heated political imagination to beat that .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
