Lowering darkly , Leonor Fresnel Loree quit the Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan last week , leaving behind him in a meeting room Presidents William Wallace Atterbury of the Pennsylvania , Patrick Edward Crowley of the New York Central , Daniel Willard of the Baltimore &; Ohio and John J. Bernet of the Erie , together with M. J. &; O. P. Van Sweringen of the Chesapeake &; Ohio ( old Nickel Plate ) group . They all , with the aid of lesser officials who were also present , had been discussing the consolidation of the railroads that operate between the Atlantic and the Mississippi , and north of the Ohio-the Eastern roads . For four years there have been such discussions and since last October Mr. Loree has been taking part in them . <P> Mr. Loree has objected to the four system railroad plan of the others , fearing that the interests of his railroads ( Delaware &; Hudson , Wabash ) would be harmed . Therefore he proposed to arrange certain small eastern roads into a fifth system , and so astute a railroad financier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Mr. Atterbury became his ally . Last week Mr. Atterbury , who presided at the executive meeting in the Pennsylvania Station , announced that certain compromises agreed to by the N. Y. C. , B. &; O. and C. &; O. sufficiently protected the Pennsylvania 's interests , that Mr. Loree 's interests would not be jeopardized by the four systems , and that he was withdrawing Pennsylvania support from Mr. Loree 's fifth system project . <P> So Mr. Loree quit the meeting , his eyes coldly furious and Mr. Atterbury ordered the excellent lunch , prepared by Pennsylvania chefs , to be served his conferees who by eating at his board became his guests .
