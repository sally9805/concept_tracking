txt L. T. V. L. , Anaconda Copper Mining company , Chicago ? I am strongly in favor of both professional and amateur boxing . When I was a boy I was determined to become another Corbett , or Jeffries , 9r Bat Nelson , and nothing I could induce me to drink liquor or to smoke , and I trained religiously all the time , or at least as much as I could . I lived a clean life simply because I believed that I never could become a fighter unless I did . Many times I had the whisky bottle and the cigaret offered me ; but not for me ? I was going to be a fighter when I grew up . As a matter of fact , a could n't lick the average kid ; I simply was n't born a fighter . By the time I was 21 years old , however , I had the benefit of many years of clean life . Nov I have a boy 13 years old , and I have taught him to box and that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrectly , he can never in a good fighter . It is n't born bon him to be a bruiser , but if I can make him believe for the next seven years that he can be a better man , I have given him the best thing in the world  --  a good healthy constitution . Personally I think prize fighters perform a real service to the young boys of the country . Nearly every kid has an idol , and nine times out of ten the idol is a fighter . I wish there were some good boxing bouts where smoking was prohibited , so that I could take my boy to see some of them . - 4. - R. P. CAMERON , 1414 North Robey street ? I have read your intention of promoting a boxing tournament , and note that various people are protesting against it . I believe in anything that is conducive to bringing out the better qualities in our young manhood , especially their fighting qualities , the kind that made " Fritz " holler " Kamerad . " My opinion of these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that they are interested only in the salary they are drawing in the cause of alleged morality , or they are the kind that believes in " turning the other cheek . " They would be nice people to be called upon to protect this country in case of trouble . I am ' a constant reader of Tim TRIBUNE and admire its independence in this as in many other matters that the conscientious objectors are hollering against . These same people were against our defending ourselves against the Germans , and they have to be fought the same as we fought the Germans . II . L. CARPENTER , Maley , Carpenter &; Co. , Union stockyards ? I am glad to take advantage of your , request to your readers to . express themselves regarding the holding of your athletic boxing exhibitions . I want to say that I am NOT in favor of them . I also ' want to register my protest against the stand of THE TRIBUNE for beer and wine . I have re ... d THE TRIBUNE for forty-four years and do hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indorsing and upholding our laws is cause enough to quit reading TEE TRIBUNE and turning to some other paper with better principles . A. G. FEGERT , publicity counselor , .618 Sherman street=Your publihing the law on Illinois on the subject of prize fighting and boxing is a good idea . Keep on publishing it all through the discussion , so that all readers may know it . Then urge that the law be obeyed because it is the LAW . We , as Americans , recognize the law as supreme ? at least , the lawabiding citizens do . Let the officials enforce the law because it is the law . If the law is not what it should be , then change it in accordance with the provisions of ' the law . But , while it is the LAW , observ'e it and enforce it . think THE TRIBUNE is doing a great thing . Boxing is a great sport and , so far as I can see , - does not - break the law .. The late President Roosevelt was one of the greatest champions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gloves himself . Can this self-appointed reformer dare compare himself with our late President ? By what right has Arthur Burrage Farwell authority to tell me or you what we can do and what we can not do ? I always thought this was a free country , but when this reformer is allowed to meddle with people 's affairs it is going too far . The trouble with us in this country is that we stand for his kind .. , Now . Tim TRIBUNE always has stood for the people 's rights , and I hope it stays in this fight to the finish and puts these meddlesome reformers out of business ; and if they are put out of business you will see the law more respected and the people as a whole more happy and contented .
