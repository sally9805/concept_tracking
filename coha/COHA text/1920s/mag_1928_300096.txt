The British Admiralty chose last week as the time to announce that it has let a 7,750,000 ( $37,665,000 ) contract for the completion of the British naval war base at Singapore to the firm of Sir John Jackson , Ltd. , of London . <P> The great Singapore Base will be a direct threat to Japan and the Philippine Islands . To announce it last week , when the British Foreign Office was dickering with the U. S. about disarmament ( see International ) , seemed a piece of sheer British Sea Dog bravado .
