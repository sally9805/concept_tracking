txt With I the end of the investigation of the Fall-Sinclair jury tampering charges in sight , Assistant District Attorney Neil Burkinshaw today informed William J. Burns and his son , W. William J. Burns and his two sons , W. Sherman Burns and W. Raymond Burrs , that so far as the case of the Government was concerned there existed no occasion for their reap- ) pearance before the Grand Jury . However , he said , if Mr. Burns and his son had evidence pertinent to the inquiry they would be permitted to testify , but , he added , " you will not be permitted to use the Grand Jury room as a forum in which to make a speech to the jury . " Later Burns and his two sons went direct to District Attorney Peyton Gordon , and after an hour 's conference it was understood that the Burnses would be heard by the jury tomorrow . One week ago , on emerging from the Grand Jury room , Mr. Burns called on the press representatives to gather about him as he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reiterated the charge that his agents had detected the Government itself in the act of tampering with a Fall-Sinclair juryman. and that his skirts and those of his agents were clean . Today he emerged not from the Grand Jury room , but from the office of District Attorney Peyton Gordon . In a voice which only those close to him could hear he said he had no statement to make . He indicated that he would go before the Grand Jury tomorrow morning . That was all . It was said , later , that what Burns put before the District Attorney did not involve the credibility of William J. Melfullin , " Agent L-36 " of the Burns jury-shadowing and investigating organization , the man who , as " William V. Long , " signed the affidavit which sought to fix the stigma of jury fixing at the doors of the Federal Government itself . This is the affidavit , now in possession of the Government , which swears is a wilful fabrication from start to finish , drawn up at the instance of and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M'Mullin Brings " Mystery Witness .

His story , it was declared , had not been shaken in a single ' particular , although it was said that he had been the subject of a very thorough investigation , since the disclosure of last Saturday , by Burns agents acting under the direction of Charles G. Ruddy , the " chief shadower " of the Washington jury trailing force . Ruddy , according to the informa1 tion supplied to the District Attorney , was in Philadelphia all day Sunday seeking to get " a line " on the man who , according to Ruddy 's own record , was ordered as " Agent L-36 " to shadow Assistant Attorney General Lamb , and was the alleged " fixer " of the alleged false affidavit which , under the name of Long , signed on Nov. 3 .

It was not denied that he might go before the Grand Jury tomorrow . brought the new " mystery " witness from Philadelphia in his automobile . The young man was in conference with Government counsel for about an hour and then departed in the company of a Government agent under strict orders not to talk . This element of secrecy convinced those in the corridor of the court house that the testimony , which will probably be given tomorrow , is regarded as of the highest importance and very likely will be in the nature of corroborating , possibly augmenting , the testimony of against Burns , his sons and their agents . Telephone Records Introduced . The Grand Jury today was in session for only two hours and was adjourned in order to afford Mr. Gordon and his staff time for important I conferences in which the jury-fixing charges were discussed . In view of the fact that Mr. Gordon expects to end the case before the Grand Jury within the next two or three days , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That they were significant was the consensus in well-1 informed circles . James L. Riddle , credit manager for the Wardman Park Hotel , and John F. Schlotterbeck , who holds a similar position at the Mayflower Hotel , were the principal witnesses before the Grand Jury today . They brought hotel records in which long distance telephone charges were listed . These books , said Mr. Burkinshaw , revealed many interesting items . The Mayflower account of Sinclair , it was explained , showed that a call was put in from Sinclair 's apartment on Oct. 18 , the day the jury was completed , for his own office in New York , the man for whom the call was intended being Harry Jeffries , his private secretary . Jeffries , however , was not reached at the office and a second call to Jeffries 's home in Orange , N. J. , was put in . This time Jeffries was reached , and soon thereafter the order to mobilize for " jury duty " in Washington was issued by Sherman Burns . Both calls were charged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sinclair 's hotel bill for the period of the trial , which was a little more than two weeks , exceeded $6,000 . Calls to Alleged " Liaison " Officials . A study of the telephone calls charged to Ruddy , as disclosed by the Wardman Park records , showed that the " chief shadower " was often in telephonic communication with the Mayflower , where Sinclair had his headquarters . There were also several calls for the home of Donald Woodward , where , according to Mr. Burkinshaw , the " chief shadower " often made contact with Henry Mason Day , Vice President of the Sinclair Exploration Company , and the alleged " liaison " between the Burns agency and Sinclair . Day is now at liberty in $25,000 bail , pending the outcome of the Grand Jury investigation . There was a report that some of Ruddy 's calls were apparently for Sheldon Clark , Vice President of the Sinclair Refining Company , who the Government alleges was also a " contact man " between Sinclair and the jury-trailing detectives . Clark is under $10,000 bail pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burns agents appeared before the Grand Jury today . All of the subordinates were directed to be on hand at 10:30 o'clock tomorrow morning . The Government intends to bring all of the " little fellows " before the Grand Jury and give them one more chance , as a Federal attorney put it , to tell what they know . Tomorrow , he added , will be their last chance .
