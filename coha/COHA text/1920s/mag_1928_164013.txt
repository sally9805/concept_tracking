Giuseppe Adami made a sorry tale out of scraps some twelve years ago , called it La Rondine ( The Swallow ) and gave it to Giacomo Puccini . Puccini , himself light-minded at the time , applied a handful of tunes , spliced them in his own skillful way and the result was a " lyric comedy in three acts " that had an indifferent sort of premiere at Monte Carlo in 1917 . Last week and by courtesy of the Metropolitan Opera Company it was given its first performance in the U. S. <P> The story has not grown in stature since Adami transcribed it , nor has the music . It remains a rather unhappy medium between Camille and Sappho-with the fancy lady in this particular case called Magda , her paunchy patron-Rambaldo , the innocent youth for whom she flies her love-nest-Ruggiero , and for comic relief-a maid , a poet . Unlike Camille &; Sappho the comic relief wins out , Ruggiero 's intentions prove a little too honorable-and the swallow flies back home . Unlike the earlier Puccini scores , the element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duets . Unlike Monte Carlo , the whole was almost reclaimed last week in Manhattan by the altogether pleasant production at the Metropolitan-by the gay , graceful Magda of Lucrezia Bori , by the caricatured poet of Armand Tokatyan , the brilliant Second Empire settings of Joseph Urban . Only Beniamino Gigli stayed out of picture . Squat and pompous he sang beautifully as the love-soaked Ruggiero.
