West Injdies . Last week the Caribbean suddenly became still under a windless sky . Seabirds wheeled inland , crying . Small boats with flapping , empty sails were sculled to harbor . On the Virgin Islands natives took to their homes in the hills , jabbered warnings to each other . Voodoo priests crept about selling charms against death . Everywhere faces looked southeast . <P> Then a low whine of wind sounded across the water , quivered the palm fronds . Far out the sea turned frothy with whitecaps . The sun grew bloodred . The whine of wind became a scream and the sky shrieked . Roofs , bodies and trees were lifted like paper , scattered abroad . Over the shores rose the tortured sea . The sky was dark . <P> Up from the Lesser Antilles had come a hurricane . Its centre moved along slowly , nine or ten miles per hour , but the vast volume of air it sucked went raging by at 130 m. p. h . <P> Porto Rico . The storm 's first major victim was Porto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island has a population of 1,400,000 . It was estimated that at least half of this number were left homeless . Chaos prevented a complete count of the dead , but early reports from nine towns indicated that 263 were known to have perished . In San Juan , the principal city , 300 chattering consumptives were forced into the open . Seventy lepers , the roofs of their colony blown away , were gingerly herded into an administration building . <P> All over the island rich coffee and citrus crops were destroyed . All agriculture suffered . Communication , light and power systems were out of commission . The 600-foot towers at the Navy radio station were toppled . Water service was suspended and the population collected rain water from the heavy showers that fell continuously after the hurricane . The darkened streets were littered with debris . <P> Horace Mann Towner , governor of the island , hurriedly cabled the War Department : " Full relief and reconstruction will probably reach into millions . " Refugees from the rural districts poured into San Juan . Food prices skyrocketed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-soaked turmoil , wrote to the governor . " For 72 hours , " they stated , " more than 300.000 people of this island , to estimate conservatively , have had little or nothing to eat and they will have nothing to eat for at least another week unless immediate and drastic action is taken . . . . Disease and famine are already here . " They urged four relief measures : 1 ) martial law ; 2 ) requisition of all food supplies and materials ; 3 ) coastwise relief for other parts of the island via boats ; 4 ) the drafting of all available manpower for public service . Again Governor Towner cabled . He beseeched all available aid from the Red Cross and other sources . The estimated property damage was $65,000,000
