txt Times have changed since MEDILL MCCORMICK , on vacation , paused long enough in Geneva to cast one Senatorial eye upon the Assembly of the League of Nations and the other upon the dispensers of , newspaper publicity ? A single hour , sufficed for ' that feat . This year , as amused delegates on the floor of the Salle de la 116formation observed , the American " delegation " outnumbers that of any other country in the world . The League Secretariat has been ? " deluged " with requests from Americans for admission to the gallery , all but of which had to be denied . The truth is that in spite of our absence from the floor of the Salle , and also in some measure because of it , interest in the League is keener in the United States than in the countries that are members . The love of mace and of friendly intercourse among nations is one of the strongest of our national instincts , one of the oldest of our political principles . The fact that we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It runs counter to our deeper aspirations and thus keeps alive an interest in the organization even among those who have so loudly proclaimed that it is " dead . " ? Our " representatives " in the gallery include many ardent advocates of world peace and world progress , but there are also many who have been hostile to the League . The rumor that DAVID JAYNE HILL went to Geneva as a listening post for President HARDING has . been denied ; but it is scarcely less significant that he is present in a perNnal capacity  --  and is remaining with both eyes steadily fixed upon the proceedings . What happens in the Assembly is sure to include much that is trivial and perverse . Last year the lost causes ranged from a socialistic proposal that the raw materials of all member nations be pooled to an outburst of pro-Germanism on the part of the Argentine delegation . Much was heard . of -a doctrine of , " the equality of nations " and of a determination to place the Assembly , as the more broadly representative body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant in the Covenant . When nations fail to have their own way , they are not always above sulking , as Argentina is apparently now doing . But in spite of all foible and extravagance the Assembly is a vastly interesting body and is not unlikely to prove , in its own sphere , as powerful for good as the Council . It is a thing the world has never seen before , a forum of mankind  --  at once a safety valve for much superfluous steam and a vehicle for conveying to all nations new and - significant ideas , powerful and beneficent movements . It ? - is an experiment . , but , an experiment along tfie.lin  --  s , Oi . that wider kiieiNledge , ' : &ind; deeper understanding upon which chiefly peace and progress depend . One achievement the Assembly ha : already placed to its credit .
