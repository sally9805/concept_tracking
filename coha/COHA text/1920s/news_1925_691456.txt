txt In his opening address before the . Geneva Conference on the Traffic in Arms Representative BURTON warmly expressed the desire of the people of the United States to aid in all efforts toward world peace , and was able to point to certain definite achievements . The results of the Washington . Arms Conference are , as he said , " known to the world . " He alluded also to our suppression of the sale of arms to Mexican insurgents and to the Hughes agreement with Latin-American countries not to recognize a revolution or coup d ' eta t until it had set up a Government freely elected . As to the draft convention for the regulation of the traffic in arms . he/promised " on a more appropriate occasion " to " offer certain " constructive suggestions and modifi " cations . " All this was enthusiastically received . The cooperation of the United States is. in fact , of fundamental importance . The Saint-Ger- I main convention in 1919 , which our representatives signed . broke down because of the refusal of Secretary HUGHES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make  --  that the traffic in poison gas be " dealt with "  --  and this was not so well received . It was not that the assembled representatives of forty-three nations were hostile in spirit , but only that they foresaw sufficient difficulty in the other problems presented by the draft convention . Extraordinary restraint is , in fact , indispensable if the conference is to avoid the pitfalls that beset the conference on opium . While the nations maintain Leavy armaments , as Mr. BURTON himself admitted , " the trade in arms can not be eliminated . " In order to regulate it effectively , an agreement must be reached ac to what . ? nations are and what are not entitled to import the materials of war . There seems to be general assent that the peoples of the Near East and of Africa . perhaps also of China , should be placed in the " forb , idden zone . " But 1 Abyssinia has plausible reasons for arming against her neighbors ; and other nations , notably Persia , vigor- I ously resist exclusion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An objection which Mr. HUGHES made to the Saint-Germain convention has still a strong appeal . A strict limitation of the traffic in arms might prevent revolutionists whose cause is just from winning freedom . One has only to think of Cuba and indeed of our own men of 1776 . And to all intents and purposes the administration of the convention will proceed from the League of Nations , of which Germany and the United States are not yet members . In- all such enterprises the most dangerous thing is to expect and attempt too much . Viewed in a just perspective , the situation is full of hope . Except for the war and the League to which it gave birth , we should have had no Washington arms conference , no World Court , no protocol , no opium conference , no conference on the traffic in arms . None of them has been a complete and shining success . Yet the progress in our understanding of all such problems has been vast and the actual achievement has been far beyond what any one a brief decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony of fate the nation most opposed to the League has been everywhere a leader . Only good can come from the present conference , and there is hope that it will prove fully successful .
