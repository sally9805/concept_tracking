txt The Interstate Commerce Commission today granted permission to the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway Company to buy control of the Pere Marquette Railway , but denied its application to acquire control of the Erie Railroad . Even the permission for the Pere Marquette consolidation was given ir a grudging manner , and condition : were set up that would force the Van Sweringen interests , which con ? trol the Chesapeake &; Ohio , to sur ? render virtually all thought of profits from stock operations which preceded the merger application , and which , in the opinion of some , may endanger the success of the whole merger proposal . Another important feature of the cornmiEsion 's decision was a refusal on its part to permit the Chesapeake &; Ohio to issue additional stock to obtain money essential to the financing of the merger on a basis which the railroad had thought fair to its shareholders . The railroad 's proposal was to obtain money by the sale of 7:23,024 additional shares of common ' . cock of the Chesapeake &; Ohio , . : . hich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of per cent . of the amount of their . spective holdings . " Shoe-String Finance " Is Hit . Comimssioner Eastman , dissented . um the decision and charged the ' an Sweringen interests with having up dummy corporations " to facili:ate shoe-string financial operations : 1 a very large scale " and to create situation where the financial operations would escape supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission . He also stated that the Nickel Plate , Chesapeake &; Ohio , and Erie , of which are now said to be tinder the control of the Van Sweringen interests , are competing systems . " The common control of these properties , " he added , " should be considered in a Clayton ' act proceeding . " Commissioner Porter concurred in the part of the decision granting au- ' thority for acquisition of the Pere Marquette and believed also that acquisition of the Erie should have been permitted . Chairman Campbell dissented from the finding that the acquisition of the Pere Marquette would be of public advantage , holding that the report was not convincing that such advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Ohio common stock has been selling recently at $197 a share , and the commission considered this basis of distribution too generous . Instead it specified that the railroad might issue not to exceed 200,000 shares to be offered to present holders of common stock at $150 a share , to the extent of one share of additional stock for each six shares of their respective holdings . The joker in the commission 's apparently favorable ruling is that it restricts tho Van Sweringen interests from paying more than $110 per share for additional common stock or $100 a share for prior preference stock of the Pere Marquette , which is necessary to majority control . Common stock of the Pere Marquette was quoted at $140 a share today and prior preference at a shade above $99 . Whether , under such conditions , the Chesapeake &; Ohio , as controlled by the Van Sweringens , can obtain the additional stock on the basis fixed by the commission , even if Van Sweringen interests are willing to turn over to Chesapeake &; Ohio all stock that they own at $110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of considerable f , peculation . Hits Personal Profits .. The commission was even more severe in dealing with holdings of 36,500 Pere Marquette common shares which 0 . P. Van Sweringen , in the application submitted , had offered to turn over to the Chesapeake &; Ohio at $110 a share , a total of $4,015,000 , to which carrying charges were to be added . Mr. Van Swerin- gen appeared in the application as Chairman of the board of the Chesapeake &; Ohio and the commission declared that in its opinion no personal profit should accrue to him . The commission did give the Chesapeake &; Ohio permission to submit a supplemental application for authority to issue additional stock , allowing one year for consummation and providing that the proceeds might be applied to the discharge of its interest-bearing obligations if the applicants found it impossible to make the Pere Marquette purchases on the specified terms . In dealing with the proposal of the Chesapeake &; Ohio to acquire control of the Erie Railroad as well as of the Pere Marquette , the commission declared flatly that it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied . Lines Called Non-Competitive . The application was filed with the commission Feb. 11. 1927 , and was generally referred to by railroad men as the follow-up of the Nickel Plate merger program , which had been rejected . The new proposal differed in that the Nickel Plate , or New York , Chicago &; St. Louis Railroad , was not directly a party of it , despite the fact that the Van Sweringen interests , which own the Nickel Plate , were the dominant figures in the new offer . The plan proposed was an intermediate step toward the unification of the Chesapeake &; Ohio , the Erie and the Pere Marquette and indirectly involved the Hocking Valley , which is owned by the Chesapeake &; Ohio . The contention of the applicants was that the lines were not competitive , and that great savings in operation would result . The Van Sweringen interests organized the Virginia Transportation Company , which acted as a holding company for them in the acquisition of shares necessary to stock control of the Erie and Pere Marquette . In the application it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie first preferred , 50,495 shares of second preferred and 357 of common at a cost of $22,541,596 . Estimates Cost at $65,000,000 . The Chesapeake &; Ohio also had under option from 0 . P. Van Sweringen 345,000 shares of Erie common , 22,305 of second preferred and 28 , - 895 of first preferred , at a cost of $13,973,597 , and had been authorized to purchase , at the same price as quoted by Van Sweringen , namely 34.50 for common , $43,75 for second preferred and $45.87 for first preferred , another 134,900 shares of the stocks , the owner of which was not identified . Altogether it was proposed to get 1,071,339 shares of the Erie stock , or 60,7 per cent . of the voting total , for $42,042,573 . In considering the status of the Erie shares at this time the commission expressed the belief that it probably would cost in excess of $65 , - 000,000 to gain control . The application also quoted as available under Options , some of which have expired , $34,332,297 in Pere Marquette stock . The commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now because of the advance in the market value , and that in any event it represented but 40.5 per cent . of the stock outstanding . Actually , It stated , the applicant road was able to show control of but 53,100 shares of the stock , or 7.7 per cent . of the total . The commission , although stating that no specific objection had been offered against the merger , said that nevertheless the proposal anticipated at least in part a fourth Eastern trunk line , although the principle involved had not been approved . It continued : " Although it may be said that the control would not necessarily be permanent , there is no exigency in the affairs of either the Chesapeake &; Ohio- or the Erie which requires action at this time . " " We were asked by the minority committee , " the commission added , " to deny these applications on the ground that the proposal is a great speculative enterprise rather than a transportation development . We are also requested to take into consideration the managerial policy of the applicant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of merger schemes thereon . In dealing With all these questions we must confine ourselves to the essential requirements imposd by the act . Not in Commission 's Province . " Management per se does not come within our province . The evidence showing personal and corporation profits , use of company credit and control , and factors of similar character has received attention in the degree which these matters have a bearing upon the public interest in the plan immediately before us . Not all of the transactions leading to the proposed acquisition of control may be accepted as necessary , or as justified by the results to be attained , nor can they be rectified by conditions attached to our order . " The operations of subsidiary companies , notably the special investment corporation organized by the Nickel Plate and the Virginia Transportation Corporation by the Chesapeake &; Ohio , which , in effect , pledge carrier assets and incur obligations for the carrier , are of a nature to raise grave doubts as to their legality . " Financial manipulation of great railroad properties as an accompaniment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerated . Unification of existing lines should have its inception primarily in the traffic and transportation conditions of the territory served . If the regulation of railroads , with especial reference to their unification and capitalization , can be effectively and justly administered under the acts passed by Congress for that purpose , these projects should be so controlled and governed as to be made productive of large benefits in transportation . " In summing up its findings in regard to acquisition of the Pere Marquette the commission said : " The applicant to issue not to exceed 200,000 shares of its common stock for the purpose of providing funds to ( 1 ) discharge the indebtedness upon , and acquire , 16,600 shares of Pere Marquette stocks of three classes now held by the Virginia Transportation Corporation ; ( 2 ) acquire 36,500 shares of Pere Marquette common stock from the Van Ness Company at the cost of such stock to that company , namely , $2,522,881 ; and ( 3 ) acquire such ' other shares of Pere Marquette com mon stock as may be obtainable at a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference or preferred stock as may be obtainable at a price not to exceed $100 per snare . The expenditure of the proceeds under these terms will not acquire a majority stock interest in the Pere Marquette , but the applicant may , if found necessary , submit a supplemental application for authority to issue additional stock for that purpose . " Eastman Attacks Proposals . Commissioner Eastman 's dissent was a bitter arraignment of the Van Sweringen interests for their financial operations . " Aside from any direct and immediate transportation effect , " he said , " will public benefit be derived from placing this road in the hands of the interests which now dominate the Nickel Plate and Chesapeake &; Ohio . The policies and practices of these interests in many important respects have not been such as to insure public confidence and were the occasion of sharp criticism in the Nickel Plate unification case . " The activities of these interests , he said , were first aided by the New York Central and have since been carried on with the help of the New York Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plate and the ' Chesapeake &; Ohio as the cornerstone of the structure to the great personal profit of individual directors of those carriers . " The credit of the railroad companies , he charged , had been diverted " to the ends of speculation and private profit . " " The unifications which this method is likely to accomplish , " Mr. Eastman added , " are those which offer the greatest opportunity for speculative profit , rather than those which offer the greatest opportunity for transportation advantage . " Market Anticipated Decision . The action of the stocks involved in the Van Sweringen merger on the Stock Exchange yesterday indicated that Wall Street interests were prepared for the announcement of the Interstate Commerce Commission . Erie stock remained practically unchanged , but stock of the Chesapeake &; Ohio and Pere Marquette advanced sharply . Reports that the Commission would rule the Erie out of the merger had been coming out of Washington for a week . More than a year ago it was disclosed in THE New Timm TIMES that the Van Sweringens were considering the possibility of leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan as submitted called for inclusion of the Erie . Pere Marquette stock advanced 6 points to its previous high of 146 on a turnover of more than 8,000 shares . Nickel Plate stock , indirectly affected by the ruling , touched 148% and closed at 14014 for a net gain of 1% points on a like turnover . Erie closed % firmer at 583$ on a turnover of 9,000 shares . Apparently the adverse features of the commission 's report had a dampening effect on the movements of these stocks , for their supporters have predicted even better levels for them . The fact that the commission had made the report was not officially announced until after the close a the market . Its full effect on stocks will therefore not be seen until the market opens ' today . The previous ruling of the commission on the merger caused many sharp declines in railroad stocko. ,
