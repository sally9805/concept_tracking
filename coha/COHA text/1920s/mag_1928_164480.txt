The role of reigning queens though splendorous is indefinite . Their duty to the State may be irreproachably discharged by mere male bearing. * Even more nebulous is the aggregate contribution to statecraft of the wives of Premiers , Ministers and Opposition leaders . They are too numerous to be counted , and too much at cross purposes to be broadly significant . But today a new class of august women loom as worthy of inspection . They are the Consorts of the world 's six major Dictators . Theirs is the simplified problem and the dazzling opportunity of swaying a nation by persuading , cajoling or nagging at one man . <P> Senorita Mercedes Castellanos achieved politest world renown ( TIME , April 23 ) when it was announced at Madrid that she , an orphan &; a spinster of 47 , would shortly be taken to wife by the Dictator of Spain , General Don Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja , Marquis de Estella , 58 . <P> Last week Senorita Castellanos became an even more piquant and challenging figure . In highest Spanish circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next September , is about to take place secretly in Madrid . That the Dictator-Bridegroom can compel the Spanish press to keep his most obvious secrets was shown , last week , when he suppressed for three days a newspaper at smart San Sebastian which had dared to print a photograph revealing that the calves &; ankles of Senorita Mercedes Castellanos are chunky and unslender-as are those of Queen Thuraya of Afghanistan ( see Afghanistan ) . <P> Whatever the date of Dictator Primo de Rivera 's wedding , Spaniards are relieved that he has chosen definitely , at last , among the too many ladies who have sought through him to sway the course of Spain . There was , for example , very recently , the Marquise de Arguelles . Perhaps it is well that her somewhat sinister influence will be supplanted by that of the Orphan &; Spinster-who is one of the richest women in Spain , and accounted sage with the wisdom that comes from managing large monetary affairs . <P> Not since Dictators came recently into fashion has one married . Therefore the nuptials of Primo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of alert , contemplative minds upon what manner of women are now deemed fit to be Dictators ' wives : <P> Rachele Guidi Mussolini once served as a lusty taproom wench at the rustic inn of good Papa Allesandro Mussolini , sire of Benito . Wise Papa Allesandro warned the wench against his son . " Do not let yourself think of that young man , " he is said to have said , " It would be better to throw yourself under a train . Married to him you will have neither happiness nor peace . " <P> Precisely when and how Rachele Guidi and Benito Mussolini were married is still a topic for active speculation . A delayed civil marriage appears to have been followed by a still further delayed religious ceremony . But the union was fruitful from the first . Daughter Edda Mussolini is now 17 , son Vittorio , 11 , son Bruno 10 , and Babe Romano Mussolini is aged six months .
