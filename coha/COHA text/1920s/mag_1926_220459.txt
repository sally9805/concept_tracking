The sunny , glamorous South , home of hominy , " ' taters , " " ok'ry , " gumbo , mint juleps , has many lures for the motor tourist , but July and August have never been the conventional months for visiting it . <P> Nevertheless , two perfectly normal gentlemen , seldom known to do the exotic , started off last week on a Southern automobile trip .

Longworth and Slemp have decided that the President is out of the 1928 race , and they ( Mr. Longworth as principal , Mr. Slemp as impressario ) are in it . True ?       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
