Last week , Postmaster General Harry S. New gave out the data for Post Office receipts in June . The reason they are of any special interest is because , early last spring , after a great fight , Congress passed a bill which increased the salaries of postal employes ( to the tune of about ' $68,000,000 a year ) and increased revenues in a way to furnish an equal amount of additional revenue ( TIME , Mar. 9 ) . <P> Said Mr. New ; <P> " Although the receipts of the 50 selected post offices for the month of June , 1925 , show an increase of 14.72% over June , 1924 , and those of industrial cities , with 16.45% , show even a better average , it is fair to state that June , 1924 , with which the comparison was made , was a very poor month , and showed a loss of 1.17% in receipts of June , 1923 . In contemplating the increase , this fact must be taken into consideration , as well as the further fact that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day than in June , 1924 . <P> " Of course , any estimate based on these figures as to how nearly the postal receipts will balance expenditures for the current year is the merest guess . But the figures quoted would indicate a deficit of something like $40,000,000 , which is due , of course , to the legislation passed by the last Congress affecting both pay and rates . " <P> If Mr. New 's merest guess proves correct , Congress made a grievous miscalculation . <P> In the year which ended June 30 , 1924 , the Post Office ran a deficit of $12,000,000 . The annual deficit had been decreasing since the War . When Congress passed the pay and rate increase measure last spring , there was a prospect of a $3,000,000 surplus this June . Because of the new law ( pay was made retroactive to Jan. 1 and increased rates did not begin until April ) , the Post Office showed a deficit at the end of the year ( June 30 ) . The deficit , not yet calculated , is estimated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that next June 30 will show a deficit of $40,000,000 . If so , it means that the Treasury 's estimated surplus of $290,000,000 next June must be reduced to $250,000,000 . It means , also , that there will be more squabbles and more tinkering with postal rates and that , if any change is made , the rates will probably be revised upward .
