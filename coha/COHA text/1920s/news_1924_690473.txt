txt Local sales of pig iron last week were close to 25,000 tons against 15.000 tons the week before . Pending open inquiry totals 0.000 tons . Some of the product was for fourth quarter shipment , but the larger portion was designated for delivery within the next 30 to 60 days . Prices are unchanged at base of SIP Buffalo and 520 eastern Pennsylvania . Higher silicon grades , however , are 50 cent , to $1 a ton higher in Buffalo . For the past several months producers have paid little attention to silicon differentials , quoting all grades on an equal basis . But with most of the merchant furnaces out , the supply of high silicon content iron has dwindled considerably , as the steel units producing iron make practically all low silicon grade . In consequence there is a growing scarcity of high silicon iron and indications point to better prices in the near future . Producers expect this strength to be reflected in prices of all grades of pig iron .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
