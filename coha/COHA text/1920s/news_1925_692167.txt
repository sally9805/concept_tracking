txt The schools today may be better or worse than they were a generation ago , but anyhow ' are different . Thepublic school both reflects and measures the public interest in the maintenance of American ideals . Good citizenship and patriotism have , of course , been in the past dependent upon sound education ; but what is new is that ? they have become the " dominant aim . " This is not so distinctly announced , says Dr. RUSSELL , by the , thousands of school boards as by the Prussian Kultusminster , although the varied utterance of these boards is noisier . He might have added that it is not so distinct as that/of the Russian Commissar of Education , butsthat it is as determined . Behind these school boards is public opinion ; which " . fixes " our educational creed and controls " all our undertakings . " Any other control " is inconceivable while we " maintain our present ideals of " American democracy . " In the light of such an authoritative view , the Tennessee case certainly has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Oregon case involves the whole question of freedom of learning , as the Tennessee case involves the freedom of teaching . The legislation which gave rise to both of these cases is but an illustration of the general tendency to shape conduct by legal enactment and to use the school as a convenient means of reaching a whole generation . We learned during the war that one subject , German , could be eliminated from the public school curriculum , a -- d it has been demonstrated that subjects can be introduced through the interest and influence of homogeneous , persistent groups . Dean RussELL 's hope is that they may neutralize one another and the teacher thus be given a chance to work out his own salvation . But the teacher must have help from those who have means and freedom to study the new conditions under the new aims , and first of all be able to answer the questions : " What is d. good citizen ? " " What should he know ? " and " By what course is " he to come into the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean RUSSELL has to make is that we I must fall back on the method of " trial and error . " But he has , at any rate , ' made us see what our greatest educational problem is . A NOTEWORTHY REPORT-Dean JAMES'B . RUSSELL of Teachers College , in a report of six or seven pages , has made a real contribution to the literature on public education . It should be in the hands of school boards and school teachers the country over , because it clearly defines their office ? and function under the new dispensation of democracy . It presents no new program , but urges the importance of bestirring ourselves to determine what the content and method of that program should be , in view / of the change which has come over the purposes and studies of our . public school as an institution and agency of democracy . The key statement is that " for the " first time in , history social democ " racy is attempting to shape the " opinion and bias the judgment of " oncoming generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training .
