Brick masons at East Chicago , Ind. , slashed at mortar with their trowels last week , plumped bricks down to form the stringer courses of a 500-foot surface tunnel ; pipe fitters twirled threads onto gas lines with their tap- &-die; threader ; freight gondolas dumped clay and ganister-Harbison-Walker , $36,000,000 brickmaking corporation , was having constructed a new type of kiln to burn silica brick . Corporation President J. E. Lewis had heard of the kiln operating at Dusseldorf , Germany , and after a talk with his Board Chairman H. W. Croft in their Pittsburgh offices had hurried to Dusseldorf to see the kiln in action . He liked it ; secured the U. S. rights to its use ; immediately had mechanics awork at East Chicago . <P> The ordinary way of making bricks is to press a mixture of clay , sand and water into forms . Usual size is close to 21 x 4 x 8 in . Such blocks are dried in the air or in a warm draft . Then they are stacked in a hemispherical kiln usually 30 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of kilns looks quite like a group of dirty red igloos . Their orifices are plugged up and a fire lit under a stout grating upon which the raw bricks are piled . In six to ten days they are burned hard and useful . Their red color is the result of iron in the clay and sand . White bricks come of lime added to a specially prepared clay . Various minerals added to the base clay give " tapestry " bricks . <P> This fashion of making bricks has great wastage . In the kiln heat a great portion of the bricks warp and curl . Some can be sold for seconds and used in the hidden supporting walls of low grade apartment houses . Most , however , must be crushed and used as road-making filler . <P> Harbison-Walker in shaping their bricks squeeze their clay or ganister mixture into a long greyish bar which , as it crawls out the mold , resembles a creeping crocodile . A slicer armed with steel wires cuts the firm bar into separate bricks just as a string cuts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks are to be placed on small cars and slowly passed through the 500-foot tunnel kiln which Harbison-Walker 's President Lewis is having built at East Chicago . In passage they will endure a heat of 2,700 Fahrenheit . ( Temperature of boiling water is 212 F. ) Spoilage of bricks is expected to be trivial .
