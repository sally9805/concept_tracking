txt Cuts of $500,000,000 in present taxes were pledged by Democrats of the Senate Finance Committee tonight in a program whereby they seek to increase the tax reduction of $325,736,000 already provided in the revenue bill which is to be reported by Thursday . Principal among the three planks of the Democratic platform is the pro . posed addition of $44,000,000 to the $98,575,000 cut in surtaxes promised in the House bill . If this $44,000,000 is applied to a : further lowering of surtaxes on incomes between $22,000 and $100,000 , the Democrats bind themselves to abide by the 20 per cent . surtax maximum on incomes of $100,000 and upward now in the bill . The second plank of the Democratic tax platform contemplates the repeal of the $1 tax on each $1,000 of corporation capital stock , involving a. tax cut of $93,500,000 . A third proposes to abolish the 10 per cent . tax on admisslop tickets and club dues , a combined source of revenue to the Government of $33,000,000 last year . . Normal Rates Approved .. The normal rates and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House bill are accepted by the Democrats . To supply revenue to meet the added reductions of $170,000,000 , the Democrats demand that Secretary Mellon refrain from paying on the public debt the $175,000,000 expected from Great - Britain and other foreign nations in the current year and pay this , instead , into the sinking ' fund , thus releasing that amount for tax reduction . Under this program , the Democrats contend , the public debt could be retired in thirty-two years , as contrasted with the Administration plan for settling it in twenty-five years and the former Democratic proposal for doing it in sixty-two years . The Democratic Program . A statement of the Democratic program was given by Senator Simmons of North Carolina , ranking minority member of the Finance Committee , tonight , as follows : The reductions in taxes proposed by the minority members of the Finance Committee will amount to al ) . proximately $500,000,000 and are as follows : First , we propose reduction in income taxes of $44,000,000 in excess of those provided in the House bill . We accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates provided in the House bill upon incomes up to and including $22,000 . But we do not accept the surtax rates in the House bill on incomes between $22,000 and $100,000 and propose with respect to these incomes to so adjust the brackets in the House bill as to provide for a reduction in the surtaxes of the incomes within these brackets of $44,000,000 . If this readjustment  --  in the interest of equalizing reductions made on incomes in excess of $22,000 ? is accepted by the committee or the Senate , the minority will accept the maximum surtax rate of 20 per cent. , as prescribed in the House bill . Average Reductions Specified . The average reduction made in the House bill upon incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 is 25 per cent. ; upon incomes between $20,000 and $100,000 is 9 per cent. , and upon the income in excess of $100,000 is 50 per cent . Second , the repeal of the capital stock tax upon corporations . This tax is peculiarly discriminatory against the weaker corporations , and in addition is distinctively a nuisance tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues . The basic question for consideration in connection with tax reduction relates to the amount of money which should be raised by Federal taxation annually for the purpose of reducing the indebtedness of the Government . Under the present law all moneys in the Treasury not specifically made applicable to some other purpose are applied to the reduction of the indebtedness . Under the bill as it comes from the House it is proposed to reduce taxation to the extent of about $325,000 , . 000 . If such reduction occurs , the amount applicable to payments upon the public indebtedness will be reduced by that amount . Necessarily , therefore , we are called upon to consider primarily the amount of revenue which should be raised for the purpose of the reduction of the public debt . Under existing la , F , provision is made for a cumulative sinking fund . In round numbers there is applied to the sinking fund from current Treasury receipts each year $253,000 , - 000 and interest at an average of approximately 4 per cent . upon all accumulated investments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately $20,400 , - 000,000 . If this sinking lurid is main-tained , as contemplated by the present law , it will liquidate the entire principal of the indebtedness of the country whether represented by bonds , certificates or other obligations in not more than thirty-two years . The minority believes that this sinking fund requirement , together with the interest charges imposes annually upon the taxpayers of the country all the burden which should be borne by them in order to pay off the indebtedness . Under the present law the $253,000. - 000 annually set apart as a sluicing fund is raised by ' taxation and used for the retirement of our indebtedness and in addition to that , the amount annually received ( estimated for this year at more than $175,000 , - 000 ) from our foreign debtors , is likewise applied to the retirement of our indebtedness . The minority propose to apply to this sinking fund all receipts from foreign Governments arising on account of their indebtedness , thereby reducing to the extent of these foreign payments the amount . to be raised by taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government to pay off its entire indebtedness within thirty-two years and make provision at the present time for tax reduction of more than $500,000,000 per annum , instead of the reduction of $325,000,000 as proposed by the bill as it comes from the House . The statement is silent regarding changes in the Senate of automobile and certain other taxes , but either concerted or independent action by Democrats may be expected on these . Will Deal Later With Other Taxes . Senator Simmons declared that his statement only represented " the attitude of the minority on things in the bill with which the statement deals ; and other important matters in the bill are left to be dealt with as they are reach Readju - ment of the middle " brackets " of the surtax rates is a mandatory principle with some Democrats . In , the House Representative Rainey of Illinois criticized Representative Garner . the Democratic leader , severely on the ground that surtaxes on incomes between $11,000 and $44,000 were left unchanged from the 1924 rates , and that although the men with these incomes constituted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bill . The Simmons plan is a variation of the Rainey contention because it includes a different range of rates , but it is directed toward the same end . Failure by the Democrats to mention the estate tax rates excited curiosity tonight . In some quarters the theory was advanced that though ordinarily standing for high rates on inheritances they were now much embarrassed by the insistence of their States that the Government quit the estate tax field altogether . If this embarrassment exists , it may influence Finance Committee Democrats to yield when Senator Smoot moves to repeal the Federal tax , as he said yesterday he . would . Abandonment of this tax would mean difficulty in raising revenue to offset , at least in part , the loss of $110,000,000 revenue expected from this source in 1926 . Problem In Dropping Estate Levy . ? - Senator Smoot acknowledged that he . would be faced with a serious problem should total tax reduction reach $436 , - 000,000 through loss of the estate tax , but pointed out that the revenue bill is founded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss would not average anything near $110,000,000 annually , . particularly as receipts from . the estate tax are expected to drop sharply in 1927 . During the House debate , Chairman Green of the Ways and Means Committee said that under the 80 per cent . credit plan the Federal Government 's part of the estate tax would not eventually be more than $30,000,000 to $40 , - 000,000 . Senator Smoot , however , will not consent to total loss of the revenue derived from estate taxes and , if estate taxes are dropped , . will seek to find another method of making up some of the loss . Democratic Senators have talked considerably lately about substituting a graduated corporation tax , a project of Senator Jones of New Mexico , for the existing flat tax of 121,5 per cent . Omission of this suggestion from the Democratic program led to the conclusion that the minority thinks removal of the capital stock tax is all that is necessary to be done for the corporations . Highly complicated as it is , the Jones plan is understood by comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its placing of the tax burden . For these reasons it has never gained much headway , despite its author 's earnest efforts . The silence of the Democratic statement on publicity of income tax payments confirmed Friday 's declaration by Senator Simmons that this subject would not be a party principle but left to the judgment of individual Senators . Each day the prospect of defeat for this provision of the law grows stronger . Senator Simmons said he would submit his tax plan to the full committee by sections and as the opportunity offers .
