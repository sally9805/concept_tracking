T HE tide has turned ; books that " every child should know " went out on the last tide , too waterlogged to float back . The boy no longer has to read Dickens and Dumas " ' cause I seen ' em to the movies . " We can no longer ring the old appeal : " Read this because everyone has read it . " How then may we start the children 's love of reading ? Is it not by stimulating the fancy , encouraging the imagination till it outruns the present and overtakes the past ? Suppose we begin with " The Well in the Wood . " Buddie is a pioneer cousin of Alice , as her Wonderland lies in the Northwest . After straying into the deep woods from her log-cabin home , she chances to put a spray of enchanter 's nightshade in her hair , and the aspect of bird , beast , and forest is suddenly changed . Colonel , the yellow dog , is a companionable guide now that his speech has become intelligible to the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog a show , ' " declared Colonel , making a grand flourish with his right forepaw . " ' Other dogs have shows , but you never hearof a yellow dog show . ' " Of the acquaintances they make in the forest , one of the most amusing is Professor Bray , the donkey traveling with a lute , played by ear , who sings by various methods ( the Donkesi , the Sobrayha , and the Thistlefixu ) , as " the more methods you try , you know , the more of a donkey you are . " The illustrations by F. Y. Cory are quite what Buddie would want them to be . Trudging at fancy 's side we may catch a dim glimpse " Through the Cloud Mountain , " but the cover is prophetic  --  a little figure with a crutch , and a vista of unattainable gardens . Poor fancy would fain borrow the crutch . Many a book for children is bettered by amputating the illustrations , but here the reverse is true : the colored plates by Gertrude Kay have wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of the text . Here is a fairy story strictly union-made , eight hours a day , and time-and-a-half for overtime . Jan the lame boy who was shut outside the enchanted door , what time the Pied Piper whisked the children into the mountain , finds his way alone to storybook land ( called by the author " Land of Eternal " ) , where he is admitted on his own statement that he was created by Robert Browning . Alice-in-Wonderland and Jack -- of-theBeanstalk attach themselves to him as guides . Alice has not improved in manners or disposition by her residence in the clouds . Her imagination stalks in flapping overshoes instead of skipping in her aforetime " ankleties . " Imagine Alice with no further resource , when she goes to a masquerade ball attended by the who 's who of all literature , than to appear as a shredded wheat biscuit ! In spite of this disappointment we turn eagerly to another and very different sequel to the Piper 's mystery . Padraic Colum has caught the real echo of the pipe . " The Children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can expect from that world beyond the mountain . Again we have three children journeying at the heels of the Piper , who now appears in his earlier guise of Mercury . These protagonists are Golden Hood , Valentine , and John Ball the miller 's son , with his talking horse Baldwin . The chorus is made up of Wee Willie Winkie , Jack Sprat , Jumping Joan , Philomena the countess 's daughter , Angelus who rang the church bells , and other well-known natives of Hamelin town . They visit Baucis and Philemon , make the acquaintance of Mars , the Old Hag of the Forest , Circe ( strangely benevolent ) , Satyrs and Nixies in a tapestried confusion of adventure . We miss the simple directness of some of Mr. Colum 's other stories , but his English is as always , exquisite . The poets are abroad on the children 's counter this season . Title-pages bear the names not only of Padraic Colum , but of Sara Teasdale , Margaret Widdemer , and Carl Sandburg . One indignant child , on whom Carl Sandburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no sensible child would so much as look at it . " What shall the intelligent child make of this : " Said Gim me the Ax ' It is a necktie with a picture like whiteface pony spots on green frog swimming in the moonshine ' " ? Perhaps this is funny : " The zizzy is a bug . He runs zigzag on zigzag legs , eats zigzag with zigzag teeth , and spits zigzag with a zigzag tongue . " Or this description of the Musical Soup Eaters : " They whistled and chuzzled and snozzled the soup and the noise they made could be heard far up at the head of the procession where the Spoon Lickers were marching . " There is always room , in the middle-distance of childhood for more fairy stories , more folk-tales , more Arabian Nights . " Solario the Tailor " would seem to be a direct descendant of Scheherazade . His tales are of princesses and blind beggars and one-armed sorcerers , highwaymen and ragpickers , as they should be , and their entertainment is greatly heightened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an inconsequential queen who wishes she had her knitting , and two small boys whose business it is to see that the story-teller gets a chance to finish his stories . " The Islands of Magic " seem to be peopled with folk-tales with European echoes , geographic legends , and churchly superstitions . These tales were gathered in the Azores , in connection with research for the Hispanic Society , and they preserve a quaint local distinction . Though we may be familiar with such adventures as befell the Daughter of the King of Naples , it is unexpected to have a fairy story end thus : " Their wedding was celebrated with great joy and they lived together as God lives with the angels . " St. Anthony appears in the role of Fairy Godmother , and " Death is a good Christian and will keep his word . " The gem of the collection is " Outside the Door Like the Mother of St. Peter . " Maya the Bee comes to us as a person of distinction and apparently expects to be taken seriously . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in these experiences of the adventurous though sentimental young bee , and will find keen pleasure in the behavior of the various insects and creatures who hop or crawl across the pages . Maya is greatly taken with the rosebeetle and his fascinating feelers , but in the wicked dragonfly she sees nothing but the gauzy wings to admire . She begs Miss Loveydear the dragonfly to release her friend the Bluebottle . " Let him go , " cried Maya , and tears came into her eyes , " his name is Jack Christopher . " " Yes , he is a dear little fellow , " the dragonfly replied tenderly and  --  bit Jack 's head off . " Then there is the Tumble Bug who pretends to be a rosebug , and never to have heard of dung ; the butterfly who seems most unappropriately named Fred ; the wicked spider , and the unpopular stinkbug . The barkbeetle gives Maya plain talk . " Ah , bah , do n't take things so seriously . Just laugh when you see something funny ; that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does not even see anything amusing in the grasshopper , who lectures her thus : " Do n't think too highly of yourself , my dear young lady . Most creatures in this world can fly , but only a very , very few can hop . You do n't understand other people 's interests . You have no vision . Even human beings would like a high elegant hop . . .. I have known members of my own family who could hop to a height three hundred times their length . Even the elephant , the largest animal in the world , ca n't hop as high as that . " But Maya 's chief characteristics are an unaccountable admiration for human beings ( this book was written before the war ) and a yearning to serve her nation by some heroic deed . Her melodramatic adventures with the wasps are less fascinating than her earlier encounters in the insect world , and the sentimentality which rises like a mist in the beginning of the story gets to be pretty foggy toward the end . The diction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the young American reader is looking for Americanisms in the animal world he will find them in " The Pussy Cat Princess . " Yet with the most bewitching kittens acting as models to the photographer ( Harry Whittier Frees ) , and with nimble wit and irrepressible humor supplied by the author , the result is disappointing . The kittens appear photographed in various occupations , skipping rope , piloting airplanes , carrying on the war , peddling mice-cream , discovering a mouse in the king 's layer-cake . But cunning as the kittens are , they would be far more so if their fuzzy roundness were not compressed into dolls ' clothes . And their kitten psychology is maltreated . To have such appealing pussycats and puppydogs Babbittized hurts the feelings of the discriminating animal lover . It is strange also that modern warfare can already be made a subject of jest . King Fido makes war on Tabbyland , calling out the troops to defend their country , and his army gathers : the Dachshund Doughboys , the Mexican Hairless Harriers , the Fighting Irish Terriers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puppy Popgunners ( or infantry ) , and the Peekin ' - knees Kilties . Funny , but poor taste . " Bannertail " is an aristocrat among animals . This story of a gray squirrel is told in Thompson Seton 's familiar way , with his inimitable pen-drawings flashing humor on the wide margins . After years of paper famine the spaciousness of this beautiful volume seems to spread as luxuriantly as the squirrel 's plumy tail . Surely of all our wildwood folk the gray-squirrel is the closest friend to childhood , and his story should be widely read . But Bannertail is no portly and pauperized park bencher  --  he is the silver streak that flashes through the forest . The lessons he acquires in youth , his courtship of Silvergrey , his part in and out of the family life , and his encounters with weasel and snake , sickness , famine , and plenty , fill out the measure of his days . Dignity in the telling and fun in the picturing make an excellent combination . Better one such book than scores of the to-bed-going variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one library door is marked GIRLS and the other BOYS , the child element in books is rapidly running out . Stories of this halfway period are rarely notable . " Red-Robin " is , however , an excellent story of a rarely unselfish girl . Mrs. Abbott has the gift of spinning a tale and carrying the reader along without stopovers , and she can portray a very lovely and living young person . " The Flower of Fortune " brings to life again the old Dutch and English days of New Yorke when it had just ceased to be Nieuw Amsterdam . The details of costume and house furnishing , the customs and deportment of the time , the colorful characters  --  pirate , Dutch burgher , English adventurer , Jewish merchant  --  make a rich background for the youthful actors in this exciting book . " The Hill of Adventure " has an outdoor freshness that is wholesome , even if the characters are rather pen-drawn than real . Two young city girls find themselves in the Rockies , in the midst of labor troubles ( which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , family mysteries and she-bears , which enliven their nights and prolong their days . The reader is thankful that no scout ritual is required , and that the courage and presence of mind of Beatrice and her sister are not requited with blue beads . " Including Mother " will find a certain popularity with the high-school girl . To bring up one 's mother , overlooking her indolence , indulging her foibles , controlling her extravagance , admiring her beauty and encouraging her talent , and then to marry her off handsomely  --  what more could the modern daughter desire ? But the story tastes like a magazine ; it was written for quick consumption , and should be labeled " Immediate ? Perishable . " Since most " boys ' books " can not be classed as literary ventures , and have little connection with the dreams of childhood or the realizations of later life , perhaps boys may be left to judge these for themselves . Here is what some lads think of the following newcomers : " The Tides of Deal " is " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no part in the narrative  --  a restful change . It is about a very popular boy , just fresh from high school , who , in his rush for power , went back on his best friend . In the climax , however , this friend is found to be less of an ' angel ' than was supposed , and the hero comes out triumphant in fact , though apparently humiliated . " " Peter Cotterell 's Treasure , " though admitted to be interesting , is yet condemned as " nothing more , nothing less , than thousands of others you may purchase at any bookshop . " Of " The Woods Rider , " a story built about bee-keeping and the turpentine industry , a young reviewer writes : " There is not a real person in the book , and even the element of surprise is wanting , for the characters do almost exactly what you know beforehand they will do . " " The Black Wolf Pack " also fails to thrill , in spite of the mysterious hunter and the pack of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was Young " is acclaimed as " one grand series of gunfights and all of it true . " These experiences , gleaned from conversations with old-time stage drivers , sheriffs , pioneers , from brittle files of the Tombstone Epitaph and other Arizona papers , and various early histories , have the unmistakable stamp of the West as it was . " Blackbeard , Buccaneer " is sure to rank first , among this season 's books , with those boys who love " the creeps . " The volume bleeds at every pore ; the turning of a page means suspense ; swords swash , guns roar , heads crack , blood spurts , fiends curse , masts snap , ships sink , hell yawns ? ( no time for longer words ! ) . " The Boy Jesus and His Companions " is a book to be read aloud in the home . Its simplicity , dignity , and freedom from cant and sentimentality set it apart from most rewritten Bible stories . It is clearly told like running water , and will sound long afterwards in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Child " is rather for mother 's table than for the child 's bookshelf . It is delightful to read of Barbara 's enthusiasm for Shakespeare , and it is easy to see how such a royal playfellow inspired her comrades to follow where she led . Many a parent , on reading this , may find it easier to bring child and poet together . If , instead of regarding Shakespeare as the exclusive property of the adult highbrow , we let children discover him for themselves , before they have heard that they ought to admire him , and before they suspect that he is considered difficult , there would be more Barbaras growing up . The occasional unhindered child even now finds the way into his golden world . A girl of ten , reminded of bedtime before her book was finished , set her alarm for 3 a. m. so that she might " see how Hamlet came out " before schooltime . And a small boy of nine , being taken to his first Shakespeare performance , said " ' As You Like It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Macbeth . ' " But even these children would find " Shakespeare and the Heart of a Child " difficult reading . Too great an intimacy with too many plays is presupposed as a starter ; quotations adrift are so much more confusing than when tied at their moorings . " Buried Cities " is for the child himself . Let us hope that no eager school teacher will spoil this by listing it for required reading . With this little volume ( in its gay Pompeiian jacket ) as a guide , the child digs his way back into the past  --  till Pompeii is revealed . So vivid , so simple and inspiring is this little handbook that the usual tale of treasure-trove pales beside it . Why stoop for a mere iron-bound chest of doubloons when whole cities lie hidden at our feet ? With this in hand we shall have our children sniffing around like the archaeologist in the old French play , whose nose led him straight to Roman remains . To prove that we are not wholly fancy 's slaves , let the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dog Heroes of Many Lands . " Tige , the yellow goatherd who held a mountain lion at bay and saved his bleating herd ; Zip who traveled fifty trackless miles across the snowbarrens of Hudson 's Bay and brought help to the freezing mail carrier ; Jamie Hogg 's collie of the Ettrick Hills who would labor for no other master ; Brakje the Kafir dog who nursed and fed his dark-skinned master lying wounded and delirious in the jungle after killing a lion single-handed , and perhaps finest of all Bruce , the firedog of New York who herded twenty fire-mad horses out of a burning stable in the teeth of a blizzard and held them in safety . They are a noble company , they and their fellows who make up this remarkable collection , and their stories are most fittingly told .

' " Inside the cover Pegasus leaps skyward with his child rider ; the first page opens at " Kubla Khan , " and we know that Pegasus has set the pace . And now for the last of all . If you are threatened with fire , flood , or earthquake , save " Doctor Dolittle " at all cost . He made his appearance with characteristic modesty last year , in " The Story of Dr. Dolittle . " But this particular reviewer must have been blinded with too much reading of serial stories and caught never a glimpse of the kindly naturalist , till " The Voyages of Dr. Dolittle " appeared unheralded and the reviewer war-whooped with joy . The two books are one , each better than the other , depending on which you read last .
