txt There is a tenseness in the political atmosphere of Prance this week-end which no recent crisis has produced . M. Briand 's Government is split within itself , with the Premier and Finance Minister on the one side and the radical members of the Cabinet on the other . Outside the Government the cartel has been more or less reframed On 8. joint financial policy and is trying to impose its policy on the Government . The Senate is with M. Briand and M .. Doumer , but its action can be at best only tardy and corrective . The Senators can not prevent events which seem likely to be Precipitated next week or at the latest next month . In the Chamber lobbies there Is a general whipping up of party spirit and of excitement which augurs ill for M. Doumer and the Government . And in the press there are two currents of opinion , one anxiously appealing for support for the present - Government and the other vaguely advocating abandoning the present parliamentary system and the creation of a committee of public safety with dictatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events which have led to this state of mind have been fully described in these cables within recent weeks . What will happen is so involved by circumstance that prediction is difficult . But today it is clear that the Left cartel of M. Herriot and M. Blum  --  that combination of Radicals and Socialists which was elected in a majority in May , 1924 , and has ever since held power without conferring on country , at least internally , any , great benefits  --  is making a last strong bid to take back the complete direction of affairs and re-form its ranks under its own leaders . Today this re-formed majority has all but completed its financial plan for balancing next year 's budget and providing a sinking fund and will lay it on the table of the Chamber on Monday . It will then be for the Government to accept or give way to another . The plan contains the following principal provisions : A reduction of 500.000,000 francs in the 1926 budget by nation-wide economies ; rigid application of the income tax , with increases as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension of civil rights for all who fail to pay taxes ; a higher tax for foreigners ; a decrease of 30 per cent . in the income tax of salaried persons and of 20 per cent , for those whose incomes are partly salary and partly unearned ; a serious attempt to collect from farmers by imposing taxes after a visit to the farms and inspection of crops ; severe penalties on all commercial and industrial enterprises for tax dodging ; a big increase in the tax collection organization ; increases of taxes on Stock Exchange transactions ; collection of overdue war profits tax ; rewriting of all existing tax laws with a view to increasing their effectiveness . If M. Biland and M. Doumer yield and amend their proposals for meeting next year 's expenditure according to the dictates of these Radicals and Socialists , the Government will be permitted to continue for some more weeks . If M. Doumer refuses to accept dictation on the method by which he roust raise money , then his resignation and almost Inevitably the resignation of the whole Government must follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voting the accommodations for January , which must be passed before the end of the year . Government Lett Distrusted . In itself this regrouping of the majority parties in an agreement on a financial plan would be an excellent matter if the majority had the confidence of the country and could work in harmony with the Senate . But nothing is more obvious than that there is general distrust , throughout the country of a Left Government , based on past performances and especially on criticism of its parliamentary tactics . So much , time has been lost in valn efforts and so many faulty plans and unfruitful discussions have been aired that there is a distinct re ' action against the whole parliamentary system . Tonight the Temps , in veiled fashion , under the title " The Shadow of a Dictatorship , " sketches the possibilities of the situation should M. Steam and M. Doumer fail , and while France is not yet quite there , events may well become precipitate should the present Govern , ment be forced to resign . If there were any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorship might be formed perfectly constitutionally , as it was formed by the old Tiger during the war when he muzzled Parliament and clamped his most dangerous opponents in prison . But there is no one in the public view with his authority and all M. Briand 's skill in parliamentary manipulations seems likely to fail to cope with a majority reformed on a definite program . He has not lost the battle yet , but he is wearying of it . He knows the situation demands stronger measures than he has strength to apply . For him the days are past when he could break a railway strike by mobilization and break a parliamentary combination by the power of his oratory . If he goes , he must make way for M. Herriot and M. Blum again : but not until then , and then only if they repeat their past failure " will this talk of a dictatorship and a Committee of Public Safety have real ' character . Crisis Near Acute Stage . Even its discussion has , however , is : conjunction with the difficulties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a complete new se , : , of plans , caused tension and nervou.sneea which in the Chamber itself are acute ? On Monday , when the Finance Minist ' must face the Finance Commission , or on Tuesday , when he must face the Cabinet . there may be an explosion . The phrase " This situation can not continue " is on every one 's lips and most commonly on the lips of those who are entirely responsible for its creation by their falsification of the position of the country under M. Herriot and M. Clementel , by their dismissal of M. Caillaux at the bidding of a banking group . ant because of their attachment to the financial theory they themselves have not Power to apply and by their failure when they re-formed their ranks under MM . Painleve and Bonnet to keep in agreement . It there does come in this country a revolt against pa rilarnen ta rism the fa ult will lie entirely with this majority , which did not know how to govern .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
