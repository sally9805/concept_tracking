Adolf A. Joffe , one of the greatest exponents of Bolshevik diplomacy , now Russian Minister to Austria , waxed contemptuous of a reported anti-Bolshevik league in the Balkans , hinted at war . warned against verbal sabre-rattlings : " Naturally , this Balkan shouting about the Bolshevist danger arouses great bitterness among the people of the Soviet Union and enhances the difficulties of reaching an understanding between the Soviet Government and the Balkan States . <P> " Moreover , history teaches us that it is dangerous to rattle your weapons even verbally . We have known instances where in a similar atmosphere , and quite unexpected by all parties , rifles and cannon have gone off somehow of their own accord . "
