In Ireland . A company of neat , composed gentlemen disembarked , last week , from a train in Dublin . Hooligans tossing bottle-tops at a seam in the railway platform left off their innocent pastime and conversed in alcoholic whispers . These gentlemen , they had been told , were a crew of mallyvoguelers who could cut the bowels of a man into laces and tie them up again as easy as saying whiskey . They stared as the neat gentlemen-350 U. S. members of the Interstate Post-Graduate Medical Assembly ( TIME , June 15 ) fresh from London-paraded past to their conveyances . <P> In Dublin , next day , the doctors visited the Mater Misericordia Hospital ; saw Surgeons II . F. Moore , J. M. Hayden of Ireland demonstrate the concluding stage of their cure for osteomalacia ; * went on to Belfast , where Queen 's University conferred the degree of Doctor of Laws on Dr. Franklin H. Martin of Chicago , Dr. Hugh Cabot of Ann Arbor , and one surgeon more famed than even these . Then , into a grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister of Northern Ireland , and his Lady , the surgeons from Michigan , Wisconsin , Iowa , Missouri and where-not marched . <P> They felt grateful for their entertainment to the knightly Prime Minister . They felt even more grateful to Dr. William B. Peck of Freeport . Ill , for to him they owed the fact that they were there at all . Some years ago , Dr. Peck organized the Tri-State Medical Association , with members from Illinois , Iowa , Missouri . Once a year , it held a congress in some large U. S. city where the delegates attended medical clinics , were addressed by famed speakers , whose expenses had been paid by Dr. Peck . The Association grew , took in six more states , was finally organized as the Interstate Post-Graduate Medical Association . The present tour is its first public venture . A perspicacious manager is this Dr. Peck . He knows the might of a name , and , some months ago , secured as President of his organization the celebrated gentleman upon whom Queen 's University conferred its third degree- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. , the brother of Dr. William J. , the co-founder of the famed Mayo Foundation at Rochester , Minn. , where even the alley-cats , it is said , cry : " Mayou . " <P> The Mayos . Dr. William W. Mayo , the father , settled in Le Sueur , Minn. , when land sold for 50c an acre and a man 's shotgun was his Bible . The land was arid , crops meagre . In heed of funds , Mayor hung out a shingle on which was burnt his name prefixed by the word " Doctor . " His first " case " called for a post-mortem examination of a horse which had suffered a bizarre demise . Shortly after , Mayo , having received an appointment as Army Surgeon , went to Rochester where the Sisters of St. Francis built him a hospital-30 beds . His two sons , when they came of age , gave their attention to this hospital . The world has since beaten its path to their door .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
