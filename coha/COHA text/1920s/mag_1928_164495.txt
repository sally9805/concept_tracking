When the citizens of U. S. cities are opening their country places and leaving the sticky streets , the rich citizens of London return to town for a spring of gayeties . The yearly exhibition of paintings at the Royal Academy opens the season . To the Academy 's doors came last week lords and ladies , all the best people who live in London , eager to see the pictures and excited at the prospect of saying how-do-you-do to friends they had not seen since the autumn shooting in Scotland . Mrs. Winston Churchill , with three Anglo-Indian ladies , Painter Sir John Lavery with his lady , Margot Asquith , an enormous smile twitching under her hawk nose , Premier Baldwin , in a topper , Ishbel Macdonald with her father , a crowd of college men wearing golf clothes to show their nonchalance , a host of pretty people who bowed to other people who did not know them , went up the stairs and in the door . <P> There were lots of good paintings , lots of polite portraits , lots of neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed these quickly , laughing and talking ; then they stopped , suddenly silent , to look at six sorrowful paintings made by a madman . <P> The madman was Charles Sims , R. A. , who once painted King George with spindle legs , who became a lunatic , who committed suicide by jumping in the Tweed river , who left a note asking the Academy to show the last half dozen canvases he had covered ( TIME , April 30 ) . Reluctant , the Hanging Committee obeyed . The pictures were silly and terrible ; their names had a dark and foolish clamor-My Pain Sheltering Beneath Your Hand , Here Am I. Passing them at last , to look at Sir William Orpen 's bitterly melodramatic The Black Cap , or the clever work of 14-year-old Joan Manning Saunders , the smart happy people imitated Premier Baldwin 's solemn headshake . " Dreadful . . . " they said , " a shocking thing ! . . . "                    @
