The Sabbath calm of Cuban politics was suddenly broken last week by a series of loud and alarming reports . <P> Col. Alfonso Fors , head of the.judicial police , announced that a plot had been discovered to assassinate General Gerardo Machado y Morales , President of the Cuban Republic since 1925 , and to plunge the country in civil warfare with the idea of bringing about U. S. intervention . A certain Dr. Alejandro Vergara Leonard was named head of the conspiracy , and he and nine followers were arrested and flung into the grey , 18th century Castillo del Principe . <P> " I can now say , " cried Chief Sleuth Fors , " that an open state of rebellion and utter disregard for legally constituted authority exists throughout the nation . " He immediately obtained 73 more warrants for prominent Cubans , and darkly hinted that the Cuban army was honeycombed with sedition . <P> Meanwhile one of the 73 plotters was discovered in New York in the person of suave Octavio Seigle , founder of the Cuban Nationalist Party , now prudently selfexiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general manager of the Chase National Bank in Havana . Francis , another brother , is president of the Banco del Comercio . <P> " It is an open secret , " said Octavio Seigle , fingering a neat butterfly tie , " that opponents of the government who disappear from Havana are taken to the Cabana fortress next to Morro Castle , and fed to the man-eating sharks of the harbor . <P> " This was amply verified in the case of Labor Leader Claudio Bruzon , a political prisoner , whose arm was found inside a shark caught in the waters of Havana Harbor , and fully identified by his wife and friends . The only measure adopted by President Machado 's government was to forbid , as shown in the front page of the newspaper El Pais for March 15 , 1928 , the further fishing of man-eating sharks in the Bay of Havana . " <P> U. S. newspapers cabled to President Machado a resum of Octavio Seigle 's charges , which included assassinations with sawed-off shotguns and racketeering in lotteries conducted by the President himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's secretary : " Honorable President Machado grants no importance to these matters which tend to create unjustified alarm while absolute peace and faith in its government and President exist in all the nation . . . As to the absolute untruthfulness of this information , the President would prefer that you apply for an opinion to the American embassy , or to any other member of the American colony , such as bankers , merchants , presidents of corporations , etc. "
