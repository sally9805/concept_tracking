Around Mexico 's great Federation of Labor , the C. R. O. M. , there was generated , last week , a menacing crisis . Without prior hint of trouble the Congress of the Crom met and passed two fateful resolutions . The first gave notice to Mexico 's new President , Seor Emilio Fortes Gil , that provincial officials are " persecuting " members of the Crom , and asked that these persecutions be stopped . The second resolution requested President Fortes Gil to padlock the Teatro Lirico in Mexico City , where a gross buffoon has been impersonating and holding up to ridicule , night after night , the President of Crom , paunchy Luis N. Morones . <P> Speedily the President made reply . He recalled that in his inaugural address ( TIME , Dec. 10 ) he had pledged himself to uphold the right of free speech and therefore could not muzzle the buffoon . Instead , the President sent 50 riflemen to protect the Teatro Lirico from possible Crom mobs . To the Crom 's charge of " persecution , " square-jawed Seor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress ordered all Crom members throughout Mexico to resign from any State or Federal post which they may hold . <P> By most Mexicans this was interpreted that the Crom had declared political war on the Obregonistas or agrarian party-the party of President Fortes Gil . Simultaneously it became known that Ex-President Calles had been elected Honorary President of the Crom , thus looming in the role of a crony of Crom President Luis Morones . The shattering effect of this news upon Obregonistas may be judged from the fact that their various party groups had pledged united allegiance , only last fortnight , to the new Great National Revolutionary Party headed by Ex-President Calles . That night possibilities were aired and thrashed into a lather of fury in the halls of Congress . <P> The sheer frenzy and unprintable vilification of debate in the Senate was barely eclipsed by that in the House . Deputy Manuel Mijares shrieked : " Morones is a octopus sucking the blood of the laboring classes , vulturing and gorging on the dupes who have elected him President of the Crom ! " Deputy Aurelio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through comparisons which finally became obscene . Senator Lauro C. Caloca hurled thoroughgoing curses and charged that Seor Calles when President had connived with Luis Morones in stupendous graft . Meanwhile in the Chamber of Deputies Melchor Ortega and Aurelio Manrique had pulled guns on each other , but were overpowered by friends and disarmed before they could commit murder . <P> Next day Ex-President Plutarco Elias Calles issued a short and momentous declaration . His intentions and acts had been misunderstood , he said ; and upon pondering the situation he was determined not to explain but to withdraw perpetually from any political activity whatsoever .
