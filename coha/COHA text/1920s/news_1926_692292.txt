The common selling at 34% is 20 points above the 1925 low . The heavy bUying and high price reflect expectation of an early adjustment of the accrued preferred dividends , which will total 281/2% up to this quarter . The management is considering the capital readjustment necessary to look after these accruals and also take care of the profit and loss deficit , which totaled $17,860,237 June 30 , last . The bookkeeping adjustment necessary to look after the profit and loss deficit may be made through a capital adjustment in the common shares . Under the laws of Connecticut , where American Agricultural was incorporated , stocks can not be without par value . But the company has made such vast strides due to sagacious management and improvement in the fertilizer business that the way of capital readjustment is very much easier than it would have been a brief twelvemonth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current assets to current liabilities of 17 to 1 , with nearly $7,000,000 cash on hand at the end of last June .

Thus the preferred dividend of 6% was earned with $1.19 a share to spare . The Street has been busily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the selling season still to develop it is too early to make any definite estimate .

End of the 1920 fiscal year found the company saddled with nearly $30,000,000 of receivables , a large portion of which were uncollectible and have been written oft through drastic setting up of reserves against these totals . Never again is the company likely to be caught by such an agricultural debacle , for it now sells the greater part of its manufactures for cash , and this policy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country .
