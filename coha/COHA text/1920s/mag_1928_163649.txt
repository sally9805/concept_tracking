The black-furred cub of a silver-tipped sire , boyish Senator Robert Marion ( " Young Bob " ) La Follette of Wisconsin , mounted the convention platform last week as his dead father had so often done before him , to voice the " conscience " of the G. 0 . P. He followed Senator Smoot . He presented what has been called , since 1908 when the senior La Follette began the practice , " The Minority Report on the Platform . " <P> The galleries wahooed . The stand-pattingest of the standpatters smiled indulgently . At one burst of applause , the young man bowed deeply and said : " It is so unusual for a Republican from Wisconsin to receive applause at a National Republican Convention that I thank you most sincerely . " Then , lest politeness detract from potency , he asked that the remark be stricken from the record . But everyone remembered the politeness and before the young man left the platform he had cause to take more bows , hand over heart , actor-fashion . Everyone enjoyed it and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a chuckle in it . <P> Of the Minority Platform itself , people said that the voice was the voice of La Follette but the hand was the hand of Senator George W. Norris , the deep-eyed , thin-lipped Nebraskan who is guarding the elder La Follette 's mantle until the son is sere enough to wear it . They guessed so partly , perhaps , from the difficulty the young man sometimes experienced shifting his document back and forth to facilitate gesturing ; and from the unreality of the gesture which the young man made while saying , " We denounce . " People who denounce in their own words do not need to study their gestures . Moreover , many a Norris phrase was there : " bankruptcy has stalked , " " the spectre of peasantry , " " fraught with peril , " " free farms , free homes , and free men . " <P> Upon less affable lips it would have been a tirade on Equality v. Privilege . It was not seriously a platform but an explosion under the platform . It sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which may , like many another " radical " plan , come about in time , but which at that writing were hopeless , wilful " heresies . " Part of the Minority Platform of 1928 : <P> That the McNary-Haugen Bill should be promptly enacted . <P> That Federal power developments and operation should be undertaken at Muscle Shoals and Boulder Dam . <P> Denunciation of the Coolidge policy in Nicaragua and of the Big Navy . <P> Denunciation of Oil Scandals . <P> Presidential elections by popular vote . <P> Approval of the often-beaten Norris amendment to abolish " lame duck " Congresses . <P> That the Volstead Act should be liberalized . <P> Denunciation of the Federal Reserve system 's " conversion . . . into an instrument . . . of stock market speculators .
