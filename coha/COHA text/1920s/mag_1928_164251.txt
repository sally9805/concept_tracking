Pending the findings and final recommendations of the Senate investigators , President Coolidge reiterated his opinion that the seat of trouble in the bituminous coal industry is too many mines and too many miners . He agreed with Senators Gooding and Wheeler , Miner John L. Lewis and many an operator , that amendment of the anti-trust laws will probably be necessary to let the operators make agreements in salutory restraint of their own trade-but not until miners and operators shall have reached production agreements among themselves . <P> Hearing early reports that the income tax revenue was less than had been expected this year , President Coolidge sent word around to the Government departments ( in effect ) : " Be cautious . Be frugal . Economize . " <P> In a dirty little shack by a worn-out copper mine near the crest of the Bluebird Range in Montana , lives an old man with tobacco juice in his beard , holes in his shoes and memories in his head . His name is Bill Martin . He is a mine caretaker , sometimes a sheepherder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , he prospected for silver and copper with a fellow called Bill Clark , formally named William A. Clark . Together they found metal , a lot of metal . Bill Martin drank up and gambled away his share . But not Bill Clark , who kept his head , went into politics , went to the U. S. Senate , built an extravagant palace full of works of art on Fifth Avenue , way off in New York . Three years ago , Senator Clark died , willing his art treasures to the Metropolitan Museum , Manhattan , on condition that it would keep them as an integral exhibit . The Metropolitan refused the treasures on these terms , but not the Corcoran Art Gallery of Washington , substitute legatee . ... Last week , with Senator Clark 's widow on his arm , President Coolidge walked through the Corcoran 's new Clark annex , followed by a gala procession , and looked at the pictures , tapestries , laces , rugs , faiences , sculptures , furniture and other gimcracks collected to the tune of perhaps five millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark . <P> President Coolidge 's guests last week at the White House were as varied as usual , including : <P> Chairman William Morgan Butler of the Republican National Committee , to discuss some inscrutable political matter . <P> Some American Legionnaires , asking that the Legion be given representation as an official " observer " at any and all international disarmament conferences attended by the U. S. <P> The Ambassador from Chile , Senor Don Carlos G. Davila , who lunched . <P> Senator Andre Honnorat of France , to tell President Coolidge about the Cite Universitaire foundation in Paris , to which many countries , including the U.
