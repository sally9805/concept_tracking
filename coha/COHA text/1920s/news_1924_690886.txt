txt The annual report of the Secretary of the Navy , published today , should be read in the light of his admission on May 22 in a communication to the House of Representatives that the United States Navy had not been kept up to the strength sanctioned by the Washington Treaty . Mr. WILBUR calculated the existing ratio to be 5-4-3 , with the United States declined from parity with Great Britain . To restore our navy to its proper place thirteen of the first line of battle ships " must be reconditioned and modernized , " he said ; forty-one non-combatant auxiliary ships were needed for " a rounding out of the battle fleet " ; submarines capable of manoeuvring with the fleet at its fighting speed should be acquired ; the total of 10,000-ton cruisers ought to be twenty-one ( the number in commission is now less than ten ) ; there should be an adequate reserve supply of torpedoes , instead of a deficiency of 20 per cent. ; the personnel should be increased to keep needed ships in commission ; six 400-ton river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the radio equipment should be put on a modern warfare basis . In the report to be submitted to Congress early in December there is this disquieting statement : " Due to road " equacy of funds wherewith to meet all " upkeep needs , the material condition of " the fleet has not improved during the " past year . " Congress adjourned with the Senate failing to pass a relief bill " sent to it by the House . The Secretary asks for appropriations " to maintain the " navy at the full ratio provided by the " treaty for the limitation of naval ar " mament , not only with reference to the " type of vessels covered by that treaty , " but with reference to other types of " vessels not so limited . " In August there was such a shortage of funds that an order had to be given to reduce to a minimum " all improvements to the " units of the fleet , no matter how im ' " portant . " Plans to modernize six of the older battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work must be done " if our ratio of naval . strength is to be maintained . " The Secretary states that six more of ten cruisers authorized were delivered during the current year . All of them will soon be in commission . Full cruiser strength is a matter that must be worked I out through annual appropriations over a term of years . Of the aviation branch Mr. WILBUR says : While the number of aircraft available for the needs of our navy Is not sufficient . our naval aviation compares favorably in design and in quality with that of other nations . A distinct step in advance will be made when the aircraft carriers now in course of construction are ready to take their place with the fleet . He has in mind the conversion of the battle cruisers Saratoga and Lexington . Of our superior fleet of destroyers  --  no other sea power is so well equipped-103 are maintained in commission . Of the decommissioned destroyers , a greater number , all that the Secretary can say is that they are looked after " as satis " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel available . " The strength of the line commissioned officers " represents a minimum figure for adequate naval peace preparation . " It is admitted to be a difficult problem to officer " the vessels now maintained in commission under the operating plan . " The whole ' lumber of officers on duty is 4,785 , of whom almost one-half have had only " limited sea experience . " This condition calls for intensive methods of training afloat . The Secretary regrets that appointments to the Naval Academy have been reduced from five to three for each Representative and Senator . " Unless the Congressional restriction is removed , the navy , " , he says , " will " never reach its authorized strength of " line officers . " An addition to the complement of 86,000 enlisted men is recommended . It is reassuring to learn that " the character and accomplishment " of the personnel of the fleet have " never been higher , " and that its gunnery shows a " considerable advance .
