txt HOW WOULD you like to take a trip to the center of the earth ? Of course you could not go there In fact , but your fancy can take you It you will let astronomy be your guide . We live on the surface of a great ball , whose diameter Is almost 8,000 miles . On its surface are air and water , green plants , and all manner of living things . The air presses closely down upon it , and makes a warm blanket , which holds the sun 's radiations for a time , and keeps the earth from ever experiencing the cold of outer space , a cold so Intense that the bleakest polar night would seem a furious heat by comparison . The temperature of the earth 's surface varies little as temperatures go . Most of the time It is above the freezing point of water , and the seas never boll and steam . tho way they do on some neighboring planets of ours . Three-quarters of the earth 's face is covered by water . We call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , but in proportion to the etre of the earth they are but the merest film of moisture . Figure it yourself . What part of 4,00 ) miles . the radius of the earth , doey six mules make ? The rocks and soil which cover the ground are but the merest shell as well As we pass downward , we reach the limit of the " zone of fracture " at about six miles , below which the pre &; sure of the rocks abo-03 is so great as to prohibit cavities , cracks , or fissures from ever forming . The rock down here is hot , and grows hotter as we descend . On the surface the rocks are made of various kinds of sediments , below come lavas and rocks which were once melted , which gradually merge into rocks which would melt if they were on the surface , and these In turn merge into a central sphere of metal which , astronomers think , is mostly made of iron . The center of the earth is as hot as a. star . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch , and yet the globe is not molten , but is as solid and rigid as a ball of steel . This is the reason : Every object assumes the form it does because of forces acting on IL The force which mainly shapes the earth is gravity , and gravity is concentration at the center . It pulls every portion down , and thus assures the earth 's smoothly spherical shape . In pulling , it also squeezes itself , and by so doing forces the lavas and light rocks to the surface , like slag is squeezed out of hot iron , and also heats the metal in the core by direct compression . Stars and planets keep the heat they do mainly by self . compression . The sun is white hot because It has sufficient gravity to compress even the surface white hot , but the earth , being smaller , compresses itself less , and so maintains a lower temperature . There are various hypotheses which tell of a time when the earth and sun wore different from what they are now , but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been much as they are today back to the dimmest period of time .
