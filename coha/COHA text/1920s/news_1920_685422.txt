txt In all British banks , stock exchanges and managers . offices the vital question of the day is this  --  can trade and finance survive a special tax of $2,500,000,000 levied on wealth made during the war ? Can business survive a surgical operation  --  the amputation of two and a half billions of money , which is now being used to give employment to tens of thousands of working people ? The Parliamentary Committee on War Fortunes has just issued its final report and it says : " Yes  --  business can survive . " The report says that " although the suggested tax is strongly opposed by the financial and commercial world , there is , on the other hand , a very large body of public opinion which regards it not only as expedient , but as a just and necessary attempt to equalize the losses suffered during the war . " The Bankers ' As , - eiation says : " No , business can not survive ; " and the St ? ' xchange committee is of the same opinion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge sum in cash without producing a financial panic in the stock exchanges , the extent of which it is difficult to forecast . " It is the old play ? of " The - Merchant of Venice " re-. enacted ; with the government ? es Shylock , proposing to cut off its pound of flesh without causing its victim any loss of blood during the operation . Shylock failed , and lost his fortune and his daughter into the bargain ; and the probability is that the British government will fail too , though it will persevere to the point of blood-letting . The danger of the whole matter is that it is a clear . cut struggle between the Haves and the Have Nots . There arc on the one side about 75,000 people who have become rich during the war ; and there are on the other side 21,000,000 voters ; nearly half women , and all more or less sufferers because of the war .

These men have increased their wealth by fully $1,000,000,000 since 1913 . They control probably only one-seventeenth of the national wealth , but if they fell , they would pull down the entire structure of British industry and finance . They are not merely rich men . They are as essential to British trade and commerce as the skeleton is to a human body . Take away these 280 men , and British industry would be as primitive as a body without bones . There are only 05 men in Great Britain who have incomes of more than $500,000 a year . There are only 30,000 who pay Super-Tax , as having incomes of $25,000 a year ; and there are only 400,000 families that can in any sense be regarded as wealthy .
