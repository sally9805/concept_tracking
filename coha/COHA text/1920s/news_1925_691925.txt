txt The people of Australia have established a complete system of industrial courts . There is one court in each of the six States , besides a Federal industrial court . The latter hears cases which have to do with industrial conditions in more than one State . These courts adjudicate , by regular process of law , cases which grow out of cohflicts between employers and employes . Their decisions also describe the basic conditions which must obtain in the conduct of the nation 's industries . The legislation which establishes the Industrial courts is exceedingly simple . Usually the law merely sets up the court and gives if a broad general supervision over industrial relations . " In the South Australian Industrial Arbitration act of 1912 , the term ' industrial matters ' is defined in a sense so wide as to include almost every conceivable question likely to arise between employer and employe . It includes , for example , wages , hours of employment , sex , age , qualification or status of employes , apprenticeship , employment of children , the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons or classes of persons in any industry , and all questions of what is fair and right in relation to any industrial matter having regard to the interests of the persons immediately concerned and of society as a whole . The act defines ' industry ' ira a broad sense  --  a sense which includes the work done by employes of municipalities . The act provides machinery for punishing offenses against the act , and it prohibits the lockout and the strike under penalties of fine ( which may be made a charge on wages due or to be due , and may be made a charge on the association of which the offender is a member ) and imprisonment . " ( Quoted from Judge W. Jethro Brown in " Australia : Economic and Political Studies . " ) To the American mind , it may seem impossible that such an institution could be successful . Both our employers ' organizations and labor unions have fought every effort to establish such a judiciary in this country . Kansas failed utterly . The late Mr. Gompers , who once debated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the decisions of such a court must strike at every fundamental or American liberty . The Inalienable rights of our citizens , he declared , include the right of a worker or a. group of workers to stop work , on any occasion , at their own volition . The employing class was equally bitter against the Kansas court . To have a Judge upon the bench declare what wages and conditions were to be seemed to them to be an act of extreme tyranny . The State of Kansas was in no position to lead wisely in the development of this institution . Kansas is primarily agricultural . Its farmer majority tried to thrust its conclusions down the throats of the two minolity classes of the population of the Sunflower State . In Australia the soil of opinion from which this judiciary has grown is wholly different . Australia has the most highly organized labor-union movement and the I most powerful and experienced labor party in the world . The Australian labor unions , ( with the exception of a very small minority of Communists ) are loyal supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got beyond the point where they think that a strike is a useful means of progress . Of course , it might be taken for granted that employers would rather take their case to court than to suffer sabotage and strikes and the constant threat of them . In his able and succinct description of the system , Judge Brown describes the new industrial law as a " body of principles worked out from precedent to precedent and adapted from time to time to meet the needs and aspirations of a progressive society . " He quotes a distinguished English jurist as proclaiming that it is t .. - duty of a Judge upon the bench to attain " the gradual illumination of the public conscience . " This is a large order as regards Industrial relations . Take , for instance , the crucial matter of the minimum wage . The courts in Australia have decided that a minimum wage should be such a wage as will support an average family in comfort , decency and fullness of citizenship . The law as defined and elucidated by the courts thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorstep of the workingman 's home . The law provides that the Judge shall examine into the economic and social conditions of the home . The law takes for granted that that home shall give to the natio* a group of children . Those children arse to be properly nourished and soundly educated . It is evident that , with the acceptance of this point of view , the ancient theory that the wages contract is simply a business transaction falls to the ground . In its place there rises , , through the " illumination of the public conscience " and the rule of law , a totally new attitude . Suelge  --  Brown goes on to say that " at present , public opinion in Australia is inclined to hold that the lockout and the strike are wrong . " The reason is evident . The objects hitherto obtained by use of force are now being secured by the administration of law . The " industrial Judge is driven toward the goal of a coherent and enduring body of principles . " If a specific industry can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry had better fail . If , for the public good , it is to be saved , its salvation must come through legislation . Bounties may be paid or a tariff on imports may be collected . Another principle laid down by the industrial courts concerns the protection of the reasonable and decent employer from the unfair competition of employers . who are habitually unfair . This has been , in all countries , one of the curses of uncontrolled ' competition . Many an employer has suffered because of this . Not a few have failed . Others , feeling themselves driven to the wall , have reverted to the hard bargain with their employes . But if all the industry is brought up to recent wage and working standards , then the righteous employer does not need to fear the consequences . In this country we have left this great task of enforcing minimum standards entirely to the labor unions . And too often they have failed at just this point . It can not be said that during and since the war there have been no strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period prices have risen rapidly . Sometimes they have reacted and fallen rapidly . So it has been often difficult to adjust the rates of wages . It has been the hardest conceivable time for the industrial courts to find their way and retain the support of both parties to the industrial contract . Their final vindication would seem to be the fact that ' they have come through and made good . We have many funds and institutions which are devoted to making investigations . Expensive expeditions are financed and sent out to photograph and study the bottom of the ocean . Others are digging up ancient ruins in the most remote countries . No doubt much of this work is both interesting and valuable . But If we should send a commission to report on the industrial courts of Australia and New Zealand , it would discover scenething of our own future to us . For , . despite every aspect of misunderstanding and backwardness on our part , we shall some day develop a system of industrial courts .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
