Notes and Comment THAT " last meal " served in Delmonico 's amid the tumult of wrecking gangs and electric hoists must have had some purpose . And that the reporters were welcomed with open arms and that the whole thing was carried off in accordance with the most approved maxims of modern bad taste , suggests that publicity will do very well for motive . Mr. Natanson , however , says differently . Mr. Natanson , whoever he may be , managed to shout above the din that , " This is but another refutation of the oft-repeated fiction that business men lack sentiment . " Of course it may be as he says . But we have a feeling that the people  --  and there are lots of them  --  to whom Delmonico 's means anything in the way of sentiment stayed away from that affair  --  or , possibly , were not invited . WOMEN indulge the greater vices more gallantly than do men , but they lack the genius for the lesser ones . Since they took to drinking , for example , feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no good end . Old-fashioned cocktails , Martinis , even the Bronx which was something of a concession a decade ago -- enjoy little popularity now . Woman 's participation in general drinking has let loose a flood of sickly-s w e e t concoctions . First , the Orange Blossom . Later numberless combinations of saccharine fruit juices and gin . Latterly , the Alexander has triumphed , which has the puny flavor of a chocolate malted milk . Since appreciation of a dry cocktail is born of long and patient training , it has gone out of fashion . Man has had to adjust his drinking to syrupy messes .

IF the policy of drawing our Public Library 's purse strings tighter endures , either the strings will break , or the library will be deftly strangled . Even now , on stormy nights , passing revelers have sworn that they saw those smug lions before the portals rise , change their shapes into wolves , and leap up the broad expanse of stone stairs to sniff and whine at the very doors . But it is not easy to arouse the cynical New Yorker 's interest in the financial plight of the Library , as we found when we mentioned it to our friend who still keeps his house in Washington Square .

The Prince visits Buenos Aires and Mr. William Randolph Hearst buys a Twelfth Century castle in Wales . Handicap THE conception of young Gloria Gould as Directress of the newest Embassy Theatre dates back to a dinner dance gathering at Greenwich , Connecticut , where Miss Gould had the good fortune to sit next to Major Edward Bowes of the Capitol Theatre , and the Metro-Goldwyn Pictures . To Major Bowes 's far-sightedness goes the credit of having answered her youthful confession of desire to have a theatre all her own with the ready " My dear , of course you may have a theatre , " and forthwith he put her on the salary list of the Embassy which he was then planning . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world through the medium of Success , " The Human Magazine . " " I Must , " she said , " Stand on my Own Feet , In Spite of Being Born a Gould . " Anyone who read that article can not but admire her bravery in persisting under her maiden name at the Embassy , and not taking advantage of that of her husband , Henry A. Bishop Jr . Miss Gould is only twenty . Exits and Entrances NO longer will the World 's music criticisms appear under the signature of Mr. Deems Taylor . He has resigned finally , against all protests , and has cast off for the seas of composition . At the moment , it is work on a new symphony that he is alternating with carpentry on his home near Stamford . Later , it will he an opera . His successor is Mr. Samuel Chatzinolf , the first artist  --  in musical terminology  --  to essay the role of critic in this town . He is reported to be under contract to the World for three years , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous than is customary among those who devote their Winters to trying to hear five or six concerts the same evening . Oddly enough , Mr. Chotzinoff won his first fame off-stage . He was the pianist who played so brilliantly in the wings whilst Mr. Leo DietrichGRAND CENTRAL Watch-watching , harried , breathless , snatchy talkers . They pass  --  commute , inglorious New Yorkers. stein made gestures at a keyboard under the glare of the footlights . The vehicle was " The Concert . " Subsequently the World 's new critic has been accompanist for Heifetz , Zimbalist , and other violinists . Also , he has been writing occasional comments on music . As to his technical equipment for criticism , Zimbalist 's comment on receipt of the news about Mr. Chotzinoff may be illuminating : " So ? Then it means four months of practice for my New York recital . " Mr. Donald Perry Marquis has kJ triumphed at last , and will be free henceforth to pursue literature to the hitter end . For six months , or longer , his friends have known of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish a daily column for the Herald Tribune , but hope had almost died that the paper would release the genial Don from his obligations , when , abruptly , it did . He has two plays completed for Fall or Winter presentation : " The Dark Hour , " a tragedy which Mr. Murray Anderson will venture on the boards of his embryonic Park Avenue Theatre , and " Mr. Pie-Eye , " a comedy in the mood of " The Old Soak . " Further , Mr. Marquis 's desk is cluttered with fervent appeals from magazine editors for material , to which he proposes to give some attention in the near future . " The Lantern , " Mr. Marquis 's former column , will be illuminated henceforth by Mr. Edward Hope Coffey , who has shed his beams therefrom during his predecessor 's absences , signing himself , as he will continue to do , Edward Hope . This young gentleman is a protege of Mr. Marquis , who has led him carefully along the way to the eminence of succession . Only once did Mr. Marquis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , announcing his determination to become a writer , asked advice about what college to enter . Mr. Marquis selected Princeton . But then Mr. Marquis did not attend Princeton himself , so he may be presumed to have been disinterested . Democracy IF you can imagine the long , deep glooms of a cathedral with here and there the bright gleam of a brass Spittoon , you have a passable picture of the main corridor of Tammany Hall . They are real spittoons , glorious , alder-manic . Tammany would scorn to call them cuspidors . There are doors , too ; high , heavy doors , which open seldom , and close abruptly when they do . Men wait about , well-fed , normally amiable men , formed into nervous , whispering groups . There is hoarse , mumbled conversation . One thinks of the faithful at prayer , and feels the tenseness of a revival , unrelieved by the convert 's ecstatic shouts . An awesome door swings ponderously open , and a summoning face appears , a man detaches himself from one of the cliques and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad of shoulder , square of jaw ? all the identifying marks of the district leader  --  an unquestioned power in his own sphere . Now he treads cautiously , almost on tip-toe , and with sudden clutch removes his hat before he sidles uneasily through the thin opening made to admit him . He is lamb-like in his disappearance , who is the lion elsewhere , for now he has come to solicit and not to dispense favor . The silence settles more deeply . The hum of conversation rumbles lower , with an occasional disconcerting note when a deep bass breaks under the strain of speaking softly . That portentous portal swings ajar again . The big man reappears . His face is flushed . He breathes heavily and quickly . " I got it , " he cries , hysterical as a girl . " I got it . I got it . " Over and over this exultant paean . He can say nothing else . He laughs , still hysterical , this giant of a man , this power among his own . He sniffles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men come to him , out of the deep shadows , and shake his hand . A few pat him on his broad shoulders . One pauses to flick a cigar butt into one of the gleaming spittoons before he speaks : " If it could n't be me , glad it was you . I 'll give you all I got , " he mumbles . " Thanks , " murmurs the big man , and , with subsiding hysteria , again , al-most unbelieving , " I got it . I got it . " Tammany has made a nomination . Survival AT any rate , the tradition of broad-mindedness has survived the migration from Madison Square , and will reside in the new Garden . And what better proof might one offer than the program now proposed for its official opening , which is to be  --  the Building Trades willing along about November 30 , First , since art is long , and profits fleeting , we shall have the Six-Day Bicycle Race , which , it is said , is by way of being one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the old tolerance still prevailing , the town will be treated to a gorgeous music festival , under the baton of Mr. Nathan Frank , of the open air opera Franks . During the Winter , there will be skating , and , perhaps , hockey games , for the new Garden is to have a rink . Boxing , of course , will come in for its just dues , and possibly a bit more . But most of Mr. Tex Rickard 's mental efforts will be bent upon finding further cultural entertainments , such as the music festival , for it is the hope of himself and his associates that the new Garden will carry the prestige of the old as a civic center . NEVER is the new Garden men- tioned , but the memory of the old brings back legends of Barnum , particularly that one preserved for us in Valentine 's Manual . It was in the master showman 's younger days , when he conducted his museum on Ann Street . A crowd had lingered so long , gaping at the wonders , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation , Mr. Barnum hastily lettered a sign and placed it over an exit . It read ! THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS . The crowd read ; they milled into the passage , curiosity-impelled ; they sought , as Mr. Barnum later quoted them , " some new kind of an elephant , " only to find that the Egress was not an elephant but all out of doors . DISCUSSION of Zuloaga has not yet died out amongst those who can pronounce his name , and the reminiscent buzz is naturally greatest about his portrait of Mrs. John Barrymore , which was posed  --  and most extraordinarily  --  in Hamlet 's costume . " I suppose every woman at one time or another cherishes an ambition to be painted in black velvet and pearls , " remarked a tea talker recently , " but this is the first instance I 've known of one 's deliberately choosing her husband 's business suit . " Identities YES , observed the Gentleman in the Know , this E. Barrington who has been chiding Lady Hamilton and heaping fresh incest upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that Dodd , Mead &; Co. carefully refer to the author as " him , " on the jackets of " The Divine Lady " and " Glorious Apollo , " the Gentleman in the Know conceded , but publishers have engaged in little literary pleasantries ere this . And a mystery , however mild , never hurts a book 's sales . She is a Mrs. Beck , murmured the Gentleman in the Know , and she has written other novels , signing them L. Adams Beck , again a device infering masculinity . These earlier works were fanciful and delicate stories of the Orient , wholly different from the present ponderous biographical novels , which have enjoyed and are still eftjoying such wide vogue . It is an old trick , but a good one , mused the Gentleman in the Know . Moreover , he added abruptly , this charge of incest against Lord Byron is not what one might term new . It was made first by Harriet Beecher Stowe , in 1869 . She met Lady Byron during a visit to Europe and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the title , " Lady Byron Vindicated . " And , now , is there anything else ? inquired the Gentleman in the Know , too patiently . Oh , " Serena Blandish , " he echoed . I thought everyone knew who wrote it . It was Mr. Sidney Dark , the English novelist , who spread the identity of the author wide . The Lady of Quality has written rather profusely under her maiden name , Enid Bagnold . " Serena " is her first venture into anonymity . Her husband is Sir Roderick Jones , K.B.E. , the present director of Reuter 's , the European news agency . Not much of a secret to that , murmured the Gentleman in the Know , depreciatingly , and was off . Local MR . HENRY COLLINS BROWN , who is the gentleman who has taken the Museum of the City of New York so much to heart , sails next month on the Mauretania expressly to invite Their Royal Highnesses to grace New York with their presences during the celebration , next May , of the 3ooth Anniversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Brown , in collaboration with Mr. August William Hutaf , hopes to have well in the process of organization a new club  --  if so elastic a group may be called thus  --  which will meet once a month for dinner and for telling and listening to tales of the old New York . In this , Mr. Hutaf is the prime mover . His project has the advantage of having available a meeting place already saturated with atmosphere , the same Gracie Mansion of Mr. Brown 's museum , at the East River foot of Eighty-eighth Street , a most interesting , though much-neglected institution . The intention is to meet at some central hotel , and to proceed from there , by tally-ho , to the Grade Man -- sion for the dinner and discussion . The first journey thus should he a most interesting event . Even mounting a tally-ho once required much agility ' . Epicureanism NOT alone has the art of cocktail making gone from us . The style in sodas and sundaes has changed as well . It is the favorite lament of the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dish in the cool exclusiveness of Hicks on the Avenue . " People change , " he sighed ; " there are n't many who remember the old days . . . days when customers appreciated plum and blackberry syrups , wintergreen and birch , and we had ginger beer on tap . No one has discrimination now-a-days . All they know is chocolate or vanilla . " There are those whom the cruel machinery of progress must always mangle . Disengaged PEOPLE with a few minutes to spare could do worse , but not much worse , than to walk up and down Broadway and Sixth Avenue , alert for lunch-hour conversation of the street 's more permanent population . " I tell you , " is to be heard , " they scream . It 's a riot . " These people , then , be actor-folk . The employed trouper is describing his effect upon his audience , to the envious ear of an unemployed colleague .

Not so his idle friend , who is aware that at any moment Mr. Arthur Hopkins may summon him to a conference and an immediate offer of the leading role in his proposed revival of " Rose Bernd . " And therefore , over that stomach that is as unused to food as is a bootlegger to the flat silver on his groaning board , there is plainly visible the best of snowy linen , flanked on both sides by a decent broadcloth that has been beaten into the form most recently approved by the heir to the British throne . Bits of color , too , are evident , in the handkerchief that peeps in unutilitarian shyness from the breast pocket , and in the socks that match it in color ? this because of a mistaken trust in a Vanity Fair decision some years ago that that kind of thing was the thing .

The dog days are upon him , God help him , and the envy of plumbers and masons and butchers and policemen and lawyers is in his breast . For these people , though lowly their estates , have jobs . . . and pay envelopes . The women of the theatre , kinder and more refined , have evolved a method of asking of their friends whether a job has yet come their way , that has none of the shuddering brutality of the male , " Are you workin ' ? " And so it happens that when one of these frail creatures encounters upon this Forty-fourth Street a sister who has , she knows , been making the grande tour of the offices from morn to night , frantically seeking even the lowliest role that is daily becoming more vital , she draws the searcher to the shade of the nearest hosiery window , and asks : " Found anything you like yet , dearie ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shubert I would n't take the role for any price ; it 's unsympathetic . " And then both smile , and then both know that each is lying ; and in the hearts of both is fear .
