Vincent Vigoroux , 15 , youngest editor and publisher in the U. S. , whose paper is The Little Acorn of New Rochelle , N. Y. , and 1,150 editors of high school papers throughout the land , attended the annual convention of the Columbia Scholastic Press Association in Manhattan last week , saw how linotype machines were made , visited plants of New York City newspapers , heard President Karl August Bickel of the United Press say : " The day of the hardboiled , cynical reporter with a bottle of whiskey in one pocket , and an American Mercury in the other , has passed . Ideals are higher now . . . . This condition has come about largely by reason of the influence of young people . This generation is the best we ever have had . One young man , Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh , raised the tone of journalism 25% by his flights to Europe , and Mexico and Central America . And that is the effort of only one clean-minded American boy .
