txt A Viking , if anybody , should know what the Winter weather is going to be . So when Captain AMUNDSEN arrived here the other day and announced that " there will not be any 1 " real cold weather here'between now " and next Spring , " and " I predict " a fair Winter for New York and " vicinity , " it seemed to be hardly worth while to take the mothballs out of the ulster . Confirmation seemed to come from St. John 's , Newfoundland , in a dispatch of Dec. 1 : With lilac and rose bushes budding , oath three inches high above the ground and a temperature of 52 in the shade after a record month of warm weather , Newfoundland is enjoying the longest Indian Summer in history . ? ? ? Even in the northern parts of the island there is little sign of Winter . Why any Winter at all ? Nobody wanted It but the coal dealer and the boy with a new sled . The department stores were a unit for a mild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every fine day up to the 25th ! Meanwhile , the snowflakes were mobilizing in the north , and the wind , like The wolf 's long howl from Unalaska 's shore was moaning in the rafters . Without warning from the Weather Bureau a very good imitation of a blizzard smote New York and suburbs on Saturday night and carried on all day Sunday . The mercury fell to 12 degrees above zero . January had sat down hard In the lap of young December . Had Captain AMUNDSEN played a practical joke on a confiding people ? Were the budding lilac and rose bushes of St. John 's mere word-painting by a naturefr.kir ? Up in Northern Ontario and bleak Quebec Winter had set in three weeks earlier than usual , and that was some time ago . What most of us forget is that the North American Continent has quite a spread , and produces many kinds of weather at one and the same time . The philosopher will not rail against heavy snow and nipping cold early in December . There are checks and balances in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1922 , but January brought the heaviest snowfalls recorded for that month by the Weather Bureau , 21.6 inches up to the 28th . Then the season turned mild and gracious . At the end of the third week in January , 1924 , it seemed as if there would be no Winter at all . December had been halcyon and ? benignant . Said EDWARD HOWE FORBUSH , ornithologist of the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture : Up to Dec. 28 the ground was bare and the weather mild as far north as Ottawa , and wild flowers were blooming in Northern Virginia . In Southern New England there were reports of snakes crawling , gnats on the wing , swarms of beach flies , and strawberries picked for the Christmas dinner . January was kind almost up to the end , but on the 26th a cold wave borne on the pinions of a seventytwo-mile gale froze New York to its marrow . February was spiteful with snows and frost , and there was Winter enough for all . The season of 1925-26 was bad enough , as everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow came late , there was plenty of it . But such a storm as swooped down on New York last Sunday is rare so early in the Winter . It was premature by a month or so . Perhaps the worst is over for this month . We may have a lamb-like January . Anyway , to limbo with the prophets !
