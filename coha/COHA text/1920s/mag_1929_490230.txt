ALTHOUGH we commonly look at life with a becoming tolerance , we find , on searching our heart , that we have very little patience with the way seven-eighths of the hotels are run , here or anywhere . In spite of what managers say about courtesy being the rout of hotel management , it is frequently not courtesy but unction , banana unction . All the sideehows in most hotels arc run by concessionaires  --  the newsstand , the ticket agency , the check-room ; the valets , the bellboys , the waiters are predatory . Cigarettes are five cents more than at the corner stand , telephone calls are ten cents . While this system makes easy bookkeeping and more prqfit , it is pretty hard on the guest : the corridors turn out to he dens of jackals . That is why , so often in a hotel , you see the look of the hunted in the eyes of the guest .

A PERSON who drifts along , fall-ing a victim to the various snares and delusions of dramas , popular novels , movies , and phonograph records is likely to get pretty well out of touch with actuality . We realized the other night that nobody has suffered more from the current sentimentality and pseudo-realism than the American mother . As portrayed , she falls into three types : the white-haired movie saint , who is a complete nonentity ; the mother of book and stage , who is more or less of a fiend along pathological or neurotic lines ; and the mother of hallad , who is just a plain idiot . One would gather from all this that plain , normal mothers have disappeared . Yet we see them all about .

ATHOUGHT FOR THIS WEEK : Several years ago Forhan 's toothpaste told a credulous world that Four Out Of Five Have It . The suggested remedy was Forhan 's . Today , after all these years , you 'll notice if you read the car cards that Four Out Of Five still Have It . Tf the toothpaste does what the ads say , should n't the ratio by this time be down to three nut of five ? Are we being kidded ? SIMON &; SCHUSTER-OUT mistake  --  E. P. Dutton &; Company have just published a new edition of " Alice in Wonderland , " with drawings by Willy Pogany replacing the old familiar pictures by Tenniel . Alice , in the new version , appears in bobbed hair and short skirts-1929 model . The reason given for this change is that to modern children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather strange and remote . Well , we could say a lot on the whole subject , including our belief that the old Alice 's strangeness and remoteness were a part of her charm . We no longer have the strength , however , to combat the distortions and desecrations of Progress . These days it is best to conform , even to join the new pioneering idol-smashers . Thus we suggest another change along this same line : Rewrite " Beautiful Joe " and make the heroic dog a Sealyham . Sound Technique ABAFFLING problem came up in a photoplay the **31;378;TOOLONG Company was making a week or so ago  --  a matter of symbolism . A man was to be executed and the idea was to suggest his demise , not show it . " Umm , " said one master mind , " we could have him leaving his cell and then we could show a flash of a candle going out that would do it . " Mr. Ultra killed this idea at once .

The High Place THAT forty-fi ve-thousand-dollara-year triplex apartment atop the new Delmonico Hotel at Park and Fifty-ninth rewards the eye mainly just now with its magnificent view of the city . It is being visited by occasional curious and wily sightseers , acting as they think millionaires act , and a few actual millionaires seriously considering living there . Pretender or plutocrat , what they see at present is a hodgepodge of rooms , foyers , and galleries , inelegant and amazing . The place is not yet decorated ; the arrangement is bewildering , with nooks and crannies everywhere and devious small hallways which seem to do much winding around to perform very little service . As you leave the elevator on the first floor of the apartment ( the thirtieth of the building ) , for example , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes four right-angle turns in a distance of twenty feet and winds up at a service elevator . Halfway along this odd corridor a little niche holds a small , lonely , and lovely washbowl . Similarly , in a dressing-room on this floor , situated between the master 's bedroom and his bath , you can reach out and open five doors without taking a step , thus getting all the fun of a Coney Island maze . The present layout was the idea of Mr. James H. R. Cromwell , who had the whole building under lease and lived in the apartment for a short while . He was probably lost most of the time . In all there are nineteen rooms , not counting a dozen other large spaces which might be made into rooms . There are fifteen closets , six baths . The living-room is on . the third floor . It is forty-five feet by seventeen and commands a magnificent view up Park Avenue , down Park Avenue , over the East River , across the city . Bordering this floor are two promenades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art galleries , or anything you are bright enough to think of . On the middle floor is the dining-room ( seventeen by twenty-nine ) , the library ( about the same size ) , the kitchen , butler 's pantry , several large , nebulous , unnamed spaces , and a room definitely referred to by the renting agents as a den . The lowest floor includes five bedrooms and baths , a nursery , a laundry , and  --  among other things  --  a pressing-room . The last is just tentatively named ; you might want to do something else with it . Bon Voyage THE latest dodge in gifts for friends departing on steamers is to present them with their first bottle of legal champagne . You order it delivered , of course , after the ship is safely out of territorial waters , one procedure being to order it served ( card attached ) the first dinner out .

The Theremin SIX or seven months ago we told how the Russian inventor , There-min , at a concert in the Plaza , played tunes by waving his hands gently before antennae on a box . Rachmaninoff was there and applauded softly and a woman excitedly exclaimed " Magnifique ! " It now seems that the contraption is to he manufactured in quantity and placed on the market at a retail price within the reach of practically all . Some announcement may already have been made about this but we have some extra facts . The Radio Corporation , it turns out , sent representatives to an earlier concert Professor Theremin gave before the Engineers ' Club and these reported that the thing worked . The radio people thereupon arranged with the foreigner to take over his idea , agreeing to pay royalties which should make him wealthy . The home machine will somewhat resemble a radio set but it will be simpler : just a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a plug to fit into a light socket . When the plug is in and the knob turned , the rod sends out wave impulses . The hands , moving through these waves , produce the sounds . The quality of the music depends on how good a musician the player is and how well he has got the hang of the new instrument . By varying the distance of the hands from the rod , one plays the scale ; by varying it with finesse one gets quarter-tones . Theremin himself plays classical pieces . It was his rendition of Ruhinstein 's " Night " and Glinka 's " Elegy " that won the applause of Rachmaninoff . They say the Theremin , as the new music box will probably he called , is much easier to master than the piano or most other musical instruments , and that the children of the future will begin their music study by gesturing before a box . The Radio Corporation , we have it , was chagrined that none of its engineers hit upon the idea , which is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That terrible demon of the early days of the radio , still a restless and yowling house cat at times , has become an invisible piano . WE also hear the Radio Corporation people are going ahead with television but are determined not to market an instrument until they can make good ones . This may he within eighteen months . Television is far advanced right now . At the moment receiving sets are being placed in the homes of various officials and employees of the corporation . These are known as " outposts . " Soon these will be turned on to pick up moving pictures of world events . The officials and employees will have to make daily reports on the quality of the reception . The recording end of the machinery is giving more trouble than the receiving end . At a football game , for instance , what corresponds to the microphone in sound radio would have to gallivant concerning himself , he seems to have decided ten years ago to write the story of his life , and began making notes for a volume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butlers knew what was in his mind . The accumulation is considerable , however , and recently an experienced writer was called in to help him in his work . Mr. William Inglis , a well-known contributor to the I V arld twenty years ago , is the amanuensis , or the collaborator . Some days the two spend several hours at work together . We are told that the autobiography will include an explanation and a defence of Mr. Rockefeller 's methods of building up his millions and answer many of his detractors of bygone decades . The Pilot Light EVEN System understands , if you touch its great heart . A man who lives in Twelfth Street took himself and family into the country for the summer , although he came into town for a couple of days each week . He thus frequently stayed overnight at his town house , but , there being no servants , he did no householding . Early in the season he got to worrying about his gas bill . It developed that the pilot light on the stove had been left on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas per month . ( He could have shut it off and saved himself much concern , but he never thought of that . ) He studied over the first bill . What was he to do ? Stamps are not legal tender . There was , he felt , a certain lack of elegance about wrapping up two dimes and three pennies and sending them through the mails . A cheque for so small an amount would he silly ; besides , he had an idea that it would he unlawful . He fretted a gond deal , and the bill ran on . When finally , at the end of the second month , he got another bill , listing twenty-three cents cur , . rent charges and twenty-three cents overdue  --  total , forty-six cents  --  he decided to lay the whole matter before the gas company and ask them frankly what he ought to do . He did this in a thoughtfully written letter , and to show that it was not the money but the principle of the thing , he enclosed a dollar on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company under no circumstances accepted payment in advance and it therefore was enclosing fifty-four cents in stamps . But what pleased him most was the postscript : " We have noted on your account that your bills will henceforth be held in abeyance until they have reached the amount of $1.15 . " With this great load off his mind , the gentleman is now burning up some extra gas , just to show he appreciates a favor . Belles Lettres MJOYCE ( this is the RS . PEGGY HOPKINS place to drop out if you do n't want to hear about Mrs. Peggy Hopkins Joyce ) had a villa on the Riviera this summer  --  large , and run in considerable style , you better believe . During the season , a Broadway man of letters was invited to call afternoon . He was received in a large living-room , and no sooner were greetings over than Mrs. Joyce called out to several servants standing about , " Prepare the room for reading . " The lackeys and maids sprang about , fluffing up pillows , moving chaises-longues , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bring in the book . " A lackey made a rather formal entrance with a volume which Mrs. Joyce took and handed to her guest . She then requested that he sit down and read to her . Somewhat dazed , he did . He discovered that the book was " Mutt and Jeff , " but he betrayed no astonishment or emotion , gamely reading the lettering of the comic strips . After this had gone on a few minutes he thought to simplify things by omitting some of the exclamations , such as " Biff ! , " " Wham ! , " and " Wank ! " ( The last is the sound made when a skillet strikes a man 's head . ) Mrs. Joyce detected these omissions , however , obviously knowing the book by heart , and commanded her visitor not to leave them out . After that he did n't . The afternoon wore away . The Broadway gentleman does n't know whether his hostess was having him on or not , but he considers it all pretty strange . Pastoral LIMB on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about an artist in Westport , Connecticut . One bright sunny morning he was all ready to paint a picture for a very fine coatand-suit concern , showing a very fine gentleman in evening clothes , for publication in the Saturday Evening Post . His model , who was to come from town , failed to show up . There was no time to waste , and the artist , after a bit of fruitless telephoning , finally went out the door and returned later , leading an Italian gardener , who lived in a but down the road . He dressed this man in full evening garb , a two-hour feat which exhausted both artist and model . The result , however , was peculiarly pleasing : it turned out that the Latin gentleman , once washed and redecorated , was an ideal fashion plate . Further , he posed for seventy-five cents an hour , as against five dollars . Further , the picture was highly satisfactory to the clothing concern . The arrangement continues , the only difficulty being that the gardener ( the former gardener , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant raiment that he wears evening dress almost constantly , wandering softly about the fields and ditches , dreaming dreams and getting the pants nut of press . Sunbeam and Simplex ONE of the most conspicuous automobiles on the streets is a Sunbeam town car , done in tan , inside and out , with all sorts of frills on it . Recently one of our most diligent agents , who had seen it about Manhattan two or three times , encountered it in Fifth Avenue , Brooklyn . Over there it had attracted quite a crowd . People were standing about , wondering whose it was , when a sign-painter working near by stepped up to it , opened the door of the tonneau , took therefrom several cans of paint , and proceeded to mix the contents on the runningboard . Several people muttered about the car but the painter did n't say anything . Later the same day , coincidence playing a part , our agent was driving along a Brooklyn street when THE NEW YORKER 21 he saw the car parked before a delicatessen store . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with a big pot of coffee , got into the car , and drove off . Our agent followed . The man drove up before one of the most pretentious apartments in Ocean Avenue , got out , and went in , through the main entrance . This simply made the mystery deeper . Our man would have gone ahead and solved the whole thing , he says , but it was the day the Zeppelin was over Times Square and he had to get back to Manhattan for that . This brings us logically to Mr. Tiffany , the jeweller , and his cars . A man drove into an uptown garage with a very old machine , to have something fixed , and remarked to an attendant that probably they did n't see many cars as antiquated as this one of his . To this the garageman replied that Mr. Tiffany has two cars , both of them 1912 Simplex machines , and that he has driven only those two cars since he got them , before the war . They are of the old-fashioned , very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engines , and never has thought of getting a newer model . Sea Story MACJRICE WERTHEIM , of stocks , real estate , and the Theatre Guild , chartered a yacht this summer , loaded it with friends , and took them through the fiords of Norway . He was an interested and a busy host , hurrying about the boat to see that everybody had a good time , was happy , and did n't catch cold ; so solicitous that , after two or three weeks , one of his guests remarked , " My , my , Wertheim , I ca n't get rid of the idea that You 're working for me and that I ought to fire you . " About O'Neill AFRIEND of Eugene O'Neill just returned from a visit to him says that all reports about him have been exaggerated for a long time . It seems that the first wild items about him and his activities in the Far East were caused indirectly by his well-known aversion to publicity . The reporters were startled to find his name on a hotel register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't believe O'Neill would use his own name . This excited them to begin with , and then O'Neill was elusive , and they got all worked up . This really started the hullabaloo which has kept going ever since . Flamboyant descriptions of the ch  --  teau he has rented in France have exaggerated its grandeur . It is not a show place , simply an old residence on an estate owned by three noble ladies who rented it to the O'Neills furnished , for about half of what a four-room apartment rents in New York . It is without electricity and has but one bath . The former occupants retain the farming and gardening privileges on the estate , which comprises about seven hundred acres . O'Neill has dammed up a stream for a swimming pool , because he has never been without one on the grounds of any house he has owned or lived in . He still owns Peaked Hill , near Province-town , the first house he bought after fame and fortune took him out of Greenwich Village ; his house on Hamilton Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce arrangements ; and the other one he owned , near Ridgefield , Connecticut , has been sold . The Province-town house is two miles from that town and hard to reach , through sand and mosquitoes . Even so , a delegation from a woman 's college once grimly made its way there to petition him to write a play for the college girls , with eighteen women 's parts and no men . The playwright once said , possibly just after that visit , that his ideal home would he an estate in Siberia with a fifteen-foot wall and Russian wolfhounds inside and out . O'Neill has abandoned , at least for the time being , the two remaining parts of the religious trilogy which began with " Dynamo , " and is working on a new play . It wo n't be finished until well into 1930 and will not be produced until next season at the earliest . He used to write two full-length plays and some one-act pieces every year , but henceforth he expects to do no more than one long play every two seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thoroughly that his friends believe it deserves to be reviewed all over again . He cut the minister entirely out of the last act , added two new scenes , and otherwise altered the play . Of late years he has been cutting and changing his plays in various details every time a new edition is brought out . Wrong Right Number tT indignant gentleman called Lex- ington 3209 and got his number . " I want to report a dive on West Forty-fifth Street , " he began , meaning a speakeasy , when a thin prim voice at the other end of the wire interrupted . " We have nothing to do with contests conducted at public baths , " it remarked , and nobody seemed to be getting anywhere until the gentleman thought of asking with whom he was talking . It turned out that he was connected with the Boy Scouts of America , whose telephone number now is Lexington 3209 . Before that , it belonged to the Prohibition Administrator of New York .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
