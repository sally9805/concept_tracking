Cork , not Boston <P> Sirs : <P> A friend in Colorado has just sent me a clipping from your excellent magazine of June 10 , in which you quote me as asserting I had been jailed in Boston . I never said such a thing because the only place I ever was in jail was Cork , Ireland , where I was erroneously accused of having planned the battle of Kenmare , in which two tree Maters lost their lives . <P> I feel particularly sensitive about your casting such aspersions against Boston , as that was the only town in America where a speech of mine was quoted correctly . I had no idea , when I consented to give an interview in Walt Whitman 's house in Camden ( to help raise funds to make it fireproof ) that I would be letting myself in for so much unfortunate publicity . No sooner did I reach New York than someone showed me a clipping from the New York World saying that I " mourned for America " ( which is just the opposite of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ) and that I was jailed in Boston . A little while later I received an angry letter from my aunt , la Comtesse de Gabriac , saying that the Paris Herald had also reported me to be a jailbird . Simultaneously came various letters from California kidding me unmercifully about the same story carried by papers out there . The clipping from TIME was the fatal straw , and realizing that TIME will reach as nation-wide a public as all these other papers combined , I rely upon your courtesy to correct this mistake , and relieve Boston from calumny . <P> It is true that I am working my way around the world , partly for a novel I am writing , to be called Sea Change , and partly for the experience itself . . . . <P> CHESTER A. ARTHUR , JR. * <P> New York City . <P> Boston 's Buildings <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of July 15 you give a list of the United States cities which have buildings of 21 or more stories . In this list you state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only two-the Custom House Tower , 495 feet , and the United Shoe Machinery Building in process of erection , 27 stories . A third one is projected comprising 22 stories . There is one of 15 stories and two or three of 14 and a large number from ten to twelve . <P> For years the maximum height for buildings in Boston was 125 feet above the street . Three years ago this was changed to 155 feet , and today we have a most unique law which does not restrict the height of a building provided its cubical contents do not exceed the area of the lot times 155 . This represents the height of human ingenuity in determining how to solve traffic and light problems . <P> CHARLES N. FITTS <P> Boston , Mass . <P> <P> Aluminum Street Cars <P> Sirs : <P> Your issue of July 15 contains an error on page 13 . Pittsburgh is not the first city operating an aluminum street car . Cleveland had its first aluminum street car nearly two years ago . Come to Cleveland if you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders pay for them under the Taylor-Tom Johnson franchise . <P> WILLIAM F. KEES <P> Cleveland , Ohio . <P> <P> Hobo Argot <P> Sirs : <P> Evidently Max Feckler ( TIME , July 15 ) is a little confused in his own argot or lingo . First , he refers to the trainride-stealing American bum , and then refers to him as a hobo . There is no connection whatsoever between a bum and a hobo.
