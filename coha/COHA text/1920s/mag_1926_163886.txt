Between Indiana and Philadelphia lie some 600 miles of fat midlands , coal-seamed Alleghanies and factory-dotted coastal plains . It is a tedious train trip ; wise people take the sleeper . By automobile it is more pleasant ; the roads are excellent and through the Pennsylvania mountains there are gorgeous views . But best of all is to fly it . Then you can soar above the farmlands , circle and behold the cities like great wens on the face of nature , swoop up and over the mountains , dallying if you like on the long downward slant to peer off east to the continent 's end and the long Atlantic ground swell . Last week a boy of 14 , Farnan Parker of Anderson , Ind. , stepped into his plane and flew from his home to Philadelphia . He took his time , stopping twice en route , arriving in 18 hours . His mother , an accomplished aviatrix , was following him by train . He was more or less waiting for her . Then Farnan proceeded to Washington and sought out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the House , which applauded . Platis were arranged for Farnan to appear before the House Mili tary Committee , now investigating the national aircraft situation and give his testimony on what youth can , does and should do in the air . A licensed pilot since he was 13 , the young man can navigate the subtle technicalities of aeronautical theory quite as readily as he copes in practice with air-pockets , cross winds , cloud banks and wind squalls .
