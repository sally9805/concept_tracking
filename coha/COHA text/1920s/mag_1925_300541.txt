ERNESTINE SOPHIE-Sophia Cleugh-Macmillan ( $2.00 ) . <P> A little girl , most mysteriously derived , is living at an English parsonage when the Crown Prince of Nicomedia dies . A general and a count come to claim her for the little comic opera kingdom as its heir presumptive , the daughter of the King 's youngest son . For a girl in her early teens , Ernestine Sophie has admittedly a remarkable amount of poise , extraordinary insight and understanding . She likewise develops into an excellent shot with the revolver . So she goes to the intriguing little court and sets it upon its ear . The Princess finds two men who love her dearly , besides revolutionary plots and a near-revolution , but all are successfully quelled and at 16 Ernestine becomes Her Majesty . The story is one part Graustark , one part Prisoner of Zenda , and one part original merit . The original merit provides enough good characters to make entertainment . Highly to be recommended for consumption by maiden aunts and ingnues.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
