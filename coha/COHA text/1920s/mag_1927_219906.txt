Had they been interviewed , some people who figured in last week 's news might have related certain of their doings as follows : <P> John D. Rockefeller Jr. , philanthropist : " Moving men all last week carried furniture into the new 166-suite Thomas Garden Apartment that I have financed cheaply in lower Bronx , New York City . The goods belonged to bricklayers , electricians , policemen , streetcar men , firemen , bookkeepers , teachers , librarians and like members of the thrifty and shifted classes , for I have provided rooms at rents they can afford . Each tenant pays down $1,000 to $1,700 cash , and thereafter $64 to $100 monthly . Eventually he will own his apartment outright . All this I have made possible by financing the construction at exceedingly low interest rates .

S. this year as a royal polo player , accompanied by the team of young grandees with whom he plays habitually in Spain . " <P> Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands : " I do not read the U.
