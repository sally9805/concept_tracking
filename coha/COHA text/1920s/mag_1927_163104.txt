When a telephone operator refuses to give out the time , when she refuses even to repeat the number given her , but , instead , chirps pertly , " Thank you " - is she giving " good service " ? <P> The citizens of Sweden do not think so . Their lives are passed in a land where " service " is not advertised but given . From a Swedish telephone operator is expected the sort of unstinted satisfaction which a Swedish housemaid gives by shining the family shoes every day , doing the household wash and energetically scrubbing such members of the family as may deign to take a bath . Last week the telephone companies in Stockholm and Gothenburg announced a new era of luxurious telephoning typically Swedish . <P> Not only will Swedish switchboard girls continue to give out the time , but for a charge of 10 ore ( 2c ) , they will perform the following new types of super-service : <P> 1 ) Awaken a telephone subscriber at whatever hour may be designated . <P> 2 ) Continue to call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> 3 ) Answer calls made to a subscriber with a given message , such as that he is sick , busy , absent , but may be reached , later , at such-and-such an hour . <P> 4 ) Take messages during the subscriber 's absence and repeat them when he makes his return known . <P> Some citizens of the U. S. wondered last week , if this so " unAmerican " super-service is given over U. S.-made telephones . It is not . Swedes long ago refused to tolerate the heavy , antiquated type of instrument which requires two hands to lift it from the table and manipulate it . The " Made in Sweden " telephone is a one-handed device , weighing only a few ounces , combining the transmitter and receiver in a single mounting . Therefore , and because of their excellent quality , Swedish telephones have been very widely adopted for the newer installations in Europe , Asia , Latin America . <P> A quaint instance of Swedish cunning was observed in London , last week , when several large coffins were unloaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than packing cases of the same size , contained Swedish matches , were sold after the matches had been unpacked .
