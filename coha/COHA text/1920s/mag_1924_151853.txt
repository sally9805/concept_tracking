Bureaucratic centralization , standardization and maternalism seemed to be the aims of the 28th annual Congress of Parents and Teachers , meeting at the University of Minnesota , in the City of St. Paul . For the second consecutive year the theme was Adult Home Education . <P> Dr. John James Tigert , U. S. Commissioner of Education , suggested a program " to take the school and college to every home . " He pointed out that the vast majority failed to continue their education after leaving school . He proposed a coordination of the State Departments of Education , the American Library Association and the directors of university extension courses , with the Mothers and Parent-Teachers Associations . This coalition would be under the direction of the bureau of which he is the head . <P> According to Mrs. A. H. Reeve , of Philadelphia , President of the Congress , these agencies should give courses to help the vast majority who " stumble along the beaten track of parenthood by the uncertain light of their own experience . " Said she : <P> " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing , budgeting of time and strength , non-technical instruction in the laws of hygiene , the inspiration of exercise , the technique of rest ; home-furnishing and color-values ; art appreciation and a discriminating taste in literature ; the history of music and musicians ; psychology in graded lessons ; poetry-the very best , but what people really do like , not what they should like from the standpoint of a technician or a modernist ... a university course in training for parenthood , which shall include the mental , moral and physical education of children from earliest infancy through the high school age , to be supplemented by graded reading courses and required theses . " <P> Miss Charl O. Williams , field secretary of the National Educational Association , denounced the opposition to the proposed Federal Department of Education as coming from private and parochial schools and privately endowed universities . Said she : <P> " In the last six years I have crossed the continent six times and in one year I have been in 25 states . I believe that I am in a position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment and I assert that there are more children in the schools than there ever were before the dry law . " <P> The Convention ended by endorsing Law Enforcement , the proposed Federal Department of Education , the proposed Women 's Peace Conference , and expressing condemnation of the " filming " of salacious books and the subjection of children and animals " to cruel circumstances in the making of films .
