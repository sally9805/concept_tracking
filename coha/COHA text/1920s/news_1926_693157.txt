txt The Yale-Princeton Agreement . It is to be hoped that all lovers of true university sport appreciate the splendid significance of the recently announced YalePrinceton agreement not to scout each other 's football teams for the purpose of I getting information as to offense and defense . A well-coached team has developed mental and physical alertness . The practice of scouting and then Informing the team what to ' expect and what to guard against certainly does not contribute to mental alertness on the part of players , nor does it add to the zest of the final games on the part of both players and spectators . rt is too bad that Harvard has not yet subscribed to this agreement , as it should be the duty of these three great universities to initiate the best sportsmanlike practices in American intercollegiate games , and serve thus to de-Red Grange undergraduate athletics . Noblesse oblige . W. 0 . WATTERS JR . New York . Oct. 4. 3926.                    @
