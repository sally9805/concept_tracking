A THICK , black , oily cloud hangs over the parleys at Lausanne . But despite M. Barrere 's insistence upon good old-fashioned secrecy the newspaper correspondents manage to rescue a few stray bits of news . ( Some day a wise historian will do justice to the epic struggle of the American correspondents for open diplomacy  --  which , to them , is synonymous with " news " ? in these post-war years . ) We learn that the wily Turk is bargaining with might and main , with all the Western Powers together and with each one individually . Apparently he has bid higher than Greece for the friendship of Bulgaria and has thereby disrupted hopes of a new Balkan Alliance ; he might well be willing to make concessions in the troubled territory of West Thrace in return for solid compensations in truly Turkish territory . Apparently too the British would be willing to accept the fact of Turkish domination of the Straits  --  with some face-saving phrases  --  in return for unquestioned control of Mosul oil . But there the American representative joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any part of the world , and our State Department is right in objecting to the thieves ' bargains which the Allies made in wartime . But  --  well , we wish it were as zealous about the Open Door in some parts of the world nearer home , and in regions where there is no oi : T HE President has made as earnest an appeal to the Congress for his precious ship-subsidy measure as it is possible for him to make , but the Congress and the public have remained cold . The bill will doubtless slip through the House because of the cracking of the party lash , but it ought not to pass the Senate unless renegade Democratic votes can be purchased for it . Why should anybody vote for it except under party duress ? Baldly stated , the Lasker proposal to shipowners is this : the Government is losing $52,000,000 a year in this business ; therefore it wishes to unload upon private individuals . First , it offers them its ships at $30 a ton , when the prevailing price is $20 a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that three-quarters of the boats were badly designed and wastefully constructed , being planned with reference only to their usefulness as war-adjuncts and with no thought as to their usefulness after the war . Now , in order to induce anybody to consider buying damaged goods like these , the Government offers a bonus on the operation of all its ships , good or bad ; that is , it promises to make up their deficits in operation upon the theory that those deficits will be much less than its own . It pretends to know just about what those deficits will be , but the amounts it actually offers are far below its own pro rata losses , and , of course , there will be factors such as the coming in of the Diesel engine , which is revolutionizing all ocean traffic , the influence of which no man can estimate . So the country is asked to take a leap into total darkness and to establish once more the vicious principle of aiding a few privileged persons to carry on an economically unsound enterprise , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulk of our merchant fleet and selling the rest for what it will bring . I NSTEAD of appointing a " lame duck " to the Supreme Court President Harding has nominated a corporation lawyer . It is reported that Pierce Butler , lately general attorney for the Chicago , St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Omaha Railroad , was recommended by the Kellogg-Preus machine , but it is certain that the farmer-labor friends of Senator-elect Shipstead , who roundly trounced Senator Kellogg last month , are indignant that such a citizen of their State should go to the highest court of the land . Former Attorney General Wickersham also indorses him : he named him to prosecute the packers in 1910 . The case was , says Mr. Wickersham , " presented as well as it could be , although the packers were acquitted . " As regent of the University of Minnesota Mr. Butler showed his true colors . In 1917 Professor Schaper , head of the political science department , who had previously opposed Mr. Butler on railroad-tax questions , was called by telephone to appear before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Butler , was charged with " disloyalty " and dismissed without a for-
