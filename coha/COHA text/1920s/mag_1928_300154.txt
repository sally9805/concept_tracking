All Chicagoans , most excursionists to their World 's Fair , recall with mingled emotions the turreted and crenellated brownstone " castle " abutting on lower Lake Shore Drive . The two acres of pleasaunce surrounding it confirm the impression of burlesque medievalism , of an architect strong in his delusion that a parapet here , a battlement there , comprise the ancient dignity of Kenilworth , Warwick , Elsinore , Tintagel . <P> Despite its atrocious style , its incongruity in a bracket of sheer apartment houses , those familiar with the castle 's tradition regard it affectionately , reverently . For here live the Potter Palmers . <P> With a horse , Ulysses loosed destruction over Troy . In 1871 , Mrs. O'Leary did the same for Chicago with a petulant cow , which shattered an oil lantern in its straw-lined stall . Flames ran amuck , ravaged the straggling town , left it blackened , hollow , crisp . Disconsolate , penniless , young Potter Palmer stood in the ashes of his home . Suddenly , where was Bertha ? Bertha had borrowed a buggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an extension of credit . New York agreed , and-phoenix-like-Chicago and the Potter Palmers soared together . <P> The Palmer House Hotel was built , the castle was built in 1885 . Thence Mrs. Palmer ruled as absolute empress of society ; her invitations an accolade , a command . At the World 's Fair , she was hostess to the Infanta Eulalie of Spain ; Duke and Duchess d'Aragona , descendants of Columbus ; Princess Schahovska , Prince Cernoski , and Prince Isenberg of Russia . Mrs. Palmer summoned , too , Prince Henry of Prussia . Prince Henry was disdainful . " Is royalty to be guest of an innkeeper 's wife ? " Royalty was . Prince Henry came . <P> Encouraged by this signal triumph , Mrs. Palmer sought other worlds to conquer . London beckoned . Forthwith she purchased a house on Carlton Terrace ; flung down the gauntlet to Mrs. John W. Mackay for King Edward 's favor , and the social leadership it carried . The tourney was magnificent . For one Arabian night 's entertainment in 1909 , Mrs. Palmer spent $10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to discriminate ; shared his attendance equally . <P> Mrs. Palmer returned to the U. S. ; rested on her laurels . In 1918 , she died at Sarasota , Fla. , bequeathing her collection of Corot , Bissavis , Whistler , Monet , Millet , to the Chicago Art Institute ; her castle and fortune to Potter Palmer , Jr . <P> Many an imperial legend clusters about her name . One is traced to American-girl-glorifier Ziegfeld . Then managing strong man Sandow 's tour , he boldly invited Mrs. Palmer to the dressing-room . Pantie-clad , Sandow 's bulging thews , barrel chest , excited her admiration . " What marvelous muscles ! " Sandow tautened his biceps . " Feel them , " he said . Mrs. Palmer did . Precedent was established . Thenceforward , claims Ziegfeld , thirty women appeared after each performance , prodded and pinched the chuckling Sandow.
