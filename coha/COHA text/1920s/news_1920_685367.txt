txt Paradoxical as seems the case of WILLIAM BAUER , it is characteristic of the predicament into which the world of labor has fallen . BAUER was a " white collar " worker , struggling to support a family on $21 a week . Large sums of money passed through his hands  --  with the exception of some $700 which he held out to meet his family expenses . The time came when he could no longer conceal his embezzlements . Laying aside his white collar , he took a job as longshoreman . As an unskilled laborer he not only supported his family but saved enough to pay back the stolen money . The long way round was the short way home . The longshoremen , be it noted , were on strike . They declared that they were not receiving a " living wage " and cited figures based upon a report from the Commissioner of Labor at Washington to show that a family can not live properly on less than $2,800 a year . In asserting their " right to happiness " they held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon business and adding materially to the expenses of the community  --  including , of course , the white collar worker . But what was " unhappiness " to them afforded BAUER the means of feeding and clothing his family and , furthermore , of regaining an honest name . We are speaking in terms of an individual , but what we are describing is the predicament of an entire class . It is the class of brain workers , whose education requires years of application and the expense of thousands of dollars . The advantage of the manual laborer consists in the fact that he is organized . Time was when his economic plight was intolerable . History has no more heroic tale of struggle , blind and misguided though it has often been , than that by which the poor and the ignorant straggled free from the burden of the old economic order and gained the full standing of today . But it is one thing to have sachieved a giant 's strength and another to use it like a giant . The plight of Wnusii BAUER. with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wages and prices spiral upward , is the plight of brain workers everywhere ? ministers , college professors , officers in the army and navy . From the burden which the war has imposed upon the nations two classes have struggled free . They are the so-called profiteer , whose exactions have been great enough in all conscience , and the organized laborer , who through interruptions of the processes of trade and transportation has inflicted upon the nation a loss which is indeterminable but possibly greater . They are the modern millstones between which the brain worker is ground to an ever more impotent pulp . Those who indulge in prophecy say that the brain workers will organize as the hand workers have done . In England . a Middle Class Union has sprung up which , in the recent transportation strike , dealt organized labor blow for blow . A similar movement is talked of in New York . But the strike-breaking of the English Middle Class Union was made possible by the fact that large numbers of discharged service men were still unemployed . Whether the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any case It would require decades , perhaps generations , to develop an adequate organization of the brain workers . The individual , meantime , has a remedy made to his hand  --  the remedy of W/LLIAM BAUER . He , and he only , gave the overalls movement r. thoroughly practical form . In , an interview recently recorded in the Sunday - TIMES the President of the Erie Railroad pointed out that the heads of the chief lines in the country rose from the ranks , beginning as callboy , messenger boy , warehouseman , axeman , rodman , trainman , brakeman , fireman , locomotive engineer . The President of the Central Railroad of New Jersey , bearing similar testimony , emphasized how little skill is necessary to carry a man of character and ability forward to positions that pay as highly as a 631-lege professorship or the Governorship of a State . " A boy green from the farm , if he is husky and strong , " after being coached as fireman for one or two trips upon the locomotive , " has acquired " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance . By the end of the week " he is an experienced fireman . " If the conductor takes him in hand , " by the " end of the week he becomes a full " fledged trainman . " In conclusion , Mr. BESLER said : " I " agree with Uncle JOE CANNON , how " ever , that a college education is moth " ing against a man . " His chance of advancement is many times redoubled . And for those who take a broader view of the situation there is this also to be considered : Every man who quits the crowded ranks of brain labor betters the condition of those who remain .
