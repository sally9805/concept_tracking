THE INGENIOUS HIDALGO ! MIGUEL CERVANTES - Hans Ryner - Harcourt , Brace ( $2.75 ) . Ingenious also , Arthur Ryner has imagined the biography of Cervantes in the days of his age , when , as he finised Don Quixote and wrote Persiles y Sigismunda , he saw the dear sun waning and Death , be cause he laughed at it , " coming to him like a raillery . " Author Ryner has well conjured the situations - Cervantes in Madrid , surrounded by poverty , influential enemies and with Death for a friend in need . Cervantes in Esquivias , draining the gay fountain of his wit , writing a happy and fantastic story as if thus to postpone the conclusion of his own fantasy
