Currently there are slightly less diphtheria , infantile paralysis , measles and typhoid in the U. S. than at this period last year , and slightly more meningitis , scarlet fever . Smallpox also has increased considerably in 1929 . But very few U. S. people now die of smallpox . During the last week of November , when the U. S. Public Health Service last compiled statistics , there was not one smallpox death reported in the entire country . At the same period there were 676 deaths from influenza and pneumonia , much less than last year . <P> This relatively light incidence of influenza has not , however , abated fear of and interest in this respiratory disease . When the University of Chicago officially announced that its Isidore Sydney Falk had isolated the causative germ , the Streptococcus polymorphous ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) , the news spread with the celerity of a political or murder despatch . From London Dr. David Thomson , who has worked on the same problem , said : " Proving that one has discovered the true germ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in animals by this germ in pure cultures . . . this is a very important part of the American 's discovery . " <P> However , Dr. Morris Fishbein , editor of the American Medical Association 's Journal , with his usual salutary skepticism , editorialized : " With little if any apparent warrant , it is again announced , for at least the tenth time in five years , that the causative organism of influenza has been discovered and that it is hoped to prepare a vaccine . There is thus far little or no evidence in scientific medical literature , or even in spoken addresses , to indicate that I. S. Falk , Ph.D. , and his associates have progressed any further toward the solution of this problem than have workers in other parts of the world , now or in the past . " <P> Reported Dr. Falk : " All I can say is that I made my report before the Bacteriology Club of the University of Chicago and the evidence will shortly be in print in more detailed form . " <P> Supplemented Dr. William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very thoughtful piece of work , whether or not he has found the influenza germ. "
