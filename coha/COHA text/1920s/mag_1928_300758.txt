England , the cradle of the Railway , is still served by world 's fastest non-stop trains . Last week , England 's first regularly operating sleeping-bus service , a rival of its railways , began operation . Twelve sleepers rumbled out of Newcastle in the premiere sleeping-bus , which made the 254-mile run to London before breakfast time . On the way the bus stopped at Darlington Station from which , in 1825 , chuffed forth the first steam train . Each sleeper was served " early morning tea " in his sleeping-berth.
