Selden Palmer Spencer , Republican , and junior U. S. Senator from Missouri , died suddenly in Washington , D. C , after an apparently successful operation for hernia . <P> The Nation remembered him as an irreconcilable opponent of Woodrow Wilson , as chief defender of Truman H. Newberry , who was eventually driven from the Senate , as a leading apologist for the Teapot Dome Lease . <P> But he meant much more to Missouri . Two years after he had received his diploma from Yale , he went to live in St. Louis and , as Professor of Medical Jurisprudence , associated himself with the Missouri Medical College in the early days of that institution . When only 34 , he became a judge , speedily earned a sobriquet of honor : " Iron Judge . " In his post-judicial days , he put iron into the feeble Republican Party and was at least partly responsible for Missouri 's voting for Republican Presidents in ' 04 , ' 08 , ' 20 , ' 24 . He was one of the few Republicans elected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1918-25 ) longer than any Republican predecessor . <P> Assistant Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis was considered likely to succeed to the Senate seat by appointment . Mr. Davis ' association with international tennis is typical of a new cosmopolitanism in politics . He is not of the Old , but of the Coolidge " New Guard . "
