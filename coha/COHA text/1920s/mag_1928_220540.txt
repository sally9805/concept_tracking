From a chamber of commerce standpoint no convention sugar plum is sweeter than the League of Nations . It never quite adjourns . The Permanent Secretariat teems constantly with women &; young women directed by a few males . Several times a year there are big convention weeks when the Council meets , or the Assembly , or both . Moreover the League draws smart and moneyed spectators to neighboring hotels . For seven years the League plum has meant rich lickings to the Swiss city of Geneva . Suddenly , last week , President Edmund Schulthess of Switzerland learned with hopping indignation that the Austrian Government is now definitely bidding in the manner of a chamber of commerce to entice the League to Vienna . <P> Naturally Monsignor Seipel , Chancellor of Austria did not trumpet his proposal , last week , like a blatant babbitt . The Chancellor is by nature as silent as a turtle . Quietly he slipped off to Prague , Czechoslovak capital . There , last week , he conferred with Foreign Minister Dr. Eduard Benes , best-posted diplomat in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a city near the inflammable Balkans . Presently close-lipped Chancellor Seipel said : <P> " It has not been officially proposed to the Austrian Government that the League should be moved to Vienna . ... I am not opposed to the plan . " <P> Any statement more positive than this double negative would have given Switzer land ground for offense ; but Chancellor Seipel had made his meaning crystal clear . He heads a Republican Government which would gladly offer to the League for a headquarters the old , enormous , sumptuous Imperial Palace of the Habsburgs at Vienna . Thus the League would save itself the expense of building a new headquarters at Geneva to replace the present ramshackle Secretariat and the mouldering Salle de la Reformation ( where the Assembly sits ) . Reputedly the League has considered spending 1,000,000 on its proposed new buildings and most of that could be saved by moving to Vienna . <P> The other side of the sugar plum is that Austria needs desperately some such bolstering of her commerce as the perpetual League convention would provide . The factories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with that shorn away Vienna is choked with what she can produce but can not sell . <P> Significantly at this point enters the question of Anschluss : the much- mooted union of Austria with Germany . Such union is believed by many economists to be vital to the commercial survival of Austria . It could be made unnecessary by moving the League to Vienna . But Germans want Anschluss , want to absorb Austria . Therefore Germany , with a Council Seat on the League , may be expected to fight tooth and claw any move to move the League . <P> Throughout the week Chancellor Seipel masked the import of his visit to Prague under the excuse that he was there to lecture on The World Outlook . This he dutifully did before a huge , enthusiastic audience in which sat and applauded Dr. Benes , biggest little statesman in Europe .
