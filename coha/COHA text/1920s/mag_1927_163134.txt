Twenty-two red legs carrying eleven redskins were throbbing over the 480-mile Redwood Highway between San Francisco and Grant 's Pass , Ore . The red lips of Miss Redwood Empire , " little fawn " of the Hopi Indians , greeted John Mad Bull of the Karook tribe when he staggered across the finish line last week-the winner of the marathon . He had covered the 480 miles ( longest footrace ever held in the U. S. ) in 7 days , 12 hours , 34 minutes . He was rewarded with a $1,000 prize , to which he added $50 to purchase an automobile . <P> Eight hours later , to Grant 's Pass came Flying Cloud of the Karooks to receive $500 . And then , while a fellow redskin trotting beside him played old airs on a harmonica , came 55-year-old Melika of the Zuni tribe to receive plaudits befitting a barrel-chested old age . <P> Other runners : Fighting Stag , Rushing Water , Falcon , Big White Deer , Sweet Eagle , Chochee , Jamon.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
