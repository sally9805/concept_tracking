txt // the hours from 3:30 to 6:00 on school days , and all day on Saturdays . Only in this way can the school be kept clean without employing a larger janitorial staff than is needed during that part of the day when school is in session . 2 . School janitors are frequently incapable of performing their tasks efficiently . In many school systems where the superintendent of schools is given a free hand in the employment of teachers , and where only welltrained and competent teachers are employed , the board of education reserves the right to appoint school janitors on a political or a philanthropic basis . The result of this practice is that school janitors are frequently physically incapable of performing their work efficiently . In many other cases they are lazy and incompetent , and entirely lacking in decent standards of cleanliness and sanitation. 3 . School janitors have not been trained in the proper performance of their duties . Very few schools have undertaken the important task of instructing the janitorial staff in the proper performance of their tasks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best study of this subject , and one that is commended to school administrators and teachers to the end that they may pass on the information to the janitorial staff , is An Analysis of janitorial Service in Elementary Schools by Reeves . It is published by the Bureau of Publications , Teachers College , Columbia University , New York City . This study , which was a doctor 's dissertation in Teachers College , makes a thorough analysis of the janitor 's duties , and a careful // study of the most efficient way to perform each of these duties . 4 . School janitors have not been supplied with proper equipment for performing their duties properly . Duties of the school janitor. ? The following duties and methods should be impressed upon the janitorial staff of the school . 1 . Schoolrooms , corridors , and stairways should be swept thoroughly every day . There is no excuse for doing this work less frequently . The majority of school rooms are not swept daily because there are generally too many janitors during that part of the school day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient number during the hours when this work can be done . All sweeping should be done after the close of the afternoon session of school . Brooms should never be used . If the school is not equipped with a vacuum cleaning system , brushes should be used . All dusting should be done in the morning , at least one half hour before children are admitted to the building . Under no circumstances should janitors be permitted to sweep the rooms , corridors , or stairways at times other than those indicated above . 2 . Woodwork should be dusted once each week . 3 . Walls , window shades , wall pictures , and other decorations should be dusted at least once each month . 4 . Windows should be washed at least three times each year on the outside , and once each month on the inside . 5 . Blackboards should be thoroughly cleaned by the janitor every other day . // 6 . Erasers should be cleaned thoroughly by the janitor every other day . 7 . Chalk trays should be cleaned daily . 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be oiled . The practice of oiling other schoolrooms is of doubtful value , provided provision can be made for cleaning them sufficiently often . The frequency with which classrooms should be scrubbed depends upon whether or not oil is used on the floors . Floors which are not oiled should be scrubbed every two weeks . In kindergarten and primary rooms , where the children sit on the floor frequently , the floors should be scrubbed once each week . When floors are oiled , oil should be applied sparingly . They should be scrubbed several times during the year , and fresh oil applied . 9 . Seats and desks should be thoroughly cleaned at least once each month . io . Wash bowls , sinks , and drinking fountains should be cleaned daily . I z . Toilet rooms should be cleaned daily . 12 . The entire building should be given a thorough general cleaning at least twice each year . If the teacher is not to be expected to do part of the janitorial work , and she should not be expected to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner such as that suggested above , it will readily be seen that additional help will be needed during those hours when this work can be done . If school officials will take the trouble to budget the time of the janitorial staff properly they will in many cases be able to secure efficient servMAKING // ice , such as that outlined above , without any considerable increase in the cost of the janitorial service . Decorations. ? Many schoolrooms have entirely too many decorations . Very few schoolrooms present an attractive appearance . The following suggestions regarding the selection and arrangement of decorations should be helpful : I. Avoid dust catchers. 2 . Do not keep children 's work on display after it has served its usefulness . In some schoolrooms these displays are permitted to accumulate throughout the year , and even over a number of years , with the result that these rooms have a very untidy appearance . 3 . Select decorations on the basis of children 's interests , rather than on the basis of adult interests . ( A small number of very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap , unattractive decorations . This is particularly true of pictures. ) 4 . Try to secure proper balance and proportion in the arrangement of decorations . This principle is well illustrated in the arrangement of pictures in the thirdgrade classroom , a photograph of which is reproduced opposite page 30 . Notice that the frames of these pictures are smooth and straight . It is easy to keep them tree from dust . 6 . Hang wall decorations as low as possible . The presence of blackboards makes this problem a difficult one in most classrooms . 7 . If plants are kept in the classroom , arrange them in such a way that they will not obstruct light . This may be accomplished either by having a plant box , // placed entirely below the window , with only the plants extending into the light , or by suspending the plants from brackets fastened to the wall between the windows , as was done in the illustration opposite page 30. 8 . There should be a room bulletin board . The material for the bulletin board should be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children can see it easily . Material on the bulletin board should be arranged according to interest , and should be arranged in such a way as to present an attractive appearance . All four corners of mounts should be fastened to the bulletin board . When material has served its usefulness it should be removed . Material on the bulletin board should be kept free from dust , and in a sanitary condition . The color of the bulletin board should harmonize with the color scheme of the room . 9 . Do not use window curtains , and do not place in the windows objects that will obstruct light . Ventilation. ? We have been accustomed to believe that a school building which was not equipped with a fan system of ventilation could not be properly ventilated . For a number of years it has been a commonly accepted practice in providing for the ventilation of classrooms that there should be admitted into the classroom thirty cubic feet of air per minute per pupil . This standard can not be met without resorting to forced ventilation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended upon ventilating systems in school-building construction . Recent studies of the subject have tended to discredit the notion that it is necessary to admit thirty cubic feet of air per minute // per pupil , as well as several other commonly accepted theories of ventilation . Two studies which have thrown considerable light on this subject are the Report of the New York State Commission on Ventilation , and The Ventilation of School Buildings by McClure , published by the Bureau of Publications , Teachers College , Columbia University , New York City . In Ohio , the State Industrial Commission requires that such ventilation should be provided as to secure six changes of air per hour . Under ordinary conditions of occupancy this is about equivalent to the standard of thirty cubic feet of air per minute per pupil . Research which has been made in this subject would seem to indicate that there is no justification for this standard , and that its application has resulted in the needless expenditure of millions of dollars in school-building construction . Many teachers work in school buildings where this expensive equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used for years . In the majority of school buildings which are equipped with ventilating systems the fan is used only during that part of the year when heat is used . It is certainly obvious that if forced ventilation is necessary part of the year it should be necessary all of the time . The best advice about ventilation seems to be that mechanical ventilation is not essential for school buildings except in special cases , such as very noisy locations in which it is inadvisable to open the windows , or exceptionally dusty or malodorous surroundings . In the Report of the New York State Commission on Yen36 HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION Illation it is stated that schoolrooms provided with window deflectors , with radiators beneath the windows , and with exhaust ducts , may be successfully ventilated throughout the winter season without fans . It has been urged as an argument for forced ventilation that teachers are careless about providing window ventilation . Those who have worked in school buildings provided with mechanical ventilation systems know that there is very little truth in this argument , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , even where forced ventilation is provided . The following statements regarding ventilation seem to be justified , for they are the result of scientific re-search : i . The factors of primary importance in ventilation are air temperature , relative humidity , and air movement . 2 . The most important factor in ventilation is temperature . The most desirable temperature for schoolrooms is from 65 ? to 68 ? Fahrenheit. 3 . The chief cause of danger in badly ventilated rooms is overheating . 4 . High temperature combined with high humidity is especially harmful , because the effect of high humidity is a decrease in the heat loss from the body . 5 . Air movement is especially desirable because it facilitates the loss of body heat by the evaporation of moisture from the skin . 6 . Dust , bacteria , organic poison in expired air , odors and carbon dioxide have been considered as being much more important in the ventilation problem than // they actually are . The presence of objectionable body odors in the classroom should not be considered a ventilation problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing . 7 . The system of window air supply with gravity exhaust seems to be the most desirable way to handle ventilation under ordinary conditions . 8 . Schools that depend upon window ventilation should use window deflectors to prevent direct drafts . These deflectors should be of glass in order not to obstruct light . CHAPTER IV MENTAL HYGIENE Mental hygiene as here considered has to do with the individual 's happiness , his relations with his fellows , his aims and purposes in life , his efficiency , and the freedom from conflict that should characterize his daily life . It is not difficult to justify the inclusion of a consideration of mental hygiene in a series of talks to teachers on the school health program , for the aims of mental hygiene will surely never be attained in an individual whose physical condition is not good . Similarly , physical condition is largely dependent upon mental hygiene . The child 's mental attitude. ? When the child comes to school for the first time he comes with certain welldefined attitudes toward school , toward authority , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward other children , toward play , toward himself . The wise teacher will take all of these things into account in inducting the child into his first school experiences . She must not expect a right attitude on the part of every child toward all of the new situations . Neither should she expect changes from wrong attitudes to right ones to be abrupt . She must see to it that desirable changes are gradually but surely made . The child 's personality , his attitudes and prejudices , his 38 // thoughts and feelings , and his ideals are well developed at the time of his entrance to school . They are capable of modification , but not of sudden uprooting without danger of serious consequences to the child . We must remember that the child is a personality before we ever get him . That personality must be respected . The attitudes and prejudices , feelings and emotions that the six-year-old will bring with him to school on the first day are as varied as the kinds of homes from which the children come . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to bring with them at the time of their first entrance to the public school . i . That teacher and principal must be feared . This attitude is one of the most common of all . Many parents and older brothers and sisters take delight in teasing the young child about the terrible experiences he will encounter when he starts to school . They , like so many teachers , have failed to respect the personality of the child . They do not realize that his thoughts and feelings , his prejudices , his fears , and his dislikes are as important to him as theirs are to them . So they tell him about some kind of spanking machine which the principal has in his office for punishing little boys and girls who do not obey . They tell him what the teacher will do to him if his behavior is not good . Part of this is for the purpose of insuring good behavior on the part of the child , frequently with a sincere desire to help the child make his adjustment to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such parental precautions . The result is that the child // comes to school in fear and trembling . He has to be brought to school , he cries , and is afraid when his mother leaves him . The child who comes to school with such an attitude has created for himself and for his teacher a most serious problem . 2 . That the strange boys and girls he is meeting for the first time are not nice . Parents are naturally solicitous regarding the friendships which their children will form at school . They realize that they are relinquishing a large measure of the control which they have been able in the past to exercise over the child 's contacts with other children . In their attempts to safeguard him against bad companions they may prejudice him against all of his playmates. 3 . That he must fight whenever anybody does anything to him , or that he must never fight . The result is that some children come to school ready for battle . They are quarrelsome , and have frequent fights . Others , having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first sign of difficulty on the playground . Their playmates soon find this out and impose upon them , and they are thoroughly unhappy . q .. That school will be an unpleasant place , and the work awfully difficult . Unfortunately the recollection that parents have of their own school days frequently leads them to make such statements to their children . Many parents have not spent enough time in the modern schools attended by their children to enable them to have an adequate notion of the spirit of the modern school . It is very difficult for them to conceive of a school as a happy place , and of work so interesting that // it is a pleasure to do it . So the children approach the modern school with a notion that it will be similar to the school which their parents attended . 5 . That people will " pick " on him . Many people , particularly those of low economic status , have , consciously or unconsciously , given their children to understand that they can not expect to be treated fairly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . Such a defensive attitude is quite common in young children , who come to school suspicious of teacher and classmates. 6 . That everybody should pay attention to him . This attitude is encountered most commonly in the child who comes from the " one-child " family . Such a child has been accustomed to having everything done for him . He has not learned to be a cooperating member of a group . He has been accustomed to having people treat him as a center of interest . He expects to find the same condition at school . 7 . That certain subjects will be especially difficult . The school meets this problem with the introduction of each new subject . If a parent had difficulty with arithmetic he solemnly warns the child that he must expect to have difficulty with that subject . Consequently he begins his work in arithmetic , assured in advance that he is going to have a terrible time with it . The teacher 's task. ? What is the teacher to do , especially the primary teacher , who encounters all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present themselves to her for their first experiences in school ? She must set about the task of replacing wrong // attitudes with right ones . She must not just order these right attitudes . It will do no good simply to tell the child who fears her that he must not fear . Her actions must assure the child that he has nothing to fear . It will not help to squelch the child who thinks he should receive more than his share of attention . He really believes he is entitled to this attention . He must be brought gradually to see that he is one of a group , and that he must be a cooperating member . The child who expects to be treated unfairly must have an abundance of evidence that he will always receive fair treatment . Most important of all , the first-grade teacher must not expect children to make the transition from a life of complete freedom to one of comparative restraint immediately . Important transitions are not made that way . The teacher must accept her children as she finds them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shortcomings . She can not will them suddenly to be different . It will be her task to lead them gradually and sympathetically to become the kind of group that she wishes them to be . The kindergarten and the nursery school. ? If the kindergarten is to be able to justify its continued existence it will be because it serves as an important agency in preparing the child for induction into the school . The nursery school seems to be making a real contribution in this direction . In the past the kindergarten has not done this to any marked extent . In fact , it has frequently been charged that it had the opposite effect . To the extent that this has been true , it has been due // to the fact that primary teachers and kindergarten teachers had so little in common , and that each group failed properly to understand and to interpret the aims and purposes of the other . The present tendency to train kindergarten teachers and primary teachers in kindergarten-primary courses should help to remedy this situation . The following are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can serve to prepare the child for proper induction into school life : z . By correcting wrong attitudes toward school . 2 . By allaying fears . 3 . By discovering and securing the correction of physical defects . 4 . By correcting stammering or stuttering . 5 . By helping the child discard baby talk . 6 . By assisting the child in overcoming shyness , moodiness , and stubbornness . 7 . By giving special attention to the nervous child . 8 . By assisting the child to overcome undesirable habits , such as thumb-sucking. 9 . By teaching the spoiled child and the child who is too individualistic to work as a cooperating member of a social group . 1o . By determining when the child is ready for school entrance . ( This will be accomplished through the administration of mental tests , behavior tests , etc. ) i . By assisting parents to make the mental adjustment necessary in sharing the control of the child with the school . // 12 . By making provision for the child who is mentally ready but not physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past the kindergarten has probably failed in this last requirement more than in any other . There seems to be little reason why many children in the kindergarten should not do considerable work in beginning reading , especially the pre-primer work . Kindergarten teachers have usually taken the position that this work has no place in the kindergarten , in spite of the fact that many kindergarten children are extremely anxious to begin reading . If the kindergarten will devote itself wholeheartedly to such a program as that outlined above it will find its services much more greatly appreciated by the public and by school officials than they have been in the past . The mental health of the teacher. ? Mental hygiene is as much needed for teachers as it is for children . The teacher who is nervous and who " flies off the handle " is very apt to produce nervousness in her children . Of all the desirable personal qualities in teachers , probably none is more desirable than an even temper and a sunny disposition . Of all the failures in personal qualities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these traits . The nature of the teacher 's work possibly tends to produce nervousness and irritability . Children are frequently annoying . Teachers are notably conscientious and painstaking . The community generally expects them to conduct themselves as models of behavior to // the rising generation , both in school and out . It is little wonder that this consciousness of being constantly on duty gets on the teachers ' nerves . Part of the remedy for this condition is to be found in proper work habits . Teachers should not have to devote more than one evening a week to their school work , grading papers and the like . Many teachers attempt to take extension courses or correspondence courses . This is frequently a mistake . Teachers generally do not take enough exercise and recreation . It may be mentioned here that chaperoning school parties is not recreation for the teacher . Teachers spend too much time in the company of their colleagues talking shop , when they are off duty . The wise teacher will plan to find some time each day when she can forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a private citizen . Cooperation with the home. ? As is true of every other phase of the school health program , the mental health of the school child will be found to be closely related to home conditions . It has been suggested that the kindergarten and the nursery school can help solve this problem . But many schools do not have kindergartens and nursery schools . In any case , it is essential that the school and the home should work in close cooperation on this problem . No parent wishes to give his child wrong attitudes toward school . No parent desires to cause his child to be unsocial in his tendencies . No parent wants his child to hate arithmetic . Yet parents do cause all of these undesirable things and many more . It is the function of the school , and of the // individual teacher , to help the parents not to inculcate wrong attitudes and prejudices in their children . The parent-teacher association , the room mothers ' club , and similar agencies are the means at the teacher 's disposal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Chapter I of this book it was pointed out that one of the modern developments in health education in elementary schools has been the large amount of emphasis given to securing the practice of health habits . The peculiar applicability to health education of that definition of learning which states that a thing has been learned only when it modifies the behavior of the learner was also pointed out in the first chapter . If we could be sure that the child was practicing the health habits that he should practice , we would not need to be greatly concerned about the knowledge of physiology and hygiene that he possessed . Some writers have gone so far as to suggest that there should be no formal instruction in physiology and hygiene in the first six grades , and that nearly all of the instructional emphasis in this subject should be given to the teaching of , and securing the practice of , desirable health habits . Still other writers on this subject , conscious of the need of preparing the child to meet the health problems of adult life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits on a real comprehension of the workings of the human body , and of the factors which make for health and disease . 47 // All are agreed that the formation of right health habits is an absolutely indispensable element in the modern school health program . Health habits in the primary grades. ? It would probably be not far wrong to say that in the primary grades relatively little attention need be given to making the child conscious of the reasons why certain health habits should be acquired . The formation of the habit is the important thing . He does not need to be made to reflect why it is desirable for him to come to school with a clean handkerchief instead of with a soiled one , or with no handkerchief at all . He should simply become accustomed to the notion that remembering to take a clean handkerchief before he starts to school each day is just one of the things which he should do . Health habits in the intermediate grades. ? By the time the child reaches the intermediate grades , particularly the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give some consideration to the reasons why certain health habits are desirable . He will be interested in the consequences of the failure to observe these health habits . He may become conscious of certain principles out of which the health habits that he has acquired have been developed . I Efforts to secure the practice of desirable health habits. ? We have made considerable progress and many mistakes in learning how to teach desirable health habits and how to secure the practice of them by children . In various school systems and by various childhealth agencies there have been developed some very elaborate and detailed schemes which have for their // purpose securing the practice of health habits . One of the most interesting of these programs was the plan which was known as the Modern Health Crusade . It provided for an inspection each day for health habits , for the keeping of the health habits record for each child , and for the awarding of badges of merit and the conferring of titles , such as " squire , " " knight , " etc . Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in the practice of health habits . Two general criticisms have been made against the majority of these plans . They are : i . The machinery was too elaborate . Sometimes the amount of record keeping was too great . Frequently teachers and children grew tired of the device because of its very elaborateness , and in giving up the device , gave up also the practice of the health habits that the device was intended to stimulate . 2 . The inspection involved inspecting for health habits , the presence of which could not be determined objectively . For example , it is one thing to determine whether a child has a clean handkerchief , or clean face and hands , but it is quite another thing to determine whether he brushed his teeth before coming to school . The result was that in too many instances the child was motivated to lie . The greater the interest of the children in the reward which was given for a perfect record , the greater was the likelihood that they would depart from the truth in the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one row was pitted against another . Here the child feared to // tell the truth because of the certainty of incurring group disapproval . Standards for health-habits inspection. ? The criticisms mentioned above , however , do not establish a case against the health-habits inspection . It is believed that the health-habits inspection , properly conducted and properly safeguarded , constitutes one of the best means for securing the practice of certain health habits . The following standards for the health-habits inspection are suggested : I. It should occur each morning at the opening of school . 2 . The total time consumed should not exceed five minutes . 3 . It should be thoroughly objective in its nature ? that is , only those health habits should be inspected for , the presence or absence of which can readily be observed by any competent inspector . Children should not be asked , in connection with the inspection , whether they have practiced other health habits . The following health habits are suggested as representative of those which should be included in the health-habits inspection : i . Clean handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ q .. Clothing in order , and free from avoidable dirt 5 . Clean shoes 6 . Clean finger nails of proper length // Technique for conducting the health-habits inspection. ? In the primary grades the teacher should conduct the health-habits inspection herself . She may do this , either by the method illustrated in the frontispiece , of having the children pass in front of her , or she may pass rapidly down the aisles , inspecting the children in their seats . In grades above the second it is desirable to have children conduct the health-habits inspection . Again , either of two methods will be found satisfactory . In the method illustrated below , the children passed in front of the room inspectors , while one member was responsible for making a record of the inspection . The other method suggested is to have an inspector for each row who inspects the children in their seats . Where children participate in making the inspection it is necessary to see that a proper attitude is developed both on the part of the inspectors and of those who are inspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent opportunity for citizenship training . It is desirable to have the inspectors elected by the group . Certain standards for eligibility as an inspector should be agreed upon . One of the citizenship problems is to persuade the children to vote for the children who will make the best inspectors , regardless of their personal preferences . Another problem in connection with the use of children as inspectors is that of avoiding the humiliation of any child as a result of the inspection . The photographs reproduced in the frontispiece and opposite page 54 , which illustrate the health-habits in52 HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION spection , were taken in the first and sixth grades of the Elementary Training School at Ohio University . Health habits not subject to inspection. ? It is evident from the above discussion that there are many health habits which must be taught which should not be made the subject of inspection . What is the best method of securing the practice of these ? In general , two methods are suggested . Some of these health habits should be taught to the children themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inspected for , should be made known to the parents . Some of the health habits which should be taught to children , in addition to those for which an inspection is made , are : i . Brushing teeth at least twice each day . ( The proper method of cleaning the teeth should also be taught. ) 2 . Keeping open at least one window in the bedroom at night . 3 . Refraining from drinking coffee and tea . 4 . Sleeping II2 to 13 hours a day ( according to age ) . 5 . Eating only at regular times . 6 . Using an individual cup if drinking fontains are not provided . 7 . Washing hands before eating . 8 . Sitting and standing properly . ( Most children need to be taught how to do this . ) Chapters X and XI contain a rather complete statement of health habits . // Securing cooperation of parents. ? The greatest contribution that the teacher can make toward securing the practice of health habits by the children in her class is to secure the cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for certain health habits ; we may urge the practice of still others , but if parents are not informed regarding our efforts , and are not cooperating intelligently , the health-habits program will break down . In other words , fully half of the instructional task will be found to consist of instructing parents . There are a number of ways for accomplishing this . One way is to inform the parents through printed or mimeographed bulletins regarding the health habits which the school is trying to teach . Another way which should be supplementary to the first is to devote some of the programs of mothers ' clubs and parent-teacher associations to this subject . Another very effective way is for the individual teacher to invite the mothers of her pupils to come to the school for a conference on this subject . In addition to all of these ways , the monthly report card to parents should report health habits . We have been told that our task is teaching children , and this conception of the teacher 's work is a larger conception than the old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in this field of health education we may have to accept a still larger conception of our task . Our chief aim in health education is to promote the health of boys and girls . In the accomplishment of this aim we may have to teach parents as well as children . We may even have to extend our teaching efforts beyond the children and the parents // and into the community . But let us not lose sight of the fact that , regardless of whom we have to teach , if the effort results in healthier boys and girls , then the effort has been properly directed . CHAPTER VI NUTRITION AND HEALTH The school program which fails to take due account of the nutritional status of the children is neglecting not only an important factor in the health of the children , but a most important factor in the establishment of favorable conditions for learning . Problems of absence from school on account of illness nutrition problem . During the past ten years commendable progress has been made in one aspect of the nutrition problem among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite generally to recognize the desirability of regular weighing and measuring of children . In many communities excellent results have been secured through providing food at school for undernourished children . We have generally failed , however , to attack this problem in the thorough-going fashion which its importance deserves . A school nutrition program. ? The school nutrition program should consist of the following : 1 . The children should be weighed once each month . The measuring may be done less frequently . 55 // 2 . There should be a careful examination by a physician of those who are found to be as much as ten per cent underweight . 3 . A serious attempt should be made to secure corrections in cases where physical defects are found to be responsible for undernourishment . q .. All children should be instructed regarding proper diet . 5 . Cooperation of parents should be secured . 6 . School feeding should be provided for undernourished children . Principles underlying a school nutrition program. ? The following statement of facts and principles relative to the school nutrition program has grown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this problem : r . Any efficient program of health education in elementary schools must recognize the primary importance of nutritional status as a basis for estimating the general physical condition of the children . 2 . Gains in weight as a result of special nutritional effort may be expected to be dependent on physical condition . 3 . Gains in weight are largely dependent on ability to enlist the active cooperation of the children . q .. Very little can be accomplished by the school without the active and intelligent cooperation of the home . 5 . The school is in a better position than any other agency to carry through successfully a child-nutrition program . // 6 . It is highly desirable to lengthen the noon recess to include a rest period at home if possible , especially for young children . 7 . The mid-session luncheon at school is desirable , both as a nutritional and as an educational feature . 8 . Instructional emphasis should be given to the importance of balanced diet and vitamin intake , as well as to caloric intake . 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school feeding program must finally depend upon modification of the home dietary as a result of tastes cultivated or convictions established through the school experience . An efficient method of weighing and measuring children. ? One of the reasons why health work is neglected in many schools is that the teachers do not possess a satisfactory technique for doing it . This is particularly true of the problem of weighing and measuring children . In some schools the school janitor is entrusted with this work . In others , the school nurse does it . This work should be done in the classroom by the teacher , or by the teacher and children together , as a regular part of the room program . The technique which is described below , and the illustration opposite page 62 , will enable the teacher to conduct this work with a minimum of disorder and confusion , and loss of time . The photograph which illustrates the technique was taken in the fourth grade of the Elementary Training School at Ohio University . HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION Materials : Scales , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot long . Scales with measuring rod can be used instead of tape measure . Preparation : I. The scales should be placed in the front of the room near a window . 2 . The tape measure should be nailed to the wall near the scales . 3 . It will facilitate matters to write the names of the children on the blackboard in the order in which they will be weighed . Later recording will be simplified if boys and girls are listed separately and in alphabetical order . 4 . The children should remove shoes , sweaters , and coats . Procedure : I. In the appropriate space after the child 's name on the blackboard , record the date of the child 's birth . 2 . Record the child 's age , using the nearest birthday . 3 . Have the child stand with his back to the wall , and with his heels and head touching the tape measure . Determine his height by placing the thin board lightly across the top of his head and against the tape measure . q .. Record the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have him stand in the center of the scale platform . See to it that his hands are not touching the scales and that he is NUTRITION AND HEALTH s not touching any other object . In grades above the third the children may do the weighing under the supervision of the teacher . 6 . Copy the blackboard record on the permanent record . Record forms and weight-heightage tables prepared by Dr. Bird T. Baldwin and Dr. Thomas D. Wood can be secured from the Bureau of Education , Department of the Interior , Washington , D. C. Physical examinations of underweight children. ? Legitimate criticisms have been offered of the attempts some schools have made to bring all children up to normal weight . These criticisms may be summarized as follows : i . Not all children should weigh the same . This is undoubtedly true . Some studies have been made of this problem , and still others need to be made . For example , it is probably true that different racial groups vary in normal weight for a given age and height . 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of underweight children . The practice of schools has generally been to give milk to underweight children . For the great majority this will prove beneficial . Some children apparently can not drink milk but will drink cocoa . Others are probably in greater need of orange juice than of milk . 3 . The mid-session lunch at school destroys the child 's appetite for the noon lunch at home . Where this is true it generally indicates either that the school lunch is given too late in the school session or that the 6o HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION school program provides too little opportunity for physical exercise . The school lunch should be given about two hours before the child will eat his lunch at home . q .. Some children are underweight because of physical defects rather than because of improper or insufficient diet . All of these criticisms can be overcome by an intelligent administration of the school lunch program , and by having a thorough physical examination of every child who is underweight . Specialists in the care of children are generally agreed that children who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly the fact that a child is as much as ten per cent underweight justifies a thorough investigation with a view to remedial treatment . Among the most common of the physical defects which retard growth are bad teeth , diseased tonsils , and adenoids . Instruction regarding diet. ? One of the largest units of instruction in the elementary school 's course of study in health , and one which should appear in every grade , is that which deals with the child 's own diet , and with the kinds and the amount of food which he should eat . The monthly weight record constitutes one of the best ways of motivating this material for the child . In the primary grades the mid-session lunch period provides an excellent opportunity for instruction about food . Children in these grades should be taught what kinds of food they should eat ? milk , green vegetables , hard breads , and whole-grain cereals . They NUTRITION AND HEALTH 6i should be taught to eat only at regular intervals , not to eat many sweets ( and never except at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor tea . They should be taught to wash their hands before eating , to take small bites , and to chew their food well . If these lessons are taught during the lunch period , and if the things which are taught are practiced during that period , the teacher may reasonably expect them to be well learned , and to carry over into the home practices of the children . The morning lunch period so conducted thus provides the means for instructing the children in the kinds of food which they should eat , the way in which it should be eaten , and in proper table manners . The illustration opposite page 94 shows the morning lunch period in the kindergarten at Ohio University . The instruction in food in the intermediate grades should include information about the different classes of foods and their functions . The children should get some notion of the caloric content of various foods , of the importance of a balanced diet , and of vitamins . They should learn what kinds and what amount of food they should eat . Each child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as indicated by his monthly weight record . It is essential that this instruction should not be formal , and that the information which the child receives should actually modify his behavior in matters of diet . Cooperation of the home. ? Regardless of how far the school may go in setting up a modern nutrition program , including regular weighing and measuring of children , examination of underweight children by physicians , and // providing school feeding for undernourished children , the best results can not be obtained unless the school can secure the active cooperation of the parents in the nutrition problems . Great progress has been made during the last ten years in educating American parents in the importance of proper attention to the diet of infants . It is now common practice for the mother to consult experts regarding the proper food for the baby . Baby clinics and day nurseries are contributing their share to a solution of the nutrition problem for children who have not reached school age . The school must assume the responsibility for securing a similar degree of intelligent cooperation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just how is this cooperation to be secured and what form should it take ? 1 . In the monthly report to parents regarding the child 's school progress the school should also report the child 's nutrition status . It will be found that parents are at least as greatly interested in knowing whether the child is of normal weight as in knowing whether he is up to standard in his spelling ability . 2 . The school should conduct conferences with parents on the feeding of school children . In these conferences such subjects should be discussed as the proper diet for the school child , the proper amount of rest and sleep , etc . The following quotation from Farmer 's Bulletin No. 717 , U. S. Department of Agriculture , entitled Food for Young Children , by Caroline L. Hunt , is typical of the kind of information which should be given to parents : // A child between 3 and io years of age may be considered well fed if he has plenty of milk , bread and other cereal food , an egg or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a day , a little butter , a small portion each of carefully prepared fruits and vegetables , with a small amount of sweet foods after his appetite for other foods is satisfied . If any of these is omitted his diet is likely to be one-sided . 3 . The school should exert its influence with parents to secure the correction of physical defects discovered through physical examinations .

CHAPTER VII COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND THEIR PREVENTION Importance of the problem. ? Approximately twentyfive per cent of all deaths in the United States are caused by communicable diseases . The percentage is much larger when we consider the deaths among children of school age . It is significant that many of the communicable diseases occur almost exclusively among children of elementary-school age . The following table shows the percentage of deaths which occur before the tenth birthday , to the total number of deaths from certain diseases : Ninety-nine per cent of all deaths from whoopingcough occur before the tenth birthday . Eighty-nine per cent of all deaths from measles occur before the tenth birthday . Eighty-six per cent of all deaths from diphtheria occur before the tenth birthday . Seventy-four per cent of all deaths from scarlet fever occur before the tenth birthday . Thirty-four per cent of all deaths from pneumonia occur before the tenth birthday . 64 // It is clearly evident then why the problem of the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely interested . Not only must the school be interested in this problem , but it has certain important responsibilities in connection with the problem which it must not neglect . Until the school assumes its full share of responsibility for the control of communicable diseases among children , it will be open to the charge of doing more to retard public health through its neglect than it contributes through its instruction . It will be the purpose of this chapter to show the ways in which the school can discharge its responsibility . Children 's disease survey. ? Every year children die , schools are closed , thousands of children have to miss valuable weeks of school , and to repeat grades , because of a foolish notion that " children might as well have the children 's diseases and get them over with , " because teachers do not know how to detect the first signs of children 's diseases , and because they do not know what children 's diseases each child has had . No child should be wilfully exposed to any disease . Parents whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assurance that every effort will be made to prevent exposure of their children to these diseases . When we realize that measles , a disease which many people have not greatly feared in the past , constitutes one of the ten most important causes of death among children of the ages from five to ten years , we shall see why the problem must be regarded as a serious one . One of the first items of information which the teacher // should secure from her children at the opening of school in the fall is that concerning children 's diseases which they have had . This information can best be obtained by sending a note to the parents of each child asking them to check the diseases which the child has had . List the common children 's diseases , such as chicken pox , diphtheria , measles , mumps , scarlet fever , and whooping cough . Also ask whether the child has been vaccinated , when , and whether successfully . Leave a few blank spaces for writing in diseases not listed . Leave space for checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be mimeographed in the superintendent 's office and distributed to teachers . When this information is secured it should be consolidated by the teacher on a single sheet for all of the children . She should keep this information in a convenient place where it can be referred to quickly . This record will give the teacher reliable information , enabling her to follow a wise course when epidemics are prevalent . She will know what diseases to be especially watchful for in her room . She will know what diseases individual children have had . She will know what children should be segregated when epidemics come . A form like the one reproduced on page 66 will serve as a record for the children 's disease survey . Place a check in the appropriate column after the name of a child if he has had the disease . Place an " I " if he has received immunization from that disease . Under " Vaccination " enter the date of successful vaccination . The teacher as a disease detector. ? It must be remembered that the children 's disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . It will be of invaluable assistance , however , to the teacher who desires to make an honest effort to safeguard the health of her children , and to prevent epidemics from occurring in her room . In addition to this , the teacher needs to be able to recognize the evidences , particularly the first evidences , of the common communicable diseases of children , and to possess a technique which will enable her to make a quick but thorough inspection for these at the opening of school each day . Many teachers feel that inspection for evidences of children 's diseases is not properly a part of the teacher 's work . There is the feeling that such duties should be performed by the professional health worker . This would be true if there were available a trained health worker for every classroom every morning . That such a condition does not exist and probably never will exist is obvious . Part of the reluctance on the part of teachers to assume these duties is occasioned by the fact that they were not trained for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to train teachers , until quite recently , in the performance of their health responsibilities in the classroom is difficult to explain . It is probably due to the fact that the whole field of health education is still in its infancy , and that we have been slow to distinguish between the highly technical health responsibilities which can be discharged only by the professional health worker , and the less technical ones which can be discharged by the trained layman. // It is never intended that the teacher should attempt to act as a diagnostician of children 's illnesses . Fortunately , it is not necessary for her to do so in order to safeguard the health of her children . The teacher does need to know when a child is ill , and , therefore , needs to know the common evidences of illness . It would probably be well also for her to have available for use a statement of the observable evidences of each of the common communicable diseases of children . Evidences of illness. ? The list which is reproduced below is a partial list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The teacher should always be on the alert for these , and particularly at the morning inspection . When a child shows any of the evidences of illness he should be excluded from the classroom immediately . Every school which can possibly do so should provide an isolation room to which such cases can be sent until they can be examined by the doctor or nurse , or turned over to their parents . The important thing is that children who are ill should not remain in the classroom with other children , and that they should receive expert attention immediately . The following list of readily observable evidences of illness should be helpful to the teacher : Running nose or sneezing Red or inflamed eyes Sore throat Cough Unusual paleness or flushing of the face // Fever or unusual hotness of the skin Dizziness Nausea Vomiting Chills or convulsions Symptoms of communicable diseases. ? While it is true that the teacher should never attempt to diagnose illness , it may be of service for her to know the early symptoms of each of the common children 's diseases . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important , therefore , that the teacher should be able to recognize the first symptoms , and that she should not wait for corroborating evidence before taking action . Particularly when there is reason to expect the appearance of a given epidemic , the teacher will find it valuable to be able to recognize the early symptoms of that disease . The early symptoms of some of the common communicable diseases of children are as follows : Measles. ? Cold in head , coughing , sneezing , running nose , red and watering eyes , fever . Do not wait for the eruption to appear , as it does not appear until the third day , and the disease is transmitted most readily before that time . Scarlet fever. ? Vomiting , sore throat , fever . A fine scarlet rash will appear within twenty-four hours on the neck , chest , arms , and face . The disease is transmitted readily before this rash appears . The rash is apt to appear on the neck , chest , and arms before it appears on the face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illness . This may be accompanied by vomiting or a chill . The throat may be red , and a patch of gray membrane present . There is apt to be a slight fever . Small pox. ? Usually difficult to distinguish in its early stages from chicken pox . Chill , fever , nausea , backache , and headache are usually present . The eruption does not appear until the second or third day . The disease is highly contagious before that time . Chicken pox. ? The first sign of this disease is apt to be an eruption of red , raised spots , which usually appear first on the forehead . Whooping cough. ? Begins like a cold in the head , with sore throat , and a cough which is worse at night . The disease is communicable for a considerable time before the " whoop " develops . Tonsillitis ( Sore throat ) . ? The throat is inflamed , and there may be yellowish spots on the tonsils . Usually there is a high fever , and frequently , chills . German measles. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less severe . In many cases the first sign of the disease is an eruption of deep pink spots , which appear first on the face . The morning inspection. ? At the opening of school each morning the teacher should inspect her children for evidences of illness or of children 's diseases . The following procedure for conducting the inspection is suggested : 1 . The teacher should stand with a good light at her back . // 2 . The children should pass , single file , in front of the teacher . 3 . As each child comes in front of the teacher he should draw down the lower eyelids . 4 . The child should pause in front of the teacher , open his mouth wide , and say " ah " in order that she may examine his throat . 5 . The children should be instructed to report any feeling of illness to the teacher as they pass in front of her . 6 . Children who show any signs of illness should be told to step out of the line until the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined more carefully . An inspection such as that described should require from five to ten minutes for a group of forty children . The illustration facing page 70 shows an inspection for signs of children 's diseases in the third grade of the Elementary Training School at Ohio University . Preventing the spread of disease. ? The elementary teacher has still another important responsibility in connection with the control and prevention of communicable diseases . She needs to be informed , and to see that the parents of the children in her room are informed , regarding the possibilities of preventing these diseases through immunization . Some of the most remarkable achievements in the whole field of public health have been accomplished in connection with the discovery of methods for rendering individuals immune from communicable diseases . // We have long known that small pox could be prevented 1through vaccination , and yet there still exists a considerable amount of feeling , due to superstition , prejudice , and ignorance , against vaccination . More recently , scientifically proved methods have been discovered for protecting individuals from many contagious diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diphtheria , and the toxinantitoxin treatment for rendering susceptible cases immune ; the Dick Test for determining susceptibility to scarlet fever , and immunization for susceptible cases ; typhoid vaccination . The efficacy of these new methods for preventing communicable diseases is well illustrated in the diphtheria statistics for New York City where the Schick Test and immunization with toxin-antitoxin have been carried out on an extensive scale by the Department of Health since 1919 . The statistics for the number of cases and the number of deaths from diphtheria in that city for the period from 1919 to 1923 are reproduced below . figure An exceptionally important service in connection with the prevention of communicable diseases which // can be sponsored best by the parent-teacher association , in cooperation with the public health authorities and school officials , is the pre-school immunization program . Too frequently immunization against communicable diseases is deferred until children reach school age , in spite of the fact that many of these diseases are prevalent among very young children . For example , diphtheria is the most common cause of death among children of ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if children are to be protected effectively against such diseases , immunization must be provided at an earlier age than that at which they enter school . It is essential that medical science should not be hampered in its efforts to prevent communicable diseases . One of the greatest contributions the teacher can make to the promotion of public health is in educating the public to make intelligent use of scientific discoveries in this field as rapidly as they are available . CHAPTER VIII THE CORRECTION OF PHYSICAL DEFECTS In the first chapter of this book it was pointed out that it is much more important to have the child live continuously throughout his childhood as a healthy child than it is to teach him a large amount of information about health . Fortunately , accomplishing one of these objectives does not preclude the other , but we are so accustomed to thinking of our task as teaching , that we are always in danger of neglecting our non-teaching tasks , even though we recognize their importance . If we accept as the major objective of the school health program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the matter of preventing physical defects , discovering the presence of physical defects , and correcting physical defects must become an important part of the school health program . This chapter will deal with those phases of the school health program which have to do with ( 1 ) preventing physical defects ; ( 2 ) discovering physical defects ; and ( 3 ) correcting physical defects . Preventing physical defects. ? One of the major responsibilities of the school in connection with the prevention of physical defects is that of teaching correct posture , and of providing proper seating so that correct sitting posture may be attained . The teaching of cor-75 // rect posture is generally neglected in the elementary school , where it needs most to be taught , because teachers themselves are frequently negligent in this matter . Yet of all the health habits which we need to teach , there is none in which we may expect a greater degree of wholehearted cooperation on the part of the children than in that of good posture . Our greatest difficulty with this , as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach the correct habits until the wrong habits have been acquired , thus creating for ourselves the extremely difficult task of breaking down incorrect habits and establishing correct ones . Correct posture. ? We frequently think of good posture as meaning merely the correct way to stand and the correct way to sit . It means much more than this . It means the habitual right use of the body in any situation ? standing , sitting , walking , running , jumping , lifting , stooping , resting . The problem of securing correct posture is a matter ( I ) of setting a good example , ( 2 ) of giving right ideals of posture , ( 3 ) of getting the children to give attention to the details of correct posture , at the same time guarding against stiff , unnatural , and exaggerated positions . The physicalactivities period provides an excellent opportunity for securing the practice of good posture . A correct standing posture is attained when the head , body , and legs are poised one above the other so that a line dropped from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foot . In both standing and walking the feet should be parallel to each other . In a correct sitting posture , the body should be bent // only at the knees and hips , and the head , neck , and trunk should be kept in one straight line . The greatest difficulty in the way of securing correct sitting posture in schools is the fact that the majority of the seats and desks are not properly adjusted to the needs of the children who occupy them . School seats and desks should be both movable and adjustable . The seat should be slightly concave . The seat should be low enough and short enough that it does not press against the child 's legs and thus interfere with proper circulation . When determining the adjustment to be made in the seat and desk , have the child sit erect with hips pushed against the back of the seat . The seat and desk should be so adjusted that he will be able to sit with both feet on the floor , forearms on the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . The lower part of the desk should not touch the child 's legs . Protecting the pupil 's vision. ? Another common physical defect which the school has a responsibility for preventing , because it has too often in the past been responsible for causing it , is that of defective vision . Defective vision is , with the exception of defective teeth , the most common of all the physical defects of school children . According to a conservative estimate , based upon a study of thousands of cases , serious vision defects exist in from 15 to 30 per cent of all school children . Even under the most favorable conditions , school work , involving , as it does , a large amount of reading is likely to produce vision defects . The teacher who is conscious of this problem has it within her power to // protect the vision of her children in a number of ways . Among them may be mentioned the following : I. See that the seats are arranged to give the best light possible . The child should not face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side only , preferably from the child 's left . 2 . See that shades are properly adjusted to prevent glare . 3 . Secure , if possible , a proper provision for artificial light in the classroom for use on dark days . q . Do not permit children to read for too long periods without relaxation . S. Insist upon the adoption of textbooks having large type , short lines , and wide margins . 6 . Discourage home study , especially for young children . Discovering physical defects. ? It has been customary to assign this task of discovering the presence of physical defects to the professional health worker . This is as it should be , and where the school is provided with a competent staff of professional health workers the teacher does not need to be concerned with this phase of the problem . Unfortunately , the majority of schools do not have regular visits from the doctor , the dentist , and the nurse . In such situations it is essential that the teacher be able to assume some of the responsibilities she can safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Defective vision. ? The teacher should be familiar with the observable evidences of defective vision . These are so closely related to the child 's regular school // work that it is a very simple matter for the observant teacher to detect them . The following probably have defective vision : ( I ) the child who can not read writing on the blackboard easily ; ( 2 ) the child who habitually holds his book less than one foot or more than fifteen inches from his face ; ( 3 ) the child who holds his book in an unusual position ; ( 4 ) the child who squints or blinks ; ( 5 ) the child who is frequently troubled with headaches ; ( 6 ) the child who usually has red , watery , or inflamed eyes ; ( 7 ) the child who habitually wrinkles his brow when reading . There is no reason why teachers should not use the standard vision charts in testing the vision of children . Many teachers think they should not attempt to use these vision charts because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians , or nurses . As a matter of fact , there is no more reason why a teacher should not use a standard vision test than there is why she should not use a standardized reading test , or arithmetic test , except that she should not attempt to make any diagnosis as a result of the vision test , beyond determining the probable presence or absence of defective vision . The following statement of materials needed , and of procedure for administering a vision test , should enable any teacher who cares to do so to test the vision of her children with a fair degree of accuracy . Materials : For testing the vision of children above the first grade , the Snellen Type Test Card should be used . For 8o HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION testing the vision of kindergarten and first-grade chil. dren , picture vision charts should be used . Arrangements for testing : I. In order to make sure that the children will not memorize the material on the vision chart it will be necessary to test each child privately . 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position where it will receive good light . 3 . A chalk line should be drawn on the floor , twenty feet from the chart , indicating the place where the child is to stand while being tested . 4 . Children who wear glasses should be tested with them on . 5 . A piece of cardboard should be used to cover one eye while the other eye is being tested . Testing procedure : I. Have the child stand , toeing the chalk line , and facing the vision chart . 2 . Place the cardboard over the left eye , making sure that there is no pressure on the covered eye . 3 . Have the child begin reading aloud the line which is labeled the forty-foot line . Have him read each line successively , down as far as he can . It is advisable to have some person stand at the side of the chart , in a position which will not obstruct the light , to point out each line which is to be read . Children whose vision is normal should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye has been tested , test the left eye , using the same procedure . 5 . The data should be recorded in fraction form for each eye . The numerator of the fraction will always be // " 2o . " The denominator of the fraction will be the number indicating the last line of the chart which the child was able to read correctly . For example , if the last line which the child was able to read correctly with the right eye was the thirty-foot line , the fraction for the right eye would be recorded thus : Right eye : 20/30 . If the vision is normal , the fraction should be 20/20 , or one . If the value of the fraction is less than one , as 20/30 , nearsightedness is indicated . If the value of the fraction is greater than one , as 2o/15 , farsightedness is indicated . Signs of defective hearing. ? The teacher should be familiar with the observable evidences of defective hearing . The following are probably giving evidence of defective hearing : ( 1 ) the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child who generally looks to see what the other children are doing before beginning to follow directions ; ( 3 ) the child who watches the teacher especially closely while she is making an assignment or giving directions ; ( 4 ) the child who seems to favor one ear by turning the head while listening ; ( S ) the child who frequently asks to have assignments , questions , or statements repeated . Other evidences of defective hearing are running ears and earache . The simplest test for defective hearing is the watch test . In giving this test , the child 's eyes should be closed , and one ear stopped with a finger . The child should be able , under such conditions , to hear distinctly the tick of an average watch at a distance of two // feet in a quiet room . The other simple test is the whisper test . In giving this test , place the child twenty feet away from , and with back turned to , the examiner . One ear should be closed as in the watch test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper . Examining teeth. ? The teacher can make an examination of the teeth of the children for the purpose of discovering cavities , and the cleanliness of the teeth . The examination will be facilitated if she is provided with tongue depressers , which can be secured at very small cost at any drug store , and dental charts on which to indicate teeth which need the attention of a dentist . Evidences of ill health . The examination for the other common physical defects of children is of such a technical nature that it must be made by a physician . There is one other thing which the teacher can do , however , in this connection . She can be observant for the evidences of ill health , which frequently indicate the presence of physical defects , such as adenoids , diseased tonsils , etc . Some of these common observable evidences of ill health are : nervousness , pallor , lack of energy , mouth breathing , swollen glands in the neck , speech defects , difficulty in controlling the muscles , unusual emotional excitability , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little value to discover the presence of physical defects if we do not take the additional step of securing their correction . It is in connection with this step that the school health program most frequently breaks down . Even in schools which employ doctors , dentists , and nurses to // make physical examinations of the children , these people frequently regard their task as completed when they have discovered and recorded the presence of physical defects . It is a part of the teacher 's task to see that these defects are corrected . There are many reasons why parents are frequently reluctant to have perfectly obvious physical defects in their children corrected . Sometimes they are reluctant because of ignorance of the necessity for taking such action , sometimes from prejudice , sometimes because they dread the financial outlay involved , and , perhaps most frequently of all , from a desire not to subject the child to pain . The teacher must meet all of these objections , and very frequently must talk with the parents a number of times , before her efforts will meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elementary Training School at Ohio University . The physical examination revealed the fact that a boy who was not getting along well in his school work had defective vision , and that he needed glasses . The teacher of the fourth grade , in which the boy was enrolled , notified the parents of the results of the examination , and requested that they take the boy to an oculist and have him supplied with glasses . Nothing happened . The teacher visited the parents and renewed her request , and still nothing happened . In the course of the school year the teacher visited the parents a number of times , talked with the mother over the telephone , and wrote several notes to the parents . They always had some excuse for not having the correction made just // These materials must be kept in good condition . In order to do this , it is necessary to keep them in a tight cabinet . Probably the best plan to be followed is for the school to purchase a large first-aid cabinet completely equipped . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to replenish them as they become exhausted . The first-aid cabinet should be placed on the first floor in a room which is easily accessible from the playground . If possible , this room should be equipped with a hospital cot and with two or three comfortable chairs . This room might well be equipped for physical examinations and for use as a dental clinic . There should be an adjoining room with a lavatory and bath , with hot and cold water , and a toilet . It is true that the majority of elementary schools are not so equipped . It is also true that boards of education are frequently unable or reluctant to provide money for such equipment . Parent  --  teacher associations can generally be interested in undertaking the project of equipping a health unit for the school if space can be found for the housing of it . Certainly , few projects would be more worthy of the efforts of parent-teacher associations than this one . Let us consider now the kinds of injuries and other emergencies which are likely to occur in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common are those injuries which are classified as wounds . Whenever the skin has been broken we call such an injury a wound . Other injuries , fortunately // much less common , are dislocations , and fractures or broken bones , Sprains are fairly common . Collapse from shock , and fainting , while not common , occur occasionally . Wounds. ? If the wound is of such a nature that only a small amount of blood is escaping paint freely both the wound and the surrounding skin with tincture of iodine or with mercurochrome . Then pick up a folded piece of clean gauze with the fingers of the right hand and place that side of the gauze which you have not touched against the wound . Sometimes cotton should be placed over the gauze dressing before applying the bandage . Finally put a bandage over the entire dressing . Do not attempt to wash out wounds with any medicines . In the case of a hemorrhage your first task is to stop the bleeding . In order to do this you must determine whether the hemorrhage comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined . Blood from an artery comes out in jets and spurts , while blood from a vein simply flows . If the injury is in an arm or leg have the patient lie down and raise the arm or leg straight up . In a venous hemorrhage the flow will stop , but not in an arterial hemorrhage . The quickest way to stop hemorrhage of any kind is by pressure , as with the thumb , a short distance away from the wound . If the hemorrhage is from an artery , the pressure must be applied between the wound and the heart . If it is from a vein , the pressure must be applied on the side farthest from the heart . Use of a tourniquet. ? Every first-aid cabinet should // have as a part of its equipment a tourniquet . A tourniquet is a device for applying the pressure referred to above . It is , of course , clear that stopping a hemorrhage by pressure of the thumb will be effective only temporarily , as no one can keep up the required pressure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use is not available , one serviceable in connection with an injured arm or leg can easily be improvised from materials available in any classroom . Place a round pebble ( or a large eraser will do ) over the place where the blood vessel is located , above or below the injury , depending upon whether the hemorrhage is coming from an artery or a vein . Place a handkerchief around the arm or leg , over the pebble , and tie together at the ends . Then place a pencil under the knot , and twist until you get the required pressure to stop the bleeding . Tie the pencil to the arm or leg so that it will not untwist and thereby release the pressure . No special knowledge as to the exact location of the arteries and veins is necessary . An artery or a vein can be located quickly by pressure on various locations near the wound . Pressure by any appliance should not be allowed to remain longer than one or two hours . It is presumed that a physician will have arrived before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of blood should be made to lie down with the head lower than the rest of the body . Dislocations , fractures , or broken bones. ? By dislocation we mean that a bone has been pushed away from the proper place at a joint . A dislocation can be detected by comparing the injured with the uninjured side // of the body . The dislocation shows itself in a deformity . There is usually considerable pain , and the joint can not be used . The proper first-aid treatment is to send for a surgeon immediately , and to make the patient as comfortable as possible until he arrives . Do not attempt to reduce the dislocation except in the case of fingers . To reduce dislocation of a finger , grasp the wrist with the left hand and pull the finger straight away from the hand . The bone should slip into place . Fractures are of much more frequent occurrence than dislocations . The most common sign of a fracture is a deformity of the injured member . Pain is always present . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and until he arrives great care should be taken to prevent any movement of the broken limb . If it is not necessary to move the patient , and if no delay is anticipated in the arrival of the surgeon , it will be necessary only to place the patient in a comfortable position , carefully supporting the fractured bone on each side of the break . If it is necessary to move the patient it will be advisable to apply splints consisting of thin strips of wood which when bound in position will prevent bending of the limb at the point of fracture . Before applying splints the limb should be drawn gently into its proper position and suitably padded . The firstaid equipment should include a number of splints of various sizes Fracture of the upper arm . First send for a surgeon ; then carefully get the arm into its natural position ( compare with uninjured arm ) and apply two splints , the outer extending from the shoulder , and the inner // from armpit to elbow . Use a sling for supporting the arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get the arm in natural position . Apply splints which will reach from the elbow to the middle of the hand . Then place the forearm across the chest where entire arm is to be held in position by a sling . Fracture of the collar bone. ? When the collar bone is broken the patient can not raise his arm above the shoulder . Send for a surgeon . Place a pad of cotton in the armpit , and place the arm in a sling so that it will form a right angle . Bandage the arm to the body . Fracture of fingers. ? Gently draw the fingers into proper position . Apply a small padded splint under them . Place forearm and hand in a sling so as to give support to both forearm and hand . Fracture of the lower jaw. ? The person with a broken jaw is unable to speak , the mouth is open , and the gums may bleed . An irregularity of the teeth may be noticed . Send for a surgeon . Bring the lower teeth gently into their natural position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bandages . Fracture of the upper leg. ? It is difficult to determine surely whether the thigh bone is broken . If in doubt treat it as if it were broken . Send for a surgeon . Place one splint from the armpit to the foot on the outside . Secure this splint by bandages over the abdomen as well as the limb . Place another splint from the crotch to the foot on the inside . There must be no movement of the hip joint . Fracture of the lower leg. ? Send for a surgeon . ArFIRST AID 9 range for a suitable temporary support . If the patient is not to be moved , a pillow shaped to make a trough will provide satisfactory support . If it is necessary to move the patient , splints should be applied . For this purpose thin boards , long enough to prevent movement of the knee joint and of a width greater than the thickness of the leg , should be used . These should be held in place with bandages , none of which should come near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the toes assume the same direction as the toes of the uninjured leg . Fracture of the wrist. ? Send for a surgeon . If he is delayed , gently pull the hand to reduce the deformity . Apply padded splints of sufficient length to reach from the elbow to below the wrist . Place the forearm in a large sling in such position that the forearm will be at right angles with the upper arm . Fracture of the ankle. ? The foot is apt to turn outward with evident deformity . Send for a surgeon . If there is to be considerable delay before the arrival of the surgeon , the foot may be gently drawn down and turned inward , a padded splint being applied on the inside of the leg , extending from below the foot to the knee . Fracture of the knee-cap. ? This injury is easily recognized as the broken parts can be felt . There is considerable swelling . Send for a surgeon . Apply a padded splint to the back of the leg , extending well above and below the knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those described above , it will be necessary to apply first-aid treatment for the shock which accompanies the // injury . By shock is meant that condition which frequently follows some serious injury and which is characterized by great physical exhaustion . It is often called collapse . The patient is prostrate ; the skin is very cold , the pulse is weak and fluttering , and breathing is fast and not strong . Send for a doctor . Place patient flat , with head low . Keep patient warm with blankets and hot-water bottles . Collars and all tight clothing should be loosened in order to help the patient to breathe comfortably . Rub the limbs in the direction from the toes to the hips and from the fingers to the shoulder . Give internally hot black coffee or tea , and half a teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia . Hold strong spirits of ammonia to the nostrils . Fainting. ? Fainting may be considered as a mild form of shock . The treatment is the same as that prescribed for shock , except that usually a dash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sprains. ? In case of sprains there is swelling , but no other deformity . The pain is severe . Keep the affected part in an elevated position . Provide for the patient 's comfort . Do not allow the affected joint to be moved . Apply cloths wrung out in very hot or very cold water until relief is obtained . If the sprain is severe , send for a doctor . CHAPTER X HEALTH INSTRUCTION IN GRADES I , II , AND III As has been indicated in preceding chapters , it is the point of view of the writers that health instruction , in the sense in which that term is usually employed , is only a part of the school health program . This is particularly true of the first three grades of the elementary school . In these grades there need be no period set aside for recitations in health provided a maximum of use is made of the excellent opportunities for health instruction in connection with the other phases of the school health program . Instructional emphasis in connection with health in these early school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to develop in the child a feeling of responsibility for his own health conduct . The healthhabits inspection provides one of the most effective means of securing the regular practice of health habits . Correlation of health instruction with other school activities. ? Opportunities for health instruction in connection with other phases of the school health program are abundant , and should not be neglected . In another chapter it was pointed out that much of the instruction regarding diet should grow out of the monthly weighing 93 // of children . The child who discovers that he is underweight is naturally anxious to know what he needs to do to correct that condition . That is the proper time to give him instruction regarding the kinds of food and the amount of food which he should eat . The lunch period. ? The mid-session lunch period for undernourished children and the school lunch for children who do not go home for lunch , provide excellent opportunities for giving children instruction and practice in proper eating habits . These periods also provide opportunities for instruction in courtesy , kindliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it true that the school lunch periods provide these opportunities , but it is also true that if the school neglects to capitalize these opportunities to secure the practice of right ways , the children will probably use them in the forming of wrong habits . Some specific habits which the child should form and practice in connection with the school lunch period are : To wash his hands and face , to comb his hair , and to make himself presentable before coming to the table . To use a napkin . Not to talk with his mouth full . To chew his food with lips closed . To eat slowly . To use a spoon , fork , and knife , and not to handle the food with his fingers . To drink only when his mouth is empty . Not to eat food which has dropped on the floor . // The following list of good habits was gleaned from the children 's talks to their dolls : 1 . Wash clothes often . 2 . Do not wait till the clothes are very dirty . 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep them on hangers . 6 . Put clothes in the air at night . 7 . Wear aprons and overalls . 8 . Brush hats when dusty . g . Put hats away in boxes after wearing . Io . Do n't throw hats in the dirt ( a favorite pastime at recess ) . I I. Brush and polish shoes . 12 . Wash stockings often . 13 . Change and wash underwear often . The children performed very conscientiously the duty of teaching the dolls these rules , and these lessons did actually work over to a large extent into good personal habits and better care of the children 's own clothing . The teacher who is alert for possibilities for health instruction will find them in connection with practically all of her school work . Language activities , the story hour , dramatization , arithmetic , geography , all abound in fine opportunities for health teaching . Need of definite objectives. ? It should be clear that a " cut-and-dried " course of study in health is not desirable . It should be equally clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leaving the matter of what will be taught entirely or largely to chance and to the inspiration of the moment . Too often the op-. // portunity will be seen only when it has passed . It is essential , then , that one have clearly in mind the habits , the ideas , the attitudes , and the ideals which it is desired that the children should acquire . One should also be conscious of the kinds of situations which will provide opportunities for this desirable instruction . A TENTATIVE OUTLINE IN HEALTH EDUCATION The statement for Primary Grades of objectives for the elementary school health program given below is taken from the Tentative Outline in Health Education , published by the Board of Education , Cleveland , Ohio , and is reproduced with the permission of Mr. Floyd A. Rowe , Director of Physical Welfare , Cleveland Public Schools . These objectives should be of material assistance to the teacher who does not have the guidance of a course of , study in health education . Grade One A. To have physical defects corrected as far as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . C. To cooperate with the Department of Physical Education . D. To arrange for classroom conditions hygienically . E. To interpret the school health program to the parents and to secure their cooperation . F. To organize regular periods of classroom activities other than teaching units so that they will // contribute to the promotion of the general health program . These should include : r . The Every-Morning Health Review . 2 . Regular weighing and measuring . 3 . The mid-morning lunch . q .. The relaxation period . G. To establish and develop specific health habits . To accomplish this aim , the Rules of the Health Game ' should be stressed by grade one and maintained throughout the school life of the child . RULES OF THE HEALTH GAME A full bath more than once a week . Brushing the teeth at least once every day . Sleeping long hours with windows open . Drinking as much milk2 as possible but no coffee or tea . Eating some vegetables or fruit every day . Drinking at least four glasses of water a day .

To like to sleep with the windows open . Relaxation 24 . To feel that a nap during the day is not babyish . 25 . To relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 . To develop habits of safety . H. To acquire health knowledge . The primary consideration of the first grade is the development of health practices . The child will not be held responsible for reproducing much specific information . In general it is desirable that : i . Children know some of the habits which help them to grow ? such as long hours of sleep , outdoor exercises , having a good breakfast . 2 . Children know that the sixth-year molar is the first of their permanent teeth and must be well cared for . 3 . At least one or two children be taught how to read the thermometer in order to act as thermometer inspector . I. To develop desirable mental attitudes toward health , health practices , and life situations . i . The school aims : a . To develop and maintain on the part of both pupil and teacher an attitude of considering health as a HEALTH INSTRUCTION IN GRADES I , II , AND III ioi means of enriching life , not as an end in itself . b , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to health and growth and not as ends in themselves . c . To develop and maintain an attitude of interest and enjoyment toward health as a school subject . 2 . The child 's attitude toward life situations will largely determine his mental health and social behavior . Health education offers an excellent opportunity for contributing to that aim of general education which seeks to give the child the ability to meet life 's problems courageously , fairly , and intelligently . Mental health for normal children involves the establishment of a well-balanced and serene mind capable of adjusting itself readily to the mastery of life 's problems with a freedom from mental strain . The school seeks : a . To train children to rest . b . To give every child an opportunity to achieve success . c . To give children a chance to express themselves . d . To train the child in the concentration of attention so as to promote an orderly association of ideas . 1Q2 HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION e . To train the child to take efectiv , action when necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social relationships . g . To make the atmosphere of the schoolroom friendly , happy , joyous , and optimistic . Grade Two Objectives listed above far grade one under , A , B , C , D , E , and F , are identical with those for grade two . G. The specific health-habit objectives for grade two include all of those listed for grade one and these additional ones . OBJECTIVES ACTIVITIES Cleanliness I. To prevent chapped hands by thorough washing and drying . 2 . To trim the nails and file them . 3 . To wash the hair once a week and comb it daily . 4 . To use and care for an individual towel , comb , brush , and toothbrush . Clothing S. To remove damp clothing promptly . 6 . To wear separate clothing at night . Exercise 7 .

To be polite and cheerful at the table . Posture Io . To walk without scuffing , and with the toes pointing straight ahead . Sleep and Rest I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. To develop health knowledge . By the end of the third grade the children should be responsible for the following health knowledge : I. To know the rules of the Health Game . 2 . To begin to understand the relation between health habits and the way one feels // ( for example , the relation between the loss of sleep or rest and nervousness ) . 3 . To know how to adjust clothing to weather conditions . q .. To know that one should keep away from children who have communicable diseases . 5 . To know the health value of fruits and vegetables . 6 . To know which foods make strong bones and teeth . 7 . To know that milk is the best single food . 8 . To know what constitutes a good breakfast . 9 . To know how to read a thermometer . io . To know the value of visiting a dentist twice a year . The objectives listed under I are identical with those listed above for the first grade . Placing the emphasis in primary health instruction. ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education for the first three grades is clearly upon the health program rather than upon health instruction . The chief purposes are to protect and promote health and to establish those habits which will insure health rather than to cause the children to acquire a large store of information relative to health . Some health information is imparted but it is selected with a view to the child 's present needs primarily rather than with a view to his adult needs . Problems of health instruction. ? The problems connected with the best way to introduce a specific health // habit which we wish the children to acquire are real problems . Unfortunately for the teacher who needs to be told definitely how each step is to be taken , no definite and satisfactory general answers to such problems can be given . The right solution of such problems depends upon the situation , and no two classroom situations will be the same . We can point the way by examples of how it has been done , we can set up certain guiding principles , but finally the teacher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves . Let us consider " safety-first " instruction , and , more specifically , those aspects of this subject which have to do with getting safely through the streets on foot . We desire that the child shall acquire certain habits which he can be depended upon always to use on the appropriate occasions . Among these are : Crossing streets only at corners and at right angles . Crossing only when traffic movement is favorable , and looking in both directions . Looking to the left before crossing ; then crossing to the center and looking to the right . Waiting for policeman 's signal , or for traffic light where traffic is regulated . We know that children need to acquire these habits . Undoubtedly the school has some responsibility for teaching them . How shall we set about the teaching of these safety rules ? First of all , we know that they must be unusually well taught ? taught in such a way that they can be depended upon to function whenever a proper occasion arises . Here is an opportunity for the io6 HEALTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know that retention of information depends largely upon vividness of presentation , upon a felt need for acquiring the information , upon recency , and upon repetition or practice . Applying these principles , we may draw certain conclusions regarding a proper procedure for teaching such habits as those listed above . We may safely conclude , for example , that the information regarding the proper way to cross streets will make a stronger impression upon the group if presented at a time when a child has been injured or has had a narrow escape from injury in such a situation . The writer recalls an experience in teaching such habits to his own children which illustrates the point . A playmate who lived in the same block was struck by an automobile while attempting to cross the street near our house . She had failed to look before she started across . One of my children saw the accident , and the other two were on the scene shortly after it occurred . We utilized this incident while it was fresh in the children 's minds to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street , and to teach them how to cross streets safely . The accident referred to occurred about three years ago , yet the children recall it very vividly , although one of them was only four years old when it occurred . The recollection of this accident to their playmate still operates effectively in making them cautious when crossing streets and in preventing them from playing in the street . Care needs to be exercised not to appeal too strongly to fear in // such a situation . The appeal should be made to the child 's good judgment . The practice of using older children to assist young children in crossing busy streets going to and from school is an excellent one , not only from the standpoint of immediate safety , but from the standpoint of habit formation as well . It employs the principles of a felt need in connection with a real situation , and provides that most necessary element in habit formation , frequent practice . It should be clear then that while the teacher should be conscious of the health habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught , she can not be told exactly when nor exactly how these are to be taught . For these , she must depend largely upon her own alertness , her training , and her good judgment . Correlation of health instruction and other activities . ? Mention has already been made of the effectiveness of other school activities , such as language activities , the story hour , and dramatizations in connection with health instruction . In order to be able to utilize these methods effectively the teacher needs to be in possession of an abundance of interesting and appropriate material . It is the opinion of the writers that the best collection of such material for health instruction in the elementary school is contained in Health Training in Schools , by Theresa Dansdill , published by the National Tuberculosis Association , 370 Seventh Avenue , New York City , 1923 . Every elementary teacher should have access to this book . An excellent example of the use of dramatization in Io8 HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION health work is contained in the health play which follows . This play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely by the second-grade children in the Elementary Training School at Ohio University . The work was done in connection with the second-grade health instruction during the school year 1926-27 . A student teacher , Miss Mellissa Pearl Davis , directed the efforts of the children under the supervision of Miss Amy Weihr , critic teacher . Every word in the play , including the title , was suggested by the children themselves . THE MAGIC WATER LILY SCENE I ( In the Living Room ) WARREN : Oh , let 's play a game of marbles . ALL CHILDREN : Oh , yes , that would be lots of fun . DONALD : Here 's my shooter . DOLORES : Ca n't I shoot first ? WARREN : Oh , you always want to be first .
