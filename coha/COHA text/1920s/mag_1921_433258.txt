The following authentic letters , which the Atlantic has been privileged to copy front the yellowing sheets still in the writer 's possession , tell a story of tire pioneer spirit which ought to be preserved . No introduction is necessary , but the reader should know that the writer was , in 1865 , a wife of ten years . Mrs. Devereus still lives , at the age of ninety-three . DEAR MOTHER , I have a long story to tell you , of why I am here with Will , in this small , rough prairie village , so small and remote , I am sure you have never heard of it before . It is 90 miles from our home in Council Bluffs , with no nearer settlement of any size in any direction , and hundreds of miles from any railroad , and I doubt if the view from our window would impress you very favorably , yet it seems very good to us to be here . My last letter to you told of Will 's successful return journey from Denver , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote of greatly improved health : he would be home ready for duty in two weeks more , coming on slowly to get the full benefit of longer outdoor life in the early October days ; and his enthusiasm over wagon-travel and camping-out for health was greater than ever . Ranches were not so far apart , and the ranch women could bake his bread , which , Ire owned , with his own baking in the Dutch oven , had been often very poor . Nor need he wait to join the slow progress of pack-trains , as he was forced to do farther West , where the Indians were dangerous and an escort of soldiers was furnished . He would enjoy camping by 330 himself in freedom and quiet , and he would soon be home . At 4 o'clock P.M. of the very day this letter reached me , a telegram came from Grand Island , saying , ' Very ill by the roadside ; come at once and bring the doctor . ' You can imagine how dazed I was for an instant , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but where Grand Island was , or how I was to get there , I knew no more than if I had not lived two years at one of the gateways to that great plain stretching 500 miles west to Denver . I called to a passing friend , who , fortunately , was a woman of presence of mind , and had been to Denver herself . She recalled at once the important fact that it was the day for the Overland coach , which only every other day left Omaha at evening for Denver ; and it was nearly time for the last boat on the ferry to Omaha , and the ferry was two miles away . Send me the doctor and someone to take me to Omaha , ' was all that I waited to say ; and hastened to put the few things in my bag I could think of . She found our good friend and banker , Mr. Deming , at the first corner , in his buggy , and he drove to the door at once , and offered to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need I had not yet thought of , he could furnish me funds for the journey , and arrange , as we drove on , for any emergency which should call for more . It was impossible for the doctor to go with me , but he came to me , and gave me all the advice he could . In half an hour from the time the telegram reached me , we were on our way , and I had a little time to collect Inyself before reaching the ferry . I was so absorbed in going over that terrible telegram , to gain some new light on it , that I had no fear or hesitation about taking the journey , nor did I recall what little I knew about such rough travel in the unsettled West , or what it might demand of my strength , if not of my courage ; and I wondered , vaguely , why Mr. Deming should ask me if I were sure I had better try to go . Of course I must go . We reached Omaha just in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bock seat of the coach for me ; and as I crawled into it at 9 o'clock , in the darkness , I heard the driver say , ' Two nights and a day will bring her there ' ; and the dim lanterns outside showed me Mr. Deming 's pale and frightened face as we rolled away . It was well fear was not added to my anxiety . The rapid movement of the four horses gave me relief , and the intense silence of the black night left me free to think ; for though Mr. Deming said with trembling voice , as he shut the coach-door , ' A lady going to her sick husband ; wo n't you be kind to her ? ' and I was conscious of persons in the other seats , I thought no more of them , and set about making myself comfortable enough for one who could not sleep . I rolled the ill-smelling blanket into pillows , and made a tent-cover horn head to foot of the big mosquito net that my thoughtful friends insisted I should take , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the rolling hills between Omaha and the Elkhorn behind us , and were passing rapidly over the plains of the Platte valley . I had grudged the delays of the night , when they stopped to change horses , for every hour made one less of that terrible sum of two nights and a day , ' before I could reach Will , ' ill by the roadside ' ; but when the light became clearer in the coach , there was a moment 's sense of repugnance , but no fear , when I met the eyes of three of the roughest-looking men I had ever seen , staring at me . They had not spoken a word through the long night , I believe in kindness to a lone woman , though they seemed not only coarse , but dull . They rarely spoke to each other during the time I was with them , and never to me ; and when awake , seemed filled with astonishment at my presence there . At the noon station a new passenger took the vacant seat in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of a more cultivated type of man . He was kind to me , giving me helpful attentions at the rough stage-stations , where we tried to eat . Once he insisted , without any complaint of mine , that a basin of water should be placed on a chair inside the shanty for my use , instead of my sharing with the men the towels and basin on the bench outside the door . A sense of being protected by this good man encouraged a little sleep , and the slow hours wore on . Toward night I began to inquire about Grand Island , supposing that I was to go on to that station , and should reach it next morning . But when , later , the driver was changed with the horses , the new one came to the coach-door and asked , ' Is there a woman here , going to her sick husband ? ' To my eager inquiries of what he could tell me about Will , he could only say , ' They told me to watch out for ye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night some time . ' This , I found , was eight miles east . of Grand Island , from which I he telegram came . After midnight I began to peer into he darkness with beating heart , full of vague and terrible fears . I think my friend in the coach was anxious , too , with too much sympathy to sleep ; for he was good to me in a silent way , which helped me to wait quietly . At two o'clock in the morning the coach suddenly stopped , and we knew it was not to change horses ; it was too quiet . The coach-door opened , and in silence my neighbor sprang out , and I silently followed . The driver bade us make for a dim light not far away ; it was a lantern hanging under Will 's wagon , standing by the roadside . My friend helped me to climb into the dark opening under the canvas cover , from which a voice strangely unnatural called faintly , I thought you would never come ; now let me go to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not distinguish his face . The stranger exclaimed , ' I ca n't leave you so ; this is dreadful ; I will stay . ' But I knew Will must , first of all , get rest that night . No doubt he had forced himself to keep awake until the coach came by . I hope the man knew I was grateful for his kindness , but I could only whisper , ' Go on ; I can do ; send me a physician if you can find one . ' Later on , I did get comfort at a critical time , through his remembrance of us , though he found no physician . I crawled along the wagon-bed until I came to Will 's head , and sat clown on the straw and soothed him to sleep . He was too ill to tell me anything about himself , only feebly saying once , shall get well now . ' When it was light enough to see , I crept out the front , and found ? the wagon was drawn up beside an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a long sod-barn , and no other habitation in sight . half-grown boys came out of the new cabin , and I went in to find someone to get me the nourishment I must have . ha Will , and food for myself , and to learn something about him . A frowzy , dull-eyed woman met me ; her yellow face and yellow hair and lank figure told inc the kind of emigres ; she was . She seemed to have sot particle of interest in the sick man outside ; had I been some unknown species of human kind , she could not have ap . peared more dazed . A coarse-featured girl of eighteen , maybe , joined her , and paying no attention to my wants , they continued to stand silent , and stare at my face , my clothes , and my hair . I think nothing up to that time cam so near breaking my courage as the silent stare of that dull , passionless wo .. man . I knew then that I was lit t le better than alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I begged for fire , and hot water , and milk , and gained by degrees from then , that Will had come to their cabin a week before and given his horses m the care of the sons , because he was ill , and had sent one of them back to Grand Island with the dispatch to me , later ; and they had made soup for him once , when he said they must . Did I think he would die ? and , Was it a catching sickness ? I knew as little as they what his sickness was ; but I meant that lie should not die , and that they should give me help , though I did not say so . The het milk I gave him revived him , and he , slept again , while I searched his box el ' stores , and made myself a homelike cup of tea on their old broken cook-stove . A spider and a kettle were all the uten- sils they had ; but I cleaned up Will 's saucepans , and then looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon . I could not climb in and out , and care for him . They insisted there was no Haim for him in their cabin , and indeed he needed quiet and good air , which he would not have there ; but I found in the old but a bedstead frame , with hoards across it , and on them a ragged hay-bed . The floor of the but was like that of an old barn , and the sod-roof was broken hi spots , but was shelter enough for those mild sunny days . I asked for fresh hay for the bed , and in perfect silence they did just what I bade them to do , and then stood again and stared at me. ' him bed was the sole piece of furniture in the hut , and there was not much more in t he newer cabin . I looked about for a box to serve as a chair , but none ... add be found . A cask of onions and one of Oats stood at one side of the small square room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freely , all day . When the boys came to their breakfast , I got them to carry Will to the hut on the mattress-bed in his wagon , on which he had slept during his two months ' journey ; and on my taking or his heavy clothing , he slept more quietly , but could tell me little about himself . I gradually learned that , after his last letter to me , he had failed for some nights to get good sleep . Mosquitoes appeared in swarms , and horse-thieves acre about , so that Punch and Judy had to be watched at night . He felt himself growing ill , and pushed on , hoping at least to get to Columbus , the nearest place he could find advice and care . But that was 60 miles farther east , and when his strength gave out entirely , he stopped beside this cabin , because there was a barn where his horses could be made safe . How he had lived since he sent the dispatch , he did not know . He thinks the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile was visiting for me. made a seat for myself on the foot of his bed , with Isis overcoat as a pillow , and watched , and fed him with all the nourishing things I could contrive from our limited stores , and did not know enough to know that he had a low malarial fever , fast assuming a typhus form . He insisted that he needed nothing but rest , and in his weak state I dared not experiment with the few Medicines I had with nut . I ate in the other cabin , with the silent family . living mostly on rice and crackers , and tea of my own making ; their bacon and mashed potatoes , with the bacon fat stirred into the potato until it was almost a soup , was intolerable to me ; and badly made hot soda bread , with coffee , was all they had besides to eat . They came west from Southern Indiana . The women wore home-made Linsey-woolsey gowns , with straight , scant skirts , and I envied them , as I Went about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed away the hoops , and sewed up my skirts in festoons , and laid aside my small hat , which seemed so absurd a covering in that spot , and went bareheaded to and fro in the sun . One evening the boys came in with an antelope thrown across one of their ponies , which they had shot at some distance , somewhere , and I thought Will could have soup , and I could have a change in food ; but before morning they had it all packed in salt , and the stew they made for dinner had a dreadful taste . All day long the sun shone from a cloudless sky . A few rods in front of our door , the perfectly level trail to Denver stretched in a yellow line of dust to the limits of the horizon , east and west . Four or five miles away , a brown spot indicated a cabin , and a dim fringe of low trees , still farther away , marked a stream ; otherwise , the circle of the horizon bounded an unbroken plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except when clouds of dust rose in the west , and long lines of oxen came slowly by the door , sometimes as many as sixteen pairs fastened behind each other , drawing as many huge white-covered empty wagons on their return trip to Omaha . Made up in this fashion , one or more men could manage the train returning ; and in these days of emigration west , wagon-drivers could be readily found to go to Denver ; but few wished to return . Every day the stage-coach passed , east or west , and it seemed a friendly link between us and the world , 150 miles away . The mail was carried the alternate day on a buckboard with a single seat , sometimes shared with the driver by a passenger . After ten days of hope and despair , I saw plain signs of increasing weakness in Will , and watched eagerly for the buckboard to pass at noon . I must get advice from someone , if only from the stage-man . It seemed odd that it should halt before I went out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , asking , ' How is your husband ? ' I knew at a glance he was an Eastern man and a gentleman ; and oh ! the intense relief to my overstrained nerves just the sight of him gave me , utter stranger as he was . In a few words he explained : he had heard of our desolate state from the man who was kind to me in the coach when I came to Will ; he was not sure he should find us still there , but he would inquire . He was engineer of the force then at work at points east and west , surveying the line of the Union Pacific Railroad . I could not speak of our great need , but he turned away and ordered the man to go on without him . I protested , ' You will lose your place in the stage , and can not get away from here , maybe for days . ' ' I can walk , and nine miles farther on I have a corps of men , and can overtake them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and little to eat . ' ' I shall do ; and this is dreadful for you and your husband , ' he said , and bade the stage-man go on . He told me he knew nothing at all of sickness , and Will was too weak to bear the sight of a strange face ; so he sat down on the wagon-tongue outside , and I went back to the hut with more courage . He brought me my food to the door ; and when , at evening , the mosquitoes grew worse than usual , he built a smudge of damp grass before the door , and all night I saw him at intervals , pacing backwards and forwards beside it . He could not rest in the wagon even , for there were no blankets , and the mosquitoes had taken possession . Toward morning Will revived , and I could leave him , to consult with my new friend a moment . He said I must send one of those boys back twenty-five miles to Wood River , where there was said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy off . Then , finding he could do little for us , and the coach going east fortunately having a vacant seat , he took it , charging me , if we needed assistance later , either there or on our way east , to send someone to hunt up a surveying . party , and he would give orders to them , along the line , to go at once at my call . This gave me much comfort ; for a vague , horrible sense had been growing clearer to me of what might be my needs if Will did not improve in that desolate land , sixty miles from an Eastern settlement . The doctor came next day ; he proved to be a German , from a small cattle-ranch , with little knowledge of English , and less of medicine . He looked at Will in astonishment and then at me , and fairly gasped as he exclaimed , ' What- ever sent such a man as lie out here ? ' Will 's pale , refined face certainly was not that of the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did n't know what to do for ' his kind , ' and he thought ' he would die if he did n't get out of here , ' and he ' minded he would anyway ' ; and then he turned away indifferently , and went to gossip with the woman in the cabin . That coarse bluntness was needed to settle my mind . We must move east early next morning , and that man should go with its and drive . He protested that he could not . He must go back to his cattle . But I still had some faith in his medical knowledge , and meant he should go with us , and set about getting ready . Will was too ill to counsel me about arrangements , and the wagon was ready to start before I disturbed him , to tell him my plans . My firmness about its being best to go gave him courage to allow us to move him carefully into his old place in the wagon ; and when I turned to the doctor , who still doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into the driver 's seat at once , he obeyed , as if I had some right M control him . With our small store of brandy at hand , I climbed in beside Will , and we moved on slowly . At first the motion exhausted him ; but he was certainly no worse when we halted at noon , four or five miles on ; and at the end of a short day 's journey , we found , at a ranch , a comfortable lounge in the living-room of the family , which made a bed for him ; and he took milk more freely , and slept quietly ; and I lay on the floor beside him , and slept , too . It was strange how little sleep I needed , and how little I minded the roughness of everything . Still under protest that his cattle would suffer for care , the German helped me make things comfortable for the second day 's journey , and , to my relief , went with us , though sulky and silent . As for nursing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapable ; but I believed lie could drive and care for the horses ; and , in my anxiety , I had failed to take carefully the direction in which the surveying-party were to be found , and no one seemed to know anything about them , nor could we make any delay with safety , to find help from them . We must make a longer drive that day , to reach shelter at night ; but the deathlike look had gone from poor Will 's face , and the smooth prairie trail gave little jar to the spring wagon , as the horses never moved faster than a steady walk . Noontime brought us to the best sod-house I had seen ; it was really a comfortable home . There were no floors , but the ground was hard and polished , and the inside walls were covered with white cotton cloth , and a ceiling , made of the cloth , was suspended under the roof of sod-covered poles . I made tea and toast for Will on the good cook-stove , and ate with relish , myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house prepared for the doctor and me ; for though it was not a stage-station , in that new country all houses ' keep , ' as the people say . At night , the house where we had planned to stay was more pretentious , but I did not like the looks of the ranch men and women who came out to help us ; and having my choice between a bed in the living-room of the family and one in an empty old cabin near-by , I chose the latter . The door would not shut , the bed was not clean , the dirt-floor was no better than the roadway , and the dust from the old sod-roof above us lay in black ridges on our faces next morning ; but it was enough that Will was certainly gaining strength . The weather was still soft and mild , and t he sun shone all day ; the air was a tonic , and Will dozed away the hours in comfort . I had been able to buy an empty soap-box , of which I made a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage , on our last day 's ride to Columbus , where we should find a hotel and a good physician , and could dismiss our German , and rest until Will was well enough to go home . lint a new trouble met me . Our driver had found whiskey at the ranch , and brought a bottle away with him . He soon fell asleep and , after a little , tumbled in a heap on the floor of the wagon , under the high seat . I could not reach the reins nor dare I alarm Will , who was sleeping and had observed nothing . I only hoped the man would continue to sleep , for the dear horses were old friends , and I knew they would keep to the trail , and turn all right if they should meet a train , which was not likely to happen , as at this season they were all going east . Before we reached the crossing at the Loup River , not far from Columbus , which was a difficult ford and my dread all the anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb to his seat and take the reins again ; and to my great relief , another single wagon , like our own , was about to crawl down the steep bank into the deepest portion of the current . Our Punch and Judy did not need guiding to follow the lead ; and we went safely on across the many islands and channels of the wide river , dangerous , some of them , from quicksands , if you lost the trail , and soon after drew up before this house , where I am writing to you ; and it seems a palace to me , though it really is a dingy two-story building , very bareand common-looking . Freighters and stage-drivers , dressed in rather uncouth style , lounged on the dirty narrow porch ; but I climbed down from the rear of the wagon , in my soiled , oddly draped cotton dress , with a con- Hence in their good-will that I did not find misplaced . A dozen strong men came forward to lift Will out , and take 01T the horses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its guests on the porch ; and if I lout sug gusted to them to take that drunken doctor away and hang him , I think they would have done it . An Ohio woman kept the hotel : she had heard of us from the stage-men , and a word secured us a room up I he stairs , in her barrack-like house , though it was already overfull of men . The wretch who had kept me in fear all day , and could then stand with difficulty , was paid and dismissed . lie had seemed to obey me in coming , as if I owned the world ; and I am sure he be . lieved I owned it all when I paid hint what he asked for coming ; but it mattered little to me so long as we Were safe and among friends , and Will was better . I ate my supper with pleasure , though the forty rough men seated at the table with me seemed much embarrassed at my presence . I recognized respect for me in my helpless state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke to each other in whispers . But oh , dear ! when I came back to our room , hoping to find Will resting and happy , he was , for the first time at his illness , wildly delirious . The sight of so many people , and the bustle and noise of the house , after the worries of the day , were too much for his weak state . I sent in haste for the physician here whom I had heard of , and when he came , I saw I could rely on his aid and his knowledge . He gave a quieting medicine , and this morning , as I sit beside Will , writing , he is quite himself , resting and stronger . Daylight has shown the room to be exceedingly dirty ; the house has been full of disbanded soldiers going cast from stations and camps north of Mc Platte River . The bed was unfit for decent people , and we grow more particular when we reach settlements . As there seem to be few , if any , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand myself a little . I succeeded in getting a ' bucket ' of warm water and a mop , and have taken up a good deal of the dust , and no doubt some fleas and other vermin . We hope on to be able to go on home . I have not dared to write te to you before t his . To think of you and my 1-astern home , and put in words , during the past two weeks , what has taken all my strength and courage to face , would have weakened my self-control . Now I write full of hope and in comparative comfort . Cotrscit BLUFFS , town October 50 , 1865 . It is two weeks since I wrote to you , soon after reaching Columbus , and WC thought a day or two would see us on our way to our home ; but Will did not mend as fast as we hoped he would . Sometimes I lost hope ; but had I not escaped with him alive , from those desolate prairies behind us , the very ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of a kind and intelligent physician , and the essential comforts of life . I cooked Will 's food on the kitchen stove myself ; but I was in no way disheartened , nor did my appetite fail me , when I saw the process of cooking the food for the public table ; I even helped pull out some of the flies from the batter of soaked bread , which stood on the cooking-table ready to be fried into great balls , in spiders full of grease , and knew , when I ate them later for supper , that not a few remained . To show daintiness , or seem to be different from those about me , would repel the kindness so freely given , which was our support and help . When I could leave Will , I went to the I 'M 108 ? No. 3 porch and talked with the stage-drivers , as t hey came in , about the 90-mile journey still before us ? learning how many miles we would be forced to travel in a day to reach the stage-stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom of staying at public places on the road . That we were not molested the night our German doctor found the whiskey , at that lonely wayside ranch , eras fort unate . But , after ten days without much change , we both grew restive ; there were so many things to make our going on more and more imperative . It was the last of October ; these constant days of sunshine must soon end . What if November winds and cold storms set in early ? We had no clothing warm enough for late traveling on the plains , and , to my great satisfaction , Will had come to see , what I had long known , that at his best , even in our pleasant city home , he would not be equal to the demands of Western life upon his physical strength , and we must go back to New York before winter . A coach-ride from Council Bluffs to Des Moines , of 150 miles , was not to be thought of at that season , and the only other way to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we delayed too long at Columbus , the last boat of the season would leave for St. Joseph , Missouri . We must go on . The anxiety and thinking kept Will from getting strong ; but he could not yet walk , much less drive horses , and I could find no one to hire . Every man who could work was out on the prairie with hay-machines , cutting and curing hay for the keeping of the great trains of oxen and mules , which , coming and going to and from the far West , made Columbus a ' refitting ' station , as Council Bluffs is called an ' outfitting one . ' Huge stacks of hay , high and long , and long barns , built of sod and stacked over with hay , stretched in every direcLion from the little cluster of cabins near the hotel , which made what we call a village and they call a town . They had been cutting hay since July , and would keep on till the frost drove them in ; but there were not men enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . There was a camp of soldiers stationed a few miles away , and someone mentioned that a convalescent soldier , an under-officer , had received a furlough , and would be glad of the free passage east , and would he a suitable person to help us . I wrote at once to the commandant of the post , and received a courteous reply , that the man would come the next morning and go with us as we wished ; so , without delay , I made everything ready , and Will grew bright at the prospect of moving on . Our good friends , the stage-drivers , brought him to the porch next morning before they went out with their coaches , and our horses were put on the wagon , already loaded up and before the door . Good-byes were said to our hostess and her barkeeper , who stood smilingly in the doorway ( after confirming to us our previous surmises , that they would soon make a united head to the house ) , and we waited for our soldier . He came with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . The soldier 's papers required him to report by the Southern route at Leavenworth , and he could not go with us ! Will grew faint with disappointment , and exclaimed , ' I shall certainly die if I stay here . ' One glance at his despairing face , and then at our trusty horses , and a look at the sunny sky , and a thought of those stage-drivers who had promised to meet us at the stations , and I said , ' I will drive myself ; help him in . ' Will did not object , and in ten minutes he was in his old place on the mat- ress and pillows , and his voice sounded quite strong and cheery as he called to tell me how to climb over the high sides of the wagon , to reach the seat , perched up so high that the canvass cover almost touched my head ; and I felt elated and happy as I gathered the reins in my bare hands , and turned into the trail to commence our four days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left all signs of habitation behind us . I knew a good deal more about prairie traveling than when I came out . I had not yet resumed my hoops ; the demands of fashion at Columbus , proud and central city as it claimed to be , had not required it . I had completed that morning a most satisfactory bargain , some days under consideration , with a stage-driver 's wife , who had come for a few days to the hotel , for her last summer 's Shaker sunbonnet , with a buff chambray cape and strings , in exchange for my quite stylish and new hat . I was to pay her two dollars in cash besides , for she was not sure that the hat was quite the thing . ' Most uns wore Shakers . ' At the last moment , she yielded . I knew the comfort of that deep shade and fast strings , under the bright sun and prairie winds ; not that my complexion needed shade : I was already brown as the prairie dust , and my gloves were long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , put on under my dress , may have looked a trifle clumsy , but gave me warmth and left my arms free . I was a little dismayed when Punch began to go lame after a mile or so . I dared do a good many things , but not to lift his foot to see what was the matter , and Will must not be worried . But he soon cast a shoe , and I climbed down and recovered it ; the soft , stoneless soil could do no harm , and the first stationmaster put it on again . Our lunch-box was well filled and I made tea on the station stove , while the men hastened to take off the horses and child because Will called out ' Hullo ' in a good full voice . The man had walked across the prairie several miles , to see if they was square with the horses , ' he said , but really to see if we were all right . I can not begin to tell you the comfort these men were to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words to say ; if we expressed gratitude , they turned away shyly and disappeared ; they still looked at its in that wondering sort of way , I suppose because we showed plain marks of being tender-feet , ' as newcomers from the East are called . I was never frightened at our loneliness on the prairie , even when one day they told us there would be a stretch of 16 miles without a house . One day , I was startled for a moment , at a sudden apparition , behind a slight rise of ground , of a dozen Indians , coming in single file , at right angles across our trail ; and the horses , too , showed signs of fear ; but their squaws were with them with loaded ponies , and I knew we were beyond clangorous Indian ground , and they were soon out of sight . Once , at our noon halt , we found no men at home at the station , only a young German woman who could not speak English ; and as the usual custom for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was at a loss what to do ; for to lift a pail of water to those thirsty , eager horses , was beyond my strength and my courage as well ; but the woman came to my help , and did it all with ease . Until the afternoon of the third day we had been following the unbroken trail on the level prairie ; then we came to a large stream with deeply wom banks , and , to my dismay , some of the planks of the long bridge were upset , and it was impassable . I could not leave the horses nor could I lift the heavy planks to replace them . It was nearing sundown ; what could we do if darkness found us in that place ? The coach had already passed us , and not a train or house was in sight . For the first time my teeth chattered with fear . A half-hour 's waiting , and two men in an open spring wagon came rapidly up beside us . Spring wagons are unusual on the plains . The slow-moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used , and they can be seen at a long distance . I thought this one had dropped from the sky , and still more , when the men came quickly to speak to us , and in the tone and language of the far East , asked us how we were . They were entire strangers , but belonged to the surveying-party , of whom we had seen and heard nothing since that morning at Lone Tree , when our friend left us after his night 's vigil . They had been told by their chief to look out for us , and had been expecting to find us at some point farther west , days before that time . Just when all other help failed us , they appeared , and we were soon safely on our way , to the last night station of our journey . The last day was a difficult one for me , though Will was already so nearly well he needed but little care , reclining cheerfully on his cushions , telling me stories and enjoying the sunshine . But the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elkhorn River , and the frequent long descents were perfectly smooth , like ice , and the worn shoes of the horses obliged me to ' put on the brake . ' It was hard to reach it , and harder to press it clown . Then the front bow of the wagon cover had broken , and left the canvas to flap about my face , and the sun beat in my eyes , altogether bringing on a violent headache . For the first time in all the four weeks of care and labor , I came near giving out ; and the nearer we came to t hieklv settled country and town life , the less we could expect of personal interest in us . We were being lost in the edges of the rushing , busy life of that world , which seemed to commence at the Missouri River ; and Heaven , which had been so near , and Angelic care , in the shape of good Johns and civil engineers , no longer seemed about us . When at last , we took our places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the river on the ferryboat at Omaha , I hoped I might never again see the valley of the Platte . We realized , too , when we were unrecog. nized by friends on the boat with us , that we were filling well the rifle of emigrant ' poor white , ' whose faded-out , shabby look had often excited half pity , half contempt in us , in the streets of Council Bluffs . When we drew up at last , at our own door , safe and nearly sound , amid the congratulations of the kindest of neighbors and friends , I still kept in mind the tender , almost worshipful respect and care of our stage-driver friends . And now Punch and Judy , our faithful horses , are to be sold , and a few days must see us on our way down the Missouri , for November 's chill air is here , and our faces are set towards New York and home .                    @
