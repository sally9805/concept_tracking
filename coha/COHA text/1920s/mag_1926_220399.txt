In Manhattan , a suddenly patriotic mob of pedestrians booed , hissed , cried : " If you were a man we 'd lynch you ! " at a woman being hustled out of a restaurant by policemen . The woman was Mrs. Harriet Fowler , owner of the building , who , having ordered her tenant , the restaurant manager , to remove U. S. flags decorating the building , and having been refused , had seized scissors , hacked one U. S. flag in two . In court this woman said : " I thought it was only a piece of bunting . " In court another woman said : " I do n't see how you could do such a thing . This makes me boil ! " <P> The boiling woman was the judge , Magistrate Jean Hortense Norris of Jefferson Market Court . She brought her well-manicured fist down with indignant rage , remanded Mrs. Fowler to jail under $1,000 bail . <P> Since the advent of female governors in Texas and Wyoming , and the spread of the fame of Ohio Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation of " first woman judge " has been somewhat eclipsed nationally . Locally , however , she is more than ever a notable . She began her career when , only two years a bride , she was widowed in 1899 . She had been educated in Germany , Brooklyn and the New York University law school , and soon became an expert tax counsel , social worker , suffragette . In 1919 she reached her magisterial bench , from which she has dispensed much advice as well as justice ; advice , chiefly , to married couples . ( " Kiss and make up before going to bed . " ) Sexless in the performance of her duties , she is every inch a woman in private life . There is nothing of the flat-heeled , bass-voiced " careerist " about the carefully gowned , French-slippered , tastefully bejewelled , vivacious dame of 49 whom many a discriminating New York bachelor is charmed to dine .
