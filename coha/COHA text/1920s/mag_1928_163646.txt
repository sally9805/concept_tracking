As governor , Candidate Smith ordered his son-in-law , Major J. A. Warner , to send a corps of state troopers to Janesville , N. Y. , to protect Senator James Thomas Heflin , who mortally hates and fears the Roman Pope . Just before Senator Heflin began to speak , the platform on which he and 50 others were standing crashed to the ground . Many were bruised ; no one was seriously injured . The troopers kept the excited multitude of 10,000 Klansmen and " other patriots " in order . Shaken but unruffled , Senator Heflin climbed on a safe corner of the wreck and heffled for two hours as the sky grew dark with night . Said he : " Alfred will never see the inside of that White House . In the first place , he wo n't be nominated at Houston ; and if he should be nominated , he will be thoroughly licked . Alfred will get it where McAdoo got it-in the neck . "                @ @ @ @ @
