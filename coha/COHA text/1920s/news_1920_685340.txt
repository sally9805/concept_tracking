txt Princeton University came near destruction by fire early ' this morning when flames which started in a prized recitation hall , fanned by a stiff breeze , left it a blackened ruin , jumped to his-. tonic Marquand Chapel and destroyed it and swept on to the roof of McCosh Hall , a million-dollar building , before a determined fight by regular and volunteer firemen had subdued them . Dickinson Hall , one of the oldest structures on the campus , is gone , and with it invaluable and irreplaceable collections of the professors of economics and philosophy whose students used it . Beautiful Marquand Chapel with its famous old paintings and its splendid artistic memorials is a thing of the past and a charred area on the roof of McCosh Hall tells how near one . of the university 's finest structures came to destruction . At 2 o'clock this morning the fire was under control after apparatus and men from nearby towns had been raced to the aid of the Princeton department and the volunteers from the ranks of the students and old grads here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is estimated at $200,000 , without taking into account those things which have been burned and can not be replaced . Probably never has Princeton lived through a night of more intense excitement . The town was jammed with visit . ors for today 's events , and every upper class club was crowded with girls and their chaperones s attending week-end house parties , and in the gymnasium the freshmen were just swinging well into their dance when the alarm set the whole place aquiver . While some who were not- participating in the night 's gaities came tumbling , tousled and half clad from the dormitories , hundreds in evening clothes hurried from the various social affairs , eager to be the first to attempt rescue work and to fight the fire . There were some among the girls in flimsy evening attire , so fired with enthusiasm they wanted to rush with their escorts into Dickinson Hall , but they were restrained . The hall is named after Jonathan Dickinson , the first President of the University . and is three stories high . How teh fire started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three-story building were lit with the glare of flames sweeping up the stairways and biting through the ceilings . Early arrivals forced their way Jute the building , knowing that it houstld invaluable collections made through the years by the professors of philosophy and economics and that they must be saved quickly if saved at all . Through the smoke-filled halls the students groped their way , clambering up stairways where tongues of . flame already were following them . From room after room they grabbed armfuls of books and papers and collections of data and other exhibits , plunging down and out to the campus just as the first groups of girls and their chaperons joined the excited watchers outside . By then other students had manned the university 's fire fighting apparatus and the first of the city department 's fighters had joined in . Dickinson Hall was ' aflame from basement to roof and even the hardiest of the students dared not go back for more . It is believed that all books , records and collections except the few armfuls carried out were destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be saved and that there was every probability that more college buildings would go , attention was turned to the chapel , directly in the path of the fire if it spread . Across the blackened ruins of what had been a $50,000 building , by no means replaceable for that sum now , the flames jumped to the chapel building . Every effort had been made with the apparatus at hand to interpose a sheet of water between the ever hotter fire and the handsome chapel , but with a stiff wind whipping the fltime sheets about and burning embers showering as the blaze licked through the roof , that effort proved t Students Try to Save Property . While the crowd pressed close , groups of students formed gangs and carried Out as much removable property as they could get . But again the fire was too quick for them , and before they could empty the building they were ordered outside and compelled to remain there . The volunteers did succeed in carrying out most of the pews , and some of the portraits , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of rescuing the altar and some of its occoutrements . Both build ings were unoccupied when the fire started , and hence there were no rescues , nor was any one hurt in the fire fight . Princeton was more than usually crowded when the fire started because the Yale-Cornell crew race is to be rowed on Carnegie Lake today . There also is a baseball game with Harvard and an interscholastic track meet . As a result , probably the biggest crowd that ever gathered on the campus at such early morning hours watched the fire , cheered the regular and the volunteer fire fighters impartially , shouted advice and encouragement and generally joined in the excitement . Dickinson Hall was the gift of John C. Green , and was erected in 1870 from the design of George B. Post of New York . It is built of local stone , trimmed with Connecticut limestone . Extensive alterations were made in the building in 1876 , and the exterior was altered to the appearance familiar to the present generation . Marquand Chapel was the gift of the late Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June . 1881 . I The building was cruciform and constructed of brownstone . The apse contained the organ and choir stalls , the gallery over the main entrance was used in part for visitors and the faculty stalls were along the side of the building . The mural and window decorations were of high artistic character . The Saint Gaudens heroic bronze high relief of the late President McCosh , erected by the class of 1879 , was one of the first objects to confront the visitor : By its side were a low relief memorial tablet to Professor Joseph Henry and a bronze tablet of Professor ' Arnold Guyot , set in a fragment of a Swiss glacial boulder presented by his native city , Neuchatel . On the cast wall of the south transept was the memorial tablet to the Rev. James Ormsbee Murray , first Dean of Princeton University . The tablet was of rose-colored Numidian marble , with a bas relief portrait in white marble , surrounded by an embossed wreath .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
