txt There is now building near Paris a ship which will cross from Cherbourg to New York , it is asserted , in sixty hours on the surface of the water , and which will be able to travel in all weather as an airplane can not . Some time in April , it is hoped , this new adventure in quick transportation will be undertaken . The craft will leave at dawn one day from Cherbourg and will enter New York Harbor two and a half days later , according to the plans . Storms will not affect it , its designers say . Even in rough weather , it . will make between forty and fifty knots . In a calm it is expected to make seventy . There will be six men aboard . They will have a sending and receiving wireless installation . They will carry enough food for ten days , and as they wil ! follow the steamship lanes , they will he in no danger of h'iing lost .

Passengers may demand more comfort and more space ; but it is believed these ships will become the forerunners of a new Atlantic fleet of mail carriers and will be especially useful as dispatch boats in the smaller seas of the world . Like Two Cigars Linked Together . The ship , which is now being built at Saint-Ouen , just outside Paris , and will be taken down the Seine during March , resembles in shape two long cigars with a bridge between them , in which are placed the engine room , wireless room and crew 's accommodation space . Each cigar-shaped floater is slightly more than sixty feet long and nine feet wide . In the middle are placed gasoline storage tanks , which will carry about five tons of fuel .

The tank space will be furnished with an electric pump and ordinary hand pumps . The cabin slung between the two floaters will be about ten feet wide and twenty-seven feet long . It will be entirely enclosed , so that the ship can drive on its way without danger through big waves if it encounters them . A 650 horsepower , eighteen cylinder Lorraine-Dietrich engine will supply the motive power . This engine will be placed just behind the captain 's bridge in the front part of the cabin , with the propeller shaft running through the lower part of the cabin . At first the ship was planned to have an air propeller , but the present plans are for a water propeller . This has the advantage that it will lift the ship forward along the surface of the water , for in essence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oceanogliss-Eur , " denotes . Government Is Interested . After the inevitable initial delays , the building of the ship is now well under way . By the end of this month the two floaters , the cabin and engine will be ready for assembly on the water of the Seine . The French Government is taking a paternal interest in the preparations . In earnest of their faith in the ship the engineer who has designed it , the foreman of the works which is building it and two directors of the company which is financing it , will travel to New York in the crew when it is finished . The other two members will be a captain who has spent his life in the transatlantic service and who declares his complete faith in the invention as the fast ship of the future , and a wireless operator , also experienced in transatlantic sailing . In some ways , this experiment can be considered the French shipbuilders ' reply to Charles A. Lindbergh 's exploit . He crossed the Atlantic in thirty-three hours above the waters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
