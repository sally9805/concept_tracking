A commercial airship line between Chicago and New York , often discussed , took definite shape last week . A corporation is to be formed in which Marshall Field , William Wrigley , Jr. , Franklin D. Roosevelt , Benedict Crowell , former Assistant Secretary of War , and Owen D. Young , Vice-President of the General Electric Company , will be members . <P> First a careful investigation of the possibility of such a line was made , by German engineers , who had been trained in the school of the Zeppelin . The report was favorable and preparations are going ahead . <P> Present plans are to build in this country a rigid dirigible of the Schtte Lanz type . Helium will be used as the elevating gas , because it is non-inflammable . The ship will carry 50 passengers , and is scheduled to leave New York at six in the morning and arrive in Chicago early next morning , the passengers sleeping en route . The Government is to give full co-operation because of the military advantage of developing commercial aviation in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
