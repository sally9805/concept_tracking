txt Has the new status of women , which in theory puts them upon an equality with men politically and economically , so changed the relations of the sexes in the affairs of life that men are no longer inclined to accord women the deference , courtesy and consideration that were their due under the old order of things ? Mrs. ANNA SPENCER , ill a lecture before the Teachers College of Columbia University on Friday , said that she was sorry to observe that many women were claiming *4 the " same kind of privileges that chival " rous and good-hearted men used to " give to their mothers , sisters and " friends when those mothers , sisters " and friends mere absolutely de " pendent upon them . " Privileges so defined are somewhat ambiguous . The inference is that men are not disposed now to be helpful and generous toward their women relatives and friends who endeavor to be economically independent . If that is true , the age of chivalry toward the gentler sex has departed , or is passing , for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and to personal friends , they must feel like putting other women on the same plane with themselves in all contacts in business and social intercourse and in public . Do even the advocates of absolute equality of women under the law maintain that the attitude of men toward women has become calculating and less kind ? In some States the legal status of women is not satisfactory to them , men enjoying certain rights withheld . These are sometimes unimportant , but there are women who want an exact balance of rights between the sexes , with complete legal independence of man . Privileges of any kind they scorn . They may be firmly of the opinion that deference , courtesy , consideration and the will to help women are no longer in man 's standard of his relations with women . But that is not the case , and women who understand man better know that he has not changed because they have got the ballot and are striking out for themselves . Woman is still the weaker vessel and always will be . She still needs man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of life she will always be at a disadvantage , and most of the prizes and the wealth will go to man . ' The average woman understands this and does not rebel against it . She is no more hostile to him than he is to her . Under the new order woman will not be idealised so much  --  it is just as well ; but no laws to make her his . equal as a citizen can alienate man 's sympathy , diminish in the least his respect , or impair that spirit of so-called chivalry that manifests itself in the desire to help , protect and be gentle to her because of her sex . Really , there is no such being as the new woman . Woman is unchangeable , the eternal feminine . But when all this is said , it is better for society , better for the relations of men and women , contributing to the character and larger growth of both , that woman should be given every opportunity to develop her talents and to enjoy political freedom .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
