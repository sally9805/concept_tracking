For some time Lucien Gaudin , said to be the world 's greatest swordsman , and Armand Massard , 1920 Olympic epe champion , have been getting cooler and cooler toward each other . It was nothing more than professional jealousy . <P> Early one bright , cold morning , the two principals and their seconds met for combat . The two men stripped , whipped out their swords , stood face to face . There was a sharp " Engages ! " and the two pieces of steel began to grind and clash . The contest was short . M. Massard , the challenger , flicked a small wound in the sword hand of his opponent . Three doctors fled into the field , declared the wound slight , but Gaudin could not continue . Honor was satisfied . <P> Three days later , M. Gaudin met Charles Delporte of Belgium at Brussels , defeated him in a fencing match 12 to 4 points .
