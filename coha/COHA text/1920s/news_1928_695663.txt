txt A HOME FOR THE AGED . An Institution Ministering to a ? Pathetic and Growing Need . To the Editor of Tile New York limes : Announcement . was made recently that building operations , intended to double the capacity of the Home for Old Men and Aged Couples , situated opposite the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Amsterdam Avenue , will start shortly . This , in my opinion , is of unusual significance and worthy of especial note by all those interested in the progress of- old-age security . Fifty-six years ago last Sunday a group of members of the Episcopal Church , headed by Bishop Horatio Potter , met and evolved a plan for 1 he founding of a home " where old men and aged couples of known respectability might pass their remaining days in bodily comforts and spiritual privileges and freed from temporal ' anxieties . " Performing a distinguished and humane service for more than a half century , the admirable foresight and broad sympathies of these gentlemen and the wisdom of that policy are only now coming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public attention . The recent report of the Welfare Council , showing that 13,000 aged persons are being cared for in the eighty-two homes in New York , and that another 6,000 are without such care while they remain on an evergrowing waiting list , had a salutary effect on the public mind which was reflected in the widespread comment these figures promoted in the press . That the Home for Old Men and Aged Couples , in advance of this report , should have taken steps not only to keep abreast of this problem " put to anticipate its future requirements is a singular tribute to the institution itself and to those charged with its direction . The home to which I refer has taken the lead in providing its residents with not only the necessaries of life but also with as many of the comforts and pleasures as possible . The warm and tender atmosphere of a real home has been preserved , the restrictive regulations common to most charitable institutions have been reduced to a minimum , and the peculiarities of old age are recognized and met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sadder fate than that of the old couple . who have faced life 's problems together , and who have known no greater happiness than the joy of their mutual companionship , being forced to sepa- ! rate at the time when they have no one but each other : the man to wither away in an institution for men and  --  the woman to grieve out her heart in a home for women . Experience has shown that one or the other usually passes away after a few months of such separation . The Home for Old Men and Aged Couples is one of the few institutions in New York in which elderly couples may spend their last years together . . As this home has led , I firmly believe other institutions will follow . It is making a noble effort to obtain the 8188.000 necessary to complete a fund of $700,000 required for the new building and endowment . A pathetically long waiting list makes it imperative that the fund be in hand by Dec. 15 . Contributions should be sent to the Equitable Trust Company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City . GEORGE W. WICKERSHAM . New York , Nov. 30 , 1928 . High Praise . To the Editor of The Neu : York . Times : I feel I can not return to England without writing to compliment you on your journal . Especially interesting and much appreciated have been the leading articles on international questions and topics , more especially those concerning this country and Great Britain . which , for impartiality . largeness of vision and clarity of expression , could not be surpassed . If only other journals . both in this country and Great Britain . would take a lead from you . I feel sure the two nations , by which I mean the citizens of each country , would understand and appreciate the viewpoint of each other much better than they do at present , which would be better for the whole world in general . The power of the press is much stronger in influencing the minds and opinions of people than is generaSy supposed . Having served in the war myself , your leader today , " Graves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expressed by the King of England . are certainly re-echoed by all Englishmen I have spoken to on the subject of war and who passed through those terrible years of strain and anguish . R. C. ineieso:e . Brooklyn , N. Y .. Nov. 25. 1523 . To the Editor of The ' New York Theo2s : As a visitor to America for the first time , I have been surprised at many things , but nothing has surprised me more than the wide and accurate reports of news front Europe , especialiy from Great Britain . which you publish . and your thoughtful and reasoned editorials . This opinion is quite contrary to what I expected to find , because of what my American friends told me about American newspapers . THE NEw YORK- TIMES is without doubt one of the great journals of the world . HEDLEY CRABTREIG . Boston , Mass .. Nov. 23 , 1028 . Cynical Comment . To the Editor of The Ncw York Times : Newspapers delight in the caption " Robbery Below the Dead Line " or " Every Exit From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these headings induce a broad smile in New Yorkers . The " dead line " originating with Inspector Byrnes was a myth , even when first introduced many years ago . Now , with the great increase of population and crooks and with access below Fulton Street made easier , it has ceased to be a myth and has become a fable . " Guarding exits " is an equally good joke . Imagine the . force of police necessary to watch every ferryboat , every auto , every trolley and eNery road or footpath leading out of the city . Incidentally . the seasoned crook knows that lie is more safely hidden in many sections of New York City than If he went elsewhere , where , with a smaller population , his presence would he more conspicuous .

I am sure that I am expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves against this public annoyance . WILLIAM ROBINSON , M. D. New York , Nov. 27 , 19 ' 18.
