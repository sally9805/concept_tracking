txt EMOTION IN MUSIC element is represented by the word judge ment ' and the emotional by the word ' value ' ; I argue elsewhere ' that emotion is the source of our values . A judgement of value , then , casts a feeling into the form of a judgement , which is a logical proposition involving and addressed to the intellect . When we say " This is good " , we communicate in that short proposition a fact and an emotion . The communication is in tellectual : the emotion communicated , though recognizably distinct , is inseparable from the intellectual judgement . The psychosis is indi visible . Similarly what happens in Art is that some experience of an emotional character , which from the nature of the case is fleeting , has somehow been caught up and crystallized by the intellect in somewhat the same kind of way as the particular facts apprehended by the intellect are caught up and crystallized in con cepts . This crystallized emotion is the work of art . On the face of it Wordsworth 's famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seems inadequate , but it 6o McDOUGALL 'S HYPOTHESIS does embody this central idea that an evanescent experience has somehow been caught and given a permanent form . We are all familiar with emotional states by our own direct experience of them , and psychologists tried for long enough to make out an exhaustive list of the various emotions , each of which has a peculiar quality . But the lists when they had got them led nowhere and only resulted in confusion , for our emotional life does not appear to introspection as a succession of this , that and the other , but as a continually changing stream in which one element comes into prominence and then fades into something else ; fear to curiosity , curiosity to annoyance or anger , anger to disgust and so on . McDougall has therefore put forward a hypothesis about the general nature of emotion , which systematises the emotions and brings them into relation with the other phenomena of mind , and yet allows for the distinctive qualities of the different emotions recognized by common speech and literature . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assent among psychologists , but it is finding increasing support and in the absence of any equally comprehensive account may safely be accepted as the starting point for any enquiry that involves the study of the emotions . The hypothesis is that emotion is the central part of all instinctive mental processes . The complete mental process , as we have already seen , consists of first becoming aware of a stimulating object and finally acting somehow towards it in a way innately determined . Between the cognitive and conative activities is a central part , the affective . The cognitive and conative activities admit of very great modifications not only in individuals but between one man and another , but the affective part is common to all men and remains uncontrollable and unchanging in the individual . Fear , for example , causes different men to act differently and men are made afraid by the perception of different objects , and the same individual may be frightened by different objects at different stages of his career ; but the central thing , the feeling of fear is everywhere and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central part , which may be called its accompanying emotion , with a peculiar quality of its own . These are the primary emotions , and McDougall has sifted out of the vast range of our emotional exper ience those which seem to be irreducible to anything else or to one another , and tabulates the primary emotions and the instincts from which they are derived in parallel columns thus : 2 // But the complexity of the experience of the civilized adult is such that he rarely experiences any of these crude emotions in a pure form : far more frequently two or more emotions are // aroused simultaneously and blend to form sec-ondary and tertiary emotions . As an example of a binary compound he gives scorn , which is the mixture of disgust and anger . Add positive self-feeling to scorn and we get contempt . In a similar way he accounts for admiration as the mixture of wonder and submission , for awe as admiration plus fear ( " admiration is a binary , awe a tertiary compound " ) . Add gratitude to awe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender emotion and negative self-feeling ( submission ) . Fear plus disgust is loathing ; add wonder and we get fascination . This account of the origin and nature of emo-tion as we experience it in ordinary life is but a rough summary : it is necessary to add that these primary and derived emotions are blended with one another and modified in a hundred ways : They are however but the raw material of our emotional life , which would be at the level of the animals if we felt and behaved according as the fleeting stimulus of the moment aroused first one and then another of these instinctive // emotions and their derivatives . The mind of civi lized man is more highly organized than this , for the evanescence of emotion is one of its most noteworthy characteristics . ' While any feeling of fear , anger or more subtly compounded emotion is at once the chief motive of action and the standard of value by which all behaviour , both of the subject himself and of others , is judged while it lasts , its duration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remain in a state of bad temper for an hour after an outburst , but a day wears away all but a thin substratum of the most intense emotion.2 It will , however , be objected that some mo tives of instinctive or emotional origin sometimes dominate conduct for years or even a lifetime // stories of revenge offer more striking examples of what happens in the experience of everyone . This kind of emotional permanence is explained by the doctrine of the " sentiments " , ' accord ing to which our emotions tend to organize them-selves about the various objects which excite them . The word complex ' is sometimes applied to these systems of associated mental elements which are bound together by emotional ties . Psychologists have not yet made up their minds whether the term ' complex ' should be restricted to pathological sentiments ' , 2 but the fact is now universally recognized , and can be verified by anyone who observes at all care-fully the behaviour of his fellow men , that the mind does organize its experiences into systems which are unified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one of the elements is stimu lated , the whole system is called into activity . A musical example will make this clear . By the war a very strong German complex in which many of the strongest primary emotions ? fear , // anger , aggression , gregariousness ? provided the affective bonds , was organized in the minds of most Englishmen , with the result that many musical people , who could n't deny the greatness of Beethoven and Wagner , said quite openly that while they did n't wish to say anything against the quality of the music they did n't want to hear it just now ; in the case of Strauss they went further , and not only would not listen to him , but saw in the fact of his writing for an orchestra of some size the megalomania of the Kaiser ; while purists who previously condemned the use of any song translations could no longer bear to hear their Schubert and Brahms in German . Any German association tended to rouse the whole complex into activity with its accompanying emotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of this kind , though they are not always so highly charged with strong affect , that most of the emotions of ordinary experience are derived . Sometimes an instinct may be aroused pure and its corresponding pure emotion experienced , but much more frequently our feelings are blends 68 " PURELY MUSICAL EMOTION " of several instinctive emotions or derived from sentiments . In any case the ultimate source of any emotion must always be sought among the instincts . It is the difficulty of finding adequate origins in instinct that compels us to reject the hypo-thesis of a purely musical emotion . For either we have to postulate a purely musical instinct or to show that we have a music sentiment capable of yielding the rich emotional content revealed in the works of composers and experi-enced by the listener . The objections to postu-lating a primary instinct for music are numerous , independently of the biological objections . First , there is the wide recognition already noticed that whatever the nature of musical satisfaction may be , it is the same in essence as that derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall be driven to do the same for religion , scientific enquiry and conscience ? which seems to be untidy and uneconomical thinking . Further , as we shall see , there are elements of several // other instincts embedded in aesthetic experience , so that it can not be one of the primary instincts . Then again the emotion yielded by a primary instinct is a single feeling of peculiar quality ( cf. Ribot 's definition p. 66 ) , and it would be difficult to regard the content of a funeral march and a scherzo as producing the same single peculiar effect on the listener . If we admit a whole series of emotions peculiar to music ( as Dr. Brown ' ) , we have but added to our difficulties , for we can give no account of them or of their origin . The most hopeful source of a purely musical emotion is the sense of rhythm . Sense ' of rhythm I say , but it has some claims to be called an instinct . Rhythm is undoubtedly innate , and not only an innate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but possessing considerable dynamic powers , which bring it very nearly into the realm of emotion ( Wundt indeed calls it an emotion ) . A rhythmic move ment like drumming with one 's heels seems to produce a purely rhythmic pleasure of an // emotional character , but it may also produce a whole series of ordinary emotions ranging from stupor to frenzy . In any case whether it be an emotion or a sense ? the sense by which we apprehend time ? and however large a part it plays in musical satisfaction , ' we are hardly // entitled to explain the emotional significance solely in terms of rhythm and take no account of the great powers of emotional expression pos sessed by other elements in music , melody , harmony , design and tone-colour . The whole is greater than the part . ' But if we have no aesthetic instinct it is certain that we have an aesthetic sentiment . M. Ribot in ch . X of his classic work on the emotions expresses the origin and traces the evolution of our aesthetic sentiment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play impulse , and is emphatic that there is a purely instinctive element . " This X , " he writes , speaking of the proprium quid of creative work , " which for want of a better term we may call spontaneity , is of the nature of an instinct . It is a craving to create , equivalent in the intellectual order to // the generative craving in the physiological order . " And from this germ he traces the evolution of the sentiment through dancing , ( which is muscular play ) , and ornament ( which has a social value ) , to the anthropomorphic stage where art is freed from a merely human reference and man is enabled to derive aesthetic pleasure from the natural beauty of scenery ( a late development for which there seems to have been no taste even in classical times ) , till finally he can talk of Art for Art 's sake ' . Some such analysis must be accepted of the origin of the pleasure which we derive from the contemplation of beauty ( whether of Nature , art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any artistic activity . A singer or conductor for example if asked to register the emotional content of his consciousness at the actual moment of performing a work will be most aware of a sense of power or impotence in " getting it over " , whether he has gripped his audience , whether he is obtaining this nuance from his instrument and so on ; in fact the dominant emotion is that derived from the instinct of construction and is // identical in kind with that of a potter shaping his vessel , of a schoolboy solving an algebraical problem , of a chemist at the critical moment of his experiment , or of anyone engaged in anything which is coming right ' or going wrong ' . But this emotion is plainly not that which inspired the composer to write , though it will dominate his mind perhaps during the labour-pains of composition , and it is certainly not what the listener feels . It is neither a purely musical emotion nor is it the emotional content of a work of art . The emotions of the listener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreboding at Zamiel 's syncopated drum-taps in Der Freischutz , rapture in the last movement of the Ninth Symphony , and terror in Hoist 's Mars , yet it is not quite the same foreboding that he experiences at receiving a summons to a fateful interview or the terror of actual warfare . Something happens to the emotion which makes it different , though leaving it the same emotion . This something is Wordsworth 's " remembering in tranquillity " . It is the essence of art , like the essential meaning of a thing crystallized in // a concept . The emotion is caught up by an act of intuition . The difficulty of this view for music is the indefiniteness of the emotion as seen by introspection and the great variation in the emotion produced in or suggested to different minds . The Andante of a string quartet may suggest to one the tranquillity of the sea at Margate on a summer morning , to another the tranquillity of religious resignation , to a third the quiet satisfaction of a piece of work well done , while the composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that it was some charming idyll which he read in a book of short stories . This very serious difficulty is robbed of its worst terrors by Ribot 's doctrine of emotional memory and by a consideration , universally recognized , of the complexity and variation in human character . Let us see how all this works . It is to deliver myself into the hands of the enemy and to commit the unforgivable sin . But for the argument 's sake let me take a musical example and imagine a not impossible ( I hope ) // programme for it . Brahms towards the end of his life wrote Taking this movement in connection with what we know , both from his music and his biography , of his life , thought , tastes and character , we may interpret it as an expression of that passionate longing , which for some natures is specially apt to arise at the contemplation of great natural beauty , to seize upon life , to stop the flow of time , and with a side-glance at Death to eternalize the transient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind , and its quality is so subtle as to be inexpressible save in musicwords will not do it.2 Not every human being HOW PERFORMERS DIFFER will feel the mingled wistfulness and gratitude of it ( extroverts probably will not ) , and those who do feel it will feel the mingled emotional elements in different degrees of strength accord-ing to their intellectual faith , their emotional sensitiveness , even their physical sensitiveness to sun and air , in a word , according to their person-ality . Hence it comes about that any two violinists playing this work may take this theme a shade faster or slower , and while they can hardly fail to feel its wistfulness may interpret it in a different sense from that given by two other violinists . And it also comes about that while we can all write strings of thirds and sixths , they wo n't be what Brahms wrote because we are not Brahms and have not the precise blend of intellectual , emotional , moral and other traits that Brahms had . Further a similar emotional stimulus would react differently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // admitted widely enough , but not always realized at their full value . They would certainly be difficult to maintain and account for on Hanslick 's theory of " arabesques sonores " . It seems safe to assume that all humans are equipped with the same instincts from which emotion is ultimately derived , and that we can all experience all the emotions ? Mr. Holst says that musicians are expressing in sound what all men feel ; and yet within this fundamental sameness there is the enormous divergence which we have just noted . When we come to the divergence . of interpretation given by those who listen to the Clarinet Quintet or to our imaginary tranquil Andante , how shall we reconcile the summer morning at Margate with religious resignation ? By M. Ribot 's theory of emotional memory ; which claims that emotional states divested of all their accompanying circumstances can leave behind them a memory of themselves . Alongside of ordinary intellectual memory is this affective memory in which the feeling of love , fear or disappointment is separated from its causes on the various occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense an abstract emotion , analogous to an abstract idea ( or concept ) . Now the motion of music arouses general or abstract emotional states ( an abstract of tranquil-lity in our example ) and through them by means of association and a kind of emotional reverbera-tion , calls up in each hearer his own particular images and ideas which have once formed the settings of such emotional states in each indivi-dual 's experience . ' Confirmation is found for this doctrine in the close connection between emotion , bodily movement and the movement of music . Thus M. Combarieu who rejects the idea that musical composition is emotional memory claims for his own doctrine= what he calls " le dynamisme de la vie passionelle " . " Directement , la musique ne peut traduire aucun sentiment determine " he says which is precisely what I argue it does do ; mais , de la vie psychique elle traduit 1'intensite , le dynamisme interieur et // general avec tous ses degres . . . elle neglige les representations et les concepts qui accom pagnent 1'etat affectif ; n'en retient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le dynamometre le la vie sentimentale . " The same idea appears in H. J. Watt 's Foundations of Music . " Melody " he says " is the motional connection between tones , and with all its means of variation ( rhythm , speed , pitch , etc. ) it is only necessary to bring the motions of music into some sort of corres pondence with the character of the acts and energies of man for it to be able to express his soul 's life . " Music is a form of motion , non-spatial but temporal . On the other side the connection of emotional states with bodily move ments has been emerging more and more clearly in psychology . James 's topsy-turvy doctrine of the emotions ' is only an overstatement of the accepted view that it is incipient conation . The two words motion ' and emotion ' signifi cantly have a number of their letters in common . No one can deny motion to music , however much he may wish to keep it free from e-motion. 8o MOTION AND EMOTION Motion will thus express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of whatever sort ? whether , as Ribot says , it be the feelings that arise from neuralgia or the grief expressed by Michael Angelo in his Sonnets ? reduces itself to a heightening or depression of the energy of the organism . The motions of music will then express the composer 's emotions and awaken those of his audience , and just as every individual listener has a different idea of the concept dog ' according to his individual experience of particular dogs , so will his emotion of tranquillity be different according to the different circumstances ( at Margate or in a cathedral ) in which he has experienced tranquillity and to the individual make-up of his own character . An objection which a doctrine such as the one here put forward has to meet is the phenomenon of the prodigy , which has occurred so frequently in the history of music . If character and emotional experience are the vital essence of music how can the music of a very young man , a Mozart or a Mendelssohn or a Schubert , // have the worth which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is hard to give a complete answer , but two things may be borne in mind . First , instinct is a natural endowment and may develop young , so that the chief ingredient , emotional susceptibility , is given , just as exceptional intellectual ability is a gift of Nature and may put forth its powers early ; any theory , except perhaps Hanslick 's formalism , must take so much for granted . Second , though it is easy to make a list of youthful geniuses who have given birth to full-grown works of art , an equally if not more imposing list may be made of composers who like Beethoven and Wagner have only produced their greatest work in maturity after deep experience of life . We shall never explain why some men are more gifted than others , nor why one man 's gift runs to making those flying leaps which we call creation in the field of chemistry and another 's in the field of periodic sound vibrations . But that need not discourage us from examining the fruits of the gift , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face and pass by . // Emotion then is the impulse which sets the creative instinct at work and is the subject-matter of the communication that the creator gives to the world . In the process of giving it he crystallizes it , putting into permanent form something that as it occurs is of brief duration . How does he do it ? What is the nature of the crystallizing process ? Modern opinion in the main follows Croce in declaring it to be an act of intuition , i.e. it is a process of cognition and the work of the intellect . Lascelles Abercrombie pursues the implications of this and says that beauty is not a quality of things but an intuition or judgement passed on experience , and the work of art is the expression of the complete experience , which includes the value it has for the mind which experiences it . ' He further holds , as Croce does not , that an essential attribute of art is that it is communication or publication // to others of a complete experience ( ' complete ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of communication the expression must be external ; and since an intuition , if it is to be communicated , must take the form of a judgement we are justified in saying that the intuition of art is a judgement of value . The use of the word " judgement " in this extended sense may seem unwarrantable . In Logic a judgement has the form of a proposition of which one can say that it is either true or false . Even in a matter of taste where it is impossible for anyone to say definitively " This is good " or This is beautiful " because someone else with equal weight of argument or authority may say the opposite , and where there is no means of establishing its absolute truth as in mathematics , formally this judgement of value is susceptible of being described as true or untrue . A work of art , such as a Beethoven sonata , on the other hand , can not have truth or falsehood predicated of it . Yet I have described it as a judgement of value . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristotle to regard an action as the // conclusion of a practical syllogism . The funda mental act of mind which is the same in the categories of morality , truth , and beauty , is an intuition ; and just as an intuition of morality may either take the form of a judgement " This is good " or the form of an action , so in the sphere of aesthetic it may take the form of a critical judgement " This is fine " or of a work of art where the content is much richer . I keep the term " judgement " because in the first place it implies some elaboration of the crude intuition into a presentable form and in the second place because " judgement of value " is a complete phrase which describes immediately the class of phenomena to which I assign works of art . Art , of course , is not concerned with facts or statements and can make no existential judge ments ; its subject-matter is value , and experience only has value in so far as it appeals to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in instinct , are the finest flower of human evolution without which reason itself is barren and may become evil . And it is the highest in man with which the masterpieces of music deal . 85 IV RHYTHM IT is not too much to say that Rhythm is the vital principle of music . Sound is its body and Form its skeleton , but it is Rhythm that gives the body life . It is not necessary therefore to insist on its importance , which is recognized by most performers and teachers of music . But it presents two distinct difficulties to musicians : one is the practical problem of infusing the vitality of rhythm into the performance of any piece of music ? this is the artist 's secret and comes to him more or less intuitively by revelation ; the other is the critical difficulty of knowing really and precisely what this mysterious property of art is and so of talking sense about it . Rhythm is not confined to the art of music , but runs through the other time-arts , and according to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ; and it is also found in some regions of // human experience which have little connection with art . This confounds the confusion of the word still further . It is not always desirable to insist on definitions , but our uses of the word rhythm ' , even when it is confined to music , are so loose and so varied that it will be advantageous to know what the essence of the thing really is . This fortunately is possible by an appeal to psychology . We can put aside all our preconceptions about it and approach it scientifically , for rhythm is one of the properties of our minds which have been submitted to laboratory experiment . Suppose you rap with your knuckles on the table something of this kind : you will not be able to count the number of strokes ; but if you do the same thing again , you will know infallibly that the second series of taps was an exact reproduction of the first both as to the length of time occupied by the taps , their number , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any process of reasoning , as you would do if you knew by counting how many strokes there were , but by a direct perception , which is almost of the nature of a sixth sense ( over and above the sense of hearing by which the strokes of sound are conveyed to the mind ) . This is an innate faculty for apprehending time and is called a sense of rhythm . It is a sense that only works at all accurately within very narrow limits , though certain things like anniversaries have some rhythmic significance ? i.e. the mind can roughly feel the periodic recurrence of a point of time even with so long an interval . Owing to the fact that this time-sense has so limited a scope we can only think of time symbolically , i.e. by translating it into terms of number or space : an hour is measured by hands on a dial ? we all know how it varies in length according as we are busy or bored . But within its limits our sense of rhythm is very accurate , or can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments on the sense of rhythm have been made with sound , though // flashes of light have also been used . Of these the one which illumines most clearly the real nature of rhythm was conducted by Dr. Bolton in America , thirty years ago . ' BOLTON 'S EXPERIMENT There were two main objects of this experi-ment : the first and most important was to ascer-tain what the mind did with a series of simple auditory impressions ( sounds ) in which there was absolutely no change of intensity , pitch , quality or time-interval ; the other object was to find out what value for organizing such a series of sounds so that it could be grasped as a rhythmic unit , regular variations in intensity or time-interval have . To ensure absolute uniformity in sound and interval an electric apparatus was constructed which emitted clicks like a telephone . The rate of the clicks could be varied by the operator , however , and every subject was tried with several different rates . The subjects , over fifty in number , were people of all kinds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiment . They were just invited to be seated , to listen and to make any comments of any sort they liked . A number of them noticed an apparent change in the intensity of the sounds and commenced to group the clicks into twos and fours ; generally , however , it required some kind of suggestion to direct the attention of the subject to the grouping of the sounds . These suggestions were made indirectly if possible , e.g. if the subject had remarked that it was like a clock he was asked whether there was the difference in quality ( tick-tock ) that is apparent in the ticking of a clock . In some cases it was noticed that the subject was unconsciously keeping time by moving a muscle , the foot or in one case the eyelid , and he was asked why he was doing it . This drew his attention to the fact that he was grouping the sounds . In the end it was found that all the subjects except two , who were both utterly unmusical , made groupings of those monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tick , which in reality was no stronger than any of the 90 unaccented ticks . This means that our rhythmic sense organizes any series of monotonous sounds by breaking them up into organic groups , consisting of a strong accent with weak ones attached to and belonging to it . And each group seems to be separated from its neighbour by an apparently longer interval than separates the individual clicks . This organizing of strokes of sound into separate and recognisable groups was what we tested when we rapped on the table the rhythm given on p. 87 , only in that case the sounds were by no means monotonous but already organized by us ; and it can be readily understood how much stronger is the hold on the mind when the group is presented to it ready organized . This is what the artist has to do with his rhythms , whether he works in poetry , dancing or music . Of the two subjects who resisted all suggestions of grouping Bolton gives the following account : Subject 18 . Time rate of .325 seconds per click . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too slow or too fast . By no suggestion // could any kind of grouping of the sounds be effected . The subject declared they were all uniform in intensity . The subject had no musical talent and no interest in music . Subject 30 . No musical talent . Time rate .268 secs . By no suggestion was it possible for the subject to effect any kind of grouping of the sounds , which appeared as a dead monotonous series and suggested a pile-driver . These were the only two out of more than fifty who made no groupings , but it was noted that in general , younger and less educated subjects yielded more easily and quickly to the suggestion of a rhythmical grouping . The general conclusions of the experiment he states as follows : " A given number of auditory impressions within certain time-limits , when presented in such a way that there is a kind of subordination among them with respect either to time , intensity , pitch or quality , or with respect to any two or more of these properties , always stand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the essential condition of a number of // impressions entering into a state of consciousness . If such organic unity does not exist and it is possible to make it , the mind imposes such an arrangement upon a given number of the elements that they may enter into a state of consciousness . The essential condition of forming such a unity among sounds is a regular temporal sequence within the limits ( i . o sec. and o. l sec. ) ' and perfect uniformity in intensity , pitch and quality . " That is , if there is a gap of more than r second between each stroke of sound , and the sounds are quite monotonous , we shall not be able to group them nor feel them as anything but unrelated noises . If , however , the sounds are not monotonous , but there is present some organization by means of accent or variation in pitch or duration , we shall the more easily grasp them as a rhythm and longer time periods can be grasped as units.2 " Regular variations " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitch or quality , or to any two , or to all of these together , will effect a subordination among them sufficient // to constitute an organic unity . There is a temporal limit within which these variations must occur in order to form such a unity . . . In a series of auditory impressions any regular recurrent impression which is different from the rest , subordinates the other impressions to it in such a way that they fall together in groups . If the recurrent difference is one of intensity ( louder ) , the stronger impression comes first in the group and the weaker ones after . If the recurrent difference is one of duration , the longest impression comes last . " From this , then , it appears that rhythm implies two things : periodicity of the sound ( or movement ) and some organizing principle which we may call stress ' . Stress itself may be of three kinds : an increase of intensity , duration , or pitch , or two or all three of them together ; and experiments have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitch , for example , was found to give equivocal results when it was used as the sole determinant of a rhythm ; some individuals heard the high tones as the more intense , others the low , while to some // highness and lowness were indifferent . But both in speech and in melody pitch may act as an intensifier of whatever is marking the rhythm . If , for example , one says " Really ? " in tones of incredulity one pronounces the e ' strongly on a sound of low pitch , and if one says " Really ! " in outraged astonishment the e ' is again accented but on a tone of high pitch ; and in a melody the climax will often come on a high note which will generally be found to be on a strong accent . Pitch then may be a substitute for or a further intensification of intensity , but by itself can hardly be said to determine a rhythm . In speech duration and accent vary a great deal from language to language in the part each plays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nowadays at least , determined by accent. = An interesting experiment , however , was carried out on a harmonium , where accent was impossible , which showed that in the absence of accent , duration is called in as the organizing principle . Attached to the ' keys of the instrument were suitable electric contacts which regis- // tered in hundredths of a second the length of time during which each key was depressed . Four different organists were asked to play over // five hymns , and it was found that the strong beats of the bars received more time than the weak , and that " equal " notes were very far from having equal duration . For the test quoted opposite only the air was played , but when the hymn was played over with all parts no greater accuracy was found . Psychologically the experiment is decisive : duration is capable by itself of determining a rhythm . Musically all sorts of interesting things appear : = note ( I ) the difficulty of playing even triplets ; C 's are much the best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers agree in making the last of the four crotchets a stronger note than the third , and second in importance to the strong first crotchet , the great variation that is possible in the treatment of the anacrusis ( the beginning of each stanza ) , C treating each one differently ( observe how he makes an // " organist 's start " with a long first note , but at the second anacrusis stresses the second note , while at the last stanza he gives both notes an equal duration of 75 ) , ( q. ) the enormous possibilities of giving an individual interpretation to any piece of music merely by the relative durations of the notes . In this example B is the most erratic performer , and must be adjudged , seeing that this is a hymn-tune , easily the worst : his triplets are a disgrace , though he atones for this to some extent by the evenness of his crotchets . But he has a curious trick of dwelling on the third beats of the bar , ( note the B in bar r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanza 8 ; also note that he makes a half-way pause at the end of stanza /3 ) . It would be interesting to see how cross rhythms came out on this instrument and to observe the inner construction in terms of number of a bar of time . // A propos of 4 time , explanations which regard it as alternations of groups of two and groups of three would seem to be if not definitely wrong , at any rate superfluous and improbable . Experi ment has shown that the condition of a rhythm being perceived is that the mind shall grasp a time period as a unit , and that the time periods shall all be equal ? periodicity , i.e. , is the essence of the rhythm . This is not to deny the possi bility of having two standard-units in one 's mind and attending to each alternately , but in practice the mind easily and naturally integrates them into a bigger unit unless the rate is very slow . There is experimental evidence for this , and as it also gives us interesting information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , it is worth quoting in full . ' It arises out of the point from which we set out ? the inability of our minds to comprehend time directly without recourse to symbolism of one sort or another , such as counting or spaces on a dial . It shows that we can only directly and immediately apprehend the present moment , and // it goes on to ascertain how long the present moment is : " Hearing is the sense by which the subdivision of duration is most sharply made . Almost all experiments on the time sense have been done by means of strokes of sound . How long a series of sounds then can we group in the mind so as not to confound it with a longer or shorter series ? Our spontaneous tendency is to break up any monotonously-given series of sounds into some sort of rhythm Cf. Bolton 's Experiment .

Whenever we thus group the impressions in rhythmic form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wundt found that 12 impressions could be distinguished clearly as a united cluster , provided they were caught in a certain rhythm of the mind i.e. that the group was felt to have a certain internal organization and succeeded each other at intervals not smaller than .3 and not larger than .5 sec . I00 THE PRESENT MOMENT ( This makes the total time distinctly appre-hended to be anything from 3.6 to 6 secs . ) Dietze ( a disciple of Wundt ) gives larger figures . The most favourable intervals for clearly catching the strokes were when they came at from .3 to . i 8 secs . apart . 40 strokes might then be remarked as a whole and identified without error when repeated , pro-vided the mind grasped them ins sub-groups of 8 , or 8 sub-groups of s each .

It would have given a symbolic concept and no intuitive or imme-diate perception of the totality of the series . With counting we may , of course , compare together series of any length ? series whose beginnings have faded from our minds and of whose totality we retain no sensible at all . " RHYTHM It is plain from these experiments that pace is the all-important factor which determines how the grouping shall be made , but it is also clear that any grouping so made is a unit and can be apprehended as such and that 5 strokes of sound will form a group as readily as 2 or 3 . The number in fact has nothing to do with it . The experiment with the horrible version of Tallis 's Canon already quoted shows that a rhythm of four pulses is not the same thing as a rhythm of two pulses taken twice . Inside the predominating time-period which in this case is the bar of four minims the organization is strong , medium weak , medium strong , weak , not a simple alternation of strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bar ( the rhythmic unit in music ) determines how much time shall be grasped by the mind as the unit was shown by Bolton 's experiment , where variations in the rate of the clicks caused variations in the grouping . But it also appears very clearly in any piece of music in time . There is a version of the carol In Dulci 7ubilo which is called Good Christian men , rejoice . It is one of the most IO2 THE INFLUENCE OF PACE striking examples of the blind bad taste of Victorian church musicians , but nothing could be more apt to our present purpose or show more clearly the mind integrating two rhythmic units into a new higher unit under the influence of a change of pace . At the proper moderate pace of the tune the rhythm is definitely a smooth triple , the time-unit is the bar of three beats . This smoothness is essential to the beauty of the tune , and the more even ( in time length ) the bars are among themselves the smoother is the result . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference ) to print Bach 's harmonization of the tune in time , while Sir Ivor Atkins 's edition of the Orgelbuchlein is right to print it in bars of time . If one goes further than the Cowley Book , and , with Stainer and Bramley , writes the tune ins and fits it with words such as will necessarily double the pace , one then has the tune completely vulgarized , and ? this is the point ? made into a tune whose rhythm is essentially duple . It is easy to demonstrate the effect , but difficult to put it on to paper . // It would look something like this Good Chris ? tian men re ? ( joi ? of ? oice With heart etc. instead of In I Dul ? ci Jub ? il I o ? o ? I o Let etc . Psychologically the mind has telescoped two bars of a and made them one of ( or $ ) , and turned a triple into a duple rhythm . Musically you ca n't turn triple rhythms into duple without outraging your tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hands of Stainer and Bramley . To return to time , we see that there is no need to weave the comparatively fantastic hypothesis that the mind holds in unstable equilibrium two different time-periods when the simple explanation lies to hand that if the pace is suitable , the mind will do the normal thing and fasten upon a single time period as its rhythmic unit irrespective of the internal organization into 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 7 pulses . If a bar of time fell below a certain length of time , probably the rhythm would disintegrate into alternate Io4 FIVE-FOUR TIME twos and threes . How slow this pace would have to be would have to be determined by further experiment in a psychological laboratory ; but if the figures of Wundt and Dietze quoted by James are any guide , it would appear that every bar would have to last at least 6 and possibly as much as 12 seconds , which gives a metronome rate of j =50 or j =25 for a bar of time . The scherzo of Tchaikowsky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true five ; so is Hoist 's 12 ) and the passage in The Hymn of Jesus where the rate must be something like j =144 . Our object in this enquiry is to find out what rhythm really is in terms of psychology , in order that the word may be used more scientifically in musical criticism . So far we have extracted this much , that in origin it is our native power of apprehending time and that it works by virtue of its two properties of periodicity and stress ( or accent ) . But it is never safe to be content with origins in a world of which the law is evolution , // and though I believe time to be a and not ' + 42 ) there is some evidence for giving to rhythm a wider definition than periodicity and accent . Periodicity is disputed and in its place is put proportion . which we have admitted by the front door may find itself ejected from the back , for if rhythm turn out to be proportion , may find itself as merely the ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been unable to trace any direct experi mental evidence bearing on the point except such as is afforded by Bolton 's experiment , though a writer in the American yournal of Psychology ' denies that periodicity is the essential element in the appreciation of rhythm . " The results of experimental observation contradict such an idea " , he says . " It is not the accurate measurement of successive intervals of time which is essential in rhythm , but the maintenance of proportionate relations among successive groups " . The estimation of absolute duration in rhythm depends finally upon factors which are them-selves subject to variation . The chief source of lob PERIODICITY OR PROPORTION ? such variation he thinks is the experience of strain . " Accurate estimation of time in music obtains only between intervals whose durations measure like experiences of strain . " Another source of variation is a dynamic change in successive intervals in which case " its psychological duration is immediately transformed beyond recognition . " That factors of this kind produce departures from rigid periodicity in the actual performance of successive bars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the experiment with the hymn tunes which I have already quoted . For example , A 's average time per bar was 348 ( hundredths of a second ) , a figure which actually occurred in three out of the eight bars ; the bars containing crotchets varied between 333 and 342 , which shows that this performer at any rate was not free from a frailty with which all teachers of music must be familiar . C is better in this respect and tends to make these bars very slightly longer rather than shorter . His average is 292 , and excluding his long rallentando during the last two bars , his utmost variation is 5 . Ion RHYTHM What is denied is that such variations are anything more than slight departures from a norm which is held by the mind . One does not read poetry according to its scansion , yet the underlying regularity of the feet is felt in the background , otherwise the verse would have no movement and the accentuation would be that of prose . Certainly the sources of variation in music are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note the frequent half-closes , disturbing associations with words and physical details of performance such as the taking of breath and difficulties of fingering , final rallentandos and organist 's starts , etc . In normal musical performances some of these disturbing elements will not appear , but others will take their place , e.g. the emotion of the particular piece of music and always the personal factor . Such variation is part of the essence of musical interpretation . But always it is variation from a norm , otherwise , as we know from our musical experience , the composition becomes unrhythmical and falls to bits . A phenomenon like congregational singing is as good an ex 1 o8 NORM AND VARIATION ample of this as one can require . Any organist knows that for unconducted congrega tional singing rhythm of the most rigid kind is necessary . People are afraid to sing if they feel that there is the smallest danger of their singing being at any point a solo ? the sound of one 's own voice is one of the most terrifying things in the world . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their neighbours ' noises is just precisely this rigid sense , which all have , for measuring duration accurately . The good organist takes care not to forfeit by tricks with the time the confidence which is so difficult to inspire in the non-musical , whose sense of rhythm , however , is fully adequate to tell them to a hundredth of a second when the next note is coming . They work to a norm . I have been unable to find on what experi mental evidence Mr. R. MacDougall bases his assertion that it is not periodicity but proportion which is essential to rhythm . A majority of authorities ' seems to be against him , but he will // find some to agree . Vincent d'Indy , ' for example , boldly defines rhythm as " 1'Ordre et la Proportion dans 1'Espace et dans le Temps " . Time and Space ! The application of the term rhythm to the spatial arts is not uncommon . Some critics speak of the rhythm of a picture or a cathedral , and declare that they are not speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extension of the original meaning of the word , but within the bounds of the art of music distends the word even further and makes it ultimately coincide with form or design . The argument is important and runs some-what as follows . A single note can not be a rhythmic unit , but two can . One of the notes can be made more important than the other by means of an accent ( or duration or stress or of both ) . In this way a centre of interest is created , the two components stand in intelligible relation to one another , and the phrase acquires an organic unity . Extend the phrase add others to it , till the whole is amplified into a musical // sentence , and then into a canto or paragraph and the same principle holds good . As the notes fall into groups clustering round a nucleus , so the groups vary in importance and organize themselves round one particular group which is the culminating point in its section . So with the sections . Thus there is a continual widening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or design . Form in this sense has to be distinguished from pattern , with which in music it is too often identified . Schubert has shown that it is possible to have pattern without form , and Beethoven ( in the posthumous quartets ) and Debussy ( in L'Apres-Midi ) to have form without pattern or set arrangement . So long as each section of the work arises naturally from what has gone before and leads naturally to what follows , so long as the points of climax and repose are felt as inevitable and proper reactions from one another , it will not matter whether the themes have been presented in a certain order or not , but unity of structure will have been achieved and the listener 's sense of form satisfied . This achievement is the work of rhythm in the III RHYTHM wider sense . The principle of coherence which gives structural unity to a piece of music is , then , rhythm . Grouping in painting or architecture is also a principle of coherence , why not call that rhythm also ? Is there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) spatial experience or ( b ) to being equivalent in music with formal unity ? I think there is , though at no point is it possible to say that an art critic is wrong or stultifying himself by talking of the rhythm of a picture ; still less is it possible to dispute Mr. Morris 's reading of the musical facts . The one , however , seems to me to be an abuse of language , the other a confusing rather than a helpful use of language , and both to do some violence to established psychological and philosophical ways of thinking . Mr. Morris 's analysis of the building up of secondary rhythm leaves out one important element , viz. the element of duration . Duration may provide an agogic accent , he says , and it is accent that creates a centre of interest , but it is the disposition of centres of interest that for him constitutes II2 THE ELEMENT OF DURATION rhythm . The rhythmic unit has beside its centre of interest a certain duration . In the building up of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important units you do not destroy nor lose sight of their duration which is approximately equal all the time . Take a comparatively rare , though quite simple , case of a 5-bar phrase , Brahms 's part-song I7ineta . The rhythmic unit is the bar of e time ( i.e. the primary rhythm ) , s of such bars make a phrase , the unit of secondary rhythm , in which the strong bar , Mr. Morris 's centre of interest , is usually the third with the first two leading up to and the last two leading down from it . As one phrase succeeds another the mind is conscious of the equality ( in duration ) of the phrases among one another . When , as occasionally happens , the five-bar rhythm is extended to six bars , the composition does not fall to pieces , because the primary rhythm is there all the time . Even the primary rhythm can be modified sometimes so long as behind it all the mind can feel the norm . In verse Poe has stated the principle that the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to action ) , while time and metre are merely technical descriptions of the way rhythm has manifested itself in certain objective things called works of art . Time and metre therefore have ( I ) a much more restricted signification than rhythm , and are a special name of one small province of rhythm ; they are objective , while rhythm ought to have as far as possible a subjective sense , and they are confined to the internal organiza tion of the rhythmic unit . Periodicity without stress might for pur poses of musical criticism be called time ' without rhythm . J. B. McEwen denies the name of rhythm to our per ception of recurring points of time , like anniversaries , and says that this is periodicity without rhythm . ' // In this connection it would be well to remark that to speak ( as Abercrombie does ) of the rhythm of a word , such , e.g. as saying that the rhythm of " remarkable " is ti-lum-ti-um , is not strictly accurate . If you do n't call it its " scan sion " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythmic scheme " . Similarly there is really no such thing as the speech-rhythm of prose , there is only contrast of strong and weak syllables . Rhythm implies some temporal organization ; the final organization in prose is not euphony but meaning , especially the delicate suggestions and overtones of meaning . Having digressed so far to define the lower limit to the meaning of the word it is time to return to the work of paring down the over-wide use of " rhythm " from which we started . Periodicity was found in the experiments quoted to be a condition of the mind forming a unity out of a sequence of sounds , and some analogies with other phenomena in Nature which we shall shortly examine offer confirmatory evidence . While it is legitimate to speak of the secondary rhythm of the juxtaposition of phrases in a // musical composition , while form may legitimately be distinguished from pattern , the legitimacy of calling that intellectual satisfaction derived from the order and proportion of parts in a whole by the name of rhythm is most highly disputable . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because time is uni-dimensional . In the most unrhythmical performance of a musical work imaginable there is a proportion between the different durations of different bars or different phrases though such proportions may not be able to be stated in convenient whole numbers like 2 : 3 or even 200 : 2oi . What makes one set of proportions appear satisfactory and rhythmical and another painful and devoid of rhythm ? In spatial arts we may not be able to say why a proportion like the Golden Sec-tion ' causes us pleasure , but we can always say that the proportion of the height to the length of a cathedral is satisfactory , or that the proportion of length to breadth is unsatisfactory , because we have all the three distances to be compared in consciousness together . In music I18 PROPORTION REJECTED we can not do this , because one of the terms of comparison had already faded from consciousness when the next term enters . The judgement of proportion is impossible without a constant standard of reference persisting in consciousness against which variations can be judged . This norm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the appreciation of equal time distances . It is therefore improper to apply the term rhythm to pictures and architecture , because our spatial experience is a different experience from our temporal experience , in spite of some points of resemblance , and it is an abuse of language to call two different things by the same name . If we permit the extension of the term to spatial experience , we can not deny the word " rhythmic " to the perception of proportion in other kinds of experience . To carry in each hand a suit case weighing 20 lb. would give us the feeling of a smooth duple rhythm : to walk round a chemical laboratory and judge that two stinks were equally offensive but less offensive than a third would give us a waltz of smells . I19 RHYTHM Direct comparison is impossible in the perception of time , and a norm is therefore essential in appreciation of rhythm . In the art of poetry this norm is the foot , in music it is the measure , .00sely called the bar , in dancing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of equality is made not through the ear but through muscular sensation . Watching dancing would seem to be analogous to reading poetry to oneself in that both are late developments in which the original way of perceiving the rhythm , by muscular sensation in the one case , and by hearing in the other , is modified . At a ballet one sees the physical movement in terms of which the time is measured , but one does not see the rhythm , which is perceived by imaginary muscular sensations like the silent sounds of printed poetry . But the ability to feel the dance is probably rarer and weaker than the corresponding faculty of silently hearing poetry , and so music is almost invariably added to any kind of spectacular dancing . In music the bar line was not generally used before the middle of the seventeenth century when instru- // mental music had won its independence from vocal music . Through the middle ages the rhythm of music was determined by the rhythm of the words , and no bar lines appear in the part books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in score found the need for bar lines as a mere guide to the eye , and the lutenists barred their tablature , though at irregular intervals according to the requirements of the voice part they were accompanying . This represents the transition stage ; by 166o all music was regularly barred and the most formal period of music began . It is only recently that complaints have been heard of the tyranny of the bar line and its equivalent in the next stage of musical structure , the tyranny of the four-bar phrase . The bar line is felt to be a tyrant in spite of its great value to a conductor for beating time , not so much on account of its stiff regularity , which composers and performers soon learned to conceal , as that it does not always or often correspond with the real measure , which may begin on a weak beat . Similarly with the four-bar phrase , composers before Brahms had 12I RHYTHM learned how to make extended phrases fit into schemes of which the underlying structure was periods of four bars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to catch the public ear with an immediate appeal , mistakes the underlying norm as the complete rhythm of music ; such a one is in the condition of the poet who identifies jingle with verse . Against the iambic norm of Paradise Lost the natural stresses of the words are felt : Of man 's first disobedience and the fruit . To recite it according to its scansion is to turn it into nonsense . " Yet the metrical scheme also persists . You may not hear it , but it is somewhere in the back of your head all the time as a kind of pattern or standard to which every line of the poetry is referred , more or less unconsciously , for comparison . And the delight of reading good verse arises largely from this duality of apprehension . Each verse as it comes is both true to itself and true to type ; the ear catches the stress in all its variety , the mind retains its hold on the quantities , short and long , I22 THE UNDERLYING NORM short and long , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stress ) and the metrical accent ( accent of quantity ) there is a continual interplay ; sometimes they coincide , sometimes they are at odds , and the rhythmical problem before the poet is to strike the just balance . Too much coincidence means mono tony ; too much at-oddness means chaos . " ' The same thing is expressed in general terms and from an evolutionary point of view suitable to a psychological enquiry by Miss Glyn , who shall speak for herself : ' " The character of rhythm in nature is that of irregular recurrence consisting of a series of undulations which are never at exactly equal distances , or of circles which are incomplete . Man has evolved the feeling for precisely regular time-divisions out of the necessity for concerted action ? i.e. he has learned to keep strict time . This rhythmic perceptive feeling is essential to I23 RHYTHM STRICT AND FREE the art of music , and this affords an explanation of why there is no music in nature but the incoherent fragments of bird-song . Regular pulsative rhythm may be called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp rhythmic combinations . At the same time the history of art reveals the fact that exact symmetry is but a stage in its evolution . For example , in Assyrian and Egyptian sculpture of natural forms exact symmetry prevails , and regardless of existing variability of form in nature , but in Greek sculpture this rigidity has entirely disappeared . All art passes from the strict to the free , retaining only so much of the strict basis as is necessary to its intelligibility and to its actual structure . " For the understanding of the art of music it is necessary to realise the rhythmic principle involved in Strict Form and in Free . . . The first principle makes for coherence , because the exact relation is readily perceived , and it is the ' intuitive perception of relations that makes music intelligible to us and therefore coherent . In the mind of a hearer or performer of music this 124 intuitive perception of relations awakens emotions of satisfaction and repose . But once let the relations become obvious , i.e. be too easily perceived , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedily involves boredom if the same relations continue to be presented . In this sense of monotony lies the necessity for Free form , the necessity for a variation upon Strict Form which can only be made by the presentation of an inexact relation . Therefore the Free principle makes for variety and contrast , and its function is here to oppose and vary the exactness of Strict Form . A considerable degree of variety and opposition will produce a restless and agitating effect upon the mind . . . An extreme degree of inexactness will destroy the grasp of the exact relation . As the inexact relation is intuitively measured by the mind against the exact relation , by which means the amount of its variation is perceived , it is clear that if the feeling for the exact relation be partially lost music will appear incoherent , while if it be entirely lost the mind will be brought to a standstill in its grasp of rhythmic relations , and // will therefore be unable to perceive music at all , but only chaotic tones . The law of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation shall be clearly perceptible through the inexact relation . " Which brings us back to Abercrombie 's " base " , and " modulation " and the doctrine that periodicity is an essential element of rhythm , however much variety the ingenuity of composers may make by frequent changes of time signatures and interpolation of extra bars . Special rhythmic effects are of course produced by altering the unit , yet maintaining continuity by such a device as keeping the time value of the crochet constant . The change in the middle of Brahms 's Song of Destiny readily occurs to the mind , where the drum triplet equal to a crochet of the Adagio becomes a bar of time , and the incessant changes of time signature in the works of Stravinsky is only the pushing of this trick as far as ( and perhaps farther than ) it will go in order to produce an impression of tremendous restlessness and urgency . The mind becomes practised in holding on to the norm against an ever increasing // amount of variation , but sooner or later it can hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music is due to the fact that in their passion for variation composers outrun the power of the mind to establish or maintain the underlying periodicity which is essential to rhythm . On the other hand too much regularity is oppressive . Emphatic statement of the obvious is delightful to the unthinking mind , but boring to the more cultivated ; repetition of the obvious soon becomes nauseating to everyone and the progress from the Strict to the Free ( in Miss Glyn 's phrase ) is the mark of growth in all artistic appreciation . It is time to sum up the facts so far elicited about the nature of rhythm : ( I ) The essential elements of rhythm are periodicity and accent ; when periodicity alone is given the mind itself supplies an accent . ( 2 ) For accent duration may be substituted as an organizing principle within the period : a long note by its mere position I27 RHYTHM among shorter notes acquires an agogic ' accent , which may coincide with and reinforce an accent of stress . ( 3 ) Any internal organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be grasped as a whole : thus 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 and even greater numbers of beats can go to a simple uncompounded bar of music . ( 4 ) Pace is the factor which determines how the grouping shall be made . ( 5 ) Rhythm should be a term applied only to temporal experience , and not regarded as a form of proportion . The reason for this is that time has only one dimension . In proportion different quantities can be directly compared with one another ; in rhythm only indirectly by reference to a norm or standard . ( 6 ) The norms in music are the measure and the phrase , which correspond to the foot and the verse ( i.e. the scansion of the line ' ) in poetry ; the equivalents in dancing are perhaps the step and the figure . I28 SOME EFFECTS OF RHYTHM ( 7 ) Against these norms are set many variations : syncopation , changes of unit by augmentation or diminution , rubato , interpolation of extra beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the composition is to be intelligible it must be held together by the assertion and repetition of a normal period . This then is what may legitimately be meant by the word rhythm ' in art criticism . Its applications and effects are dealt with fully by teachers in the text-books of the various arts , music , poetry , dancing ; it is not necessary to catalogue them here . But a few miscellaneous examples of the behaviour of rhythm will not be out of place . Having seen what it is , we may look at what it does . Some of its by-products , too , are interesting . Two most striking effects of rhythm on the mind are known and employed by everyone without instruction from psychologists and musicians : walking in step or marching as a stimulant , and the rocking of cradles and lullabies as a // soporific . It is common knowledge that broken step and aimless unrhythmic walking are more fatiguing than marching in time ( either with or without brass band to reinforce the rhythm ) , and the reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate stimulus , especially when any of the instincts are tapped . Records are broken under the stimulus of emulation or self-assertion , high gates are cleared when a pursuing bull touches the instinct of fear , arduous or unpleasant tasks become easy and pleasant when spiced with a flirtation . Rhythm seems to satisfy some instinctive need , though as we have seen elsewhere rhythm can not be classed quite as an instinct . When applied to walking the mind is interested and stimulated by the rhythm , and energy is liberated . The same principle has recently been to some extent applied to industry , with the result that fatigue has been saved , output increased and breakages reduced where a rhythm that suits the body has been found and employed ( which probably means a rhythm that fits the periods of bodily functions like the heart and lungs ) . The soporific effect // would seem to require an opposite explanation , but it may be attributed to the power which rhythm undoubtedly has of bringing order into a disor-dered mind and banishing anxious preoccupa-tions which exist not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This power may be seen in all sorts of forms , of which the simplest is kicking one 's heels . There are few occupations which bring peace and contentment to the mind and exorcise bad temper more effectively than sitting on the parapet of a bridge or a ledge of rock and knocking one 's shoes to bits . Bach before a boat-race is an excellent sedative to the nerves , quiet music before bed-time is an insurance against insomnia , and an orchestral concert will often banish worry and resolve a problem of conduct . " Rhythm and harmony , " says Plato , " find their way right into the inward places of the soul , on which they most powerfully fasten bringing grace ' with them , and making the man graceful . " 2 If rhythm has this power of removing obstacles // and resolving conflicts , it is easy to see that it may be a stimulant or a sedative with equal ease according to circumstance . The practical uses of rhythm were appre ciated very early in man 's development . Indeed many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to the need for concerted action . Before such an explanation can be con fidently accepted , observations will have to be made on animals to see how far they may possess a rudimentary sense of rhythm . There can however he no doubt about the fact that the most primitive people are possessed of a keen sense of rhythm which they employ not only in their dancing but for practical purposes of hauling weights , building , etc . An activity in which rhythm unites with bodily movement , no longer for these primitive utilitarian purposes but for an end which , though not recognized as artistic , is not far removed from dancing , is the athletic practice of rowing . A pre-condition of pace , and therefore of success in boat-racing , is a good rhythm ; hence the importance assigned // to the stroke of a crew . Rhythm here means its usual two things ? regularity of period of stroke , and the way the movements which make up the individual stroke are organized with reference to one another . ' In the orthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strongly-marked beginning to the stroke when the blade enters the water , like the accent on the first beat of a bar of music , ( 2 ) a steady pushing of the stroke through without a further accent such as is produced by tugging with the arms at the finish , ( 3 ) a subsidiary accent caused by rapidly straightening the arms ( " hands away " ) and rais-ing the body at once to the perpendicular and ( 4 ) a steady swing forward which ought to take nearly as long as the first three movements put together . A very rough time scheme of the stroke would be In actual practice the time ratios are not so simple as this ; in a good crew the finish and // recovery would probably have to be represented by a semi-quaver and the swing forward would not take quite so long as two whole crotchets . Differences between the Eton and the styles rowed by many foreign crews lie in a re-arrange ment of the time periods and a redistribution of the accent . Jesus ( Cambridge ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsidiary accent by shortening its finish and a peculiar use of the slide , and gives the general impression of being a three-in-a-bar kind of rhythm . This style is intermediate between English and the style rowed by the New Zea landers , ' which felt almost like two in a bar . Battles rage in rowing circles as to which rhythm gives the best results . Whatever the answer to that may be , the moral effects are the same in all crews . If the rhythm is bad no pace will result ( at any rate on courses over half a mile long ) , and every voyage will feel laboured and difficult ; if to a good rhythm pace and feelings of ease and success are added , the emotional tone of that corporate personality , the crew , becomes good . // Good emotional tone is the best possible factor for releasing vast quantities of physical energy ; better even than avoirdupois derived from overeating . It is hardly necessary to add that a good crew is beautiful to watch in exactly the same way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Cecil Sharp : " Mr. Herbert Mcllwane , who spent many years in the Australian bush , relates that he noticed one evening in camp a black boy chanting a song in monotone , the while he struck a log with rhythmic blows of his hands . On enquiry the aboriginal explained that he was narrating an incident that had occurred that day , when a spare horse had bolted and had been captured after an exciting chase . " Rhythm and metre are aids to memory . The Countess Evelyn Martinengo-Cesaresco records that a modern Greek folk-singer once said to her , As I do not know how to read I have made this story into a song so as not to forget it . ' This is precisely what the Australian // bushman was doing . The modern Greek and the antipodean native acted under the same impulse . " " They wished to preserve a story and their minds were unequal to it without the aid of rhythm . Such is the origin of all folk-poetry and all folk-song ; this is how the Homeric poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rhythm is attested by many anthropologists . Combarieu2 quotes an extra-ordinary story from Central Africa , in which , like the pupils of M. Dalcroze , the natives carry on a rhythm silently in their heads : " Picture to yourself five hundred negroes swimming round a ship that has run aground and singing this tune ; at the eighth measure they all dive at once and continue to follow the music mentally at the bottom of the sea ; at the twelfth measure they shove the ship together , and at the sixteenth they rise to the surface . They act thus in concert and not one of their efforts is wasted . " There is also a story attributed to Wallaschek // that Kaffirs are punished by their fellow tribesmen with death for making a mistake in rhythm . Nor does rhythm merely help out the mind : n a difficult task ; it may supply it with energy for tackling other work not susceptible of rhythm . A friend of the writer , a provincial musical critic , described to him an unexpected experience which once occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recitals . After a heavy day of concentrated mental work unconnected with music , this critic wearily and with some reluctance went to Mr. Samuel 's concert . At the end he found himself refreshed to such an extent by the vitality of the Bach-Samuel rhythm that he was able to return at a late hour to the other work and devote another couple of hours to it before going to bed . Similar if less striking cases are probably to be found in the experience of most musical people and of those who have a wide experience of ballet . Akin to these psychological effects and partway between them and the artistic effects designed by poets and composers there is a class which can only be described as moral . This has come as // something of a surprise to us , but it was well known to the Greeks , and Plato gives it an important place in his educational scheme . " The whole of a man 's life stands in need of a right rhythm " , he writes in one place , and an even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athlete becomes too much of a savage , and the mere musician is melted beyond what is good for him " , he says when pleading for an education of music and gymnastic ; and he might be describing in the first part of the sentence the state of affairs that prevailed till a short time ago in most English public schools and does still persist in a few , and in the other part he would be doing no great injustice to the youth of Kensington and Chelsea . It certainly seems that the Greeks did achieve , by means of some kind of rhythmic gymnastic training , a harmony of mind and body which we are unable to accomplish by our athletics . Something of their secret seems to have been rediscovered by M. Jacques-Dalcroze , who claims for his system of Eurhythmics that it is not merely a kind of Swedish drill , nor a special school of fancy // dancing , nor even an improved method of teaching music ( which was the origin of the technique that he has evolved ) , but a far-reaching principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is therefore an instrument of great value for general education . These claims must be fairly well substantiated , since Eurhythmics is making headway in schools ; but schoolmasters are yet a long way from admitting the educational importance of right rhythms which Plato claims for them . He went so far as to forbid certain rhythms in his ideal state , because he believed that each of them had a definite moral effect that was undesirable , this metre being an expression of meanness , that of pride and the other of madness . We sometimes hear a modern equivalent of this in protests against ragtime and extreme forms of jazz music , on the ground that their rhythms are irritants , too intoxicating and morbid , but most commentators on Plato and educationisfs agree in treating these ideals of Plato as fanciful . None the less the heathliness of some rhythms has been rather remarkably confirmed in recent times by the observations of folk- // dancing teachers . Miss Mary Neal , a pioneer in the revival of folk-dancing and an authority on the subject , has organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no doubt about the beneficial results . The members of these classes tended , when they started , to be dull and loutish in the country , vulgar and blatant in the big towns ? if one may generalize and state the matter crudely . In both cases she noted that they had not been dancing for very long before they became not only more graceful in carriage ( which one would naturally expect ) , but more alert mentally , more attractive personally , and to have become more harmonious personalities altogether . If one asks why these things are so , why things so diverse and apparently so unconnected with one another as the sense of hearing , a savage 's delight in his tom-tom , folk-dancing , rowing , the difference between poetry and prose , orchestral concerts , education and morality are yet linked by the one principle of rhythm , one can only put forward the most tentative sort of answer . It is far from being scientific and // seems merely fanciful , but one can only say this : the rhythmic principle goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be run . Times and seasons recur periodically and we mark them by anniversaries and special festivities ( this corresponds to accent ) ; the tides of the sea move with their own majestic rhythm ; even sun spots have been observed to run in cycles of i i years . The motions of the planets , the distribution of land and sea on the earth 's surface , the alternation of night and day , the migration of birds , the physiological functions of breathing and walking , the heart-beat and the pulse , and , most important , all vocal utterance , witness to the all-pervasiveness of the rhythmic principle . We have learned , too , from physics that not only are sound and light both forms of vibration , but matter itself is in a constant state of rhythmic ebb and flow . It would therefore appear that the whole universe throbs with life ( with the emphasis on throbs ' ) , and the wonderful satisfaction which comes to us along the many lines we have surveyed is derived from putting ourselves into harmony with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The spread of wireless telegraphy has taught to an immense number of persons the nature of wave-motion , and every listener-in knows that communication is impossible between instruments that are not in tune ' with one another , i.e. set to the same vibrational frequency . Human life seems to obey the same laws , and we have more abundant life if we make it pulse with a rhythm in tune ' with the Universal Rhythm . But this is not science , nor even musical criticism . 142 V APPLAUSE IN the course of the second essay of this book a theory of applause was put forward which explained it in the light of the instinct of gregariousness . The amount of applause after any number in a concert programme is determined not by the depth of feeling or the intensity of the pleasure experienced by the audience , but by the homogeneity of the feeling , i.e. by the number of persons who experience a similar enthusiasm for the same piece of music . Hearty applause indicates that some considerable amount of group feeling has been generated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound stirring of emotion , still less of the delivery of a critical judgement on the listener 's part . The truth of this theory may be confirmed by a consideration of the kind of music which receives most applause . // The instance chosen for illustration was a folk song , which has an almost universal appeal , and the wise singer usually puts as the last song of a group , not necessarily the song which he thinks , or for that matter which his audience thinks , to be the best song , but the song which has certain applause-drawing qualities , which on examination are found to be qualities which make a wide appeal , such as a captivating rhythm or humorous words . This psychological explanation seems more acceptable than the ordinary rather crude view that audiences are through original sin inartistic , and do not applaud the best things loud enough or applaud the less good too loudly either from insensitiveness to beauty or from lack of critical ability . But though this new theory may claim to be true , it does not cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phenomenon as applause at concerts , and a more thoroughgoing examination on psychological lines reveals one or two interesting points about it . Music critics and concert-goers often complain of the inadequacy and clumsiness of applause as // an instrument for performing the apparently simple task of registering approval and disapproval . It is clumsy in registering degrees of pleasure for purposes of comparison , and it is inadequate for distinguishing between the enthusiasm felt for the composition and that felt for the artist 's performance of it . When an audience claps its hands , it is trying to do both of these things and several other things besides . Of some half-dozen elements which may be distinguished in applause the first is the natural tendency to move the body after a period of mental activity . ? 1 . The Need for Physical Movement . This tendency is much more fundamental than we have been inclined to reckon it . While psychology was part of philosophy it gave too intellectualist an account of human nature . The activities of pure mind , such as philosophizing or mathematical speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost entirely a rational creature , and no physical foundation was sought for them beyond // the fact that a man must breathe in order that he may think . Modern psychology has shown that this is not in fact the way the mind works . Fundamentally the human mind , like that of the animal , is a mechanism for doing things ( conation ) rather than for knowing or feeling , which are subsidiary to doing . The power of doing or striving is the most fundamental function of the mind because it is biologically prior to all the amazing powers which by evolution have been added to it . ' Whether mind will ever evolve to the point where it will achieve Aristotle 's idea ( of purely speculative activity o OcwpTeKOc , 131os ) and discard the biological foundations on which these higher activities are now based is a legitimate speculation , but it is quite cer tain that while we are not disembodied spirits , as at present , our minds are primarily striving organisms and that doing , i.e. making changes in our environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is one of the places where the recent work ( of Freud , Jung and the others ) on the diseased mind has brought evidence to // reinforce a view of the mind as it can be observed at work in normal behaviour. = All this seems a long way from applause in a concert room , and we have yet further to go ; but the psychological doctrine on which I am insist ing is difficult to musicians , because art and intellectual speculation are the two exceptional realms of the mind , of which the psychologist finds it most difficult to give an account . The psychologist , looking over the whole range of human ( and animal ) activity can not fail to come to the view that there is no sharp line between the physical and the mental , and that in any physical action on the part of any living creature above the level of the vegetables there is a mental element , and conversely there is no purely mental activity that has not some physical counterpart . While the mystery of the relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much a mystery as ever it was , the interaction of the physical and the mental has been shown to be close and all pervading in all human activity . // Two main lines of argument , the determinist and the teleological , have been advanced by different schools of thought to describe their interaction . According to the one , human behaviour is subject to the laws of mechanical causation like inanimate matter , and mental events such as experiencing an idea or a feeling are links in a chain of physical causation . This line of thought reached its extreme statement in the famous James-Lange theory of the emotions . According to this doctrine the physical manifestation of emotion is the emotion . " Emotion is a consequence , not the cause , of our bodily expression . Common sense says , we lose our fortune , are sorry , and weep ; we meet a bear , are frightened , and run ; we are insulted by a rival , are angry , and strike . The hypothesis here to be defended says this order of sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately induced by the other , that the bodily manifestations must first be interposed between , and that the more rational statement is that we feel sorry because we cry , // angry because we strike , afraid because we tremble , and not that we cry , strike or tremble because we are sorry , angry or fearful , as the case may be . " This is an extreme and paradoxical statement which is not acceptable to most psychologists , but it does emphasize the very close connection between the subjective experience of a feeling and the overt physical action with which it is indissolubly connected . The other line of argu-ment , the teleological , which is expounded very vigorously by Professor McDougall in his new book , ' finds everywhere in the whole animal kingdom the operation of mind and the growth of intelligence in the services of those biological ends which the living creature pursues . The great urge of life by which the creature passion-ately strives to survive without questioning the worth-whileness of survival , drives the creature to master his environment and overcome all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose knowledge is essential . // Any change in the environment must first be known before it can be dealt with . Cognition therefore is the first stage in any action , awareness of change is essential for action in the new situa tion , and mind evolves in the service of action , cognition is dependent on conation . Thus on either of these lines of thought the inseparability of the physical and the mental is a postulate of any progress in the science at all . With this postulate in mind the psychologist is able to go ahead and put order into the chaos of the facts of behaviour , and McDougall , for instance , argues that things like simple appre hension which lead to judgement , and from judgement to belief , are not the purely intellectual processes that philosophers have unhesitatingly taken them to be . " But as in all thinking the conative factor plays an essential part in these processes " : And then at last comes the diffi culty : " In aesthetic perception we are fully ISO CONATION AND COGNITION occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspense , and therefore also judgement and belief . This attitude is not easily attained , nor can it be maintained for long by those who attain it . Simple apprehension ' is then a late acquired attitude which we maintain but rarely and briefly . Affirmation or denial , acceptance or rejection , appetition or aversion normally results from and accompanies cognition . " 2 The artist who is not interested in animal behaviour , or , for the moment , in moral conduct or anything but artistic activity , will feel that he has been defrauded by psychology . The first thing he considers , which to him is a basic fact of his own experience , proves to be the arch-exception to a rule that runs right through organic life , and he finds the psychologists at a loss to reconcile it with the other operations of the mind . For this reason then it has been necessary to elaborate at length for musicians what is for psychologists a postulate about which they are // no longer in serious doubt . Ribot for example states this principle : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought is not ? as many from tradition still admit ? an event taking place in a purely supersensual , ethereal , inaccessible world . We shall repeat with Setchenoff " No thought without expres-sion " , i.e. thought is a word or an act in a nascent state , i.e. to say , a commencement of muscular activity " . The way in which activities like philosophy and art have established themselves as ends in themselves , unconnected with ulterior biological purposes , is a particularly striking example of that inexplicable kind of change which we call evolution . Recent psychological specu-lation on the way the change has come about is concisely summed up by Mr. A. G. Tansley.I Put crudely the hypothesis is something like this : The mind is charged with psychic , as the body is charged with physical , energy , which by the fact of being alive it must expend . This psychic energy , termed libido , 2 is in the main // stored in the instincts and finds an easy outlet in the complexes ( sentiments ) which the mind builds up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amount of it appears to be free and transferable to any channel according to need . When the maintenance of life is arduous the whole stock of energy will be absorbed in instinctive channels , but when the conditions of life become easier , free surplus energy is now available and must find other outlets . In children this takes the form of play ; in the adults of primitive man the surplus is extended in aggressive fighting , on primitive craft-work and decoration , dancing and religious ritual . " As man gained more and more control of his environment and became organized in powerful nations so that peace and security became the normal lot of large numbers of the human race , the psychic energy available for employment in channels other than biologically necessary ones was greatly augmented , and at the same time the number and variety of these channels was largely increased . One great field was the development of every variety of handicraft . Of activities not directly // utilitarian we have on the one hand the immense artistic developments of the ancient world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music ; on the other the development of abstract thought ? geometry , mathematics and philosophy . " ' The growth of abstract thought is due to successive modifications of the normal biological process of the mind ( perceptioncognition ? affect ? conation , issuing in physical action ) through which " truncations " , as Mr. Tansley calls them , of typical conations take place ; and the end is shifted backwards from action to purely mental ends , first to the affective part of the process , then to the cognitive , and lastly to perception itself , in which class some ways of listening to music ( e.g. aural training tests ) must be included . These truncations are not all equally healthy . Where the impulse reaches the conative stage but just fails to issue in action , we have the ineffective person ; where the end of the process is transferred to the affective stage we have the sentimentalist ; but where the end Tansley , op. cit. , p. 80 . Cf. also Ribot 's Psychology of the Emotions , Ch . X for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernible in the activities of primitive man . // is in cognition by and for itself , we have a man who may be regarded as falling short of ideal manhood ? or even with some slight contempt ? in spite of brilliant abilities and a wealth of knowledge , but through whom , nevertheless , the development of the highest powers of the mind has become possible . There seems to be less danger in breaking the chain of mental process in the middle than at either end , where we have on one side the butterfly-minded and on the other the sentimentalist and the feckless . This may be because an end in cognition is generally the starting point for further cognitive activity , while the sensationalist and the sentimentalist make no new integrations from their sensational and emotional experience respectively . These facts throw some light on the commonly recognized dangers of the artistic temperament , Having thus summarily sketched the course of evolution of those most highly valued powers of the mind which appear to differ almost beyond the possibility of reconciliation from its most fundamental functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , it appears , // especially the activity of listening , which does not involve rapid movements of the fingers or diaphragm like those of the executive musician , is a species of cognition divorced from conation. ' j'his , as we have seen , is contrary to the general working of the mind . It is not surprising therefore that the feelings of strain or discomfort which accompany the thwarting of any conation may easily arise after listening to music . ' Especially will this happen if the music stirs the emotions ( by sympathetic communication , as I argue in Essay III ) . For emotion is the dynamic of life ; is indeed in its primary form incipient conation . And this is precisely what does happen whenever we attempt to avoid the elementary rule that bodily movement accompanies all mental activity . In art and intellectual pursuits , where the activity begins and ends in the mind and there is no appropriate action in which the conation can issue , this absence of action is felt by the mind as a vague uneasiness which is relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stretching // the arms , yawning even . So after listening to any sermon , lecture or music , however engrossing , there comes a point when the impulse to move becomes urgent , and in pondering any problem the mind is helped if the thinker paces up and down . Yawning and pacing up and down are not , of course , the conations proper to mathematical speculation or attention to music , but these bodily movements must be regarded as vestigial remnants of a lower stage of evolution , when the whole energy of the mind was devoted to practical ( i.e. , biological ) ends . Of these vestiges applause has remained as the most appropriate physical outlet for the energy released by the cognitive activity of listening . And this is the primary and most elemental fact about applause , and arrangers of programmes should not altogether lose sight of this physical need of their audiences . Cunning orators , we know , space out their speeches with suitable gaps for the intervention of Hear Hears ' and the clapping of hands . In music the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . The tendency of a rhythm is to express itself at once in // immediate movements corresponding to the character of the rhythm , and all accompanists know that applause is hardly to be held back at the end of a song with a vivid rhythm , once the singer 's last note has ceased . ? 2 . Gregariousness . If this need for physical movement is the first element in applause , that gregariousness of which I have spoken in Essay II is the second . For as I there pointed out , if one is alone in a musicroom with the performer , the tendency to physical movement will not take the form of applause but of shifting one 's seat or a request to see the music . The presence of about a dozen persons seems to be the lower limit for the beginnings of applause , but generally a number approaching fifty is needed for anything like whole-hearted hand-clapping . The size of the room , however , and the physical closeness of the members of the audience to one another has an influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally arise . There is nothing more depressing than perform- // ing in a large room where there are wide empty spaces between the listeners , even if the latter are in point of fact fairly numerous . The atmosphere is less cold in the Wigmore Hall full , than in the Albert Hall half full , though the actual number is perhaps ten times as great in the larger building . The reason for this would seem to depend on the conditions which govern the operation of suggestion , which is indispensable for securing uniformity of thought and feeling . Suggestion is essentially a process of communication and has been described as the chief cognitive organ of the herd instinct , i.e. , it is the chief inlet channel through which stimuli can enter and start the instinct working . I have called it an organ , but the term is a misleading one , for suggestion makes use of perception through the ordinary senses , and it is not necessary to regard it as an independent and mysterious faculty of the mind . Since its workings depend on ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly close to one another , the subtle signs of emotion will not be detected by each man in his neighbour . Physical closeness // also determines whether another condition which governs the arousal of group feeling shall be fulfilled , viz , that the emotion shall find outward expression . I can not do better than quote McDougall:1 " The spreading and the great intensifi cation of emotion seem to depend upon its being given expressions that are perceptible by the senses . So long as its expressions are suppressed , the emotion of an assembly does not become excessive . It is only by eliciting and encouraging the expressions of emotions that the revivalist , the political orator , or the comic man on the music-hall stage achieves his successes . That expressions of emotion are far more effective than the emotion itself is recognized by the practice of claqueurs . When an audience has once been induced to give expression to a common emotion , its members are , as it were , set in tune with one another ; 2 each man is aware that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotions , 16o EXCITEMENT OF GROUP-FEELING and even in the period during which all expressions are suppressed by the audience , this awareness serves to sustain the mood and to prepare for fresh outbursts . The mere silence of an audience , the absence of coughs and shufflings and uneasy movements , suffices to make each member aware that all his fellows are attentive and are responding with the appropriate emotion ; but it is not till the applause , indignation , or the laughter breaks out in free expression that the emotion reaches its highest pitch . And a skilful orator or entertainer , recognizing these facts , takes care to afford frequent opportunities for the collective displays of emotion . " It remains to give some account under the heading of gregariousness of the behaviour of a " Gilbert and Sullivan " audience . Without going into the intricacies of the question what exactly an opera is , we may assume that it is a play with music , or at any rate music with a play , i.e. it has a plot and also some moments when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i6i APPLAUSE which arise from the dramatic situations , i.e. it is at once dramatic and lyric , and needs a balance to be struck between these two elements . But operatic audiences , especially Gilbert and Sullivan audiences , can not be induced to give the drama a chance to produce its own more highly integrated pleasure ; the lyrical moments are seized and a clamour goes up after each to repeat the stimulus and experience the same emotion all over again . This is , of course , absolutely indefensible for the double reason that it is unfair to the drama and also that like everything else in life the same thing can never happen twice ; by destroying the dramatic context you can not give rise to the same emotional commentary . This operatic encoring by people who really know better , who are quite capable of appreciating dramatic art , is something of a mystery similar to mob violence committed by respectable citizens , and must find its explanation in the same direction . The banality of operatic plots is often offered as the reason , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can seriously pretend that in the Yeomen of the Guard // the emotional moments do not depend on the developing situations of the plot , which is a good one . The explanation I now put forward I should not like to push too seriously , but I find it attractive . A good deal has been written about the degradation in thought , feeling and conduct which takes place when an assembly of people begins to show signs of the crowd-mind . M. le Bon ' found that the characteristics of a crowd were : ( a ) a descent of several rungs in the ladder of civilization ; ( b ) a general intellectual inferiority as com pared with the isolated individual ; loss of moral responsibility ; impulsiveness ; credulity ; exaggeration ; intolerance ; blind obedience to the leader of the crowd ; a mystical emotionalism. // These attributes he found to be due to what he called the " law of the mental unity of crowds " , by which the sentiments and ideas of all the persons in the gathering take one and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind " is formed , which is not the sum , but only the highest common factor of all the minds comprising the crowd and is therefore equal to something less than the lowest . The " collective mind " consists in the main of " general qualities of character " which are our common racial inheritance . It is an " unconscious substratum " which in the crowd becomes uppermost . Le Bon has been rightly criticized on the grounds of his political prejudice and on account of the unsatisfactory character of this hypothesis of a collective mind . But the characteristics he enumerates may be accepted and the " unconscious substratum " has undoubtedly got a good deal to do with crowd-thinking and crowd-behaviour . The Gilbert and Sullivan audience is a crowd , for its members have a single object of attention , a single feeling of enthusiasm for it , and a single purpose , namely to encore the x 6q . FANATICISM OF THE CROWD-MIND song just finished , and it exhibits most of the characteristics enumerated by Le Bon . It is perhaps going rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ladder of civilization , and an audience 's moral responsibility would not seem to go beyond respecting the desire of people whose last trains leave early , to hear the last part of the work , or consideration for tired and overworked artists . Its critical inferiority however is a byword ; its impulsiveness and exaggeration are obvious ; it is intolerant of the highbrow who wo n't let himself go with the rest of the herd ; and the mystic emotionalism , more often seen at concerts than at the opera perhaps , appears in the fanatical devotion which a craze for any particular label will inspire ( one year the Russian Ballet , the next year The Beggar 's Opera , the year after The Immortal Hour ; this clique 's devotion to anything modern ' , that set 's objection to anything by Brahms , the old brigade 's obsession for the name of Beethoven ) . All these facts too may safely be assigned to the " uncon scious substratum becoming uppermost and dominating the personal consciousness " . In a // recent book ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds to Freudian discoveries and sees in it a close parallel to the action of the unconscious in people suffering from various forms of psycho-neurosis ( especially paranoia ) . He makes out a strong case for his thesis into which we need not go , but stimulated by its suggestiveness we may seek a Freudian explanation of the Gilbert and Sullivan neurosis . A favourite idea of Freudian psychology is " 6 Infantile Regression " ; the unconscious is continually harking back to infantile desires and even to pre-natal experience . ( This latter is called the Nirvana Principle and like all the more startling of Freudian terms and doctrines is spelt by Freud 's disciples with capital initials ) . A crowd , then , such as the audience at lolanthe or The Yeomen , becoming dominated under the influence of crowd emotion by the subconscious mind returns to its infancy , and like the chubby infant clapping his tiny hands and shouting " ' gain , ' gain " , enjoys the present sensation , regardless of joys to come , insistent on the i66 THE APPLAUSE-FIEND immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead of the most leathery-handed or brazen-throated enthu siast . Perhaps after all it is a descent of a rung or two of the ladder of civilization to return to the mentality of a two-year-old . Similarly we may find in the same Freudian ' regions the most satisfactory explanation of that tiresome phenomenon , the applause-fiend , who shouts " Bravo " before the music has stopped , who fills in a silent bar with enthusiastic clapping and who calls for encores on the slightest provo cation . A certain number of casual concert-goers become accidental and temporary applause-fiends from ignorance and an anxiety not to be remiss in performing a proper social gesture , and it is noteworthy that the more habitual the concert-goer , the less he tends to applaud , while a musical critic can generally be detected by his ungregarious behaviour after the music has finished . Anyone who has lectured or made music to boys and girls at school has seen the other end of the same tendency ; school-children , // partly from a lack of certain knowledge of concert behaviour , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for physical movement and the desire to make a noise themselves , invariably clap everything twice as long and twice as loudly as an adult audience . But your true applause-fiend is he who aspires to be the complete , hundred-percent ' herd-man . The audience is going to applaud and he knows it ; he will identify himself with this herd ; he wants the herd to become a thorough-going crowd and to develop the lower kind of group feeling which we have called crowd-emotion ; he may even aspire to be in a small way a crowd-leader . He exhibits two of the most marked characteristics of a crowd , its hero-worship and its self-importance . These two traits at first sight seem to pull in opposite directions , but on examination are seen to be two manifestations of the egotism of the unconscious . Like the patient suffering from delusions ( paranoia ) the crowd compensates in the unconscious for the failures and shortcomings of which the conscious mind is only too painfully aware . // The most repressed kind of person who is least valued by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom from restraint which in his individual life he most sorely wants . The crowd provides , as it were , a pool for the thwarted self-esteem of each member , and each member , though he cuts but a poor figure individually , finds his self-feeling swollen by the whole pool of esteem , and when he speaks , or as in this case applauds , he is delivering not his private judgement , which as he has observed carries little weight , but that of the whole assembly , which by weight of numbers is unassailable and therefore right . The crowd however can not get on without a hero in the sense of a representative man , and upon him who is thus only a personification of itself , it pours out its veneration . And so when at a concert a popular contralto sings a song of the kind which is itself a crowd-phenomenon ( like the late Lord Northcliffe 's journals or John Bull ' under Mr. Bottomley 's editorship ) she becomes the idol of the audience , the crowd-representative , upon whom all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The applause fiend by getting in both the first and the last hand-clap makes himself the mouthpiece of this hero-worship and gets for himself the glorious feeling of superiority which belongs to the dispenser of patronage . He is indeed twice blest , for he in the crowd and the crowd in him are at once giving and receiving adulation , delicious feelings which the poor repressed individual never experiences in ordinary social life . ? 3 . The Critical Element . A third element in applause which we may consider , the most obvious of them all , is the more or less critical element which expresses the amount of pleasure the listeners have received from the artist 's performance of the music . In spite of the other factors which we have noted , the amount of clapping is a rough gauge of the amount of pleasure experienced and indicates very crudely the judgement of the audience . Pleasure is not a commodity susceptible of nice measurement and expressible in exact quantitative terms , but it // so far lends itself to calculation as to permit one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand is entirely a matter of quality : it is really nonsense to say that one thing is more beautiful than another ; it can only be differently beautiful , as people generally perceive when they are constrained to compare two beautiful objects . Hence while the pleasure of the audience may very roughly be expressed quantitatively by the applause , the attempt to express an aesthetic judgement in the same way is liable to the most fantastic error , and almost any concert will furnish instances of works which have small aesthetic worth yielding considerable pleasure . And it is really unreasonable to complain that the judgements of audiences are unsound , for the reason that they are bound to express in terms of quantity what is essentially qualitative and not measurable with a foot-rule or a pint-pot . The discrimination between the pleasure felt and the value judged must not be worked too hard , since undoubtedly there is a fairly close correspondence between them . A cold judgement that " this is beautiful but gives me no pleasure " is disingenuous and // only doubtfully possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by a particular bit of music , which are rightly regarded as extras over and above the pure aesthetic pleasure , e.g. the sensational pleasure of an outstanding beauti-ful voice , or the satisfaction that comes from observing superlatively good craftsmanship , vir-tuosity of voice or fiddle . Nor must we forget the most important of all these discrepancies between pleasure and aesthetic value , the intensi-fication of the pleasure due to the operation of the herd instinct which we examined in our earliest chapter . We reach , then , the position that the critical element in applause is liable to two distortions : ( I ) that the audience is primarily expressing its pleasure rather than its judgement , and that though the pleasure and the aesthetic value ( expressed in judgement ) are largely co-extensive , the pleasure is a wider thing and includes several other elements ; ( 2 ) even if the value as judged and the pleasure felt should amount to precisely the same thing , the audience // is still faced with the really impossible task of expressing in terms of quantity what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noise a judgement of value . It is this critical function of the audience which in the long run and in the last resort determines the future development of the whole art . At any given concert the applause may woefully distort the aesthetic judgement of the audience and the judgement itself may subsequently prove to have been a superficial and worthless one , but , as the whole history of music shows , there is no appeal from the verdict of a succession of audiences . The listener 's judgement of the value of a work is what determines whether it shall live or die , and to a considerable extent the amount of influence it shall have on other composers . What meaning then are we to attach to value ' and what psychological account can we give of a judgement of value ? Value ' is a term of the highest importance in aesthetic no less than in moral philosophy , and as I have already made use of the conception ( in // the essay on Emotion ) and as in the present essay I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is derived , it will be appropriate to give it some small amount of the psychological scrutiny which it deserves . It may be defined as the power to satisfy the whole mind . Primarily man finds satisfaction ( and happiness ) only in the accomplishment of his instinctive desires . That and that alone has value which gratifies the instincts : and all men , however highly civilized , find their deepest ( though not necessarily their highest ) satisfaction in the satisfying of the three major instincts of self-maintenance , parenthood and social inter-course , while unfortunately only too large a number of people have few sentiments ( com plexes ) in addition to these from which they may derive happiness . These are the purposes of living which aim at nothing beyond themselves . The satisfaction has an immediacy and obvious ness which is self-sufficient . I can not forbear quoting William James 's famous description of this self-sufficiency of instinct . ' // " Not one man in a billion , when taking his dinner , ever thinks of utility . He eats because the food tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him why he should want to eat more of what tastes like that , instead of revering you as a philosopher he will probably laugh at you for a fool . The connection between the savory sensation and the act it awakens is for him absolute and selbstverstandlich , an a priori synthesis of the most perfect sort , needing no proof but its own evidence . . . To the metaphysician alone can such questions occur as : Why do we smile when pleased , and not scowl ? Why are we unable to talk to a crowd as we talk to a single friend ? Why does a particular maiden turn our wits so upside-down ? The common man can only say , Of course we smile , of course our heart palpitates at the sight of the crowd , of course we love the maiden , that beautiful soul clad in that perfect form , so palpably and flagrantly made from all eternity to be loved . ' And so probably does each animal feel about the particular things it tends to do in presence of // particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lion it is the lioness which is made to be loved , to the bear , the she-bear . To the broody hen the notion would probably seem monstrous that there should be a creature in the world to whom a nestful of eggs was not the utterly fascinating and precious and **29;314;TOOLONG object which it is to her . " But we have already observed how in the course of development the human mind comes to pursue ends other than these obvious and self-sufficient ends furnished by crude instinct ; how the chain of processes whose successive ' links are percep tion , cognition , affect , conation and motor dis charge ( action ) may be broken and the process truncated by what is termed psychical displace ment , and how different new higher ( question-begging epithet , but it must stand ) ends come to be substituted for the original instinctive ends . As these secondary ends develop they become able to yield appropriate satisfactions of their // own , which like the primary satisfaction of instinct is affective ( emotional ) in character . This secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a certain quality of intrinsic ' worth-whileness . Objects possessing value ( in this narrower derived sense ) like the objects of our instinctive desires carry with them their own justification and raison d'etre , they are ends in themselves not means to any-thing further , but they differ from instinctive ends in that their pursuit is said to be disinterested . A man who pursues what he instinctively desires may be acting quite properly , but he is not acting disinterestedly ; but anyone who pursues goodness , truth or beauty is acting disinterestedly , however much satisfaction may and indeed must accrue to him as a by-product of the pursuit.2 ' 77 APPLAUSE In Essay III the view was put forward that a work of art is itself a judgement of value which has received a permanent expression . Here we have the view that applause , and we may add criticism , is also a judgement of value . But I am not proposing to argue that applause is a work of art . The essential sameness , however , of the activities of making and listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which is almost an axiom of the Musical Appreciation movement , receives some support from my two analyses . The actual hand-clapping is not of course the criticism , but is an epi-phenomenon , i.e. , a vestigial by-product of the mental activity of criticising . Criticism is the expression of a judgement of value , and the experience which is its subject and starting-point is a musical expe-rience . Criticism is therefore a work of art in the second degree and comment on a critic 's criticism may be art at three removes , but such judgements of value have their ingredients // compounded not only in different media ( words and concepts instead of sounds or colours ) but also in different proportions , the cognitive element gaining at the expense of the affective . ' It remains now only to note one or two small points which sometimes influence an audience in addition to those already discussed . Chief of these is the sporting spirit which is readily called out by any attempt to perform under disabilities of any kind ? indisposition , old age ( e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who takes a familiar role on a special occasion ) , or emergency ( as when an understudy or substitute takes a part at short notice ) . Akin to this is the politeness which tolerates incompetence , and which drives those who are at once more brutal and more sensitive to accuse the concert-going public of being Philistines and fools . Somewhat similar is the modern form of chivalry which an undergraduate audience will show to an attractive lady violinist , an element which is discernible even when the playing is very good indeed .
