Some of the country 's more potent oilmen met at St. Louis , last week , to see what could be done about the overproduction , from which their industry has long been suffering ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) . Oklahoma operators agreed to cut production from 700,000 barrels a day to 650,000 . Meanwhile , however , Texas and California oil fields continued on an unlimited production basis . Unless a national agreement covering all oil fields is reached it would appear that regional agreements can effect no major improvement . Present U. S. production is approximately 2,690,000 barrels a day and wildcatting ( opening up new fields , greatest obstacle to controlled production ) continues .
