ENITO MUSSOLINI , chief and incarnation of Fascismo , has reached the first milestone in his career as master of Italy . A little more than a year has passed since the apostle of Ideals in Action , the arch-believer in fist , pistol , and knife as the most efficacious servants of right and justice , was swept into the premiership of his native land ; since an army of his scowling , hard-fisted followers marched into Rome , defying moss-grown political traditions , and installed him in place of the hesitating statesmen who had sought in vain to govern Italy ever since the armistice of 1918 . One year has passed and Benito Mussolini is still boss in the land . His black-shirted Fascisti still stalk the streets of every Italian city , stick their fingers in every Italian political pie . One year after the march on Rome Mussolini and Fascism ? are , apparently , stronger than ever . But ? how about their Ideals ? How about those dazzling promises of sweeping reforms ? How about Mussolini 's threat of a political house-cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader promised , on behalf of himself and his followers , it was Benito Mussolini . Has he kept faith ? Have they ? Or is their sensational victory being used for the selfish ends which have sullied so many brilliant political triumphs of the past ? With a lively realization of the danger besetting flat-footed statements by an outsider regarding a most complicated situation , I would make this answer ? it deals , by the way , solely with the record of the Mussolini government in Italian internal affairs and has no bearing on its foreign policy : Benito Mussolini has kept faith . The majority of his followers have kept faith . Those among them not worthy of what is best in Fascista ideals are constantly in danger of being ousted from positions of authority , and from the Fascista party itself , because they have not kept faith . " If Mussolini were to disappear from Italian politics at this very moment. , he would have justified his existence , " an Italian told me in Rome . " He has proved that one man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be backed by centuries of tradition , can utterly defeat them ? something which , only a few years ago , anybody in Italy would have told you was absolutely impossible . Yes , if Mussolini were eliminated to-morrow , the fruits of his work would live after him . Ile is a man . He has made good . He has thrown the fear of God into Italian politicians . " There you have it . That is what people are saying all over Italy . There arc grumblings , to be sure , signs of gathering opposition . There are ugly little blemishes upon the record of Mussolini and the Fascisti as lords of the land ? in their dealings with alien minorities and foreign countries , the tactics of the bully , the cloven hoof of imperialism , have been only too apparent . Moreover , it must be borne in mind that Mussolini has been in power but one short twelvemonth ; the thought of that causes even his most enthusiastic admirers to grow apprehensive when they ponder on what may await him and his ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts and apprehensions , recurring constantly in the talk of Italians and foreign residents in Italy of the most widely divergent political views , is the refrain : " Mussolini has made good . " Italy expects from him a tremendous lot still , a sum total of achievement which , perhaps , he is not superhuman enough to compass ? but , be that as it may , he can certainly count , as he passes his first milestone , on an extraordinary degree of support among his countrymen . Italy ? almost all of it , anyhow ? still stands solidly behind Benito Mussolini . The anti-Mussolini political element is still scattered and weak and incoherent . His enemies still pipe a shy and feeble little song . Nor has one year of power sufficed to tarnish the ideals of Fascismo , which the Fascisti trumpeted loudly all over Italy through four years of struggle against Reds and Socialists , against government weakness and anti-government strength ? the ideals of which Mussolini is the incarnation . They still stand . They still wage winning battle against partisan selfishness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , many thought , idealism had perished . It was three and a half years after the birth of Fascism ? that Mussolini seized the reins of government in Italy . In March , 1919 , he and a handful of others , banded together into the first . " Fascia , " threw clown the gauntlet to " Reds , " Socialists , and everybody else who , to their minds , was threatening the welfare of Italy . At that time ? and for many months afterward ? the enemies of the existing order , most especially the " Reds " or Communists , had things pretty much their own way . They reviled and spat upon soldiers returning from the front , scoffed at the Allied victory which Italy had helped to win . They extolled Lenin and Trotzky , talked confidently of a proletarian revolution which was to make Communism supreme in Rome , as it already was in Moscow . Strike followed strike , disorder was rampant , the Italian government slipped from one faint-hearted compromise to another ; it gave constant proof of timidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Communist workmen , in defiance alike of government and employers . This was ended by a compromise between the workers and the Ginlitti government which Italian Communism might well regard as half a victory . Italy , apparently , was headed straight for Communism , or chaos . All this time , however , Mussolini and the Fascisti were active . When he began he had about fifty followers . Day by day their numbers grew . Members of many parties became Fascisti . War veterans , especially , tired of being insulted if they went upon the streets in uniform or with their service stripes , flocked to enlist under the banner of the newly-born group which declared that its sole aim was to serve Italy . The " Reds , " accustomed to violent methods in obtaining what they sought , suddenly found themselves confronted with men as rough as themselves ? nay , much rougher , as the outcome of many a clash between Fascisti and Communists soon proved . " You believe in violence , do you ? " Mussolini told the Italian Reds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So do we ! In knives ? So do we ! " And he told the weak government of Italy , in speeches and newspaper articles : " You have used constitutional methods and you have failed ! I shall use unconstitutional methods and I shall succeed ! " In the summer of 1922 things came to a " show-down . " The Communists called for a general strike throughout Italy . " If you quit work , " the Fascisti told the laborers of Italy , " we will break your strike ! " The strike began . The Fascisti , in their black shirts , sallied forth to make good their word . It was a fight to a finish . Fascisti and Reds knew that the real test of strength had come ? that he who was victor now would henceforth be boss in Italy . The two real powers in the land stood face to face , while the nominal rulers of Italy ? the Italian government ? waited apprehensively on the side-lines , wondering what would happen . All over Italy there were clashes between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn . In some towns the Fascisti took complete control of the government . They ran the electric light plants , sold food in the marketplaces , kept trains and street cars going . In Milan an Under-Secretary of State , a noted Fascista , himself operated a street car . All over Italy one could see railway engines driven . by Fascista engineers ? or else Fascisti , armed with a club , standing beside reluctant engine-drivers ready to knock them insensible if they refused to keep their hands on the throttle . The Fascisti broke that strike . After a few days of testing Fascista strength and determination , strike leaders and strikers knuckled down . Italy now knew who was her master . Less than two months after the end of the strike , the Fascisti made their famous march into Rome , swept the Italian government out of the way , installed their leader , Mussolini , as premier . Whereupon Italy , remembering his innumerable boasts and promises , looked up to him , with eyes in which admiration and skepticism were equally blended , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got down to work without a minute 's delay . First , he tackled the government offices . They were full of dry-rot and laziness . A goodly percentage of Italy 's government officials considered their jobs pleasant sinecures , quiet little backwaters , where they could have long stretches of daydreaming without interruption from that vulgar thing , work . In pre-Mussolini days persons visiting Italian government offices on business bent continually had the " two-hat trick " played upon them . An official would come in , hang his hat on a nail in a conspicuous place , go to his desk , take out another hat , and disappear on some personal errand . Sometimes he would be gone for hours . But , when anybody came to the office and inquired for him , his colleagues , with the most innocent air in the world , would point to his hat , hanging on its conspicuous nail , and say : " Just sit down and wait a minute . He must he somewhere about . There 's his hat . " The visitor would wait .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time he would grow impatient he would look up at the nail , see the hat , and wait some more . Eventually the official would sneak in through a side door , tuck his unofficial hat away in his desk , dash out into the anteroom where his official hat was hanging , shake hands effusively with the visitor , and recite some rigmarole like this : " Oh , so sorry to have kept you waiting , but , you see . I had a conference with the head of my department ? most important conference , I assure you ? and I simply could not get away ! " Through this pleasant Land of the Two Hats Mussolini swept like a tempest . It was not so much that lie discharged officials ? though he did get rid of some ? as that he " threw the fear of God " into the ranks of Italian officialdom . He made it perfectly clear that , during office hours , officials must be at their desks . He convinced them that if they were paid to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the government offices of Rome , reading the riot act to quaking secretaries and clerks . Ever since , the atmosphere in those offices , compared with their sleepy air of yesterday , has been pure electricity . Incidentally , Italian government officials do n't keep an extra hat at their offices any more . When Mussolini became premier there were fifteen government departments , each presided over by a minister , who was a member of the Italian Cabinet , each possessing a large stall . Mussolini decided that ten ministries would be quite enough for the job of running Italy . So he took five of them ? ministers , secretaries , clerks , doorkeepers , bag and baggage ? and either suppressed them altogether or merged them in other governmental departments . Devotees of political tradition raised their hands in horror ? " surely , " thought they , " the heavens will fall on the head of this audacious upstart ! " But the heavens remained in their place . So did Mussolini . He then east his cold eye upon the Italian railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trains left late and arrived late . Their equipment was faulty ; they were dirty and overcrowded . Now , a year after the beginning of the Mussolini regime , a most remarkable difference may be noticed . " The Naples-Rome train used to be three hours late , " I was told by a Roman who does much traveling . " To-day , though , you can set your watch by it . " Great is the change which has come over Italian railroad employes ! Formerly among the most indifferent of workers , they now actually seem to take a pride in their work . There is a story of an Italian conductor , who , while going through his train one day last summer , found a passenger sitting with his feet on the cushions of the seat in front of him . The conductor was horrified ! In the sternest of accents he reproved that passenger , bade him put his feet where they belonged . " In the old days , " said the Italian who told me the story , " any passenger could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces without being stopped by the conductor ! " But now comes the cream of the joke . The man who had put his feet up on the cushions was a Fascista ? a Fascista , Von . CXLVIII. ? No. 584. - 25mind you , wearing the black shirt that proclaimed him a Knight of Reform , a Galahad of Unsullied Idealism ! Surely , there is hope for the continued success of Mussolini , if , but one year after his accession to power , a follower of his is severely kept up to the mark by a conductor who , but one year ago , was probably a wild-eyed Communist ! A similar change has come over the Italian telegraph system . Formerly , in telegraph offices from the Alps to Sicily , many of the clerks believed that days were made for dreaming . They were enthusiastic for the Two-Hat Idea . Nowadays , though , no matter what their private opinions may be , they have become , outwardly , miracles of activity . Nothing shows the transformation effected by Mussolini in the Italian telegraphs better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a press telegram from Rome to London was twenty-four hours . Now it is three hours . And one telegram got through in fifteen minutes ! Wherever you turn in Italy you see evidence of Mussolini 's drastic housecleaning . Naples , for instance . Naples was notorious as one of the worst ports of embarkation and disembarkation in Europe ? if not the worst . It had become an article of faith with passengers landing or leaving there , with merchants shipping goods to or from there , that the Neapolitan was incorrigible , that everyone dealing with him had to submit to knavery , extortion , and lack of organization . Mussolini , though , decided otherwise . He attached a squad of Fascisti to the port administration , and placed it under the control of Admiral Milo , a Fascista possessed alike of firmness and idealism . Milo and his coadjutors achieved what had been thought to be impossible ? they " threw the fear of God " into the Neapolitans . To-day , according to the very best of authority , embarkation and disembarkation of freight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which make old-timers rub their eyes . One scowl from a black-spirted Fascist a , and ? lo ! and behold ! ? the Neapolitans forget rowdyism , dilatory tactics , petty graft and insolence , and ? get right down to work ! The port of Naples is the new Italy in miniature . The business element in Italy is delighted with the Mussolini regime . Italian business men , likewise the foreigner doing business in their midst , now look forward in their operations with a degree of confidence which they had not felt in years . What is true of business is true in other walks of life . Yet the strange part of it is that Mussolini takes unending joy in telling every section of the community that he does not and will not especially favor it . He goes to employers and tells them that he is not against labor . He goes to labor and tells it that he is not against capital . He tells peasants that he is no enemy of the landowner ; he tells landowners that high-handed methods with the peasantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians of all classes have shown eager willingness to believe in his sincerity . One year of power has not killed Benito Mussolini 's idealism . One year of experience of his methods in power has not killed Italy 's belief in him . Proof of the change that has come over Italy under Mussolini is afforded by the drop in the numbers of the unemployed ? last summer I was told that their total had fallen to less than onehalf of what it was a year before . Another proof is the building boom which has started in some parts of the country , notably in Milan , the great Italian business center . Before Mussolini 's day Italian landlords were restricted as to the amount of profit they could make from hiring out premises to tenants . Whatever the rights or wrongs of this system may have been , the practical result was that building operations were well-nigh paralyzed . Few wished to ganible in that direction . The Mussolini government promptly introduced a system of rentals depending primarily on supply and demand , whereby landlords could get larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes between landlord and tenant should go to a special committee . As a result of this , buildings began to shoot up at an astonishing rate . Only a year ago Mussolini and the Fascisti were at daggers drawn with organized labor in Italy . Communist agitators had immense influence with the laborers and their unions ; the seeds of Communism had been sown right and left in the ranks of labor chiefs and their followers . Yet now , little more than a year after the great general strike of the summer of 1922 , Italian labor is showing marked willingness to collaborate with Mussolini . At a recent meeting the labor unions voted to belong officially to no party . Reading between the lines , this apparently means breaking away from the former Communist-Socialistic control and giving the labor leaders a free hand to join up with some other party . All signs , np to quite recently , pointed to the fact that this signified ultimate co-operation between Labor and the Faseisti . Incidentally , there has been a tremendous drop in the numbers of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advent of Mussolini they totaled something like 2,000,000 , whereas today the total membership is in the vicinity of 250,000 ? one-eighth of what it was . Here is an incident which occurred last spring ? six months after Mussolini had become premier ? which illustrates the changed attitude of Italian labor . In Milan there is an American who is manager of the Italian branch of a big American manufacturing concern . He employs several hundred Italian laborers . He has been on his job somewhat over two years ; during the first half of that time he had the usual quota of trouble with his workmen . He was constantly wrangling with the heads of workers ' delegations , hearing dark talk of strikes , etc . Then Mussolini took hold of the government . At once there came a marked diminution of " Red " talk among the workmen . They settled down to their jobs . All went pretty well through the winter . But the first of May drew near , the classic day of Socialism . On that day Italian laborers had been accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and listening to disheveled orators who denounced governments in general and the Italian government in particular . Now , the Mussolini government had declared that , on May 1 , 1923 , there was to be " business as usual . " Workers all over Italy were cautioned against staying away from their jobs on that day . But six short months of Mussolini had not been quite enough to eradicate old habits . The first of May , 1923 , came around , and , though the majority of Italian workmen trooped to work , there were some who stayed away ? among them a number of those employed at the plant managed by the abovementioned American . He communicated with the local union to which the absentees belonged . He pointed out that , by the terms of the agreement of 1920 between the Giolitti government and the workers , it had been decided that , whenever any worker struck without orders to do so from his union , he was liable to a fine . The union heads advised the American manager to fine his absentee workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . After all , Mussolini had been in power only a few months ; it was difficult to know just how seriously the workers took him , especially workers like those of turbulent Milan , accustomed to high-handedness and arrogance in dealing with their employers . The American , however , was a man of nerve . When the men who had failed to appear on May first showed up on May second they found that they had not only lost the pay which would have been corning to them had they worked the day before but also another half day 's pay ? which , according to the agreement between the Giolitti government and the unions , employers were authorized to assess against all men who , without instructions from their unions , refused to work . Before deciding upon this step the American had received plenty of warning . There had been plenty to tell him that he could not " get away with it , " that his action would cause such a hubbub that lie would be glad , for the sake of peace , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The workers took their medicine with the utmost meekness . A scowl or two , a bit of grumbling and swearing , and then ? back to their jobs , minus one and one-half day 's pay ! That was the net result to them of their little unofficial celebration of May 1 , 1923 . Incidentally , at that same plant , there is no Workers ' Committee now . When the time came for re-electing its members , or electing others in their place , the men stopped to think . Things were going quite smoothly . There had n't been any wrangling with the manager for quite a while . " Why have any committee ? " asked the workers . And they did n't . Mussolini early recognized that one of the principal obstacles in the path of his complete success was the Fascisti themselves . He had been carried to power by a compact body of men , almost all of whom were men of action , bona " scrappers . " Unlike their chief , who combines love of a fight with remarkable brain-power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else , more . valuable in getting power for a leader than in helping him wield it . Yet Mussolini could not very well say to these hard-fisted sharers of his victory : " Thank you very kindly , my good fellows . You may go home now . I have no further use for rough-necks ! " He has compromised by pruning the actual fighting force of Fascism ? down to a. body , some 70,000 strong , who go about armed , live in barracks like regular soldiers . This corps is neither army nor local police nor national gendarmerie ? it is called the National Militia ; upon it Mussolini , so far , has been able to rely implicity . Already , however , there are those in Italy who , remembering that other crack corps of Imperial Rome which eventually made and unmade emperors , are calling these seventy thousand Black Shirts " the Praetorian Guard . " As for the rest of the Fascisti , those who are not enrolled as its military element , Mussolini has found himself confronted with another very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he started out back in 1919 to " clean up " Italy he had a mere squad of followers , about fifty , in all . Between then and 1921 , the years when Fascisti and their enemies were literally at each other 's throats , the number of his followers rose to about 100,000 . " Those who were Fascisti in 1919 and 1920 are the brand to whom I take off my hat , " a student of Italian politics told me in Rome . " To wear Fascista insignia in those days was to invite sudden and violent death . Yet they wore it ? every one of them ? everywhere . " Since 1921 , however , other elements began to join the Fascisti . Many Italians scented the coming victory . They hurried to " get on the band wagon . " By the autumn of 19 ' 22 , when the Fascisti marched upon R.orne , there were something like 300,000 of them . A few months after the accession of Mussolini there were easily 600,000 . Last summer there were close upon one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these are not sincere reformers at all . They are not men of ideals . They are not concerned with the spiritual regeneration of Italy . They care little or nothing for patriotism or justice or right . They think largely of making a good thing out of being with the Fascisti . Mussolini is well aware of this . He has taken the measure of this horde of conscienceless opportunists . What is more , he is getting rid of them as fast as he can . " There are a couple of hundred thousand men among the Fascisti whom anybody can have who wants them ! " he grimly announced in a recent speech . He is nothing if not drastic in his " weeding out " methods . Here is an instance : It became apparent to Mussolini that the leader . of the " Fascio " or local Fascista organization of Rome , and many of its members , were using the victory of Fa.seismo for selfish ends . They were " playing politics , " giving friends good jobs . In doing so , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the Roman Fascio awoke to find that he had been discharged from his post . Nor ( lid Mussolini stop there . He put in a new leader , of the old 1919 brand of idealistic Fascisti , and instructed him to find out what was the matter with the members of the Roman Fascio . The new chief reported concerning them . " Fire them all ! " commanded Mussolini . The new leader fired them all . " Now investigate each one individually , " his chief ordered , " and take back only those who are worthy of still being Fascisti . " The order was obeyed . One by one the members of the dissolved organization came up for judgment . Some were thrust aside , some reinstated . The Roman Fascio went back to its work in an entirely new spirit . Mussolini had put " the fear of God into it . " Local organizations of Fascisti sometimes abuse their power without bringing down upon themselves the wrath of their chief , for , after all , he can hardly be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to say that , whenever he hears of such cases , he is ruthless in punishing the offenders . Italian newspapers teem with chronicles of Fascisti brought to judgment for misuse of power , rough treatment of rivals , and the like . Typical of the " weeding-out " era through which Fascism ? is passing is what occurred at a little town on the Adriatic coast , where the post of government physician was vacant . The local " Fascio " went to the mayor , presented the name of a candidate who was an active member of the Faseisti , and signified in unequivocal terms that the wisest thing the mayor could do would be to appoint that man , irrespective of his merits , ignoring all the other candidates for the job . It happened , however , that the mayor had a conscience . " I will do nothing of the sort ! " he told the local Faseisti . " I will investigate the record of each candidate and appoint the one who is best qualified ! " The local Faseisti were greatly incensed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the use of belonging to the party in power if you could n't hand out the choicest plums to your friends ? They threatened to make things hot for the mayor . But he was of that brand of Fascisti to whom one would like to take off one 's hat . He investigated all the candidates , found that the Fascista was by no means the best doctor , threw him into the discard , and appointed a practitioner who was not a Fascista , at all but happened to have a most excellent record in curing persons afflicted with disease . Then before the enraged local Fascisti could carry out any of their threats he made a complete report of 4 what had occurred to the Central Committee of the Faseisti , which amounted to laying the facts before Mussolini . Fast as the telegraph could bring it came the answer : " Fire the whole gang ! " As in the great city of Rome , so in the little town on the Adriatic . The local Faseio was dissolved , reorganized , and put back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no question about one thing ? Mussolini is the big boss in Italy today . After months ai the premiership he can boast that nobody has eaten into his supreme power . The best proof of this was the Padovani ease , still fresh in the minds of all Italians . Padovani was the leading Fascista chief of Southern Italy . He had stood shoulder to shoulder with Mussolini in Fascismo 's great fight , contributed materially to Mussolini 's victory . Also , he was the idol of his followers in the south . But after the Fascista triumph , Mussolini and Padovani disagreed on whether the Nationalists should be admitted to co-operation with the Faseisti . Mussolini wanted to join forces with them ; Padovani was emphatically against such a step . The Nationalists , he said , might be all right in Mussolini 's north ; in the south , though , they were largely composed of camouflaged Reds and Socialists . All this Padovani told to Mussolini , but Mussolini was adamant ; in the north and south alike , he insisted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " declared Padovani , " I shall resign ! " " No you wo n't , " retorted Mussolini . " You ca n't resign ! " " Why not ? " inquired Padovani . " Because you 're fired ! " thundered Mussolini . It was a daring move . There was danger that the Southern Fascisti , devoted followers of Padovani , might back their leader to a man , defy the audacious northerner , make him eat his words . But they did n't . The South backed not Padovani but Mussolini . In Naples , Padovani 's stronghold , as well as in Milan , the great fortress of Mussolini , Nationalists were admitted to co-operation with Fascisti . Once again the remarkable political sixth sense of the FascisLa chief had made it possible for him to look ahead , defy the probabilities , guess right . Rocks loom ahead for Mussolini . Trouble may be storing up for him within the ranks of his turbulent Fascisti . Pitfalls yawn for him in Italy 's relations with foreign countries . The opposition , now meek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . Communists and Socialists , the " Popular party , " and others now on the outside looking in , may get the requisite strength to shake his power . But , as he rounds out his first year of office , no individual or group or party in Italy even worries him . He sits secure , the strongest man in Italy , idolized by a host of his fellowcountrymen , respected by others , feared by men to whom fear of an Italian premier was , for years , a thing utterly unknown . When he goes out upon the street people run after his automobile , tossing their caps in the air , cheering him wildly . If he continues to work primarily for Italy , to convince enough Italians that Italy 's welfare is his main object , it would seem that Benito Mussolini could maintain himself as a leader for a long time to come . In all probability , though , he will have to seek help outside the Faseista party . Too many of the Fascisti , as has been already pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for executive ability in government jobs . Yet , in finding non-Faseista co-operation , Mussolini is bound to encounter serious difficulties . Practically all the old-line politicians of Italy are played out . Everybody knows all about them , they are ticketed and pigeon-holed in the public mind ; Italy has had enough of them . Perhaps , in the long run Mussolini may discover enough new men of governing ability to enable him to carry on the government without recourse to the old-timers . Italians of a reflective cast of mind shake their heads when they realize how Mussolini towers above those about him in ability . Can he find men of equal or nearly equal ability to help him bear Italy 's burdens ? That is a question which bothers all who have Italy 's future welfare at heart . In any event , Mussolini is not afraid to have strong men about him , as this little story shows : Recently he asked a scion of a famous old Italian family , a dyed-in-the-wool conservative , to accept an important post in the government . The old aristocrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't like your policies . I do n't see how I can serve you . I refuse the post . " Mussolini said to him : " You are the first man who has talked to me that way . I like it . Now listen : " I know your career and you know mine . We have just one thing in common . Throughout our lives , we have put the good of Italy above all else . If you come into my government , what I will ask of you is not that you serve me but that you serve Italy . Now will you accept the post ? " The two men looked each other in the eye . " I accept , " said the old aristocrat . If Mussolini can continue enlisting that sort of aid by that sort of method there is truth in this line , inscribed under a picture of him which is being sold all over Italy : " Italy 's ship of state still battles against the tempest , but is it without a pilot ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
