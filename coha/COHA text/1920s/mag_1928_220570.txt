Roy W. Howard , head of the E. W. Scripps Co. and its 26 Scripps-Howard newspapers , met some gentlemen from the Guaranty Co. , the Chemical National Bank of Manhattan and of Sidlo , Simons , Day &; Co. of Denver . The men , like most men in finance , depend for livelihood upon creating new security issues for sale to investors . Mr. Howard 's company , they knew , could carry new financing . It had never gone to the general public for funds and it was a great profit-earner . On his part , he could use some millions to pay for papers which he had recently acquired and for others which he proposes to buy . The group called their parleys a deal , and last weeK the E. W. Scripps Co. issued $8,500 , - ooo gold debenture bonds through the three banking houses . <P> Everyone reads periodicals and everyone reflects that income from subscriptions and advertisements must be profitable . The nickel paid for a copy of the Saturday Evening Post does not pay for the cost of paper alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-page advertisement in black and the $11,500 for four-color pages yield profits which financiers are beginning to exploit . Each reader may be a prospect for the sale of such securities , just as almost every user of electricity in the U. S. has been offered investments in his " home " public utility . <P> But little more than a dozen publishers of the several thousand in the U. S. yet have offered their securities to the general investment public . Among the few which have done so are : <P> <P> Curtis Publications ( Saturday Evening Post , Country Gentleman , Ladies ' Home Journal , New York Evening Post , Philadelphia Public Ledger ) . <P> Hearst group ( 25 newspapers , Cosmopolitan ) . <P> Paul Block ( 5 papers ) . <P> Booth Brothers ( 8 papers in Michigan ) . <P> Frank Ernest Gannett ( 11 papers chiefly in New York State , but including the recently bought Hartford , Conn. , Times ) . <P> Conde Nast ( Vanity Fair , Vogue . Last week , as he sailed on the S. S. Munargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would edit and print an edition of Vogue in Germany . French and British editions already exist ) . <P> Luke Lea of Tennessee ( 4 Southern papers , including the Atlanta Constitution ) . <P> Colonel Ira Clifton Copley of Aurora , Ill. ( papers in Illinois and California ; see p. 23 ) . <P> United Publishers ( trade papers ) . <P> National Trade Journals ( 10 business papers being merged last week ) . <P> Butterick Publishing Co .
