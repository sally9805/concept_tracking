BEAU IDEAL-Percival Christopher Wren-Stokes ( $2.00 ) . <P> With Beau Geste , Christopher Wren roused such wholesale devotion to the gallant Brothers Geste of the French Foreign Legion that he has found it necessary to pronounce two post mortems-Beau Sabreur , and now Beau Ideal . No Conan Doyle , facile at reviving favorite characters , he is nevertheless faithful in concocting new thrills , new astounding coincidences , new bad puns , and pinning them to the surviving Geste-two others having already died elaborate deaths . <P> Not that John Geste , survivor , is even the hero of the present yarn , but it is for his sake that Otis Vanbrugh , chief protagonist , braves countless risky episodes , Arab raids , hand-to-hand fights , imprisonment , penal servitude . Otis ransacks the heart of Africa for John Geste , who in turn is trying to find two lost friends , Buddy and Hank . The first coincidence : Otis and Geste , both serving in the Foreign Legion penal colony , are both dumped into a dark silo , and forgotten . Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Second coincidence : in the middle of the desert Otis appeals to two Arab chiefs for aid , and finds that one of them is his long-lost brother in disguise . Moreover , the two of them are Geste 's Buddy and Hank . Third coincidence : with Geste 's life at stake , Otis had promised to marry a half-caste dancing girl . Honor-bound to keep his loathful promise , he is on the verge of marriage when he discovers her to be his half-sister . With such luck the end can not but be happy-and the surviving Geste still survives .
