At dawn in London people began to line up outside the stadium at Highbury where Aston Villa was going to play soccer against Woolwich Arsenal in the afternoon . When the turnstiles opened at 12 o'clock the line was a mile long . An hour later the gates closed , since the stadium was full , and the crowd outside began to fight . A hundred men were hurt . Women who fainted were passed back over the heads of the mob to the ambulance men working in the rear . Inside , Arsenal beat Aston Villa 4 to 1 . The players were unhurt .
