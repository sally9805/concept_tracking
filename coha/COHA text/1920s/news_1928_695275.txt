txt The Anglo-French agreement for a naval limitation plan to be submitted to the Preparatory Commission of the League of Nations was taken up with naval experts today for intensive study by Secretary Kellogg and there is every indication that it will be considered in framing instructions for the American delegation at the next meeting of the commission in the Fall . For the present a policy of silence apparently is to be observed , pending permission from Great Britain to make public the text of the note of Sir Austen Chamberlain on the subject , and the conclusion of analytical studies . The American delegation to Geneva is expected to include practically all who have represented the United States at previous meetings of the Preparatory Commission , under the leadership of Hugh Gibson , Ambassador to Belgium . Secretary Kellogg said today , however , that he was not yet prepared to announce the personnel . Confers With Navy Experts . Secretary Kellogg , with a corrected copy of the British note before him . went over the agreement this morning with Rear Admiral Andrew T. Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval advisers to the American delegations at the various naval limitation meetings at . Geneva . In the afternoon he conferred with Admiral Long . The impression was given that so many technical factors were involved that a careful consideration would be necessary . The Chamberlain note , it was stated , required no answer beyond an acknowledgment , but Secretary Kellogg said that later he might make some comment on the proposition . Secretary Kellogg made it clear that the Anglo-French arrangement had no connection whatever with the multilateral treaty against war . The two questions , he said . did not bear on each other in the slightest degree . All that was involved , he indicated , was a recommendation on the part of Great Britain and France to be made to the Preliminary Conference as a basis for limitation to be presented before the International Limitation Conference that it is expected will eventually be called under the auspices of the League of Nations . He explained that it involved issues that had been debated by Amer- lean as well as French and British officials during the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt only with the principle of limitation and that there was no agreement between the two nations for actual limitation . In other quarters virtual confirmation was obtained of reports that the agreement sought limitation on the basis of four categories , to include capital ships of more than 10,000 tons , airplane carriers , surface craft of less than 10,000 tons and sub-surface craft of more than 600 tons . British Had Insisted on 11 Classes . Previously the British had stood for limitation by eleven classes , involving strict subdivisions of vessels , while the French sought global limitations under which tonnage would be totaled and subdivisions permitted at the discretion of each Government within that total . Interest in the American reaction to the recommendation today centred chiefly on the cruiser situation inasmuch as the plan would group cruisers and destroyers in one category . This position , it was recalled , was similar to one first advanced by Secretary Hughes during the Washington Conference of 1921 and 1922 . It was subsequently abandoned for limitation of cruisers and destroyers separately , although last year the American delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances , it will not come as a surprise if the United States agrees to negotiate on the joint cruiser-destroyer basis . It is accepted as a foregone conclusion that the instructions to the American delegation will safeguard the stand of the United States for an adequate number of 10,000-ton cruisers and not permit the excess number of destroyers left over from the war and largely obsolescent to cut into the cruiser limitation figure for . this country . ITALY IN DARK ON PLANS . But Press Doubts It Conflicts With Italian 2olicy . Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES . ROME , Aug. ** newspapers have been very sparing in their comments on the Franco-British naval agreement , which passed almost unnoticed by the press here . This is partly due to the fact that the news coincided with the return of Nobile and his party , which occupied the whole attention of the press , and that details of the agreement are as yet unknown , so that it is difficult to form an idea of its importance or its probable effects . The announcement of the agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by refusing to accept the American invitation to participate in the last conference tor limitation of naval armament. had clearly indicated her intention not to restrict further her naval forces . It is not looked upon with disfavor. however . Italy never has been against the principle of limitation of naval armaments , merely taking the position that limitation should refer to the total tonnage , leaving each country free to divide its tonnage among different types of craft as it thinks best . As this also has always been France 's viewpoint there is no reason yet to believe that the Franco-British agreement is contrary to Italian policy . In any case it is believed the agreement will greatly facilitate the work of the League of Nations Preparatory Commission for Limitation of Naval Armaments . According to news from abroad the text of the agreement has been communicated to all Governments participating in the preparatory work at Geneva for a conference on disarmament . The text , however , has not been received by Italy .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
