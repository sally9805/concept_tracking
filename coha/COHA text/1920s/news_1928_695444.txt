txt Some time ago I published an Interciting letter which came to me from a , young German mother who was troubled because her little daughter Was beginning to play with other American children , but knew no English , since they had always spoken - German to her at home . T gave her my opinion and that of several educators and doctors , , stating , however , that they were merely opt/Ilona , not proved conclusions , as such were hardly scientifically possible . number of letters canoe to me in the train of this article , and as I .. uWe that it is a great personal pleasure as well as a cultural advantage to knew more than one 's own language , I am going to give you several of these letters . They express an opposite ? ninon to that of some authorities , - but are founded on such first hand experience that I think they should have deckled weight in helping you if you are.eimilarly placed . " Dear Mrs. Ilevans : I read with interest your article concerning the advisability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would like to relate my own experiOleos . " I am Danish . When my first baby was born , I had been In this ' Country only one year and of course preferred to use my own language when talking to the baby . My husband . almost always spoke English to me and so It seemed that when our little girl began to talk , she would use both languages . She never mixed them up . It was either one or the other . She is now 7 and has two sisters , and most of the time they speak Danish when they are alone , and English when they play outside ; or have company . If they hear a strange word that they do not know the meaning of they always tell me to say it in Danish and it seems that knowing the word In two languages helps much to remember Just where It should be used . " If I only spoke French to perfection , I would arrange to have that spoken . too . I do not mean that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spoken so the youngsters gradually , without knowing it , become interested and pick it t/P -- 'as at a meal , for instance . "
