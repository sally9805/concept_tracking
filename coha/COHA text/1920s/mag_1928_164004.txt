Dr. Hugh Stott Taylor of Princeton University , in the opinion of his chemist-colleagues , has been engaged in research which was the " most original , " and the " most stimulating to further research . " Accordingly , he received last week the Nichols Medal , coveted by all chemists . Industrial problems had suggested to Dr. Taylor the study of catalytic agents-those substances which accelerate , retard , or even cause chemical change , while remaining themselves unchanged . Catalytic agents are used to vulcanize rubber . Chemist Taylor 's experiments have been with substances which prevent rubber from rotting , dyed materials from fading , oil from becoming rancid .
