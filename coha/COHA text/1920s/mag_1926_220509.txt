Paunchy , shaggy-haired Premier Briand of France met taut-waisted , sleek Dictator-Premier Primo de Rivera of Spain at the Quai d ' Orsay last week . <P> Each took a pen , dipped , scratched . By their dipping and scratching they validated in perpetuity a Franco-Spanish pact exiling Abd-el-Krim , famed captured Sultan of the Riff ( TIME , June 7 ) , to the island of Runion or Bourbon . <P> Many a Spaniard was vexed at Dictator Primo 's exalted connivance at providing Abd-el-Krim with opulent support for life on a balmy isle 45 miles long , 32 wide and only 380 miles off the coast of Madagascar . At Madrid the slogan , " Hamstring Abd-el-Krim ! " has long attained a popularity rivaling the no-longer-touted , " Hang the Kaiser ! " <P> Frenchmen consider that peace with Krim was cheap at the price , promised him comfortable support in his exile .
