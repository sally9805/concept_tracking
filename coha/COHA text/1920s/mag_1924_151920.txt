The Soviet Chief of Police reached for the code . He read-Article 120- that imprisonment is the punishment for " exploiting the religious prejudices of the masses against the Soviet government and fostering superstition among the masses . " Summoning trusty agents of police , he directed them to the village of Pskoff , to search the doings of Priest Troitski , to bring him to justice . At Pskoff the police heard tales . Troitski had an ikon , a painted image of the Blessed Virgin whose tears , copiously shed , performed miracles . One teardrop , applied to a wound , healed it . By virtue of the tears , Lydia Belskaya was cured of scrofula , Nadya Kolkova of a chronic abscess , Natasha Arcipova of paralysis . Thousands of tears had been efficaciously shed . The police-themselves but humble Bolsheviks-trembled to lay hands upon the holy man who conducted so holy a shrine . But they feared Moscow more . They arrested Troitski , and Troitski confessed . <P> The priest confessed to knowledge of electricity , to having caused tears to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to having received 12,000 gold rubles during the " heavy years " of 1918-21 . <P> He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment . The sentence was commuted to two . <P> But ( and this is the . point of the village tale which has just come out of Russia via Walter Duranty , famed correspondent ) no one attempted to deny that many were cured of illnesses which doctors were unable to remedy . <P> British interest in faith-healing , as signified by the speech of His Grace the Archbishop of York , was noted in TIME , Aug. 4.
