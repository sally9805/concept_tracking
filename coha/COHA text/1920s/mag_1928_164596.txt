" Calvin Coolidge was an odd fish in the White House . " <P> Begun and completed in the past tense was the article William Allen White of Emporia , Kan. , wrote about President Coolidge in the August ( 1928 ) Plain Talk . Excerpts : <P> " He was peculiarly Yankee , a blue-bellied , Vermont Yankee to the core . He had exhibited absolutely no initiative . He had spoken no memorable phrase . ... He played no poker , drank no liquor , made few friends . And Mrs. Coolidge , who had come with him from the duplex apartment in Northampton , Massachusetts , for which they had been paying twenty-seven dollars a month all their married life , and who moved with him into one of Washington 's rather grand but noisy hotels , had to work hard , those first seventeen Washington months of the Vice-Presidency , keeping him awake after bedtime in Northampton at nine-thirty . . . . <P> " Coolidge always knew more definitely what he did not want than what he wanted . His messages were often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his dislikes and aversions . ... He is negation incarnate . As President , he bestraddled progress face backward . . . . <P> " Coolidge 's plus quality was honesty ; honesty backed by a kind of herd courage . Alone he is timid ; with his crowd he is immovable , undaunted . And the picture which the millions saw across the gulf which separates a President from his people was the face of an honest man ; so they idealized this picture and saw a man who saved their taxes ; a man who was immovable amid clamor ; a man who defied the mob ; a man who beatified plutocracy by glorifying parsimony ; a man who defied untoward events by ignoring them-him they saw as a hero and blinked his warts and scars . So in the white light that beats upon a throne the minor vices of a President sometimes at long range become his major virtues in the public eye . "
