" U. S. Art Shock " <P> " Hell 's ringing bells ! " shouted a large , exasperated Detroiter last week into his telephone . " I wish the Sun had never heard of Romney or of me either ! " <P> The gentleman referred to the New York Sun , which was obtaining a telephonic interview , and to George Romney , the 18th Century English cabinet-maker 's son who achieved the niceties of Cavendish Square and rivaled Sir Joshua Reynolds as London 's favorite painter . Naturally , the Sun had heard of Artist Romney , and quite as naturally of hell's-bellsing Lawrence P. Fisher . The latter is president of Cadillac Motor Co. and next-to-youngest of the six Fisher Brothers who rose from their father 's Ohio blacksmithy to dominance in General Motors Corp . <P> To Brother Lawrence , as to the other Fishers , the world of mechanics is understandable , governed by ineluctable laws of physics . The Fishers have learned these laws well and by their aid gained gold . But it was quite another world which Brother Lawrence faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon its vague terrain , he was nonplussed , vexed . That is why he cried , " Hell 's ringing bells ! " <P> Mr. Fisher had bought a painting , with extraordinary results . It was a portrait of the Duchess-Countess of Sutherland , supposedly executed by George Romney in 1782 when the chaste , ringleted subject was only 17 . Brother Lawrence paid the Howard Young Galleries of Manhattan about $200,000 for the canvas . <P> The present Duke of Sutherland , lazying at Lausanne , saw a photograph of the portrait in the Sun , with a report of its presence in the U. S. For a moment the Duke wondered if he was bemused . But there could be no doubt that his pictured ancestress remained as she had for years , at his country home in Guildford , England . He so informed the Sun . <P> Galleryman Young quickly concluded that he , and through him Mr. Fisher , had been duped . Galleryman Young went to Detroit and gave Mr. Fisher back his money . But despite this material satisfaction , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the rest of the score of paintings which he had employed Galleryman Young to buy for him ? How could one ever be sure of the genuine ? Even expert Sir Joseph Duveen , in a similar case , had proved nothing ( TIME , Feb. 18 , et seq . ) . Row upon row of glistening Cadillacs , or Mr. Fisher 's new and magnificent Fokker ( see p.14 ) , are logical , congenial objects of thought . But two paintings , placed side by side for comparison , may jeopardize the reason . <P> Over the telephone , Mr. Fisher related his tribulations : " I am collecting and I 'm blamed if I know why people should get so excited about it . . . . Ever since . . . that story about the phoney Romney - if it is phoney - I have had to have 15 or 20 guards around my house . When people hear about you paying a lot of money for a picture they get the idea that your house is lined with gold and they do everything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing would die down . I 'm sick of hearing about it . "
