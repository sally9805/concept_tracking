Many Senators were surprised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Party who were Informed by representatives of THE binw Yosx Timm indicated that the news was S complete surprise to them , but efforts ? to get them to comment on the subject produced only negative results . . It was apparent that the announcement of Mr. Kellogg 's selection aroused quite as much interest , and in some cases more than was . aroused by the announcement that Mr Hughes would leave the Cabinet The reticence of certain Senators concerning the President 's preference for Mr. Kellogg is being interpreted as indicating that they are confused over Mr. Coolidge 's reasons for choosing Mr. Kellogg for the head of his official family . There have been rumors brought to Washington that Mr. Kellogg is not in good health , and that this is the chief reason for his understood desire to retire from his Ambassadorship and return to the United States . That he should be willing to undertake the arduous duties of Secretary of State if his health was not the best was an aspect of the situation commented on this evening . An additional cause for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief , frequently expressed in Washington recently , that if Mr. Hughes should leave the Cabinet he - would be succeeded by Herbert Hoover , regarded by many as an outstanding figure in public life and with acknowledged ability of the highest character . Kellogg 's Defeat Recalled . From the viewpoint of practical politics , the selection of Mr. Kellogg for the chief office in the Cabinet is regarded as the most surprising of all the many angles of surprise which the White House announcement produced . Mr Kellogg , who came into national prominence largely through his selection by president Roosevelt to undertake the Government 's prosecution of the socalled steel trust , . was elected a Senator from Minnesota in 1916 , but was defeated for re-election in 1922 by Henrik Shipstead : the first Farmer-Labor candidate to be chosen for the Senate . At the time Mr. Kellogg left the Senate in March . 1923. it was indicated that he had ? no desire to take a position either as a Cabinet officer or an Ambassador . For this reason there was much surprise when he accepted President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voluntary retirement of Colonel George Harvey . The fact that Mr. Kellogg , through his defeat by Senator Shipstead. is classed , to use political slang , as a " lame duck , " was one of the chief reasons for the surprise intimated rather than expressed by politicians in Congress over the announcement that he would succeed Mr. Hughes as Secretary of State . This element of the surprise is not as great . however , as it would have been had the announcement been made prior to President Coolidge 's election last November . Recently there has been much comment in political circles over what the future had in store for political " lame ducks " at the hands of President Coolidge after the beginning of his new term in March . Gossip on Hughes es 1928 Candidate . One of the results to be expected team the announcement of Mr. Hughes 's retirement is comment heard in political and other circles that Mr. Hughes has in mind becoming a candidate for the Republican nomination for President in 1928 . As far as can be ascertained , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to light in Washington to give any color to the idea that Mr. Hughes contemplated another try at the Presidency . He will be 63 years old in April and , while the three years added to his age in 1928 would not make him too old for consideration as a Presidential candidate . It is believed that he has not shown any inclination to put himself in line for obtaining the nomination . Mr. Hughes has the reputation in Washington of keeping his own counsel . Since the circulation of the rumors that Ambassador Kellogg contemplated rebigning his diplomatic mi.sSion , comment in connect.on with filling the vacancy has brought forward the names of James M. Beck of New York , Solicitor General . and Senator Medal McCormick f Illinois , who will retire from the Sent in March . ' Alanson B. Houghton of New York , Ambassador to Germany . Is also among those mentioned in connection with the prospective vacancy in the post at London . Mr. Houghton was in America during the recent campaign , and before his return to Europe was a guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Houghton was appointed Ambassador to Germany by Prt:sident Harding in February . 1922.
