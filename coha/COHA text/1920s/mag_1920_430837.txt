 | AMONG the Himalayan Mountains , of which it owns a fair portion , including Mount Everest , the highest mountain in the world , is the Kingdom of Nepal . Often heard of , it one of the native Asian States of which east is known . With the exception of the British Resident and a few European officials who live in the Residency grounds at Khatmandu , the capital , no one is allowed to visit the country without a special permit issued by the Durbar . When the pass or permit has been obtained , visitors are obliged to travel by one particular route and are not allowed to go beyond the Valley of Khatmandu , a tract of country about 15 miles wide by 20 miles long , surrounded by high mountains . The road into Nepal for its entire length is purposely kept in a bad state of repair by the Durbar and runs over quite unnecessarily difficult country , the idea ' wing that the worse the road the more difficult it would be for attacking troops to enter the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I returned to Khatmandu by a fairly good road , turning off near Chitlong and entering the valley close to Patan . The Gurkha " escort , " which always accompanies Europeans on any journey in Nepal , had temporarily left me , and , seeing the road , I rode in quite easily before the escort discovered I had left Chitlong . So I found that there was this much good road , at any rate , and I believe there is a good road all the way o the plains of India down the valley of the Baghmutti. but no Europeans are allowed to travel on it . A TURBULENT , ACTIVE , PROLIFIC PEOPLE The Nepalese are a prolific people of very great energy and activity , eager to make the most of any opportunity which offers itself . The population is increasing so fast that outlets have to be found , and the trend of emigration now is to follow the foothills along Bhutan and into Assam . They make good settlers , though somewhat turbulent , bring their manners and customs and religion with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in which they settle . They require a very firm hand to keep them in order in the lands of their adoption . It is quite within the bounds of possibility that , in the near future , from sheer force of numbers , they will become the dominating race in Bhutan , the Bhutanese being few in number and a race which apparently is on the wane . The Nepalese are a fighting people , have an excellent army and organization , and are fond of show , both in military display and in their religious festivals . The latter are very numerous and in fact seem to be interminable . The women take a prominent part in most of them .  | Some of the semi-military pageants end in the massacre of hundreds of buffaloes and indescribable scenes of blood and dead animals . In one such ceremony , known as the blessing of the colors , the commander-in-chief dips his hands in a bowl of blood and clasps each banner in turn , thus imprinting on each the mark of bloody hands . The scene is somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a martial spirit in the army . Other processions are very picturesque , flowers , flags , and banners playing a prominent part . FEMININE I'ASIIIONS IN NEPAL The Nepalese women wear yards upon yards ? sometimes as many as a hundred ? of fine muslin plaited to form a huge fan-shaped bunch in front , the back being quite tight . When a lady of rank drives in her barouche she completely  | fills the carriage with her voluminous skirt of brilliant hue . Above the skirt a vivid little tight-fitting jacket , usually of velvet , is worn : the hair is dressed in a peculiar knot in front , above the forehead , and fastened to one side by an enormous gold plaque with a jeweled center . A heavy gold necklace and gold bangles complete her jewelry . Every imaginable shade is used ? purple , pale blue , green , carmine , orange , white , yetlow , turquoise , and deep red and the effect is wonderful . At the time of state ceremonies the streets are filled with processions of elephants in gorgeous trappings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual crowd of good-natured , pleasure-loving people , the whole against the background of the old temples and natural surroundings making a wonderful spectacle . A YEAR SPENT IN NEPAL I spent a year in Nepal , where I was sent officially , and have seen the lovely valley in its many changing aspects at different season s ? pale green with growing rice , golden at harvest time , white with blossom in the spring , and brown and bare in the short winter months , but always beautiful . MIv stay also enabled me to become acquainted to some extent with the manners and customs of the people . The journey into Nepal is not an easy one , and at the time of my visit the railway only ran as far as Segowlie , whence the journey of sixteen miles to Raxoul was continued in a carriage lent by a hospitable planter at whose house the night was spent . Here the difficulties began , and the journey as far as Hetowrah , through the Terai and outer hills , was accomplished on horseback or in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track through the forest , but as soon as the outer hills are reached the road loses itself in the bed of a stream , up which the bearers pick their way with difficulty over and among great boulders . At Hetowrah the Rapti River is reached , a pretty mountain stream , and w e changed from horses and palanquins to sturdy little hill ponies and dandis , a sort of chair carried by hillmen . From there onward the road or , rather , track passes through lovely scenery and through the villages of Bichiakoh , Nimbuatar to Bimphidi , where there are some magnificent cotton trees . covered in the spring with large , brilliant red flowers , and on over the Sisagarhi Pass to Marku and Chitlong , prosperous little villages , whose inhabitants take their produce to Nhatmaudu on market days , thinking nothing of the long tramp there and back of over forty miles . WHERE ' BAD ROADS ' IS A NATIONAL DOCTRINE The official road then goes over the very rough track across the Chandragiri Pass and down the almost impassable road on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the descent is down a long staircase of roughly placed blocks of stone , and it is marvelous how the laden men and ponies keep their footing on it . From Chandragiri Pass there is a beautiful view down into the valley , studded with numerous towns and villages and surrounded on all sides by mountains , while to the north tower the everlasting snowy peaks of Gosainthan and Davabung . From the foot of the pass an excellent carriage road into the town of Khatmandu runs through the valley teeming with people , towns , palaces , temples , and innumerable shrines . There are miles of such good carriage roads within the valley , mostly constructed in Jung Bahadur 's time , and carriages and pairs and occasionally a four-in-hand are constantly used by the palace people . In this valley , where the shrines alone are said to number more than 2,700 , the buildings present an amazing diversity of form , derived from many sources ? Egyptian , as shown in the typical form of the windows and doorways finely adapted to local traditions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the designs . It is necessary , before describing any of these , however , to give some account of the religion of this people in order to show its intimate connection with the artistic treatment of the temples , shrines , and even private buildings .  | The inhabitants of Nepal are collectivelY known as " Paharias , " or " Dwellers in the Hills , " and are divided into innumerable castes , of which the principal among the Gurkhas , now the dominant race , are as follows in the order of social precedence : The following are known as high caste : I. Brahmans , who eat rice cooked only by members of their own caste . They drink water from the hands of members of castes Nos. 2 to 19. 2 . Surmgasi , who eat rice cooked by Brahmans , Thakuris , and Khas only . They drink water from the hands of all castes up to No. 19. 3 . Thakuri , who eat rice cooked by Brahmans only . They drink water from hands of all members of all castes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice cooked by Brahmans and Thakuris only and drink water from hands of all members of castes Nos. 2 to 19 . The intermediate castes run from 5 to 19 , inclusive , and the lower castes from 20 to 24 , inclusive . The five castes from 20 to 24 ( 10 not have Brahmans as priests . Their priests are members of their own castes . They have no dealings of any kind with castes I to 2o . They must leave the road on the approach of a member of castes Nos. 1 to 19 and call out to give warning of their approach . They may not enter the courtyards of temples . The Bantor , Danuar , and Drai tribes belong to the plains , and no one knows how to classify them in respect to social precedence . RECRUITING FOR ARMY IS RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN CLASSES Recruiting for the British and Nepalese armies is carried on only from certain of these castes . In addition to these , there are among the Newars , or conquered people , 41 castes and subcastes . Then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potters. etc . It can be imagined that , with such a  | medley of castes , the placing of the people by any outsider is almost , if not quite , an impossibility , and these Hill people are far more strict in their caste rules than any of their so-called coreligionists ( Hindus ) in the plains . I say " so-called " advisedly , for though the bulk of the people profess the Brahman or Hindu religion , so many of the older forms of Tantric worship and of Buddhism have been retained and have so great a hold on their imagination that it would now be more correct to call them BrahmoBuddhists . ANCIENT TANTRIC RITES SHOW IN CARVINGS With a large substratum of Tantric rites appearing in many of their forms and ceremonies , the same influence is found in the carvings in the temples , some of which are gross , and even immoral , although only in a few instances is this very apparent . So , to look with understanding at the varied and beautiful buildings , it must be remembered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources and have adapted their ideas to their immediate surroundings with marvelous effect . In the structural features of their architecture and its ornamentation , in their sacred utensils , arms and armor , in their household implements , vestments , jewelry , everything , there is a similarity and special form which runs through all these eastern Himalayan States . The opinion of Sir George Birdwood , the great authority on such matters , is as follows concerning the source : " It is a matter of some conjecture where this civilization springs from . . . The traditions of the yellow , or Turanian , races of central Asia point to the west as the place of their genesis , as those of the white , or Aryan , races of Europe , Persia , and India point to the east , the common center from whence all these races took their exodus eastward and westward being somewhere round about the Caspian and Black seas . " Chinese tradition names Tibet as the cradle of the race , which remained there for some centuries before moving into China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the stream of commerce , which has from the remotest antiquity crossed Asia from the Mediterranean to the Yellow Sea , has modified this by its inclusion with that of the hamites , Greeks , and even Nestorians and that of Cathay . " Egyptian art , which is to be traced throughout the whole of Turanian Asia , has thus penetrated into the remotest recesses of the Himalayas , and has helped to mold the buildings , both of brick and stone , the regal residences and strongholds , the houses and domestic arts of these remote and shut-in States in the heart of the Himalayas . " In some ways the arts of these States resemble very closely those of southern India , and this may be accounted for by the fact that they both escaped the Mohammedan invasion . They have retained unbroken to this day their arts as produced before the Mogul conquests of northern India . Tradition has added many a touch of local character born of people living amid lovely surroundings and having an artistic temperament as well as a religion which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they love to depict magnificently . AN INGENIOUS METHOD OF FORTIFICATION The most striking buildings of Nepal 's comparatively modern capital , khatmandu , are , perhaps , those composing the Durbar Palace , with its many quadrangles and pagoda-shaped roofs , full of chambers and courts with small communicating doors easily closed , which enable the inhabitants to defend themselves in case of political disturbances , which are not infrequent . Some of the windows are very fine and there are some striking bits of wood-carving . The Royal Temple of the Goddess Taleju , the protectress of the ruling family of Nepal , is the finest in the Durbar group and is kept exclusively for the use of the royal family . Bim Sens Tower , a building nearly 200 feet in height , stands out above the other buildings in the city . It is merely a tower , with no particular meaning , although the Nepalese have a legend that the great Jung Bahadur leaped on horseback from the top and was uninjured.  | The modern palaces , although containing valuable collections of various objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no architectural features of note . It seems a pity that they should have been so built amid the surrounding wealth of picturesque buildings . The old buildings are built of fine red brick with hair joints , leaving no mortar visible , and the ornamentation is generally of molded bricks of the same red color , although sometimes a terra-cotta tone is used . " Sal , " which turns almost black from weathering , is used for woodwork . The roofs are of red corrugated tiles set in mud , with elaborate , grotesque finials . The combination of red brickwork , toned down and weathered by age to a delightful color , with the dark wood used for the overhanging windows and doorways ,  | produces a most picturesque effect , relieved from monotony or sombreness here and there with some brilliant coloring and the sparkle and glitter of the brass an copper repousse work with which most of the doorways are ornamented . BHATGAON , A CITY OE ARCHITECTURAL JEWELS Bhatgaon , one of the oldest Newar capitals , lies about seven miles southeast of Khatmandu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues , all of the greatest architectural value , it is even more interesting than the capital . Through winding , crowded , dirty streets , with wooden colonnades overhung by the balconies of old houses , one reaches the central square , on all sides of which buildings have been erected with the most picturesque irregularity , the finest among them being the Durbar Hall , with its magnificent doorway of brick and embossed copper gilt , built in the reign of Bhupatindra Mall . This doorway is one of the finest pieces of work in Nepal and on it is depicted the whole symbolism of the Hindu and Buddhist religions . Facing the doorway is the statue of Raja Bhupatindra Mall , an extremely  | well executed figure in bronze , seated on a boldly designed pedestal of stone on a square pillar about 20 feet in height , with the royal umbrella rising above the figure . Close by is the Ujatpola Deval , or Temple of Five Hagis , which stands on five platforms up which a flight of steps leads to the entrance . This stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , the lowest pair being two giant wrestlers : above them two elephants ten times as strong as the men : above two lions ten times as strong as the elephants ; next , two dragons ten times as strong as the lions , and finally two deities , most powerful of all . In this square is also the Taumari Tol , dedicated to the Goddess Bhawani . The shrine in front has two magnificent brass dragons , one on each side , decorated with great splashes of vermilion . The brickwork is covered with brass plates deeply embossed , and on each side , on a lotus pillar , is a copper gilt lion holding a banner . This building has quaint and grotesque moldings painted in most vivid colors and lattice windows made of strips of gilt metal , the whole presenting a kaleidoscopic effect iii the brilliant sunshine . NEPAL 'S LARGEST CITY A SLEEPY PLACE Patan was the old New ? at ? capital . where Buddhism was the accepted religion of the country before the invasion of the Gurkhas . Although the largest town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of it falling into rains , but still most picturesque . It stands in the center of the beautiful valley , against a background of green mountains and snowy peaks ? a network of narrow , twisting little streets packed full of shrines , temples , and pagodas , many of them deserted and falling into ruins , but still with exquisite bits of carving and wonderful doorways of all shapes and sizes and wonderful designs . Many of Patan 's buildings are decorated with sheets of embossed copper gilt and everywhere the shrines are guarded by pairs of fearsome animals of enormous size . Carved stone pillars are surmounted by animals , birds , or fish modeled in metal ; bells of all sizes are everywhere , and huge lotus thrones in bronze hold bronze Thunder Bolts , or Dorgis . Kirtipur and Niakot are smaller cities , which , despite the evidences of decay on every hand , are full of beautiful and interesting buildings and shrines . THE HOLY CENTER F NEPAL Pashpati is the holy center of Nepal , to which tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the country is thrown open . The roads are then one long , unending crowd of men and women , old and young , chanting as they go , " Pashpati nath keJai . " Its shrines and temples are clustered on the banks of the holy Baghmutti River , and there the dying are brought to end their days . To these Hindu it is a place as holy as is Benares to the plains men , and to die there , with the sacred water lapping their feet , means passing to everlasting peace . The town is most picturesquely situated , the stream issuing from a narrow , beautifully wooded gorge and the golden roofs of the pagodas among the fresh greenery forming a lovely picture , enlivened throughout the morning hours blithe constant stream of brilliantly dressed men and women coming to perform their religious ablutions before entering upon the day 's work . The Temple of Change-Narain is situated on a spur of a mountain about eight miles to the east of Khatmandu and is reached by a winding path of stone steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the finest temples in Nepal , a veritable treasure-house of relics , its courtyard full of wonderful stone pillars and statues , the cloisters with exquisite carvings in many places richly colored and everywhere flashing sheets of hammered metal ; brass and copper gilt beaten into every possible form ? birds , beasts , fishes , dragons ? standing out on a background of conventional design ; bells everywhere ; brass umbrellas , the emblems of royalty ; great brazen and stone beasts crouching on all sides . THE LEGEND OTT THE GOD WITH TIH TERRIBLE THIRST The water garden of Balajee is a most fascinating spot , a mile or two outside Khatmandu , at the end of a long , shady avenue of trees . It is much frequented by the townspeople in the cool of the  | evening . The fresh spring water is collected in a number of terraced pools one above the other , clear as crystal and reflecting the green of the surrounding trees and bamboos . Along the supporting wall of the lowest pool is a row of about twenty dragon-head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully carved and executed , from which clear water splashes into a tank beneath . Balajee has its own religious significance , found in a small tank on one side , near a temple decorated with Tantric carvings . Under the water lies a carved stone figure of Narain , about ten feet long , with a hood of cobra heads just rising above the water . It reclines on a stone bed with four carved stone posts , rising one from each corner , evidently at one time the support of a canopy . Fish dart here and there in the clear water which gently flows over it . Narain is the creator Brahma , so called from Yam ( waters ) and Ajana ( place of motion ) . At one time he suffered the most excruciating thirst , having drunk poison from the sea , and to assuage this he repaired to Gosainthan , in the snowy regions of the Himalayas , where , striking the mountain with his trident , he caused three streams of water to flow , forming a lake . Pious pilgrims fancy they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tradition is that if ever the ruling king of Nepal visits this lake his death will immediately follow . The great Buddhist stupa of Bodhnath , one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the valley , is a striking example of another form of shrine . The dome-shaped , Chaitya rests on a semi-spherical mound surmounted by the square base of a spire capped by a golden umbrella , while great pairs of eyes have for a thousand years  | and more looked out calmly and serenely to each of the four quarters of the globe from underneath the overhanging eaves . Equally famous is Swayambunath , anOther temple of the same type and even richer and more frequented . It is most Picturesquely situated on the top of a Wooded hill approached by a steep . almost perpendicular , flight of goo steps and closely surrounded by smaller shrines , each in its own way a gem of architecture and carving . In front of the temple is The gigantic Dorgee , or Thunderbolt of Indra , jesting on a carved stone pedestal . Thousands of pilgrims from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Buddhists . THE NEPALESE EXCEL IN METAL-WORK The art of the Nepalese , or , properly speaking , the Newars , is worthy of special consideration . It was the Newars who brought art to its highest state of perfection , and their influence has extended through these hills into Sikkim , Bhutan , and Tibet . Indian influence has penetrated from the south with the advance of Buddhism and has spread through the hills , along the Brahmaputra Valley . to Lhasa . On the other hand . Chinese influence is also strong and there has been intercourse with that country for many centuries . Nepal probably excels in metal-work and wood carving , though followed very closely by Sikkim , Bhutan , and Tibet . In their architecture , the Newars have distinctly drawn upon China , as shown in their pagoda-shaped temples , while in Sikkim , Bhutan , and Tibet the buildings suggest an even earlier period , possibly that of Egypt . In their metal-work all these countries follow the same method . For beatenwork , the metal employed , whether copper , brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required thickness , then shaped on a mold made of lac . It is then  | rubbed over with wet clay , leaving a thin layer on the surface . On this the pattern is drawn or scratched and then hammered with various home-made instruments till the required relief is obtained . If the relief is to be high , the filling is removed from the metal and the process continued on the back , again turned , and the final finish put on . When gilding is required , an amalgam of gold and quicksilver is placed on the baser metal . The quicksilver is burned off and the deposit of gold is burnished with an agate . ' The Nepalese combinations of copper or brass with silver are very fine , the salient parts in the silver often being picked out with gold . PREPARING MODELS FOR METAL , CASTING In the work of casting , a model is made of wax and first thickly coated with a mixture of clay , cow dung , and charcoal . When the first coating is dry a second coating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied , to give the required stability . The wax is then melted out and when the mold is perfectly dry the molten metal is run in . Some very excellent results are obtained , the detail and delicacy of pattern being wonderful . These methods are used for building ornamentation and altar utensils as well as for articles for domestic use . Some excellent weapons , especially the kukri , a knife worn universally by the Nepalese , are made , and the better specimens are often chased and inlaid with gold . They also make good koras , or sacrificial knives . Nepalese wood-carving is extraordinarily beautiful and ornate . Every scrap of wood is carved in some manner ; the struts upholding the eaves of shrines represent satyrs and dragons , while windows and doors are examples of the most elaborate and minute workmanship of every  | conceivable design . The verandas and overhanging balconies are highly ornamented and the work on some of the pillars is very bold and striking . In weaving , the natives are deficient , the only cloth made being a coarse cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sikkim excellent metal-work is produced . The Sikkim wood carving is also good , but not comparable to that of Nepal . The Bhutan metal-work is excellent , especially the swords , the wrought iron being hammered out after each of a succession of Heatings and reheating in charcoal and eventually becoming a mild steel . These weapons are sheathed in most artistic silver and gold scabbards . Some of the dagger sheaths are made of beautifully worked and pierced silver , with dragon patterns running through and beneath the open-work . BHUTANESE SKILLED IN CLOTH-MAKING The Bhutanese also make excellent cloths , both of cotton and silk fabric , and many of them are of exceptional quality as well as artistic design . Their woodcarving is on the same lines as that of Sikkim . The teapot ( see page 278 ) is an excellent piece of work and came from Lhasa . It was part of the property of the late Regent , who was in power when the present Delai Lama came of age . He was detected in using evil spells against the Delai Lama , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thrown into the Kychu River , his possessions being confiscated and sold , and the writer was lucky enough to obtain some of the articles , including this teapot . The feudal system , which has prevailed among these hills for many years , is in a measure responsible for much of the artistic work of the natives , for it enables a man to put his whole energy into his work . He has no care about food or housing ; it is to his master 's and his own advantage to produce the most artistic work possible . Time is of no account and he has no occasion to work at high pressure or to work when the spirit does not move him . All this tends to the creation of objects in which the artist can put his individuality . The early history of Nepal is obscure and the outer world had but few relations with it prior to 1767 . NEPAL INVADED BY THE GURKHAS In that year the Gurkhas , who claim descent from the Rajputs , a fighting race in northern India , invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newar Rajah of Nepal appealed to the Rritish for assistance . His prayer was granted and Captain Kinlock was despatched to his assistance in command of a small military force . Unfortunately , he commenced his journey in the rainy season , and fever attacked his men and himself to such an extent in the Terai , always notorious for its unhealthful conditions . that he was compelled to return , and the Newar dynasty , unable to withstand the warlike Gurkhas , was extinguished . In 1792 , after the Gurkhas , now firmly established as the ruling people , had plundered the temple of Digarchi in Tibet , the Chinese sent an army to punish them ; and this they did to such good effect that the Nepalese were obliged to conclude a treaty with the Chinese general within a few miles of their own capital . In order to commemorate this victory of the Chinese over the Nepalese , a pillar was erected in Lhasa , where it still remains . In 1814 , after much provocation on the part of the Nepalese , who laid claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them by the East India Company , and at its conclusion , in 1815 , the Treaty of Segowlie was signed and Brian Hodgson was appointed to be the first Resident at the Nepalese Court . MOST OF NEPAL 'S MAHARAJAHS DIE SUSPICIOUSLY YOUNG From this time onward , as it doubtless was before , had we known about it , the history of Nepal is one long chronicle of bloodshed and treachery . The different factions , each desirous of obtaining power and equally callous as to the means used to obtain it , stopped at nothing . The post of Minister to the Maharajah was eagerly sought , the Maharajahs being ,   even to the present day , mere puppets in their ministers ' hands . Most of them die suspiciously young and before they can take the reins of government into their own hands . Internal intrigues and persistent hostility on the part of the Gurkhas toward the British Government continued till the Year 1846 , when Jung Bahadur , a remarkable man , became Prime Minister , a post he retained till his death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative peace , and after his visit to England in 185o the bearing of the Nepal Durbar became more friendly . In 1854 the Nepalese again invaded Tibet , and shortly after a treaty was concluded by which the Tibetans agreed to pay Nepal an annual sum of R 100,000 ( $33,000 ) , but hostilities in a minor degree were carried on till 1883 . At the time of the Indian Mutiny , in 1857 , the Nepalese rendered great assistance to the British Government , and as a reward the whole of the territory in the Terai , forfeited in the war of 1814 , was restored to them . HUNTING GROUND IOR ROYALTY In 1876 the Prince of Wales , afterward King Edward VII , visited the Nepal Terai on a shooting expedition and was entertained by Jung Bahadur 's brother , General Dhir Shamshere Rana Bahadur . After Jung Bahadur 's death there were the usual successional intrigues , some peaceful and some accompanied by much bloodshed , till in 1901 General Chunder Shumsheer Jung Rana Bahadur was appointed Prime Minister . He visited India twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Star of India in 1905 . In 1904 the Nepal Durbar received the thanks of the Government of India for the correct and very friendly attitude adapted during the British Mission to Lhasa . His Majesty the King Emperor visited the Nepal Terai on a shooting expedition in 1912 , after the Delhi Durbar , and had excellent big-game shooting . Sumptuous camps were prepared and roads were made in all directions through the jungle . Nepal maintains a well-drilled and efficient army of about 32,000 infantry and 2,500 artillery , with about too serviceable and 15o unserviceable guns . The Maharajah is not permitted to have any intercourse with Europeans , and should the Resident or any official have occasion to interview him it is always in the presence of some Nepalese official . The Lingdom of Nepal is to be found . between latitude 27 ? 30 ' and 300 north and longitude 80 ? and 88 ? east . In the south it runs for some distance into the plains of India , along the Terai , or flat ground , at the foot of the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of Nepal 's excessive seclusion , the internal administration has remained almost entirely unaffected by European influence or ideas . VALLEY ONCE WAS LAKE In the Valley of Khatmandu itself , called by the natives Nepal , and covering about 300 square miles , are situated the modern capital of Khatmandu and the old and much more picturesque capitals of Patan and Bhatgaon . At some time in the remote past this valley was a lake , and the erosion of the vast accumulation of water must eventually have cut for itself an outlet through the barrier of mountains to the south . Gradually there was left bare the rich alluvial deposit now drained by three rivers ? the Baghmutti , A ishnumatti , and Manchera . These rivers have cut deep channels , through which they make their way till , converging in a narrow gorge , they finally find their outlet to the plains of India as the Baghmutti . This old lake bed forms an expanse of the most fertile soil , industriously cultivated from end to end , on which is grown a succession of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand down the tale that the valley was in early days filled with water , and attribute its drying up to the miraculous power of one Manju Sri , of whom it is related that he smote the mountain with his sword , thus making the cutting by which the lake was drained and the valley became fit for habitation . The population of the valley is about 500,000 , of which the town of Khatmandu contains 30,000.
