0UR crusade to bring Long Island within striking distance of Westchester is going ahead by leaps and bounds . Hardly had our first lamentation seen the light of print when word came that ferry service had been begun from Rye to Sayville . Next year , we understand , our time from Mount Vernon to Port Washington will be further reduced by the reopening of the old New Rochelle-Glen Cove ferry , which has not stirred the waters of the Sound since 1921 . Grp r a- , 1.6c ' All this is very cheering and important . To date we have always been able to start at scratch with a motorist and beat him across in a canoe . WE were more than pleased to read that a moving picture called " The Callahans and the Murphys " sent its enraged and discouraged audience out into the night . Just when we had begun to fear that the cinema was good for nothing but to erect cathedrals , it appears that pictures can cause riots along Eighth Avenue and are a Force . We were particularly pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are any Irish here with Irish spunk they 'll follow me cud " Sure that was a grand speech , and to our knowledge it was the first time in history that anyone ever rose in a movie house and shouted anything It gives us an idea . For a long time we have wanted to rise in movie houses and shout : " If there areany members of the human race here with human spunk they 'll follow me out ! " Now , by the grace of St. Patrick , we 're going to no Tr . VEN the tax laws , we note , con -- 12- , spire to put silly old creative work in this prosperous country on a sound production basis . Royalties from the sale of books have been pronounced " unearned income " ? taxable the same as interest on securities . This has already worked vast improvements in Greenwich Village garrets , where writers are installing bird baths and electric lemon squeezers in keeping with their new position in life . Any live American author , however much back rent he owes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the idle rich  --  even though he lacks the riches and the idleness . A real honest-to-goodness writer , like Sinclair Lewis , becomes under the ruling a bloated bookholder , clipping his royalties with a pair of gold-handled shears and paying the government a percentage the darned old Babbitt . What this country needs , really , is a Book Exchange , similar to its Stock Exchange , where all reputable works can he listed . Then , instead of spending a lot of time writing books , writerscould simply issue them , as you issue stock , and there would be no further question about the income being unearned . T " general tendency to hound all large passenger busses from the curbs of Times Square and Herald Square has our nod of approval . With the interurban carriers , the necessity for an adequate union terminal is apparent . A central station should prove economically sound in the long run , and could probably be augmented by short stops at hotel doorways for additional passengers . With the sight-seeing busses , eviction from the busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soliciting business ) means almost certain ruin . Theirs is a catch-penny trade . Furthermore , after a personal tour in one of them , our verdict is that anyone /Int riding in one of them is seeing New York more advantageously no matter what he happens to be doing instead . Change AWESTERNER , arrived in the city last week , sought to look up a friend , an ardent equestrian . Not locating his name in phone book or directory , lie set about the novel task of calling various livery stables to ascertain where his friend kept his horses . He was , we learn , finally successful , but not before he obtained one interesting response from a certain stable on West Twelfth Street . " Is this Hopping 's livery stable ? " he inquired . " It used to be , " said a voice , " but he ai n't in the business any more . He 's a chiropractor on Long Island . " Fiesta A HARVEST festival at the corner of Hester and Elizabeth Streets is not quite the fruitless occasion you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys bearing Roman candles , we marched in the parade for San Giovanni last week , there being no room on the sidewalk . At the statue of the saint , which stood in a gaudy canopy right next door to the Gulden 's Mustard building , the brass band halted , the torch bearers went completely out of control , a cheer arose , and two one-dollar bills were pinned furiously at the saint 's feet . Coins dropped into a nearby plate . Then the parade circled the teeming block and the performance was repeated . Considering that its origin was in Sicilian vineyards , when grapes ripen in late August , this was a sober enough affair . Yet anything Italians do has a Sort of fierce intensity . For a harvest there were only the sprawling pushcarts of the venders  --  and the saint looked beneficently down on red dripping watermelon , strings of nuts , balloons , and wooden snakes that wiggled . The street , thick with concentrated life , responded quickly to the sudden invasion , although to many it seemed a joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menaced the bass drum incessantly ; colored lights flamed from store fronts all along the narrow block ; and far above , the populous fire-escapes of the tenements shone like grand balconies in the strange glow of the torches . The saint was quickly forgotten . From a platform the band played hits of opera , while directly beneath , clear against the dark swaying crowd , a white mouse soberly looped the loop for the fortune teller . Squalor became subdued in the majesty of music . In a lighted window , framed by two growing plants , the head of a beautiful young Italian girl appeared for an instant  --  white skin , fiercely black hair ? like the pictures you see . In the East Side is the sort of beauty that exhausts you . Authorities have objected , we learn , to all this fuss being made over San Giovanni . In former years the festival has been rather more vigorous . The Society of which the saint is patron has agreed that this year 's celebration shall be the last . No Sale DESPIDESPITE our warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone recently returned travellers with offers of the real stuff just off the ship . Not always , however , do they show careful discrimination in culling the names of prospective victims from passenger lists . Not long ago a gentleman received a phone call at his offices high up in a downtown building . He was told that if he wanted some genuine Scotch at a reasonable price he had better order quickly . " I got to shove off with the Leviathan , which is due to sail very soon , " said the caller . " And I , " said the gentleman , " am an official of the United States Lines . I note as I look out the window here that the Leviathan is moving down the river now , as per schedule . I 'm afraid you 'll have to hire a motor-boat to catch her . " The receiver at the other end of the line was hung up hastily . Snappy IT appears that the task of making our Mayor the sartorial triumph he is along Broadway falls on the shoulders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honor . When Mr. Walker left for abroad , Jeann was at the pier to bid him and his twenty-five form-fitting suits of clothes bon voyage . For nine years he has personally supervised the Walker coat-vest-pants , and his small shop at Thirty-fourth Street and Fifth Avenue serves frequently as a midtown dressing room for the Mayor when the latter is making a quick change . We have had the good fortune to ANTIQUING ALONG THE POST ROAD meet Mr. Friedman , and after a conference with him are in a position to disclose intimate details about the Mayor 's snappy wardrobe , which , obviously , is important news . The official waistline is 29Y2 an enviable girth . Chest 36 . Legs slim . Suits must be built out , to suggest muscular development . Pants narrow . Inclined to the double-breasted in dinner jackets and dark blues , but the first warm breezes of summer bring a desire for something neat in a one-button sack , possibly a nice brown . Flowered bathrobes , yes . White trousers important , with stripes of varied widths . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An exceptional fine dresser , very partickla . I can make a suit to be very perfect , but Mr. Walker stands in front of the mirror and says , It iss good but it iss not Jimmy Walker . ' And then he tells me how it must be changed . " NE thing his Honor insists upon ON is that the coat shall break correctly at the waist when he leans forward in the throes of after-dinner speaking . Let it break an inch high or low , and the speech is spoiled . Even a smoking jacket for around the house must he quick-fitting . The executive garments are changed always twice a day , sometimes oftener ? which may have something to do with the proverbial executive tardiness . Travelling with the Mayor at the moment are twenty white pique vests , twelve pairs of white trousers with fancy stripes , six sport coats , two top coats , two dress coats , three dinner coats ( two single-breasted and one double ) , something like two dozen dress shirts , countless other shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broom . Other miscellaneous facts which we have upon this important subject follow : all the Walker shirts are made to order , Kaskel &; Kaskel being among the firms frequently favored with patronage . Also the Walker cravats . In these he is regarded as a fussbox  --  they can not be made small enough at the knot to suit him . His shoes are custom built , his shirts size 14 . He never wears a collar button in the back because it bulges the collar out . He wears a watch but no one has ever seen him use it ; wears soft collars , blues and grays preferred ; owns about thirty-five sticks , which are huddled in a corner in one of the rooms of his house ; detests a high silk hat and when he has to wear one usually carries it along in a hat box until the time comes to appear in it ; never wears knicker-bockers ( legs unsubstantial ) ; changes cigarette brands from day to day , at present smoking No-Harm ( nicotineless ) ; sel-dom wears a scarf pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All told he takes clothes pretty seriously and it is no wonder that we heard a young lady exclaim after a certain parade , " Oh , I hardly saw Lindbergh at all , the mayor was so beau-ti ful . " Traffic Court THE traffic officer at Broadway and Forty-third Street is hereby cited for judicial calm , tact and presence of mind under fire . Not only was traffic very heavy , but a nasty rain was beating in his face when he was approached by a bareheaded woman and an Italian umbrella mender with all his paraphernalia . They were both excited . The woman explained that the man had her umbrella and would not surrender it . The man waved the umbrella under the officer 's nose and asserted that the woman would not pay the repair charges . The officer parried the umbrella , blew his whistle to switch the flow of traffic , and took up the matter . " How much do yuh want ? " he asked the umbrella man . " Seventy-five cents . " He turned to the woman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worth more'n fifty , " she said . The officer blew three sharp blasts on his whistle and motioned a wandering cab back into place . " Give him sixty , " said the policeman . The case was settled . Challenge TO begin at the beginning , the fuss about the International Polo team which has been rattling so many teacups on Long Island ( we have it from several who take their polo seriously and have been buzzing about both camps ) is this : The question was whether the American team would be the Big Four that defeated Britain in 1924 , namely Messrs . Milburn , Webb , Hitchcock and Stevenson . Milburn and Hitchcock , as the gods of American polo , were certain of their positions , of course , and the doubt settled upon the other two . When Cheever Cowdin and Guest were named instead of them , there was dissension , inevitably . Webb , said many , should never have been replaced by Guest . Cowdin was perhaps outplaying Stevenson , y c s ( although Stevenson was poorly mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been afraid to remove one veteran without t h e other . It so happened for the benefit of the debaters ( especially for the ladies , who would n't know much about the playing merits ) that college and social ties were brought up . Mr. Stoddard , chairman of the selecting committee , was said to be a Yale man at heart , and Mr. Guest was a Yale man . All this seemed meaningless when it was pointed out that Mr. Webb is also a Yale man . When Webb and Stevenson organized a challenging team , met the reconstructed Internationals and held them to a tie the excitement was n't lessened , of course , and it was n't dissipated when in the second match the Internationals did beat the challenging die-hards . The game was played in a heavy rain which made the outcome seem indecisive . It was soon after this that Messrs . Webb and Stevenson , with a reconstructed challenging team including Strawbridge and Wilkinson of the Army , again met the Internationals , held them even for four chukkers and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE unexpected appearance of Guest and Cowdin in the hlue jerseys of the challengers and Webb and Watson in the white of the Internationals in the fifth chukker was most certainly a sensation and partisans either applauded enthusiastically or grew faint  --  according to how they felt about it . The reconstructed Internationals thereupon roundly beat the reconstructed challengers . The Webb-Stevenson adherents were gratified and the Cowdin-Guest supporters openly critical , pointing out that their favorites played in a brand-new four . They stressed the fact ( rather obvious ) that in the first four chukkers Milburn and Hitchcock were both playing off their game and that Cow-din and Guest were n't using their best mounts because they were saving them for the big match . THE unannounced shift , our ex- perts inform us , had been discussed several nights before at a secret meeting of the selecting committee and had been definitely decided upon at another meeting held during the third chukker . At a subsequent committee conference the wishes of Milburn and Hitchcock were quite frankly discussed . Milburn did not like to play behind Cow-din , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not like to play behind Webb , which did n't make the shift all right . And , of course , it was n't all right with the advocates of Messrs . Cowdin and Guest . So there you are . The situation at the time of this writing may be aptly described astense . The preponderance of opinion seems to be that the selecting committee is facing a difficult situation , a polo tram not being so easy to select as , say , a football eleven , what with house guests , wives and other relatives , social animosities , estates , mounts and many other things to be considered . We have seen much shaking of the head , however , and heard muttering about what will happen to Long Island polo if the invaders win . Poitrhoire RESIDRESIDENTS and ENTS promenaders in Greenwich Vill age have perhaps met with an old gentleman who , we believe , is the only authentic French beggar in the city . Often seen about the vicinity of Washington Square , his invariable approach is " Peale frangais , s'il 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gift of a coin al most always follow , for it would seem that nine out of ten persons about the Village pride themselves on their French and enjoy being indulged in it . The old man 's story is that he was once a fairly prosperous resident of Lyons and was persuaded to come to New York by tales of fortunes made overnight . He brought his wife here and for a time they ran a little restaurant with some success . Then his wife died and the business failed . Her burial took all his funds and for many nights he slept on a park bench . He is noncommittal as to the amount of largesse he receives , but we observed him one day gather sixty cents in a few moments in a book store on Eighth Street . The Rich . SEVERAL persons have told us of a remark said to have been made by one of the Rockefeller scions and we think , therefore , that it may be true . It was at the Rockefeller home in Maine , and the young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you buy one ? " queried her companion . To which the young lady replied , " Who do you think we are  --  Vanderhilts ? " Something we have heard lately , however , makes us believe that the comparison might just as well have been made with the Hearsts . Young Bill Hearst , whose twenty-three years would not , of course , have permitted him to familiarize himself with all his father 's apartments , homes , estates , offices and the like , repaired one evening to the Hearst residence on Riverside Drive with a young man who is musically inclined . Young Hearst 's purpose was , in fact , to listen to some of his friend 's own compositions . They were greeted by the butler . " Where is there a piano in this house ? " asked the son of the publisher . " There 's one on this floor , sir , " replied the servitor , " and also there are pianos on the next floor but one , and on the floor above that . " The gentleman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about William Randolph himself . Itseems that , during Lindbergh 's sojourn in New York , Mr. Hearst instructed two of his aides to isolate the young hero long enough to bring him to the Hearst home . The publisher was most eager to meet him . Lindbergh was finally sequestered after one of the banquets in his honor and agreed to a flying visit to the house of Hearst . There was some misunderstanding , however , and Mr. Hearst was out when the trio arrived . Whiling away his rime while awaiting his host 's arrival , the young aviator admired a handsome silver sphere of rare , early Italian workmanship . The publisher entered the room even as the young aviator was bending over the bibelot . " That 's very pretty , " said Lindbergh , nodding at the sphere , as he was introduced . " If you really like it , please take it as a gift from me , " the publisher responded . Lindbergh accepted . The little present is worth , we are told , $35,000 . Revolt UTE have just learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman of our acquaintance who has been hopelessly bullied by Long Island valets for years . Last Friday , again in the throes of intimidation , he arrived at a certain estate for another weekend . The valet , as usual , inspected the contents of his bag , with just a hint of distress on his face , classified his apparel and asked such disturbing questions as " And the tennis flannels , sir ; where are they ? " It was , as a matter of fact , just after such a question that our timid friend rebelled . A spark of cavalier spirit burst into flame within him . Waiting until the valet 's nose had reached its greatest altitude he said , " Please cease what you are doing and summon me the house secretary . I wish to dictate a postcard . "
