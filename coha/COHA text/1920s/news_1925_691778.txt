They checlt or prevent production , thereby Impoverishing the community ; they take from the people much more than they yield the Government ; they give opportunity for favoritism and tyranny , and they benefit some at the expense of others . If we were to apply these four sane principles of taxation to the coal lands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , wages and profits would both rise and the only sufferers would be the men who charge an annually increasing toll for giving mere permission to labor and capital to employ themselves .
