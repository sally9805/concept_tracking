An example set by Jesus Christ was followed , last week , by their Most Catholic Majesties , King Alfonso and Queen Victoria Eugnie of Spain . <P> As a preliminary they summoned to the Royal Palace in Madrid a starveling rabble of beggars from among whom were chosen by lot 13 men and 13 women . Soon the lucky 26 had their feet washed . Queen Victoria Eugnie laved the feet of the women . King Alfonso attended to the men . <P> Thus was symbolized the act of Christ in washing the feet of his Apostles . As recorded by Apostle John , * the procedure of the Savior was as follows : <P> He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel and girded himself . <P> After that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples ' feet and to wipe ( them ) with the towel wherewith he was girded . . . . <P> So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done to you ? <P> Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am . . . . <P> Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him . . . . <P> A new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . . . . <P> Though Their Majesties did not gird themselves with towels , last week , they were deemed to have imitated acceptably an act of greatest sanctity . The day annually observed in this manner by Spanish sovereigns is Maundy Thursday , so-called from the Latin mandatum ( commandment ) referring to the " new commandment " given by the Savior . <P> <P> *St . John XIII : 4 , 5 , 12 , 13 , 16 , 34.
