txt Declaration is probable of a stock dividend of at least 100% on the common stock of Crucible Steel Co. , at the meeting of directors in Pittsburgh , March 16 , according to an interest in the company . Decision of the United States Supreme Court that stock dividends are not subject to Federal income tax , has removed the last obstacle to the proposed Crucible stock dividend declaration . Stock to the amount of 2000 of the $25,000,000 common now outstanding is , available for dividend purposes , as a result of the $50,000,000 common authorization a few weeks ago . It was announced at that time that the new stock was for dividend purposes . It is possible that the entire unissued authorization may not be devoted to stock dividend purposes at this time , although there is. nothing to prevent such action if approved by the board . In the event of the expected stock dividend declaration , a readjustment of the cash dividend on the common will be in order . Whatever the amount of the stock dividend , it is confidently predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 12% , now being paid annually on the junior issue . That is , in event of a 100% stock dividend , the double amount of new common would be placed on a regular dividend basis of better than 6% . Both current and prospective earnings of Crucible warrant an increased dividend rate . Net available for common in the fiscal year ended August 31 , last . was in excess of $31 a share . Earnings the first quarter of the current year were at a higher rate than in the 1919 period , it has been officially stated , and business of the company is now at capacity , with much demand that can not be given consideration . In the five years ended August - 31 , last , Crucible earned about $170 a share on its common stock , after all charges and preferred dividends , according to the annual reports . From this there was distributed but the initial cash dividend of 1%% , declared last July . Crucible is just completing a blast furnace and by-product coke plant that will make it self-contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materially reduce the production cost of that product . Completion of these units virtually ends the Crucible plant ex-enSion program for the time being , thereby cutting off a drain of about $500,000 a month . However , the favorable stock dividend decision merely hastens the speed with which the disbursement will be made . Even though it had been adverse , a stock dividend would have been paid , but the disbursement would have been scattered through a longer period , in order to lighten the income tax burden on the larger holders .
