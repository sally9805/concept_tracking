The Honduran Civil War ( TIME , Feb. 11 et seq. ) was reported to be getting worse , but no definite news was obtainable , except that at Tegucigalpa , the capital , disorders were rife and threats were made against foreigners and foreign property , even against the American Legation . <P> At La Ceiba , the American Consulate was fired upon and forced loans were levied upon foreigners . The U. S. Government , which a fortnight ago severed diplomatic relations ( TIME , Feb. 25 ) , announced that Rear Admiral Dayton had landed 35 marines from the U. S. S. Denver to guard the Consulate and protect American lives and property . Later , it was announced that the U. S. Destroyer Billingsley had been sent to Honduran waters to Puerto Cortes , where American life was said to be endangered , as Admiral Dayton thought it inadvisable to withdraw the Denver from La Ceiba.
