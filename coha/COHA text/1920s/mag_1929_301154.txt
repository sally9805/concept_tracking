Two months ago the Amateur Athletic Union sent out some invitations with 5 stamps on them . There were five of them , addressed to the governing athletic bodies of Germany , France , Italy , England and Finland , asking 14 of the greatest runners in Europe to run in the U. S. this winter . Half-miler Tavernari and long-legged Hurdler Facelli of Italy , Joachim Buchner and Harry Storz , the German quarter-milers , and Sprinter Eldracher were asked . Among Finns , the invitations went to Harry Larva and Toivo Loukola , but not , for some reason , to Paavo Nurmi who , tinkering with an old automobile in his machine-shop in Turku , shrugged his shoulders and looked hard at his work when reporters asked him whether it were true that he had been feeling sick lately . Meantime , last week , down a gangplank in Manhattan strode another athlete who had received no invitation-Stanislaw Petkiewicz of Poland . <P> Prosperous and slender , with light hair , big eyes , the hollow cheeks common to runners and the round skull common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense . Runners who are being paid for by some club may only compete for 21 days , but Petkiewicz may stay as long as he likes-long enough to get used to board tracks , on which he has never contested . He studies law in the University of Warsaw . He wears a conventional grey coat , carries a sable to put on when the wind is chilly . He holds every Polish middle-distance record from 800 to 10,000 metres and last summer beat Nurmi at Warsaw , letting him set the pace and then , as others have done , passing him in the last hundred metres . In London last July he tried to beat all the best Englishmen the same day ard nearly did it . Beavers beat him at four mile and Cyril ( " The Great " ) Ellis at a mile , principally because proud Petkiewicz tried to keep ahead of all competitors throughout each race , wasting his strength by sprinting against runners who would be used up a little further on . This was not the cool policy of Nurmi , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of scorn for human competition and because he can not or does not like to sprint . <P> Proud Petkiewicz is as yet inexperienced . Although insisting that he came merely to see how U. S. universities taught law , he brought his track clothes with him and immediately presented himself for recognition by the A. A.
