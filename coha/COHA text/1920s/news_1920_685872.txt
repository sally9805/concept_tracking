txt Rejecting the League of Nations as it is framed at present , Senator Harding would unite the nations of the world in an association in which " naitual commercial .. and trade problems may be worked out , " he told an enthusiastic meeting of 20,000 Louisville citizens in the Jefferson County Armory tonight . " I regard such a policy , " he said . " as perhaps the greatest contribution that can be made to create bonds for the maintenance of world peace . I regard such an arrangement , to which I have assurance the other great nations would be willing parties , as one step in a policy of upbuilding our foreign trade . " While Senator Harding did not give the authority for his " assurance " that other nations would accept his proposal , tonight 's speech marked a development of his position in regard to foreign affairs . In his speech of August 28 he proposed a world Court of Justice , modeled after the Root Court and supplemented by an " Association of Natltins for Conference . " Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as diplomatic agreements with the view of preventing future wars . Charges Secrecy in Diplomacy . One reason for American business men not being acquainted with trade conditions abroad , the Senator held , was the Administration 's failure to divulge information it had collected through its diplomatic agents . " It would be difficult to name a time or a place , a year or a &ate,"; he said , " which exhibited more of secret diplomacy . " Senator Harding censured the Administration as not having given American business men warning of the coming of the World War in 1914 , " when the impending conflict was being discussed by European statesmen and diplomatic clerks . " The Senator urged the adoption by the State Department and the Department of Commerce of a ' new policy by which their functions abroad in the matter of obtaining commercial information could not overlap . He suggested as a solution a special department sponsored by both the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce . Speech of Senator Harding . Senator Harding , in his speech here . said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through you to the American people that I stand for the full development of our foreign trade . We look back now upon several years of our national history , when the expansion of our foreign trade , just as the prosperity of our American business , was treated with suspricion , as if in some way It had to do with an oppression of the weak by the strong . But both at home and abroad , in American business and in American foreign trade , it has been Republican policies which have maintained high standards of American honor and American commercial practices , and it has been Democratio policies which have wasted their energies in obstruction and withering interference . " I am not in favor of the Government , whether from benevolent or business reasons , going into the practice of extending loans and credits to support our foreign trade . I am against this because it is outside the function of a wise Government , and because there is less a sense of responsibility upon the part of officials who handle . the taxpayers ' money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to invest in foreign securities . " We can not compete upon equal basis with a country whose people are willing to invest in foreign loans and credits , until the people of America , who can invest , have available the enlightenment and information which will cause them to back up our foreign trade . Wants Big Merchant Marine . " Essential to our upbuilding of foreign trade and to its protection and that of our country in war , is the upbuilding of our merchant marine . " Bondholders and taxpayers of the United States have invested three billions of dollars in new vessels . We now have at our command a greater gross tonnage than any but one nation in the world . r " I am in favor of holding that advantage . I am in favor of the enforcement of the Jones act , which was intended to make it possible for us to hold that advantage . I have no hesitancy in giving full condemnation to the failure of an Administration to put into effect the bidding of Congress . Because America 's foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches the prosperity of every home , there Is a . wide and ? righteous resentment because a the policy , continued during nearly eight years of one administris , tion , and resulting in heaping upon our foreign trade impediments . and neglect . I share that resentment . " First . there is our diplomacy , as it expresses our foreign policies . It has a vital effect upon our ' foreign trade . We have seen a complete failure of the Administration either to gather . or to give . ... to our business men and our people any warning of the coming of the World War . The impending conflict was being discussed by European statesmen and diplomatic clerks , but our own State Department gave the American foreign trade no warning . " Seldom has ens aitermet ion come from the Democratic State Department that did not first reach the American people through the reports of our newspaper correspondents abroad .

" The vacillating and un-American policy which from first to last has comprised every poseible attitude , from active warfare to truculent weedling , has kept us hi the dark as to our future commercial relationships with Mexico .

' We vain find out almost nothing from our Government ea to the conditions , social and economic , in those countries whig need our help anti might furnish us with markets .

Urges Department Change . " ? The Government must serve the people and their interests . That is one of the reasons for its existence . And at the present time its Service can not be efficiently given to r.ss:st in building our foreign trade without a reorganization of our State Department and our Department of Commerce .

" Choler the State Department the Consuls are gathering- trade  --  information , under the Commerce Department the same information may be gathered by the Commercial Attaches . The policy of the Slate Department toward American foreign trade may be one pelitiy , ' and the policy of the Department of Commerce may be another . There must be an early ' Eolutiun of the difficulty . " One possibly plan is to place tinder the State Department the determination of policies , the furnishing of information and the giving of assurance of aid and protection which affects American foreign trade . Another possible solution is that of a special department . : moneored by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce , so that we may efficiently direct all our energies under one definite program . " Favors Adjusting Allies ' Debts . Senator Harding inserted into ' his ores ' pared speech tonight an elaboration upon his ram:irks at Chattanooga last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war debts owed to this country by European nationa . " During the war , " lie said , " we not only sent billions of dollars on our own account . but V:i ; loaneu many millions more to be expended by our allies , and especially- by Great llritain . In addition . we gave outright , by private as writ as public subscriptions , further great sums to relieve the needs or stricken Europe . The latter we gave with a free hand and a free heart and we desire nothing in return except the good-will of those to whom we gave . " The loans , however , stand upon a different footing . Both we and our allies recognize these loans as constituting a legitimate indebtedness , but they are not represented by anything more definite than Ambassadorial notes . i ? Nothing could be further front my desire than that the payment - of these loans should be harshly or importunately enforced . We were all engaged in fighting a common enemy , and in the adjustment of the obligations which were incurred among ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the utmost leniency . Nevertheless . these debts are. - in principle , of the same binding quality as those which were inourred in the form of loans made directly by the people and represented by interest-bearing bonds . The only difference - is that in the one case the money was advanced by our Government after first collecting it from these individual citizens in the form of taxation or loans . " It is not inaccurate to say that the Government in the transaction occupies the relation of trustee to the American people , from whom the money came and . Eke any other trustee . may not surrender their right to repayment without their consent . express or implied . " I take it for granted . therefore . that these debts will sooner or later he funded and paid . 1 feel sure our Allies . : us soon as they arc able , will want to pay them . In the meantime it makes for future misunderstanding ' do have this matter in its present unsettled form . " I shall regard it as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of adjusting these ? great debts and putting them in a form where we shall know exactly what to expect , and how and when to expect it . mind our allies will know exactly what they are to meet and how and when they are to meet it . We should do this for another reason : Whatever our allies are finally to pav should he put in the forriclrrif definite obligations bearing a , reasonable rate-of interest , so they may be negotiated and the proceeds used to reduce- our own burdensome debt and thereby decrease the intolerable load of taxation which the American people ore now obliged to bear , and , smite as important , to pay off our enormous floating debt , relieve our banking system from carrying it , and raising funds for the use of legitimate business and bringing interest charges back to a normal rate . " Makes Speeches on the Way . Senator Hardinroarrived here at nightfall after a day of speeches ond- rear aaatroree talks in Tennessee and Kentucky on his way from Chattanooga . Governor Morrow of Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train with n reception committee of Louisville citizens headed by William Hey bu ? The party motored through comparatively deserted streets to the Seelbach Hotel . where a large and noisy crowd was waiting and swarmed around the Harding car . The Senator and Mrs. ' larding were busy shaking hands until the police cleared a  --  a way to the hotel lobby . The candidate and Mrs. Harding dined privately in the hotel before leaving for the armory , where Governor Morrow prestded . Mrs. Marvin H. Lewis introduced the Senator . Senator Harding made three speeches early this morning in Tennessee at Spring City . Rockwood and Oakdale , discussing Americanism and the Cummins-Esch ' Railroad act . , Cahn ' Football Players ' . Coming into Kentucky . Oa scrimmage on the Center College football field a t Danville was delayed for half an hour in the afternoon . when Senator Heir:ling arrived . Three thousand persadhs had ? ssembled on the bleachers and Bolsi watching the team that hopes to beat Harvard and that was unconquered last season . The Kentucky players came to the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator started to speak . As the Senator mounted the platform steps a group of students gave him a cheer , Which was immediately returned front another pert of the field by a. cheer for Cox . There was some commotion in the Cox section when Senator Harding began and he turned his remarks to the opposition group . " Boys , " said he , " I litre for young fellows to he enthtudastic ' about their leader , but I wwit then ' to he Kentuckygentlemen and not insiat on interrupting me . That is all . Leespect the man who has his convictions and I respect my fellow-Americans ... who have other convictions than my own , but when you are a real American you listen to aisles of a case , especially if the one speaking is a candidate for the Pre idency . " Denies Threat of War on Meai ? o . At Somerset , Ky. , Senator Harding said : " Many Democratic speakers arc telling our countrymen everywhere that Republican success means war with jtlexitio . It seems to he a specialty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it during the campaign . Tile Republican Party is not a war party , though we did insist on fighting- vigorously and with all our resources aftee we were involved in the great world conflict . " L ; tit this taznpaign scare will not deceive America a second time . The policy ( if tin. ? present Administration , through distrust in Mexico and through humiliation at home , will be quickly reversed when we come into power . but instead of war it will bring confidence . respect reeltranquillity . " Mexico understands the Republican Policy its do Americans who are more intimately concerned with our Joelationship with the sister republic . We never intend to tell them who shall govern there  --  that is Mexico 's own Maur . We only mean to say as neighbors and friends we warat to extend a helping hand . when invited so to do ; that we a.sh .. nothing except the protection of Ameoican lives when rightfully in Mexican territory and the protection of American property which is rightfully owned there . We ask that of Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean war : that means the Golden Rule of international relationship , the respect tor the rights of Americans which dwe mean to give to all other nationalist in the world . " " There are many things of interest in the campaign . " Senator Harding na to a crowd of SOO at/Oneida . Ky. , " but a can not hope to talk to you , about them all . I hold in my hand , . for illustration , a copy of the Treaty of Peace with Germany and the League of Nations Covenant . " " That 's some book in size , " exclaimed a man in the crowd . " I got it out this morning . " the Senator continued , " because I noticed in morning papers that the Democratic candidate for President and some of his ardent supporters are insisting triat the covenant shall be printed and made available to all America . " Well , the President so interwove the covenant into the treaty that you would have to print all of it and even then if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both French and English . because it was so written . I do not object to the , ? rinting of it . I I wish it might be in the hands of all Americans if they would only read it . but . somehow I suspect you would be better satisfied if you just had one little section of it . and I will read that to you front the official text . " And Senator Harding read Article X. of the covenant . " That is the heart of the covenant , " lie went on . " That is the pledge of America to give its boys to the maintenance of the existing territorial boundaries of the world . And , speaking for the Republican party , I ant opposed to it for the United States of America . ) fonts War Over . Monroe Doctrine . " Then there is another phase that . maybe , you ought to have printed in both languages , and then all you boys and girls would have to study French to Understand , because curiously enough , if it interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English text says another thing . For the benefit cf us Americans who believe in the good old Monroe Doctrine of AllICriCa dominating the affairs of the New World as they concern us the covenant says : Nothing in this covenant shall he deemed to affect- the validity of international engagements , such as , treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe Doctrine , for securing the maintenance of peace . " That is the English text that we are supposed to follow , but the French text says : International engagements , such as treaties of arbitration and regional understanding 's like- the Monroe Doctrine , which assure the maintenance ' of prier are not considered as incompatible with any of the provisions of the present peace . " So you take your choice . I prefer the English text , but if we enter it without an understanding we will have to go to war to determine which is right . And I believe in safety first , my countrymen . " Senator Harding will leave here tomorrow for Indianapcilis , where he will speak tomorrow night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
