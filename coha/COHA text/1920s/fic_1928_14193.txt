ON a late afternoon in summer the Sunday School picnic from Little Bethel Church is nearing an end . Children are playing their last game of hide-and-seek in the woods close upon the grassy slope of a gently descending hill . Their home base is over there where the tops of three or four tall post-oaks and water oaks mark the sudden declivity of a spring ravine . Now and then a country child , calling to his fellows , rushes across the slope . In the background a haphazard worm-fence enclosing a pasture straggles in from the right , crossing the hill and disappearing through a thick growth of old-field pines , sassafras bushes and underbrush at the left rear . The fence is half-hid at the back with a hedge of plum bushes and trumpet vines in full bloom . Beyond and across a field heavy with ripening corn the sun , red as an angry eye-ball , is setting behind a low wall of cloud . In the immediate foreground is a large mossy boulder with a mark on the earth running back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is torn and scuffed from the children 's recent game of stealing pawns . Down in the depths of the pasture a farmer is heard calling his hogs . He calls softly , for it is on a Sunday , " Whoa  --  ah , pig ! Who-ah , pig ! " The two teachers come up the hill from the spring . MISS CHARLOTTE Somewhat prim and nearing fifty . They 've had a nice day , have n't they ? And we have too . p. 3 MISS ANNIE Considerably younger and somewhat plump . Seems a shame to make em stop to eat supper . MISS CHARLOTTE But I reckon they 're hungry by this time . And see , the sun is setting for bad weather . MISS ANNIE Rain on a picnic day or near it . Yes , they ought to be out of the woods . Calling . Chil  --  dren !

MISS ANNIE Oh , no , it 's all right of course . She just feels good . She smiles at MISS CHARLOTTE . Chil  --  dren ! p. 4 MISS CHARLOTTE Come along ! MISS ANNIE There 's Nancy 's brother out there and that Ethel child . Come on , chil  --  dren ! MISS CHARLOTTE They 're a job to look after , are n't they ? MISS ANNIE Oh , I do n't mind it so much . MISS CHARLOTTE One picnic a summer is enough . No , I do n't mind it , but still  --  MISS ANNIE Looking at her straight .

Let 's go lay out the supper . Everybody come on up the hill ! We did talk some about things down at the spring . ED ROBERTS comes down along the fence at the rear . MISS CHARLOTTE Please do n't think I wanted you to tell me . Sighing . I 'd be glad . MISS ANNIE Well , everything 's so strange . Also sighing . Nothing 's settled of course . Timidly . We were talking  --  Her voice trails off. p. 5 MISS CHARLOTTE Good evening , Mr. Roberts . ROBERTS Awkwardly . Good evening . He is a nice-looking , well-built man of thirty , but shy and ungainly in his actions . MISS ANNIE A surprise to see you . ROBERTS I  --  yes I do n't go around much . Fooling with his hat .

MISS CHARLOTTE That 's about the first time I 've ever seen him dressed up and away from his farm . MISS ANNIE Mr. Copeland  --  Anderson  --  said he was at Nancy 's party last night . MISS CHARLOTTE Umh . MISS ANNIE He 's about the loneliest person I ever saw . Another man with all his land would be  --  be different . MISS CHARLOTTE Nancy  --  Regretfully . I was about to gossip . MISS ANNIE What is it about Nancy ? p. 6 MISS CHARLOTTE He wants to see Nancy then . MISS ANNIE He ought to go out with the girls more . He 'd get over his queerness . MISS CHARLOTTE Let 's go spread supper . MISS ANNIE Nancy , come bring the children on ! A VOICE All right m ! They go off up the hill to the right .

Aw , but come try to ketch me . NANCY We got to stop now . FLOYD Whining . We wanter play some more  --  jest a little bit more . p. 7 NANCY Tell em all to come up here and maybe you can play another game of stealing sticks . FLOYD Dashing off . Come on , everybody , we 're gon na steal sticks ag'in ! After a moment , ED ROBERTS comes in at the rear and stands watching her . NANCY glances stealthily behind her and begins folding her handkerchief aimlessly back and forth across her knees . ROBERTS How 're you today ? NANCY Laughing softly . All right , I reckon , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS All right . Presently . What you laughing at ? NANCY Turning and looking at him . I wa n't laughing . He stands awkwardly before her , rolling and unrolling his hat in his hands . Maybe it seemed funny to see you at a foolish picnic . Suddenly embarrassed . I was just a-laughing . ROBERTS Throwing his hand out with an ungainly gesture . Seems funny to me . NANCY Thank you , thank you for coming to the party last night . p. 8 ROBERTS Staring around at the sky . I liked some of it . Fruit-basket I reckon you called it . I was glad to come . NANCY Doubling over with laughter and yet watching him closely . I just about sat in your lap once in the scramble . ROBERTS I do n't mean  --  well  --  I du n no . He continues staring at the heavens . Sorry I had to leave so early . NANCY That was all right . The sky 's purty at sundown , ai n't it ? ROBERTS Spontaneously . All the time . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hastily . It looks purty nice most of the time . NANCY Standing up . It does ! That 's a purty sunset . ROBERTS Almost gruffly . Yes . NANCY After a long while . How do you like Pa 's crop , Mr. Ed ? ROBERTS Fine Sure  --  anything . He works hard , you do too  --  he 's a good farmer . NANCY He gets discouraged sometimes . Timidly . You see you never tell him one way or the other . p. 9 ROBERTS Great goodness ! NANCY We never had such a good crop in Georgy , not the twenty years we stayed there . ROBERTS His crop 's good . You might keep the dikes built up a little better . NANCY I 'll tell him . ROBERTS In alarm . I 'm not finding fault .

ROBERTS I do n't understand all this . p. 10 NANCY I thought once or twice you looked like you were ashamed to be there . Looking directly at him . That 's what I mean . ROBERTS Lord a-mercy ! NANCY In a low voice . I do n't mind being poor , Mr. Ed . I mean it do n't make me feel bad . ROBERTS Starting forward . Great goodness , you must be crazy . Foolishly . No , I mean you 're wrong . He eyes her in perplexity a moment and then turns and goes off towards the fence at the rear as the children come pouring up the hill . NANCY Starting after him and then stopping . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dozen or more boys and girls come pushing and scrouging in , squealing and arguing with one another as they near the game 's line . Among them are JESSE NELSON , NANCY 'S brother , the ETHEL child , a girl of fifteen and FLOYD ANDERSON . The children range from seven or eight up to JESSE who is the largest . Some of them are buoyant and light-footed , others thin , undernourished and toil-worn , resembling timid little old men and women browned and burnt by slavery in the fields. p. 11 CHILDREN Le 's play , le 's play ! JESSE Let Nance be the empire . NANCY Business like . Let everybody get on the side they were before . The children arrange themselves on either side of the line , and soon the game begins . CHILDREN Dare you to come over , dare you to come over ! Coward , coward ! We ai n't ! Yah , yah , we got one . A little bent wizened fellow of nine or ten goes across the line and is caughtHah , hah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he takes his place in the prison ring and stares out with the sad reflective eyes of a monkey in a cage . Another is caught on the opposite side . He looks pleadingly across at JESSE . BOY Come git me out , Jesse . See , here 's my hand reached out . After a moment JESSE shoots across the line and seizes a stick , paying no attention to the pleading prisoner . He raises the piece defiantly in his hand . JESSE Now we 'll see who 'll git broke up first . ETHEL I touched him , I touched him ! He 's got to go to jail . JESSE Angrily beating off her hand . You did n't neither . I had the stick first . Nancy , you seen me . I was there first . p. 12 ETHEL Was he , Nancy ? NANCY Who has been looking out where ROBERTS stands gazing at the field of corn . I did n't see it .

CHILDREN ON THE RIGHT You 're bout to git broke up , that 's what makes you so ill . CHILDREN ON THE LEFT Tai n't nuther . But you got ta play fair . JESSE breaks loose from the little girl and marches triumphantly across the line to his party 's nest of sticks at the right . ETHEL Sobbing . He does it cause he 's biggest . He 's a plumb hawg . JESSE Glaring back at the enemy . Do n't neither . I stole it fair . CHILDREN ON THE LEFT Make him put it back , Nancy . NANCY Jesse , put it back and start again . I did n't see that . JESSE Well , where 's yer mind ? NANCY Put it back . CHILDREN ON THE LEFT Yah , yah , yah ! p. 13 JESSE Well , take the old stick then . He throws it sullenly across to them and the game is renewed . FLOYD darts across the line from the left , suddenly stops and hobbles over to the boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NANCY Turning around . Hurt yourself , Floyd ? FLOYD Gulping . Not much . A yell of triumph breaks from the group at the right as one of their number succeeds in stealing a stick . A BOY Come on now , we got em going . A GIRL Smarty , smarty , think you done sump'n cause you got one old stick . JESSE watches his chance and shoots across . But this time ETHEL is lying in wait for him . NANCY She got you , Jesse . With a growl he goes and sits in jail with the sticks . Screams of joy burst forth from the conquerors . MISS ANNIE comes in from the right and goes to FLOYD who is sitting on the boulder picking at his foot . MISS ANNIE What 's the matter , Floyd ? FLOYD I stepped on a old plumb thorn . He manfully tries to keep back the tears . She kneels down on the ground by him and draws back with a gasp. p. 14 MISS ANNIE You 've hurt yourself bad . The game goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaults . FLOYD If Pa 'd come he 'd git it out with his knife . MISS ANNIE hurries off down the hill at the left . NANCY Want me to help you , Floyd ? FLOYD You go on watch em . Pa 's coming and ll fix it . NANCY Smiling . Do n't it hurt you mighty bad ? FLOYD It do n't nuther . CHILDREN ON THE RIGHT Hah , hah , we got two that time ! JESSE From his prison . Some of you let the sticks go and come git me . A LITTLE GIRL I got my eye on you all right . MISS ANNIE comes up the hill and behind her ANDERSON COPELAND , a tall lean-faced man of about forty-five . ANDERSON Dropping down and taking FLOYD 'S foot in his hand . Well , looks like you had bad luck , buster . He takes out his knife and with his thumb against the blade finally extracts the thorn. p. 15 MISS ANNIE Shuddering . My , it 's an inch long . FLOYD Smiling grimly at her . Pshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that same foot and I did n't cry , did I , Pa ? ANDERSON Patting him . Purty brave man . MISS ANNIE Kneeling and wiping the blood from his foot . Yes , you are a brave man . She bends and kisses him . FLOYD His lips twisting . Do n't do that , do n't you . With a wail he suddenly buries his head against her breast . CHILDREN ON THE LEFT Jesse reached out so they could touch him . JESSE I did n't do it , I tell you . The two groups rush pellmell across to each other 's pile of sticks and seize what they can in angry confusion . NANCY moves among them trying to restore peace . ANDERSON Bending timidly over MISS ANNIE and FLOYD . Le 's take him up there to the buggy . MISS ANNIE Give me your handkerchief . She ties up FLOYD 'S foot and they take him off to the right. p. 16 FLOYD I did n't cry bout that thorn  --  I jest  --  jest cried .

NANCY Children , supper 's about ready up at the wagons . BOYS AND GIRLS You said we could play some more , you said so ! A GIRL You said we 'd play King William . BOYS AND GIRLS Yes you did , yes you did ! King William , King William ! NANCY Just a little then . Timidly . Would n't you like to play , Miss Charlotte ? MISS CHARLOTTE No , thank you . She goes off up the hill again . NANCY takes the hand of the child nearest her and the children form a ring around the boulder. p. 17 BOYS AND GIRLS Who 'll be in the middle ? NANCY Reflecting . Oh , well let Ethel be it . She wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the ring and stands on the boulder . The boys and girls then begin marching around in a circle singing , as they watch her expectantly . King William was King George 's sonAnd round the royal race he run , He wore a star upon his breast , &nbsp; &nbsp; Points to the east and points to the west . ETHEL turns along with the wheeling marchers , her eyes picking them over . Go choose your east , go choose your west , Choose the one that you love best . The music is punctuated by snickers and muttered gibes as she bashfully chooses JESSE . If he 's not here to take your part , Choose another with all your heart . He marches sheepishly into the ring and stands with her . Down on this carpet you must kneelSure as the grass grows in the field . They kneel down in shy embarrassment . And when you rise upon your feet , Salute your bride and kiss her sweet . ETHEL suddenly terrified , springs up and flees around the ring with JESSE in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  hee ! A GIRL Ketch her , Jesse , ketch her and kiss her . JESSE overtakes her and after a brief struggle kisses her . Then she takes her place among the marchers , her face burning with blushes , leaving him in the ring . The music begins again . King William was King George 's son  --  ROBERTS turns and leans against the fence looking an . NANCY glances up and sees him , hesitates a moment , and then moves on with a more nervous step . JESSE Spying him and speaking respectfully . Come on play , Mr. Ed . BOYS AND GIRLS As they march and sing . Yes , do , come on ! We do n't mind grown folks , Nancy 's playing . Come on play ! ROBERTS Coming over and standing near the circle . Go on , I 'm too old for that . He stares at them , a smile breaking through his moody countenance .

Shamed ! Down on this carpet you must kneel , Sure as the grass grows in the field . When they arise from their knees JESSE touches the little girl 's hair with his lips and returns to a place next the yellow-haired girl . He bends and whispers something to her . As they pass ROBERTS she reaches out and grasps his hand. p. 19 ETHEL Pulling him . Come on , Mr. Ed. and play . He pulls back a moment and then joins them . BOYS AND GIRLS Mr. Ed 's gon na play . ETHEL Who 'll kiss Mr. Ed ? The children scream with laughter . King William was King George 's son The tiny girl in the center stands confused as the song passes on to the moment of choosing .

The children double over in expectancy . And when you rise upon your feet , Salute your bride and kiss her sweet . ROBERTS stands up , but NANCY refuses to rise . The children let go hands and crowd up in a clamorous gang about them. p. 21 GIRLS AND BOYS Kiss her , kiss her ! Fraidy , fraidy . We dare her to be kissed . MISS CHARLOTTE comes down the hill and stops in the background . ROBERTS With a strained laugh . Stand up , Nancy . But she keeps her head bent down . ROBERTS hesitates a moment and then catching her under the chin bends low and kisses her full on the lips . Several of the boys roll over on the ground squealing with laughter . VOICES He kissed her . OTHER VOICES She kissed him . OTHER VOICES Twict ! A BOY They kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if suddenly exasperated . Everybody come on to supper !

I was surprised to She turns abruptly and goes off after the children . NANCY looks at ROBERTS and then hurries off at the right . Left alone , he sits down on the boulder staring before him. p. 22 ROBERTS Now , my Lord . He starts and seems to be wondering at his own words . NANCY comes quietly back and stands watching him . NANCY Softly . Mr. Ed . ROBERTS Without turning . Yes . NANCY Wo n't you come on ? ROBERTS I do n't want anything , thanky . NANCY Drawing nearer . I 'd ought not to asked you in the ring .

She looks back up the hill a moment and then flings herself down at his feet . NANCY What is it ? p. 23 ROBERTS Drawing back from her . Do n't He raise his eyes and gazes intently at her as if she were gradually undergoing a change before him . NANCY The sombre strength of her face softening into a warm yearning look . What is it ? ROBERTS Go on now , go on . NANCY A soft purring throaty note in her voice . What have I done ? ROBERTS You 've done a lot . NANCY Leaning towards him . Tell me , Mr. Ed . ROBERTS With a sharp malevolent laugh . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling . I do n't know . ROBERTS Leaning over her , his voice coming in a gasp .

She turns her head away with a startled movement and wiggles her feet up and down in her shoes . Once or twice she raises her eyes fleetingly to his and lowers them again . ROBERTS glances stealthily around him , hesitates and then snatches her to him and kisses her . Then he pushes her from him and bows his head on his knees . NANCY looks up at his bowed form , her face a mixture of hurt and triumph . She waits and waits but he keeps his head bowed. p. 25 NANCY Mr. Ed . ROBERTS Hush . NANCY You , you  --  why did you do that ? Please do n't , do n't play like that . ROBERTS Jerking up his head and glaring at her . I ai n't playing ! Laughing . It 's funny ! NANCY Starting .

But there 's nothing to do about it now . She starts to rise. p. 29 ROBERTS Flinging himself down by her with his arms across her knees . Nancy , Nancy , I 'm proud and mean .
