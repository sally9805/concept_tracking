Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall . <P> Most of the outstanding feature pictures of the year , such as D. W. Griffith 's American and Douglas Fairbanks ' The Thief of Bagdad , have made much of mad horse-rides over the scenery . It causes no surprise , then , when Mary Pickford , in her latest vehicle joins the scamper academy of screendom . She plunges ahead in a wild gallop that would do credit to Paul Revere . In fact , suspicion even obtrudes that it is not always Mary herself performing the athletic equestrian feats that are an honor to the Fairbanks family . <P> The picture in indeed a family affair . Lottie Pickford , absent from the screen for several years , plays devoted handmaiden to her sister , while Allan Forrest , Lottie 's husband , portrays the gallant lover who rescues noble Dorothy from the intriguing circle that would marry her off in the approved fashion of historical drama . Mary undertook the play , as she expressed it , to save herself from " being strangled in her own curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful scenes with Clare Eames , who plays her favorite role of Queen Elizabeth with versatile sinuosity , as one born to make history . A resplendent cast help to make this Mary 's best picture , culled from the novel by Charles Major , current standby whenever an array of costumes on the screen is hooked together into a drama . It sags a little at first , but the settings and photography are superb , and Mary looks more beautiful than nature itself . <P> Why Men Leave Home . If you want to be friends with your wife , divorce her . That is the general notion of this screen adaptation for Avery Hopwood 's play , done so well by Lewis Stone , Helme Chadwick and Mary Carr that at times it suggests Lubitsch 's The Marriage Circle . Mr. Hopwood has again used to advantage his favorite device of bringing an estranged husband and wife together in a quarantined house , and for once the obvious tag moral is so well put that it arouses mirth rather than wrath . <P> Between Friends . A rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tellegen is represented as hypnotizing a " friend " ( who stole his wife ) to commit suicide on Christmas eve , and then hypnotizing him out of it , by sheer power of the Tellegen will and smoldering eyes . A high spot is a Greenwich Village ball , in which great fun prevails when one of the revelers spanks the others with a waiter 's tray .
