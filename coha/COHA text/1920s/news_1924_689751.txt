The Plate erally made- to the of gray and white Low Visibility . number plates for automobiles in 1024 is that criminals will use them because , no one can read the figures from . a distance . When 2,480 persons are killed in motor accidents in one year it is obvious that the " low visibility " number plates will aid the speed maniacs , drunken drivers and cowards to escape from the scene of an accident for which they are responsible . It would be proper , of course , to include them among the criminals .

It is that the State Tax Commission , under a rule requiring a different . color ? for plates " every year , " found that all the colors but gray had been exhausted . So it was ordained that gray should be the shade for 1924 . To follow out such logic the State Tax Commission would be baffled in decreeing the color for 1925 . But not so . It has already decided on a staring yellow . Thus the explanation of the . choice of gray for 1924 breaks down . After all , perhaps the story that the low visibility plate matches " somebody 's car " is true . Ca n't the State Tax Commission reverse itself ? Without prejudice to What Every Mr. BRYAN , the Rev.

Fewer fathers are now seen on Sundays wheeling baby carriages ; and from other outward signs , what grave delinquencies may be taking place indoors on their part must be a matter for concern . Necessary as their economic functions are , fathers are too often regarded , and have come to regard themselves , as mere appliances for making money and playing golf on the side .
