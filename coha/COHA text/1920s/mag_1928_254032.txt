Of Sovereigns , temporal or spiritual , the Pope is the least frequent borrower of money . His finances , like his spiritual power , are immeasurable , occult-defying the statistical art . They are also ancient . Aaron of Lincoln , twelfth Century genius of Jewish finance in England , is credited with the initiation of large scale Church financial policy . It was Blount &; Cie. , French bankers , who issued the last Vatican bond offering , in 1886 , when Paris was the money-lending centre of the world . Last week it was the Protestant house of Halsey , Stuart+ &; Co. , of Chicago and New York , who announced a forthcoming issue of $1,500,000 of 5% Vatican bonds whose proceeds of sale will build new buildings for the College of the Propaganda of the Faith on a site of three acres on the Giancialo in Rome . His Holiness Pope Pius XI has shown his particular interest in this novel piece of financing by summoning Cardinal Mundelein and the Right Rev. Mgr . B. J. Shell , both of Chicago , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sail during the week . <P> Unusual features of Church financing concern identity of owner of the physical property against which bonds are issued and the value of the property pledged to secure the mortgage . In this case the bonds will be issued under the name of the Catholic Bishop of Chicago and they will be guaranteed by $80,000,000 worth of Church property in Chicago . The Vatican Treasury will receive the proceeds of sale of the issue , and His Eminence Cardinal Mundelein will receive from the Vatican the sums necessary to pay annual interest and meet the sinking fund which will retire the bonds within 20 years . It is thought that the College buildings will be completed in time for Pope Pius 's golden jubilee of ordination to priesthood , in December , 1929 . <P> Church bond issues are fairly common . Wall Street knows well the 1st mortgage issue of the Holy Sisters of the Precious Blood . The New York market has recently distributed a Roman Catholic Church in Bavaria loan ( $5,000,000 ) , a Roman Catholic Welfare Institution in Germany issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welfare Institutions issue ( $2,500,000 ) . The two last named bond issues were offered to the public within a few days of each other , both by Protestant bankers . The house selling the Catholic bonds published in its formal advertisement that 36% of the inhabitants of the German Reich were Roman Catholics . The house offering the Protestant bonds asserted in its newspaper reproduction of the bond circular that " more than two-thirds " of the German population was Protestant . A prominent Jewish banker who is widely known as one of the first wits of Wall Street calculated the total and remarked at a Bankers Club luncheon : " The problem of German Jewry is solved . We represent minus 3% of the population of the Fatherland . " <P> +Last week Pope Pius XI cabled Harold Leonard Stuart , through George Cardinal Mundelein , the decoration of Commander of the Order of Pope Pius IX . The banker , who is a Protestant , is the only living U. S. citizen possessing this order , the one decoration that the Pope bestows on non-Catholics . Usually it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public men . The late General Leonard Wood received it .
