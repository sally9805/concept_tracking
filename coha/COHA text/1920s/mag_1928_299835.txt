" . . . We deprive . . . him . . . and all his accomplices and abettors of the Communion of the Body and Blood of Our Lord , ... we separate him from the society of all Christians , ... we declare him excommunicated and anathematized , ... we deliver him to Satan to mortify his body , that his soul may be saved on the Day of Judgment . . . . Fiat , fiat , fiat ! " <P> Such , in excerpt , are the authentic words wherewith a Christian may be thoroughly damned by the Roman Catholic Church . But not every Catholic who is excommunicated is damned so wholeheartedly . There are degrees . For example , M. Maurice Pujo , famed Managing Editor of the French Royalist newspaper L'Action Franaise ( TIME , July 4 , 1927 and Dec. 19 ) , was permitted to be married at Paris last week , in the vestry of a Roman Catholic Church , although not long ago he was excommunicated ( TIME , April 9 ) . <P> Lest the damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roped off . But ropes were quickly lowered to facilitate the exit from the Church of a Most Catholic wedding guest , Her Royal Highness , Marguerite de MacMahon , Duchesse de Magenta , nee Princesse d'Orleans , sister of the Pretender to the Throne of France . Apparently the Princess had blundered into the Church , looking for the wedding , which she later attended in the Vestry .
