ARMY &; NAVY <P> <P> They say that every sailor 's got <P> A wife in every port . <P> That 's a dirty lie because <P> He 's nothing of the sort . <P> If a sailor has a wife <P> In every port then take my tip , <P> That every sailor 's wife has got <P> A man on every ship . <P> - Harry Lauder . <P> U. S. Navy men last week adopted a new fashion . To Commander Calvin H. Cobb of the destroyer Billingsley , bound out of St. Petersburg , Fla. , for Philadelphia , came a radio from the police that a St. Petersburg girl was believed to have been smuggled aboard the Billingsley ; please to make a search . Indignant , Commander Cobb searched-and found 15-year-old Cynthia Alberta Pool . She said she had been persuaded to go by a seaman named Kramer ; that a married woman of St. Petersburg had planned to go too but was prevented by her husband , who appeared on the dock at the last moment . <P> Seaman Kramer was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayport , Fla . She said she would have jumped overboard if she had known her father would hear about it . They locked her up in a boarding house until the father came . Meantime , Commander Cobb sent a radio to Rear Admiral Frank H. Clark , commanding the destroyer force of the Scouting Fleet . Commander Clark and his ships had just left New Orleans , bound for Atlantic Coast ports . <P> A search of Commander Clark 's own flagship , the Concord , and of the destroyer Sands and the repair ship Dobbin , discovered four more baggages . They said they were Billy Lacer , Rose McQuire , Flossie Rice , Ramilda Avery , " waitresses from Philadelphia . " They had been sneaked aboard at New Orleans . Commander Clark led his ships into Key West . The waitresses were disembarked . Courts martial began . <P> On other U. S. men-of-war , bluejackets experienced successive waves of wonder , envy , anger , relief . In Washington , Navy officials were shocked , embarrassed , furious . Secretary Wilbur , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 15-year-old 's father , asking how such things could happen . Since Navy tradition mentions only a wife in every port and none on shipboard and the regulations say very little about human nature , there was nothing that Secretary Wilbur could say beyond expressing regret . <P> It is well known that Secretary Wilbur likes to think of his bluejackets as a fine , clean-cut lot of Christian sailors who would never think of smuggling girls or women aboard ship , even as a " prank , " especially after ten days of shore leave in the Gulf ports . Five years ago , when a seagoing girl was found on the battleship Arizona between New York and Panama , Secretary Wilbur was shocked , embarrassed , furious , and a dozen sailors were court-martialed . Though no announcement was made it was safe to say that last week , as in 1923 , every U. S. Navy ship afloat was carefully searched to ascertain just how prevalent girl-stowing had become .                  @ @ @
