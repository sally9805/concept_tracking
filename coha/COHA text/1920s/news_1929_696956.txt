txt Although Ford Motor Co. has not issued its production figures for November , trade estimates place the Ford total for the month at around 110,000 units as compared with 115.000 units produced by all other manufacturers . This estimate indicates that production of the Ford Motor Co. for the first time this year was less than in the corresponding month of the preceding year . It also indicates that Ford 's output represented close to 50% of the total production of the industry during the month and emphasizes the increasing percentage of the business which Ford has obtained during the last half of 1929 . Current estimate on production compares with Ford 's reported total production of 177.483 in October and is slightly more than half the record month 's output of 205,634 units in August . Other manufacturers last month showed a decline from 217.051 units in October . While the Ford figures have fluctuated sharply during the past five months , the production of other manufacturers has shown a steady decline for the period . Their November total was equal to only 35% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raised During the past five months . output of the motor industry has been 2,079,490 units , with Ford 's output of 850.927 units 40.9 , C of the total . The output of other manufacturers totaled 1.228.563 units , equal to of the total . In the first six months of the current year . output of the industry was 3.411,761 units , in which Ford accounted for 1,070.070. or 31.32 , while other manufacturers accounted for 2,341,691 units , or In the following table , total production divided between Ford and other producers during the past five months is shown : Ford Motor Co. will close the current year with production of around 2.000,000 units , or 1.200.000 units greater than in 192S . This gain alone is greater than the total increase to be shown by the motor industry in its record per- formance of the current year , since automobile production for the industry Is estimated at close to 5,700,000 units against 4,601.141 units last year , a gain of between 1,000,000 and 1,100,000 units . What Will Be Ford 's Share In 19305 The comeback of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor market and , on recent performance , Ford looms as the great uncertainty in the 1930 market . Predictions now are heard that Ford will take 50% of next year 's output in the industry , With indications that the industry as a whole will produce fewer cars next year , this would mean a sharply contracted market for other producers . In the current year Ford 's proportion will be around 35% . However , the forecasts of a higher percentage of next year 's output for Ford do not find unanimous support among keen observers of the trends in the industry , notwithstanding that the current Ford performance lends some substance to the predictions . In such quarters it is argued that the chief stimulus to the Ford businoes this year has been a deferred replacement demand in the lowest price field which followed the Ford suspension of production In 1927 and limited production during the greater part of 1928 . There are indications that practically all of this demand has been met and that the Ford volume next year will depend largely upon a normal replacement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a more normal competitive relationship between Ford and other producers will exist during 3930 than during recent months and that Ford 's percentage of the business for the year as a whole will not exceed that shown during the current year .
