In the Dominion of Canada there is a large corporation which last week was planning to spend some $5,000,000 on two hotels in Canada , and to build a new hotel in London , England . This corporation has also let contracts for an Atlantic liner , Empress of Britain , and a Pacific liner , Empress of Japan , the two ships to cost nearly $20,000,000 . It owns some 140,000 miles of telegraph wire , distributes millions of young trees ( gratis ) to Canadian farmers , has settled more than 55,000 immigrants on more than 30,000,000 Canadian acres , and operates a traveling school that brings education into sections of Ontario in which little red schoolhouses have not as yet been established . Yet this corporation is not primarily in the hotel , the steamship , the agricultural or the pedagogic business . It is a railroad company , which operates more than 20,000 miles of line , thousands of miles more than any U. S. railroad. * Known on the Manhattan Stock Exchange by the symbol CD , it is more generally referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line running from Montreal to Vancouver , with the extent of its entire transportation system , including its Atlantic and Pacific fleets , best indicated by the fact that it has a contract with the British Empire to carry mail from Liverpool to Yokohama , the Canadian Pacific might well advance a claim to " world 's greatest " railroad . Its neighbor and chief competitor , the government-controlled Canadian National , has 22,000 miles of line , but Canadian National 's mileage is perhaps too great for its own good and only the rare vigor and ability of U. S.-born Henry Worth Thornton ( TIME , Jan. 28 ) has lifted Canadian National out of the annual deficit class . No deficit problem has Canadian Pacific . In 1928 it showed a net operating income of over $51,000,000 and net earnings of over $48,000,000 . Its common stock earned $15 a share . Canadian Pacific has a 1929 high of 267 ? , is thus selling at 17.8 x earnings . U. S. railroads traditionally sell at around ten times earnings , but in Canada there is no Interstate Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings on its investment . In addition to its extra-railroad activities , Canadian Pacific has asked the Dominion Parliament for authority to construct 1,200 miles of branch lines and expects to build some 465 miles during the present year . Expansion plans centre around the Saskatchewan district and may result in a " war " with Canadian National which has considered the Saskatchewan territory as particularly its own . Should hostilities result , the Canadian Pacific has assets of about one and a quarter billion dollars .
