Curious things happen to wings in certain positions , owing to such demoniac conflicts as those of suction on the upper surfaces and pressure on the lower . The adjustment must be delicate or nose-dives and involuntary tailspins result . Slotted areas in the wing , allowing air to pass through , seem to have a kindly , stabilizing effect . Thus aviation 's newest safety device is called the wing slot . Technical journals still use " probably " and " theoretically " in referring to it . <P> Charles Lanier Lawrance , famed designer of the Wright Whirlwind motor ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) was piloting an Avro-Avian above and about Curtiss Field . With him rode J. B. Taylor , vice president of Air Associates , Inc. , owners of the plane . Violent air currents bowed the ship 's head . It shivered , dived . As it came to earth it straightened out automatically , damaging only the landing gear . Experts attributed this salvation of the flyers to the slot .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
