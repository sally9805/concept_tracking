England the people sing a half-comic , half-sorrowful song , of which I remember only two lines : There may be intermediate situations between ugliness and grayness , but , on the whole , these two lines do express the preoccupation that all must face , that should weigh on every man and every woman ? we must grow old ; can we do it gracefully ? That is certainly an important pur suit , and , though I can not entirely in dorse the view of a Russian friend of mine who tells me that there are no ways of living , but only ways of dying more or less successfully ( a very Russian remark ) , we must certainly accept that one day we must pass " the shadow-line . " I half forget what Mr. Conrad meant by the shadow-line , by what symptoms lie recognized the passage , but I think he called " shadow-line " the moment in the life of a man when he views the future with , let us say , a certain coolness , when for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool . In a sense , a man passes the shadow-line when he discovers that there is a shadow-line , when he ceases to live as a jolly kitten chasing its own tail in default of better toys . One ceases to be young when one becomes capable of conceiving age . That psychological experience can arise from a number of causes , not only from age , for there are babies of sixty , but from sickness , failure , disappointment in a person , disillusion in a cause , from the unexpectedly repul sive sight of oneself as one shaves , or , if one be a woman , from the condition of one 's program at a dance , from the state of one 's engagement-book . For one moment the unkind gods grant us the gift of seeing ourselves as others see us . To my mind , one begins to grow old when one begins to consider the future . One may say , broadly , that youth does not consider the future , but lives in the blazing present . I realize that this - contradicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dreams , the season of hope ; it conflicts with the solemn cliches that may be found even in Shakespeare , a great man , but elementary in psychology ; Shakespeare saw men and women rather too monumental . Or it may be that Sadie in her shirtwaist , her feet incased in patent leather , is a different person from Desdemona . Quite aware that I must prepare to receive cavalry , I assert that youth does not dwell on the future . For a few moments it may dream of careers and weddings , and then , presto ! enters the thing that will happen to-day ? the dance , the gane , the flirtation ? and away , little dream , to the future where you belong . Or youth will stand on the hearth-rug and dilate on the great things it is going to do ? at least that 's what it thinks it does ; in reality , when youth describes the future , it merely asserts its present-personality . It exhibits itself , and enjoys the result . It is more generally accepted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest that age tends to live in the past . Therefore , and almost by a process of elimination , I conclude that it is the middle-aged who think of the future . It is natural enough , for they really have a future , while the aged have none and the young have Lou much . Of course , since in this article I want to speak both of men and women , it is , as usual , dangerous to generalize . Muhlfeld put it very well , speaking of Denise , I " Like all rather clever psychologists , Denise overdid it . " It is awkward to fit a view to seven or eight hundred million people , though , if this can not be done , then the generalization is faulty . Still , one must generalize , and so I will venture to doubt whether women grow older more quickly- than do men . Here I rim counter to another prevalent view , but it ca n't be helped . I suggest that mankind is unduly influenced by a convention which can be summed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man looks like , " which , of course , is nonsense , when we consider the success of movie actors and skating instructors . We have come to think that a man of forty , with very little hair , many artificial teeth , and a. skin like a poeketbook , is a young man , and we go on calling Wm a young man . But he is n't anything of the kind ; he is no better preserved , physically , than the woman of forty of the same class . Only we think it natural that he should have a skin like a pocketbook and we think it abnormal that the woman should have a skin like cr ? pe de Chine that has been frequently dry-cleaned . This leads me to a less revolutionary statement : behind the face hides an individual , a mind ; it is that mind which grows old or stays young . Now , if we consider the average middle-aged woman , her faculty for adopting new ideas , for being converted to new religions , however incredible , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , causes , occupations which may be entirely imbecile , it surely must be agreed that she retains more characteristics of childhood , or , if you like , savagery , than does her solid husband , plodding away at his office , making money with dull enthusiasm , and going to sleep after a day devoid of phantasms . IL is likely that the middle-aged woman is younger than the middle-aged man . She thinks herself very clever , but as a rule she is the baby of the pair , and if it comes to a struggle where one must outwit the other , the man will usually prevail if he puts his mind to anything so futile . If women often beat men at the game of intrigue , it is mainly because men ca n't be bothered ; they 're generally thinking of something else . That is le central point . Most men , when they reach the shadow-line , are infinitely more interested in their ambitions , in their career , in the making of money , than in the quest for love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky , and if they have not passed through it , love encounters formidable rivals . I am sure that this day many lonely women are bitterly saying , " What 's a woman by the side of a career ? " All the same , the instinct to love is not easily suppressed . As a rule , marriage inserts a gag into the blind mouth that cries for passion . Sometimes it goes on crying all the same , but the matrimonial gag suppresses sound ; as a rule , the mouth discovers that its cries are inaudible ; it stops . After a period of good conduct the gag is removed , and the mouth , henceforth , gives vent to the most respectable sentiments . Now and then a mouth rebels ; the gag is torn out at the cost of much mutual laceration . This does not always get into the papers . In general , however , it seems that most human beings reach the shadow-line without undue agony . That is because they do not travel very fast toward the fatal equator . Youthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual effect that most of us fail to realize the journey , and wake up with an awful shock , having to face the coming years in whose shadow we have so long traveled . And yet youthful rapture has for a very long time been subject to , let us say , amendments . One begins absolutely clear that one intends to own the biggest department store in the biggest town . One gets on rather well , but one realizes that capital is not easily found , that subordinates never live up to one 's conceptions , that one ca n't be everywhere at the same time , and that , do what one will , for some obscure and cross-grained reason certain individuals prefer to buy elsewhere . One gets annoyed . One struggles . One fails . One compromises . One gets used to it . One thinks about it no more . One solidifies . Or , if one is a woman , one determines to marry Prince Charming ; he 'll be richer than Rockefeller , wittier than Oscar Wilde , smarter than Count d'Orsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one manages very well with a comfortable house , a husband who in the winter sends one to Palm Beach with the children , and buys new cerise curtains for one 's bedroom . Ambition goes down , for ambition is a passion that feeds on success . If it does n't get its proper dose of triumph , it turns into bitterness . Bitterness thrives beautifully on failure ; when people are thoroughly embittered , the worse time they have the better they are pleased . But most men and women are unambitious . Their main desire is for what they call pleasure . Well , there again the shadow-line has a way of stealing upon us . When I was a small boy I used to buy stale cakes at the confectioner 's , because one got two stale ones for the price of a fresh one . I remember a wonderful fortnight , after a birthday , when I spent exactly five dollars on stale cakes . I think I ate two hundred and eighty cakes ; it was a beautiful fortnight . I could n't buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I readied early manhood , say twenty-five , five dollars failed to buy a fortnight 's pleasure ; they barely covered an evening , which , I confess , was an evening for two . Now ? well , that would be too confessional , but I find pleasure very dear . I have passed the shadow-line ; when one oversteps it one needs a stronger light and must pay for the oil . Lastly , there is love , which up to a certain age is the main diversion of mankind . It is so important that very often ambition , money-making , become its servants ; it may be true to say with the old poet in " Bel-Ami , " that glory is but a means to evoke feminine regard . This strikes one as excessive , glory being a good thing for its own sake , because it increases one 's sense of self-importance . But , all the same , it would be a mistake to think that love entirely ceases to operate in the shadowy realm where dwell the lean years , successors of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion follows a definite course . Thus , round about the twenties we generally find the young man in a state of vague ignorance . He may be slightly informed from the sex point of view , but of love he knows nothing at a11 . He prefers games , ideas , male friendships , and so he is a poor lover . Theyoung woman in the early twenties is a very different creature . She is , as a rule , more awakened to the meaning of love , and though she appreciates pleasures , games , dances , clothes , as much as the young man , they are , as a rule , clouded over by a rosy mist where sometimes she discerns the shimmering pearl of Cupid 's bow . She is inclined to turn her back to his arrows , while the young man criticizes his marksmanship . Round about thirty , the man may know much more about love , if he has been so lucky as to suffer . He has perhaps lived through the first intensity of the sex preoccupation . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more usual , therefore a little duller . He has acquired , or is acquiring , responsibility . He may be carrying upon his shoulders a young woman of the sea ; he is beginning to realize that , however dear , however necessary she may be to him , she is no featherweight . Also he may have given a few hostages to the future . They are delicious little hostages , but they do need boots , and leather goes up every day . So he is settling down , The young woman in the thirties greatly differs . She is much more awakened than she was ten years before ; as a rule she has glimpsed delights , but not grasped them all . She expected rather more than she got ; being little preoccupied with careers , with fame , with the toys that busy her man , she tends to face the shadow-line more precisely . Shrinking away from the idea that " some are getting ugly , some are getting gray , " she sometimes grows frightened , tells herself she 'd better take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period which I call " the second blooming " ; if then she has no children to keep her quiet , she often becomes experimental . Then come the forties , which for most of us are the true shadow-line . A man then generally reaches the most difficult moment of his career . He has , in a way , just " got there " ; it does not matter whether he is a capitalist arranging his biggest merger , or a workman paying the middle instalment to purchase him his house , he is , as a rule , shivering on a razor edge . He has only a year or two to come down on the right side . So it is not Wonderful Iove should then occupy little space in his mind . He has no time . Sometimes , at that age , he does have a second blooming . Forty to forty-five is in man the dangerous age , because he has still time to make a new start , but only just time . At least , in the British divorce courts we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in the first year or about the seventh year , or about the fifteenth year . This means : Obviously bad marriages ( first year ) , second blooming of women ( seventh year ) , second blooming of men ( fifteenth year ) . In women , round about forty , the affair is more formidable , because it holds more despair . The man of forty does not think himself old , but the woman generally does . They are wrong , both of them , but still that is what they think . So the forties , in. women , are generally a grave period . Women then ask themselves whether indeed all hope of love has gone , whether they have not still something with which to charm , and , sometimes , they desperately want to charm just once more . For mankind everything seems to turn on ? just once more . So , in women , the early forties tend to be the age of folly , because women then take that which they can not hold . Men , as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the fifties and sixties . As a rule they are drying up ; their emotions are flowing into other channels , such as an interest in water-colors , social service , or in local politics . The career may still be dominant , but , as a rule , it is less exacting than ten years before , because by that time a man has either made his position or knows that he will never make it at all . In either of these eases lie tends to turn back toward love : if he has made his position , he has time ; if he has failed , he wants consolation . A man of fifty-five or so often discovers romance for the first time , which is another way of saying that he enters the age of folly through which his wife passed ten years before . Sometimes he falls in Jove with a very young girl , who treats him with all the brutal selfishness of the average young girl . ( I mean no harm by this ; she is brutal because she desires things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule the man retains a sense of dignity . This is very finely sketched in The Dark Flower , by Mr. John Galsworthy , where Mark Lennan , attracted to a young girl thirty years his junior , realizes that it can not be ; that it would be unworthy of him and would lower him in his own eyes . As for the woman in the fifties and sixties , she is in a way better off than her old husband , because she really believes herself to be old , while a man doubts that , so long as he can crawl . She has given in . She has long realized that she can never charm again , and has grown so used to it that she has become indifferent ; there lies much satisfaction in surrender . So her sense of romance grows vicarious . She rejoices in the wedding of her children , while often her husband still holds on to youth and is secretly envious when he beholds young lovers . Often he hates them , and to conceal this from himself pours out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I see it , and it is not a pleasant picture , for it exhibits too many people , men and women , still in the grasp of nature . Nature is the greatest enemy of man , and it is the job of civilization to hunt that old demon , half tiger , half muddler , out of the fastnesses of our personality . We nearly all outlive the time of our romance , hold on to our aspiration to love when love no longer beseems our years , when to another we offer as a lure , not greedy youth , but the sagacity of experience or the luster of a name . Or , if we are women , then our technical skill in charming , our reputation as women who have lived , all the artificial charms that tempt because they are artificial . Many of us never know love at all , but many more insist upon maintaining the little god upon our visiting-list , long after he has grown weary of sitting in our old-fashioned drawing-rooms . Therefore , love being the prime motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take its place when love has become unsuitable to our years , when we are as ridiculous bearing a bouquet as we should be in the kindergarten . That is a difficult question , for to put something in the place of love means that we have to find something absorbing . What it is must be decided by every human being for him or herself , but decided it must be , because the condition of the man or woman who has not realized in time that love can not sustain us to the end is certainly terrible . Few people realize this . They never think of it at all . They vaguely talk about " the days when they will be old , " and make out that they suppose they will be happy breeding prize cats , or taking a journey to the Italian Lakes . Well , that is often the case , but it is a long way from youth to age , and the worst years lie in between . Thus , I have often made myself disagreeable to women , when they talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " Yes , that 's all very well . You 're prepared to be sixty , but do consider that you 'll he forty . You 'd better make your plans for that , for it 's a bigger proposition . " As a rule , neither men nor women make any plans at all , yet they are surprised that this way of living should not always prove satisfactory . They grow older , they lose the charming restlessness which makes a young man so attractive . I can think of one youth , for instance , who rode a hundred and ten miles on a bicycle to meet a girl . ( He had no money to pay his train fare . ) He arrived after an eleven-hour run , bathed , danced for five hours , and , next morning , preferred his lady to his legitimate rest . That is how it should be , but when that gaiety has gone , the man who does not realize it is in a perilous state , for he bids and can not pay . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her power to attract ; she bids , and bids in vain . They have lost all the young things , optimism , enthusiasm , which are absurd and delightful . Their condition is pitiful . It is no use telling ourselves that things will he all right somehow . I do n't want to he pessimistic , but I do believe that things are never all right , but one can bring those spectral " things " to being better than they might have been . Certainly life must seem hard to people who have any capacity for the mental side of love , unless they understand that the practice of love can fill only a period in their lives , and that if they carry the love emotion into a later period they arc encouraging an absurd anachronism . We must face it , all of us . Love-making stretches over ten or fifteen years of our lives , and after that is nothing but a bad habit . As a rule the love emotion is canalized by marriage , and that is why I am for marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad marriage is better than none . Only marriage , like all things that carry privileges , involves also certain limitations . It may he very nice to be an emperor , but if you are an emperor ? you will find it awkward to join your faithful but rather over-interested people at the movies . The coronation of marriage leads to complications of that kind . The married may be crowned with a wreath of roses , but crowned they are until the roses do decay . Thus irregularity , because it can not he open , tends to become sordid . If the marriage has produced children , irregularity then tends to become grave , because it may entail the loss of those hostages to the future who may be so dear . One ca n't be a paterfamilias and a roue ; either of these occupations is much too exacting . To which the optimistic reader replies : " Well , what more do you want ? He was a roue , and now you 've given him the job of paterfamilias . You say yourself that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he does n't always know it . His wife may be even more uncertain . Motherhood and wifehood are attractive to her ? but is that the end ? Yes , it is the end . The married must find something else in this life , or rely on the next to make amends . In his Lettres Persanes , Montesquieu shows us woman in the future life , wholly happy with two lovers . That , of course , is a matter of taste ; most women prefer duets to trios . Women are born philopenas . In earthly life it is safer to assume that we are philopena , until the dessert knife us do part . Only the dessert knife takes a long time coming . Hence , we all must find out an alternative to love . We none of us will take it if we can help it . And if , to-day , Mephistopheles were to appear to any man or woman over fifty , hardly any one would ask for anything but youth , which means that he or she would he putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same difficulty by and by . But Mephistopheles would not call again . They would have to face their problem as they would have faced it before . Schopenhauer was conscious of these difficulties . He declared that life was a long disease which could be assuaged only by means of anodynes . He found three anodynes ? love which inflames , art which dignifies , and philosophy which annihilates . Leaving out love , there is much to be said for the other two , but they apply only to people capa-. ble of philosophy or appreciative of art . Byron was probably right in likening the world to a bundle of hay , and mankind to the asses who pull . Philosophy and art are no more fodder for asses than pearls for swine . The ordinary man or woman finds a career a. good anodyne . Of course , careers may be of two kinds ? one may seek fame , or one may want money , but in either case a career is an excellent thing . So far as celebrity goes , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be famous , one can generally achieve notoriety . And money is an excellent thing apart from what it buys . I started business life in a firm of millionaires , the elder partners of which possessed more money than they could possibly use or even waste . Still , they went on making money , and I saw them every day , working pretty hard , and scratching up with glee , not millions , but quite contentedly five hundred dollars , or even less . They were n't avaricious , but . to make money amused them . They collected bank credits as other men collect old masters . They were hypnotized by figures . You may call that a silly alternative to love , but it is n't , for money-making is rather a difficult game , and , if one plays high enough , a dangerous game . There indeed lies an alternative , for it is so exacting , so anxious , that the mind has little time to wander primrose paths . The pursuit of fame is even more desperate . It holds such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily famous to-day and obscure tomorrow . When one is growing old , it is better to toss upon one 's pillow , turning over a financial or political plan , than to see through short-sighted eyes the fair picture which at no price may one add to one 's emotional gallery . And again , there is art . For such as can achieve art , whether in words , in paint , or in musical notes , here is the perfect alternative , for art is a wayward and greedy companion that cares ? not if your hair is white , and , though it has no pity upon your failing mind , yet will always charm you so long as you may be charmed . So much for fame , so much for money , and so much for art . But these are re-reserves into which few penetrate . The common man or woman must find something else , some other drug , that will replace the fruit of amorous illusion . What shall they do ? My own belief is that love , being the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure as great . If we represent love by one pound of pleasure , we must find a number of other pleasures , which , put together , make up the pound weight of delights which we have lost . Somehow , sixteen ounces of various pleasures do not quite make up a pound of love 's rewards , but still they have a considerable weight . So we say , What shall we put into the scale ? The most desperate of all remedies is religion . It is the most complete , it is the closest neighbor to that philosophy which , according to Schopenhauer , can annihilate life . Religion does not annihilate life , but it adjourns it . It says , " Do not mourn , but watch and pray . " Those who have a religious temperament are , in a way , very fortunate , for they can make their miseries into a spiritual store , on which their souls shall opulently subsist in another sphere . Religion is a potent alternative to love ; it is love in another form , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us , because we are over-individualized , because we are too ethical . Most human beings believe in right and wrong , which has little to do with religion . True religion does not deal with sin , but with self-obliteration , for the purpose of re-absorption into the essential spirit . I know that is not a current view ; as the world grows more ethical it grows less religious . That is why dogmatic religion is now a decaying force . Indeed , religion as an alternative to love is more and more taking the form of service . The people who are performing service , say in political causes , in charities , etc. , are probably people who , five hundred years ago , would have been mystics . That is why service seems , rather than religion , an alternative to love . It fits our generation better , and it seems to me the best alternative for a man or woman in the forties , when love becomes undignified . It does not matter much what the service is . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick , from furthering the Democratic or the Republican cause , from creating clinics for babies , or universities in fact , from anything . For service , being humble , is a great satisfaction to pride . When one works for a cause , the more one abases oneself the better one thinks of oneself . Service increases one 's sense of self-importance , provides the great remedy that is called vanity . In a small field one is important , one does things , one is consulted and busy . Thus the creature that once saw itself gigantic in the mirror of beloved eyes , sees itself almost as great in the columns of the newspaper or the report of the parish meeting . Sometimes service leads to another alternative to love ? namely , creation . There is great pleasure in making a thing , and it does not matter much whether it is a picture , or a garden , or even a stamp collection . That sort of thing extends our personality , and that is why some people love their gardens as others love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are something they have made . It will be concluded from all this that I believe in a variety of pleasures as against competition with the unmatched delights of love . Well , for the aging man or woman there is great virtue in change ; dull lives are bad lives . One can shake off much of the distress born of love removed , by doing many different things , by moving from country to country , by a change of profession , by painting blue the walls that were red , and red those that were blue . One can see many people , read many books , engage in various games . Life is like a pudding -- -the more you stir it the better it is . Of course , if none of these methods succeeds , there is scepticism , but that is a dangerous alternative for the average mind , because scepticism easily turns to bitterness . Though some of the bitter enjoy their bitterness , they do not enjoy life like the sceptics . Scepticism consists in believing that nothing is quite true or untrue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; scepticism is cheerful doubt , ironic comparison . It knows that things are not what they seem , thus agreeing with Longfellow , though not agreeing at all that " life is real , life is earnest . " Scepticism may doubt pleasure , but it also doubts pain ; it does not laugh as a Homeric god . Its voice is clear as that of a brook , and its wings are gossamer . All the same I recommend scepticism to nobody , for it is fit only for the serene , only for those who , like Anatole France , have lost confidence in life , but love it all the same . Human beings seem to me of three kinds ? those who have known true love , those who have not known it but have known substitutes , and those who have known nothing at all . The first may have emerged into a clear horizon , knowing that they have taken from life the best that life could give them . Sometimes they can deliberately accept some of the small alternatives that build the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second , who have known only substitutes , arc , in a jog-trot way , more fortunate , because they made their alternatives as they went . Love never engulfed them , and so they had to find something else to do . They are the slightest of us all , and perhaps the happiest . The third , to whom love has given nothing , are in the hardest case , because it is so difficult to believe that love will never come . It should come . It must come . Fate could not so offend a human right . To them , all that one can say is that one never knows what lies beyond the bend of the road , and that meanwhile it will not harm them to serve , to create , to be stirring , to do anything but think , while they sweep and garnish the chamber in which Eros may yet come to dwell . Life may not contain much happiness , but it does hold change . For many of us that comes to be almost the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
