Turkish progress under the kinetic impulsion of President Mustafa Kemal Pasha , the Ghazi , the Victorious One , was so rapid , last week , as to dazzle if not perturb Occidentals . <P> The Grand National Assembly at Angora ( new Turkish Capital ) rushed through a law whereby infants born in Turkey after Jan. 1 , 1929 to foreign parents will be considered Turkish subjects . Probably never before has an Asiatic state dared to enact a law so distasteful to Occidental Motherhood . <P> Little white-skinned Turks of the forthcoming crop will not be permitted to renounce their nationality until they come of age ; and if they do so then will be banished automatically from Turkey . <P> Two new Turkish super-submarines , recently completed by a Dutch shipyard , were welcomed into Turkish waters amid pomp . The Ghazi , the Victorious One , stood at a window of the Dolma-Baghtche Palace on the Bosphorus , and watched through field glasses while the Turkish flag was hoisted aboard the submarines . <P> Greeks , who were defeated by Turks at the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the names of the two new Turkish submersibles , In-Eunu the First and In-Eunu the Second . <P> . President Kemal made official use of the ordinary European alphabet in writing Turkish , last week , and announced that this daring innovation will soon be made compulsory throughout Turkey . <P> " The widespread illiteracy of our population , " he said shrewdly , " will make it far easier to introduce a new alphabet in Turkey than in a country where many people already know their letters . . . . Millions of Turks have abandoned the fez for the hat . . . . Thousands will find it even easier to adopt a new alphabet . . . which the millions will learn as their first . " <P> The Victorious One , hero of the Young Turks ' victorious war to oust the Sultan , has now caught the international itch for concluding peace treaties . Last week , he proclaimed , as President of Turkey , that Foreign Minister Dr. Tewfik Rushdi Bey had signed a treaty of " security and conciliation " with Italy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid in case of attack " with Persia and Afghanistan . <P> The importance of these documents is incalculable . The first would seem to set at rest the many alarms of those who have thought that Italy had colonial designs on Turkey . The pacts with Persia and Afghanistan are fresh documentary evidence of the fact that there is now in formation a Middle East Entente . <P> Twenty Turkish policemen of Constantinople completed , last week , a course rendering them " proficient in the English language " and thus considerably more useful to the 17,000 tourists who annually visit the " City of Minars " and the Golden Horn .
