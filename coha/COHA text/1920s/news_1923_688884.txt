txt Czechoslovakia 's Debt . To the Editor of The New York Times : A Czechoslovak commission is coming to the United States for adjustment of the debt which they owe to this country . Now , it seems to me that when a small , new and struggling nation is working hard , capably and honestly to gain a position among the other nations of the earth those efforts should be encouraged . What better , grander. nobler act could be done than for this great , powerful and rich nation to cancel that debt ? Wien this now great Republic first came into existence any act of that nature on the part of any other nation would have been indeed a great and acceptable blessing . Some of the nations seem to have a hard time settling their Internal as well as their external difficulties , but Czchoslovakla is splendidly striving to keep free of entanglements so far as possible , both within and without its boundaries .
