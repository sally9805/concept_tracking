Babies come crying into the world . They cry for air but in many cases the tears are gummy with pus , the little eyelids swollen and glued together . " Babies sore eyes " ( ophthalmia neonatorum ) is a common complaint . Gonorrhoeal infection is almost always the cause ; contracted from the mother , or in an occasional instance from infected hands or articles . Total blindness is often the result , how often is indicated by the 25% of all blindness in children ascribed to it . This dark , tragic disease may be entirely prevented by therapy during pregnancy ; may even be entirely cured , after having been contracted , by proper medical measures at birth . Many states , realizing this , have legally outlawed ophthalmia neonatorum , making prophylactic treatment of the eyes of newborns compulsory , supplying prophylactic outfits through health departments . The treatment , consisting of drops of silver nitrate in proper dilution , is harmless to the normal eye ; constitutes therefore a universal safety measure . <P> Much of the benevolent legislation has been effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Chief Justice Taft is honorary president . Last week was published a summary of 20 years work : legislative reform , demonstrations , sight saving classes , propaganda . Chief of triumphs was the annual decrease of " babies sore eyes " as a cause of blindness among those admitted to schools for the blind . Today it is 64% less than it was 20 years ago . The goal is a 100% decrease . <P> Public school sight saving classes have been established in 80 cities in 18 states . Large type books , ideal lighting , movable desks , special teaching methods save the sight of children hampered by defective vision . <P> Industrial reforms are being instigated to counteract the industrial hazards responsible for 15% of the 100,000 blind in the U. S.
