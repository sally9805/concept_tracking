" TIME brings all things " <P> " Unfair " <P> " It is unfair for our flyers to get all the glory while those poor Frenchmen Captains Nungesser &; Coli are dead , " said Joseph Lewis , 39 , Negro , as he stood poised on a window sill of his fifth-floor apartment in Manhattan . Then he jumped , died on the pavement below . Mr. Lewis ' sister said that he had been melancholy for several weeks . <P> <P> The inhabitants of Kenton , Ohio , * were so befuddled last week that they would not have been surprised to find rabbits in their beds or eggs in their shoes . For three days , their town was a hive of deft-fingered , beady-eyed men who stopped at nothing . But Kentonites were proud , for they were being entertained by 500 members of the International Brotherhood of Magicians-Harry Blackstone , Mysterious Smith , T. Nelson Downs ( King of Koins ) , Rajah Raboid , the Hudspeths and many another . Important doings : <P> Rajah Raboid , blindfolded with eleven thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's curious traffic . <P> Fred Kurd opened his mouth and , with his teeth , grabbed a marked bullet out of the air . The bullet had been fired from an ancient horse pistol . <P> Mysterious Smith apparently had no difficulty in getting out of a straightjacket inside of a roped coffin . <P> In convention assembled , the magicians adopted a resolution to stop the exposing of each other 's tricks . <P> W. W. Durbin , businessman and Democratic politician of Kenton , who was host , was re-elected President of the Brotherhood . <P> Howard Thurston , even though absent , was chosen as one of the vice presidents . <P> <P> Charivari <P> Villagers of Manuden , England , gathered on the lawn of the vicarage of the Rev. Harry B. Grin-die , 70 , on his wedding night . They beat tin pans , iron kettles , garbage cans , etc . They honked horns . In short , they gave Vicar Grindle an old-fashioned " tin kettling " - to remind him that they thought he had violated an unwritten jaw . <P> Vicar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife on her deathbed . The wedding took place five weeks after the death . Said the new Mrs. Grindle : " By remarrying , the vicar has paid the best compliment to the memory of his first wife . I nursed her and know her chief concern was how Harry would get on without assistance . . . . " <P> <P> Knothole <P> What percentage of mankind will jab a hatpin , ice pick or nail file through a knothole or key hole when they have reason to suspect that a human eye is pressed against the exterior of such an orifice ? <P> Some critics say 10% ; others go as high as 75% . But last week one Ray Doll , Chicago junk dealer , went so far as to fire a shotgun when he saw an eye peeking and peering at him through a knothole in his garage . The shotgun shell sped straight , blew out the brains of one Robert Hailey , 15 , Negro , who meant no harm . <P> Junkman Doll was arrested , charged with murder . <P> <P> - Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenyon College which produced U. S. President Rutherford B. Hayes ; nor with Canton , Ohio , home of U. S. President William McKinley . <P> TIME , June SO , 1927
