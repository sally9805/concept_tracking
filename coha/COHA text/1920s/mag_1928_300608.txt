Founders of the Schubert Memorial bewailed in their prospectus the slim chances of talented U. S. artists as against widely advertised ones with European reputations . Last week , as if to prove their point for them , there appeared again in Manhattan Vladimir Horowitz , 25-year-old Russian pianist who made his U. S. debut last winter . He played next day after the Schubert Memorial 's concert , in the same hall with the same Philharmonic players and Conductor Willem Mengelberg . He played ambitiously , Brahms ' great B flat Concerto-and in a manner so restrained and yet so immensely moving that critics who had hitherto accused him of superficial interpretation and claptrap effect , revamped their verdict . Widely-advertised Horowitz with the European reputation had made big music . He , apparently unconcerned , took his relaxation by spending the rest of the night at the 6-day bicycle race .
