THE HUNTER 'S MOON-Ernest Poole-Macmillan ( $2.00 ) . Author Poole for once has got away from the unpleasantnesses of living in the crowded city called great , but this story too is set in Manhattan . It is the story of an unhappy family from the standpoint of the little boy who lives in it , sees his mother and his father driven apart by a hard penny-scrimping grandmother , and only partly understands . But it has an entirely happy ending , for it sees through the eyes of the boy promise of all good things when the song-singing lover of life who is his grandfather comes to take him and his mother away . Mr. Poole has hit upon the one method of writing a completely realistic story with an unqualified happy ending . <P> THREE FARMS-Cynthia Stockley-Putnam 's ( $1.50 ) . Farming in Rhodesia-an English master ruling in solitude over a horde of native " boys " with others of his kind living some miles away for his only neighbors . To such a farm-master , who is her husband , comes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Slowly the tentacles of intrigue wind about them and their neighbors . She wins back her husband 's love , only to learn that one of her neighbors with a sensual wife has been made a cuckold , and that her husband was the maker . Then follows the neighbor 's revenge-and her own grief , wondering whose child she is to bear . It all moves with despatch to a well-planned happy ending-but unmistakably planned .
