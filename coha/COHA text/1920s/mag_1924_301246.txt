Theirs Is a Literary Tandem <P> On their return from Europe , Charles and Kathleen Norris spent some weeks in Manhattan before seeking their California ranch life . This highly literary family is always interesting ; for both Mr. Norris and his wife are vivid , keen-minded , hospitable . <P> " I 've abandoned monosyllabic titles , " the author of Salt , Brass and Bread told me . " What , " I then asked , " is to be the title of your next novel ? " " Pig Iron , " he replied-and the joke seemed to be on me . Charles Norris says that he can produce only one novel every two years ; that he is 75,000 words towards the finish of this new study of the struggle between materialism and the spirit , and that means only half done . While in Italy , he worked every day , from early morning until late afternoon . Mr. Norris does not write with the flow and the passion of his wife , who publishes , as a rule , one novel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is interesting to hear Mrs. Norris tell of early struggles in New York , of how they married on a salary that sounds staggeringly small to us in these days ; but , ' ' before we knew it , " and almost imperceptibly , the necessary sacrifices were made and reasonable prosperity began . <P> It must be a great joy for two persons to be intellectually as well-mated as these two . Here they were , with their young son and three Benet children ( for a branch of the literary Benets are nieces and nephews ) starting off for California , , with all possible gaiety . In the Autumn they plan to return to Manhattan and , hereafter , to work there for at least half the year . " If it 's possible to work in New York , " Mr. Norris added . Then , " Is it ? " The answer is , I think : It 's possible to write anywhere if you are surrounded by intelligent and sympathetic friends who are willing to furnish stimulation without insisting on distraction .

She started life as a newspaper woman ; there is much of her more intimate story , I fancy , in her most ambitious recent work Certain People of Importance . She is unlike her husband and his brilliant brother , the late Frank Norris , for she is incurably romantic . In her drabbest pages of realism- and there are not many of them- she maintains the values of sentiment and emotion . Her husband , however , writes with unusual objectivity . He proceeds on a character-basis he believes true and he is faithful to that truth , which is often a trifle bitter . <P> J. F.
