Below stairs in the dignified stone mansion of Marshal Ferdinand Foch , a group of Paris reporters completed , last week , their second month of fidgeting and fuming . The first month was the hardest . It climaxed in a duel between M. Georges Chapreau and M. le Marquis Henri de Sombrieul , both star reporters , who had rasped each other 's nerves . However , since le Marquis fired into the ground , and M. Chapreau into the air-as Frenchmen will - the shots served happily to steady the nerves of all concerned . Last week the corps of reporters five was informed by the corps of physicians nine that quite possibly they would have to wait another two months , although of course they might not . <P> Above stairs lay the Generalissimo-the man who won the War if any one man did-dying by inches . Pathos was not in the simple room but instead a grand vitality , a dauntless courage . <P> They had called a priest , weeks ago , and the Generalissimo lived on . The Associated Press had reported " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days at most , " but already old Campaigner Ferdinand Foch had doubled that span . What matter if Death took him at the next clock-tick ? Already he had fooled them all , and a man may call a joke a joke and die with all decorum and honor when he is 77 . <P> Bare walls , and a plain French wooden bed . For 24 hours , last week , the Generalissimo tried out an " American bed " - with a crank and gadgets-then resumed his austere pallet . As he lay with fast-beating pulse , enduring alternate chills and fever , the man with the calm grey eyes would sometimes cast them for a long time on the richly embroidered Banner of all the Allied Nations , which hung above his head . Sometimes too he would call for his baton-the baton of a Marshal of France-and with the tips of his old fingers would caress along the shaft the hard and prickly stars . <P> Perfectly alert and mobile , the brain followed each move of the Mexican revolution ( see MEXICO ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever and always the Generalissimo , her husband , who had long since lost all appetite , ordered his jaws to chew , his gullet to swallow , and so far as in him lay , his stomach to digest . <P> From the first day of his illness Marshal Foch demanded and received from all his doctors the minutest account of what was to be fought and how . Unlike His Majesty George V , who did not bring himself to chew and swallow solid food while his royal appetite was in abeyance ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) , the Generalissimo continued , even last week to eat with a precision which his doctors declared absolutely astounding in a patient thus far gone . <P> Tears for so splendid an old paladin seemed more than vain , yet they were not lacking , last week , when the nine doctors left the Marshal 's room , after examining their patient with especial earnestness . <P> <P> Brokenly the great Parisian heart specialist , Dr. de Gennes , exclaimed to the reporters : " Pray to heaven , gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious patient a few steps further down the ladder of Life .
