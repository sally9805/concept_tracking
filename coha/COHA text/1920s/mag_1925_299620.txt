Representatives from 300 U. S. colleges assembled at Chicago for the eleventh annual convention of the Association of American Colleges . Among this learned congress were professors of every known species , from hale and hearty , square-shouldered , square-jawed educators to wizened , bespectacled pedants . <P> Said one : <P> " We must find a new appeal . <P> " Economics should encourage economy . " Ethics should result in more honorable and unselfish conduct . <P> " Political science should teach a better social control in colleges as well as in cities . <P> " Philosophy and sociology should find some application of their teachings to the individual life and the improvement of social groups . <P> " There ought to be some way of trying theory and practice . <P> " If the colleges and universities do not provide leaders for world tasks , where else are they to be found ? <P> " If we do not uphold an orderly society , who may be expected to do so ? " <P> Said another : <P> " When the period of reaction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the children of the United States . " <P> And another : <P> " If the welfare of the Nation is to be determined by opportunity of education , then the Nation has its obligations . <P> " Does not the welfare of all of us mean that finally we shall come along to the time that , as we accepted taxation locally and in the State to support schools , we shall accept it in the Federal Government to support schools ? " <P> Evidently the atmosphere of the convention had laid heavily upon Dr. F. P. Keppel , * President of the Carnegie Corporation . Perhaps he felt that in such density there was no chance for the proverbial spark that might set the world afire . He therefore rose and told the assembled 299 in words plain , blunt , humorous : " Imagine a group of librarians or college professors or Presidents here spontaneously bursting into song or dancing , or both . Yet that is just what we need to break through our self-consciousness and our patterns of convention . This is fundamentally what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true today and here in this land of freedom as it was when Plato taught it in Greece . " <P> * Dr. Keppel served from 1910 to 1918 as Dean of the College of Liberal Arts , Columbia University . He resigned to become Third Assistant Secretary of War under Newton D. Baker . In 1919 and 1920 , he was Director of the foreign operations of the American Red Cross .
