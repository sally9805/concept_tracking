txt Objection &; Reproof As a reader who has learned to look for adequate and indeed , in many cases , admirable reviews in the ably edited BOOK RICSOUBW section of the Sunday Timex , I venture , for the first time in my experience . to protest against a review . Mr. John Carter 's review of Professor Shotwell 's book on the Paris Pact was both unfair and incompetent . Mr. Carter , to be sure , has a certain facile flair for irony ; but after searching the review in vain for a substantial appraisal of the important matters which constitute the bulk of the book , I would suggest that sophomoric sarcasm is not a satisfactory substitute for serious criticism . Moreover , the sarcasm is misdirected . With either astonishing ignorance or more astonishing disingenuousness , the reviewer manages to convey the impression that the book is an attempt to claim for " three or four private American citizens , " the author himself being one , credit that is really due to M. Briand and Mr. Kellogg . Any one familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , must know that the author , far from boasting , erred in the direction of being more than modest . Not from his own book , but from Mr. Miller 's , does one learn of Professor Shotwell 's role in connection with M. Briand 's original message . More ' serious is Mr. Carter 's endeavor to misrepresent this volume as the work of a " soft-boiled " pacifist , giving " vent to wildly inaccurate denunciations of the administration 's naval program . " One has but to read the book to perceive that the " wildly inaccurate denunciations " are Mr. Carter 's . To deal with an authoritative analysis of the pact , containing only the most cursory referendes to the naval problem , as it it were principally concerned with the pending cruiser bill , is to fall very far below the normal standard of New Yonx Times book reviews . In conclusion , with characterisue dexterity in distortion , the reviewer expresses his regret that Professor Shotwell " writes as though " the pact were the last step toward restricting war . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary to the whole trend of the book . Indeed , the concluding chapter of the book begins with the sentence : " Several times in the course of our study we have emphasized the fact that mere renunciation of war is not enough to rid the world of it .
