Two Federal judges in Texas-Judge Joseph C. Hutcheson at Houston . Judge Duval West at San Antonio-last week handed down decisions that may bear critically on the November election . Each decided that the Democratic Party , being in no sense a governmental agency but only a social-political organization , is entirely within its rights in determining for itself what shall be the qualification for citizens who cast votes in primary elections held under its auspices . The suits were brought , of course , by Negroes who asked that the Democrats be enjoined from barring out Negroes . The decisions made it clear that the Democrats had discovered the simplest method yet of disfranchising Negroes . Certificates from Democratic primaries in the South are virtually the same as election certificates , so ubiquitously preponderant is the party . Where any rising tide of black Republican votes may occur , white concern for the all-white ticket is calculated to insure the Democrats against the dangers of sloth , carelessness , disaffection among themselves . The new Texas method of disfranchising Negroes by simple race discrimination in the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar Negroes from the polls by a State law . But Negroes had this law declared unconstitutional . Other methods have been : <P> 1 ) Literacy tests-requiring voters to prove that they could read and write . Education of the Negroes spoiled this . 2 ) Property requirements The Negroes ' post-slavery discovery of industry and thrift spoiled this . 3 ) The " Grandfather clause " - admitting to suffrage any man who voted in 1867 or before , or was one son or grandson of such a man . The practical effect , if not the technical process , of denying Negroes a share in the government is , of course , a violation of the 14th and 18th Amendments to the U. S. Constitution . It has become trite to point out the inconsistency of such nullification by citizens who prate about the sanctity of the 18th Amendment . Last week 's dark plaintiffs in Texas will not have time before November to carry their cases to the U. S. Supreme Court . But predictions were made that when the appeals are heard , the South 's constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation . <P> The all-white Texas primary held last week returned Governor Dan Moody for re-election by some 100,000 votes . T. B. Love , loudspoken anti-Smithist , candidate for Lieutenant-Governor , ran some 80,000 votes behind Barry Miller , pro-Smith . Senator Earle B. Mayfield was close-pressed in defending his seat from ambitious Representative Tom Connally.
