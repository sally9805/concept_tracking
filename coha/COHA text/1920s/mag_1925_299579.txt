Last spring , Congress passed a bill to increase the pay of postal employes . It was to have cost in the neighborhood of $68,000,000 a year . Last June , just before Congress adjourned , President Coolidge vetoed the bill on the grounds that no provision was made therein for raising the revenue to pay the increased cost . All summer the veto lay on the desks of the President pro tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House . <P> Last week the bill was taken up again by the Senate . In order to pass it over the veto , a two-thirds vote was necessary . The original vote last spring was 73 to 3 for the bill . But meanwhile Calvin Coolidge , the vetoer , had received an endorsement from 15,000,000 U. S. voters ; meanwhile another bill designed to meet Mr. Coolidge 's approval by providing increased revenue to offset increased pay had been proposed . The vote was a great deal different from last Spring 's . The vote by parties , including those paired , was : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 38 <P> Farmer Labor ... 2 <P> 32 61 <P> So was the veto upheld , so was the bill defeated . Although some politicians said otherwise , it was generally the opinion of observers that the defeat of this bill marks the end of postal pay legislation for this session of Congress .
