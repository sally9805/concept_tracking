txt Launching a sharp attack on Govern nor Smith 's financial policies as un . sound and as leading the State into dangerous ground , Representative Ogden L. Mills , at the dinner of the Economia Club in the Hotel Astor last night , charged that the Governor 's tax relief measures had shifted rather than lifted the burden of taxes . Governor Smith , the only other speaker , listened to the attack and then vigorously met it . in his best campaign manner . The Congressmen and the Governor were paired to discuss " Economy and Efficiency in Government . " In his speech Representative Mills declared that , ow ? ing to the " borrowing methods of the present Administration , " the State sue . plus for next year would be only S3.000 , . 000 , thy lowest in many years . Citing figures for the period of 1921 to 19 ' 25 , he declared that expenditures in the State had increased approximately $ : , 5 , . 000,000 . The debt , in gross . he figured as mounting $140,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , the Congressman set forth figures showing what that sys. tem had accomplished at Washington since 1920 . Ile declared that the same saving could be accomplished in New ' York if the " Governor will but lay aside the theoretical conceptions of 1915 in favor or the actual accomplishments of 1921 to 1925 . " ' Colupeerfng . What lead been done at Washinkton : to tehtet he deild'eee the State . had failed to do , Repree.etteeee , et Mills said that while the capital hied gone forward steadele .. W9 1:mtk " had accepted the shadow for the SiAtance , " , and had temporized . He said that while income taxes had been cut , the rate of levy on real es . tate had steadily increased . Governor Smith Replies . When Howard Elliott introduced Gov. governor Smith as ready to reply to the Representative the 1,200 diners caught an ominous jutting of the Governor 's chin . He appeared to have been stirred by the attack  --  which he jotted down vo. luminously as the speaker mate it  --  and he went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he remarked , " front 1 the address of the Congressman , that there are two kinds of tax reduction , Republican tax reduction , which is all right , and Democratic tax reduction , which , while it reduces , is all wrong . " Taking up the Congressman 's static . tics and account of what had been ace complished under the Federal budgetary , plan , Governor Smith admitted that he had " been too busy to follow things down there in detail , " but said that he had been following conditions in this State , and lie knew that the " pay-as. you-go plan is all wrong for us . " He said that while the Federal Administra , Lion had been free , at the close of the I war , to turn at once to the problems of readjustment. the States had been forced to tackle other problems before going I ahead . " Let 's deal with his statement about real estate or direct property taxes . " he continued . " The fact of that question ' is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . We may reduce them , or we may increase them , but the State does n't benefit unless the mu . Inicipalitids pass them on . I advise the Congressman to read Governor Miller 's message on that particular point . Reason for the Income Tax , " Now , with all due respect to the Con. gressman 's statement on the income tax , I think we ought to have a few Imore facts on that . Especially on how it came to be passed . He was a mem . Oher of the committee that had it in charge , but 1 signed it , and the reason that it was passed was in order to take the place of the millions that we lost in excises . And it was understood when ( it was passed that it would be wiped out at the first possible - time . Cutting down the rates year by year is one way , of wiping it out . " Governor Smith then gave attention to his opponent 's charge that the State surplus next year would be down to e3,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check up again on that ? " li:e only about $4,000,000 out of the way . " Ihe added , reporting that the surplus would amount to more than $7,000,000. 1Noticing the Congressman 's criticism of constitutional amendments , authorizing the issuance of bonds for various pub . lic works , the Governor pointed out that most of the proposals had " originated with the Republicans , and all I had to do was to deliver the Democratic Senate , which I did . " The next point he replied to was the budget system suggestion . The Governor said that the State had had a ' budget bureau since the regime of Whitman . " and Washington got one recently . " This remark brought much applause from the auditors , and Gover ? nor Smith continued : " What I want is some control over the Legislatures method of spending the money , I do n't care what they do with it  --  it 's how that I 'm inter . estecl in . " Analyzing the " pay-as-you-go " policy advocated by Representative Mills . the speaker condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York-New Jersey tunnel . He said that the State of New Jersey had handled the " problem in a businesslike way " by authorizing the issue of bonds to defray its share of the cost He pointed out that . amortization of the Jersey bonds would be provided for out of the revenues of the tunnel , " whereas our revenues , instead of paying off the ** will go directly into the general fund for toe Legislature to spend as it sees fit . " Pay-as-Yon-Go Policy . " There is nobody in the State , " he said . " who would advocate faster for the ' pay-as-you-go ' policy than I , but it is n't practical and you ca n't do it . Let 's take the question of Iningdrae Prison , merely as an example . We can get at some concrete facts out of that , at any rate . Wingdale Prison was authorized by the Legislature as far back as 191e . Well , between that time and 1920 we authorized and spent about $1.650,000 for the construction of one small building or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a penny was appropriated . All that was up at the prison was a couple of firemen and a couple of engineers to keep the buildings protected from frost . " In 1923 , with the State Architect , I went up there and we decided to turn the prison into a hospital . We salvaged it . for the only way in which it could have been completed was through the issuance of bonds . " Ile then took the case of Sing Sing , declaring that under the " pan-as-youno " policy much-needed improvements could never be accomplished . He also cited the State hospital program as badly hampered because " under the present system " no building , " no matter how antiquated , must ever be replaced . " " Now look at the schools , " he said . " nothing could be more wasteful than to continue to pour money into these delapidated normal schools , some of which are in dreadful shape . One of the schools in particular is out of date and dangerous , but under the ' pay-asyou-go ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as a brick remains . " As an illustration of the futility of the policy , the Governor told how the State had sought to find office space for its activities in Albany . He said that in i 1915 the State lied hired all available spare , even utilizing a Turkish bath building in State Street . Yet the demand for more space continued . So finally , he said , it was decided to spend 5700,000 for a. whole block . " There was a great blare of trumpets and a fence was put around the block , " he said . " Well , in 1918 , the Federal Government was permitted to advertise War Savings Stamps on the fence , but that is as near as the block ever got to ' being of use to anybody . They finally turned it into a park . " By what stretch of the imagination do people think that a Governor and the Legislature would be less careful of money obtained by , bonds than they would be of money yielded out of current receipts ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lack of money , such as he argued could be readily obtained by the sale of bonds , has badly demoralized the State Guard . He pointed out that prior to the Federalization of the National Guard the State had maintained quarters and equipment for about 10,000 men . When the Federal authority stepped in during the war the State was called upon to maintain a force of 22.000 men . Despite the : doubling of the personnel . : aid the Governor , nothing had been done to increase armory space . Another point he made against the " pay-as-you-go " policy was in the condition of the State tuberculosis facilities . He said that lack of funds had kept the State back in adding to its sanitariums and hospitals , so that people were kept waiting on long lists , " until the disease is so far advanced they can get no benefit from the treatment . " " If you want to get a fair example of what happens when the ' pay-as-you-go ' Policy is pursued , " he said , " consider what happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest health resort and yet the only thing the State does In the way of maintaining it is to give it fifteen bath tubs a year . Eventually private enterprise will be called in to take over the Springs so that the people of this State can get some benefit from them . " Looking into the future the Governor said that money would be required for another tunnel to relieve the New YorkNew Jersey tunnel , and that " at least two more bridges will be needed over the Hudson to take care of the enormous Increase in automobile traffic . " Jae said that the second tunnel , if planned , probably would be located at Fourteenth Street , Manhattan . Tells of Hospital Plans . " The Hospital Commission , " said the Governor , turning to that phase of the State 's activities , " brought in an elegant set of plans one year . They looked great . We started out to finance the program from current expenditures , which Congressman Mills insists is the only panacea for carrying on necessary State improvements . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and during these years only $3,000,000 was appropriated for a project which everybody knew would cost $35,000,000 to complete . " We were obedient to Washington , however . In 1920 when the war was all over , Washington in a most generous and liberal mood told the States that they could carry on . So in 1920 we appropriated $7,431,000 ; in 1921 , 81.500 , - ( 100 ; in 1922 we obtained $2.120,000 and In 1923 , the sum of $5,500,000 . Then everybody finally agreed that it was utterly foolish and an extravagant waste to attempt to finance the project out of current receipts . So we substituted the $30,000,000 bond issue and new we are getting hospitals and the conditions in the old institutions are greatly improved . " Certain of the State institutional buildings were condemned as " clisgracefur by the Governor , who blamed failure to Provide bond issue money as the cause . Among the institutions he named were the State School for the Blind at Batavia , N. Y. and the Institute for the Deaf at Rochester . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor and the Legislature last year saw fit to reduce individual income taxes by $8,500,000 . Please note that they were abzle to do so only because at the same time they were collecting from real property owners $7,500.000 more than the year before . They have just repeated the offense . The income tax levy has just been cut from $38,000,000 to $29,500,000 , but real property this year will contribute to the State , in addition to local taxes , $28,031,833 , and next year $30 , - 344,435 , as compared with $21,402,022 in 1923 . " To label this tax reduction is to insult one 's intelligence . It is tax shifting and , from the standpoint of equity and good economics , tax shifting of the most indefensible kind . " Few who have studied the situation will deny , what the Governor pointed out , that those most hardly pressed by the heavy burden of taxation today are the farmers and the rentpayers . Yet these two classes of taxpayers have had their taxes increased in order to relieve security holders of part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only three possible excuses may be advanced , none of which seems to me to have any particular merit . It may be claimed that the income-tax reduction Isenefits the wage earners and salaried men . But if these were the ones that the tax shifters had in view they could have accomplished their purpose by limiting the reduction to earned income . Again , it may be urged that the rate of the direct property tax has not been raised as compared with last year . This is true , but how about assessed valua-tion ? " Here in New York City , with a lower tax rate , property owners this year will actually pay more taxes than last , because of the enormous increase in the assessed valuation . Finally , they may claim that tn . Federal income tax is so high as to justify a decrease in the State tax . But the answer to this is that Federal income taxes were materially reduced last year , will again be reduced next year , and that if you consider the Federal tax system as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between direct and indirect taxes . Moreover , the State rate was already so low and the amount contributed so insignificant , as compared with the tax-paying ability of this great aggregation of wealth , that there is no possible justiSication for reducing it by one-fourth . " Not Speaking as a Partisan . Representative Mills denied that he bad any desire to be critical , nor did he Wish to appear to speak " as a partisan , *ince the Republican Legislature acquiesced " in the measures lie questioned . He said that a " well-nigh universal cry " bad gone up insisting that retrenchment and economy be set up as barriers against the rising tide of governmental expenditures . " In this connection , " he said , " it may be well to clarify our conception of what true economy in government is , by stating some of the things it is not . Governor Smith , in 1923 , laid down two sound axioms : ' There is no economy in deferring appropriations ; there is no economy in neglecting the known wants of the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no economy in reducing taxes by borrowing to meet recurring expenditures . ' The Representative cited figures showing reduction of Federal expenditures and said that " as a result we have been able - to reduce taxes , not simply to lower individual rates . ' " Turning now to our own State of New York . ' ? he said , " what do we find ? Expenditures have increased from $135. - 000 , e00 in 1921 to $109,486,799.05 in 1925 . The net debt has grown from $188. - ( Walla ; in 1921 to $221,000.000 in 192.3 . The groas debt . has increased from ** in 1921 to 4308,491,000 in 1925 . To which must be added $65 , - 000,000 recently authorized , making an increase of over $140,000,000 in five years question at once arises ' how it was possible to reduce the personal income tax in the face of a steadily mounting cost of Government . There are two answers . " He then said that receipts from other taxes had shown a marked increase . The increased assessment upon real property owners just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - tax reduction . " In the second place , " he continued , " the budget has not been balanced . We have been living off our accumulated surplus . The unobligated surplus on June 20 , 1921 , amounted to some $44 , - 000,000 . On June 30 , 1925 , it will have been reduced to $11,000,000 , and on June 30. 1926. it will be well-nigh wiped out . Next Year 's Budget . " Let us consider next year 's budget as an example . that is. the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 next . Receipts , including a two and a half million additional increase in direct property taxes , are estimated at approximately $104,000,000 . Appropriations amount , roughly speaking , to $109,000 , - 000 , leaving a deficit of $5,000,000 , which must be taken care of out of what is left of the surplus . In addition , there are two items aggregating $3,000,000 that will have to be provided for by deficiency bills next Winter , making the real deficit 88,000,000 for the year . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . and I know of no reason why , up to a certain point . it should not be used for current expenditures and to reduce taxes . At the same time , it is perfectly obvious that the process can not be continued indefinitely , and that , sooner or later , when the surplus has been exhausted , there ' , lust be a material increase in taxes in order to take care of the increased cost of Government . " Now , the gentlemen responsible for the financial policy which I have just described have , of - course , forseen the inconveniences and difficulties , political and otherwise , incident to such a situation , and . have already devised relief measures in the form of another sedative as a substitute for the vanished surplus . It takes the form of a constitutional amendment which will permit the Legislature to borrow $10,000,000 a year to nay for recurring capital expenditure : - . heretofore paid from current revenue . With $10,000,000 a year to play with . limited only by the elastic interpretation which the Legislature may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , s and improvements , ' the crisis may be tided over without too sharp an increase in taxes . But at what cost ? " What we are proposing today , in effect , is to borrow for the recurring expenses of maintenance and operation . and the costliness and folly of such a procedure are made manifest by the figures which I have given you . There is no reason on earth why , with economy , efficiency and forward-planning , the State of New York , with its colossal resources , should not ' pay as you go ' for all but exceptional improvements . " A letter from Andrew Mellon , Secretary of the Treasury , was read by Mr. Elliott . Secretary Mellon , discussing the rising tendency of governmental expenditures , said that the tendency was not necessarily an evil . He said that one of the most serious problems of the day was " just how far governmental activities should go . " He cited certain activities which he regarded as fitting for Governments to undertake , oift added : " On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be performed better and more cheaply by individuals is a wholly . unwarranted encroachment on private income . On almost all occasions some class in the community is clamoring for increased expenditures  --  sometimes for worthy purposes , sometimes for purely class or group advantage and frequently few voices are raised In protest until tax payment time arrives . What activities are worth while must ultimately be decided by the people themselves or their representatives . The discussion and publicity given to these problems by your club and similar organizations will doubtless do much in the way of developing a discriminating public opinion . "
