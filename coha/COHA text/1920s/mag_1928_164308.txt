Upon his return from Europe for a " business visit " last week Monsieur Jean Monnet , onetime wealthy French industrialist ( brandy ) , present Manhattan banking house partner ( Blair &; Co. ) astonished Wall Streeters by explaining through the Manhattan press that his Motherland will henceforth lend money instead of borrowing . An outlet for France 's surplus funds must be found , said Banker Monnet , former Deputy Secretary General of the League of Nations . But no " rivalry " with the U. S. will result , he soothed . Co-operation in international finance , U. S. , England , France , hand in hand , will be the motto . Usurers sighed or cursed . France had kept them waiting many years . The bars against loans to France were down at last . And at long last France had money to loan . French bonds rose to a new record price .
