GLANCING at the churchlike summit of the lovely Bush Terminal Building makes us wonder why some of our millionaires do not build themselves tombs on the tops of their skyscrapers . Not in the construction days of the pyramids of Gizeh has the world afforded such an opportunity for gigantic lasting and conspicuous monuments . Odd that with this superlative opportunity for immortality right at hand no one is taking advantage of it . THE Park Lane dining room with its tapestries and well modulated music is a very beautiful place to eat . The room is cold , however , and sometimes lacks that one touch of nature which the simple-minded of us love . But our advice is to go and keep your eyes open . Eventually you will receive your reward . We lunched there last week and spied far across the room under a table in the corner , unsuspected by the suave headwaiter and his uniformed bodyguard , a mangy alley cat complacently cleaning herself . AN associate who spent part of the vacation season in one of the downtown hospitals has persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the East Twenties as the ugliest sight in the world . He insists that , on four continents , he has seen nothing to compare with the repulsive waste of unpainted water towers , clothes lines , dilapidated penthouses , pigeon coops , rusted fire escapes , coal heaps , and gas tanks . A rear view of Manhattan 's famous financial district sky line is offered in the distance and the bridges are to be discerned , but even they are submerged and damned by the dust , the heat haze , and the expanse of sheer unloveliness . CONTRARY to general opinion , Thirty-fourth Street and Sixth Avenue , where can be seen more Flat-bush and East Orange shoppers than anywhere else in the world , the cross-ing place of six street-car , two elevated and four subway tracks , two Long Island tunnels , and several Hudson Tubes , is not without its bit of ro-mance . " What on earth ! " we said to a lady who is mildly famous for her collection of pet fish . " I 've been to Gimbel 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , it 's about the best place in the city to buy tropical fish . " BY way of diversion , we took the liberty of reading two papers last Friday . In one we found the headline , " Hall-Mills Case Causes Drownings  --  Three Drinking Longshoremen Fall into East River in Fight over Jersey Mystery . " In the other we found , " 2 ' Good Fellows ' Debating Ederle Stroke Fall Off Pier and Drown . " By the general similarity of names we identified the groups concerned as the same . The incident is discouraging . While we do not expect to find mere truth in the papers , we feel we have a right to enjoy the fictions in them without being made to realize that they are imagination . E were present on one of those occasions when two men forgot the law and the refining influences of the last ten thousand years and reverted to a state of Nature . Within the shadow of the new Paramount Building one man swung on another and floored him . Electrified , we pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually in the street ; but it proved to be only two jealous soda clerks . The Sharper MR . DON MARQUIS , so it goes , on a recent trip abroad conceived the idea of setting aside one hundred dollars to spend in learning how smoking-room card sharpers operated . He had always been curious about them . So the first evening he strolled into the smoking room . Sure enough he was asked to play . Upon his eager acceptance the stranger went away and came back with two others and they sat down . At the end of the evening - Marquis was sixteen dollars ahead , having played at half a cent . This was all true to form . The next night he won thirty-one , the third night twenty-eight . He watched slyly , and on the last evening was delighted to hear the man who had organized the game suggest that , it being the last night , they raise the stakes a little . " How about a cent and a half ? " " Sure , " said Marquis eagerly . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , however , he had won seventy-six dollars more . The next day Mr. Marquis saw a lady nudge a companion and nod toward him as they drew into Cherbourg . " That , " she whispered , " is the card sharp who cleaned ' Wallace out of eighty-three dollars . " With Dinosaurs HE summer at the Museum of 1 Natural History has been one of solid , safe , and sane progress so far as the authorities are concerned and one of disappointment so far as the public is concerned . Carl Akeley has been , and still is , in Africa collecting specimens , and a group of experts have been in the Gobi Desert squinting for dinosaur eggs ; animals have been mounted , and groups have been arranged for those parts of the Asiatic Section that will open this fall if possible . But in the meanwhile the public has been deprived of most of the prehistoric skeletons , which have been taken back into the workrooms to be fixed and tidied . Without dinosaurs no museum is the same . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being a friend of somebody , or by being a scientist or a Senator , you can see the monsters . They are on one of the floors of the Asiatic Section , which is the section stretching behind you as you stand looking south at the east corner of the insane-asylum-like building . Which building , by the way , will some day he about three times its present size ; and , we hope , three hundred times as beautiful . The monsters are in there  --  not any new ones , for dinosaurs collect but slowly ? standing in confusion with affecting patience , waiting to be straightened out , motionless as the earth they inhabited many million genera bons ago . BUT on the floor above , great things are in progress . On this floor the Preparation Department , facetiously called the stuffing gang , have camped nut . Eventually , possibly within a year , another place will be found for this enterprising and extraordinarily expert gang elsewhere and the room will be filled with specimens . Just at present it looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant , rhino , buffalo , eland , and crocodile are scattered about in wild confusion , some made of plaster , some of clay , and some of hide . In one corner a quiet individual in a smock is lovingly stitching up the hind leg of a tiger , while behind him another striped one watches malevolently to see that all goes well . The door of a gigantic elevator opens ( the only one we know of that is meant to carry mammoths and a man comes out with a wheelbarrow full of bones . Across the room is a mountain of clay , which at the end of three or four months , if the three men in smocks do n't give out , will become a stuffed elephant . The model to scale stands near by . Everything is at once expert and grotesque . THEquality of the rest of the museum has necessarily remained unchanged while most of the institu tion 's energy has gone into the larger schemes for new buildings . The public will he rewarded in the end : it takes time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on view , showing that Dr. Straton is mistaken ; and a beautiful series of dinosaur skulls showing the growth of the beast from hatching to maturity and including a lifelike model of baby dinosaurs coming out of eggs . And the geology room has beers spruced up a bit with intent to charm the layman . All these things are good  --  and it is fairly cool in the building . The attendance is regular , thousands a day coming in to see what the man-eating enemies , against which they have never had to struggle , were like . Policy A STORY is just beginning to go 1 the rounds to the effect that when they took stock in one of our better department stores , more bottles of a rather expensive imported perfume were found on hand than had ever been put into stock . The puzzling phenomenon was at last satisfactorily explained : It appeals that many shrewd ladies of fashion while in Europe had purchased bottles of perfume at a very low price and on returning home had taken a bottle or two to the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gifts , which they did not care for , and could n't they have credit on them for purchases of other goods ? They were important customers , so the store said they could , thus allowing them to make a profit of the twenty-some-odd dollars difference between the French and American prices . Goldman 's Band THE Goldman concerts in Central Park are over , the Mayor has congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Guggenheim , the donors of the music , and the audience of fifteen thousand has dispersed for another year . It can he said for the Goldman concerts that they are the only ones in New York to which you can listen lying down . That is no small thing ; and we take it that the impulse to lie down when one is listening to music is universal . You can see people clandestinely indulging it any night during the season in the upper galleries of the Metropolitan . The way to reach the Goldman concerts was to stroll down the Mall from East Seventy - second Street after dinner , and so come upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a picture of gentle rapture . The crowd was so still that you looked beyond it without effort to the swaying trees , green with the indescribably soft green of foliage under artificial light . If there was any humanity in you at all , you gave yourself to the night . You wandered past rows and rows of seats , across the pavement of the Mall to the grass beyond , to slide into the cool shadows of the branches and lie on your back . Only when the music died away did you sit up . Then arose a sound to which no other sound compares in mystery ; a sound like the pattering of heavy rain on the surface of a lake . It was the clapping of thousands of hands in the open air at night . Broadway is DM the Mast bit like it . And if you have not seen New York thus lying quietly and sentimentally in the open , you have still to see her in one of her very gentlest moods . Professional Tact BELIEBELIEVE it or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , was recently conducting Henry Ford through the Longfellow house in Cambridge . Mr. Ford was expecting his Lincoln car to call for him presently and to take him back into town for dinner , but as so much time passed and the automobile still failed to arrive , Mr. Ford became more and more nervous . At last Mr. Dana thought it was high time for him to intervene tactfully . " Mr. Ford , " he said in his earnest manner , " if the worst comes to the worst , I can drive you over in my flivver . " Emigre TN discussing Captain Fonck 's flight 1-last week , we failed , perhaps , to give Mr. Igor Sikorsky sufficient credit . Gnome-RhOne-Jupiter motors , French aces and American financial backers aside , if all goes well it will really be the Russian 's science in the 101-foot airplane wing , lifting a twelve-ton load of motor , plane , and fuel , which will bridge the distance between New York and Paris . Mr. Sikorsky is excessively modest . In 1919 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeronautical engineer up to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk , slipped unnoticed into the Port of New York . Subsequently , his humble start at Westbury caused some Americans to laugh . The spectacle of earnest Russian mechanics and laborers calling each other Baron , Count , or General , like inmates of an asylum , and making tools out of anything handy tickled the sensibilities of certain Long Islanders . Then Sikorsky 's big ship , the Yorktown , crashed on its test flight . Poor , he had taken what motors he could get . Since then the Yorktown with two Liberty motors has flown , they say , 75,000 miles . During the war none of Sikorsky 's planes were lost . And he built seventy-three bombers , which made 400 trips . Then he arrived penniless in America , and in seven years has come into his second fame . He is mild-mannered , clean-shaven , distinguished . Most of his family were priests . But Igor Sikorsky , at the age of ten , built an airplane in his father 's garden . Food for the Soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending , stopped to dine at the cafeteria which perches on the northeast ledge , sixteen stories up . Never has a worse cafeteria been in a better place . We forgot hours of wandering in search of something to cat ( or at least , some one who spoke English to direct us ) when we stepped out on the balcony and found New York stretched out for us to look at . It is the complaint of roof garden connoisseurs that the roofiest New York roofs are under cover ; but not so the Shelton 's , for one may sit at a table under the sky and look out over a low rail to a scene that has both charm and exhilaration . With the puritanical feeling that it would be a sacrilege merely to sit and enjoy we bent our talents on observing . There is much to see : near at hand , the battle of the East River front where monstrous prehistoric breweries , with castellated towers , jostle the smart apartment houses of Sutton and Beekman Places and beyond , the great desert of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English gardens of 10 THE NEW YORKER imaginative souls ( or their architects ) . It is a pity , however , to see how few of the available roof areas are utilized . Almost below one lies Turtle Bay , its green trees so hemmed in that it looks like a boxed plant . Far away and beyond , Queens , miles upon miles of it . The $50,000 Ritz Tower apartment will have better views , perhaps , but the Shelton 's is the best we 've had thus far with a dollar dinner . Truly Rural THE latest Prohibition skin game reported is that of the suburban bootlegger who takes the trouble to dress and act as a yokel . He inquires of gullible persons the whereabouts of the Prohibition office . This singular inquiry later leads to a naive explanation concerning an imaginary widow whose husband was an ex-saloonkeeper and who wonders whether she has the right to sell his remaining stock that still reposes in her cellar . The resourceful salesman is reported as having much success . We have even heard of two innocent young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay money in advance ( " the sight of which will fetch her " ) and let the rogue borrow their car supposedly to close the deal with the widow in private . Neither money , liquor , nor automobile have they seen since . At Midnight SEEING a floating hotel sail has always been a worth-while occupation for the poor fishes who stay at home , and seeing one of the monsters pulling out at midnight is a spectacle to rank with the early morning market scenes of Paris . Leaving all the lingo of the sea to one side , to watch a twelve-story building several blocks long move out into the middle of a river and head for England is enough to make the most self-satisfied stock broker wonder if , after all , life on the Exchange is all that it is said to be . It is enough to arouse the somnolent imagination of an insurance actuary . In the first place there is the entrance to the dock ; a concentration of blight electric lights in the gloomy vastness of West Street ; an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; uniforms , stevedores , women in expensive evening coats , and a girl in tears . Everything is full of departure  --  our remote ancestors were wanderers , says a small voice . Then comes the gangway , slanting upward , disappearing into the wall of a great hotel . It is incredible then that such a structure can move . But if you have noticed coming up the walk , there is a narrow canyon to be crossed just as you leave the shelter of the dock and before you are immersed in the atmosphere of the hotel above you ; and at ia3/4 the bottom of it is a strip of black oily water , undulating sullenly , elemental in spite of the crates and barrels that conceal it . It actually supports the deck you walk on . Salons , bridge rooms , smoking rooms , decorations of incredible sumptuousness , corridors , and stairways , and half the world in its best clothes  --  it would be comprehensible enough were it not that all of it will presently slide away sideways like the slide of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its room . Everybody you see has his hotel face on ; there is a little extra elegance in his attitude . Through open doors you see fruit baskets and flowers , brass beds , trunks ; you hear several languages . You suddenly realize that this hotel crowd is emotional . You have forgotten where you are and you wonder why . And while you are wondering and considering that emotion can and does make the most uninteresting face arresting , the walls and floor and the overstuffed furniture and the lobby oilcloth quiver to the blast of a whistle ; a gong is sounded . It is , after all , real . From then on it grows more real . You are out on the end of the pier in the night air with the familiar river at your feet . Almost in midstream rides a big tug , a sentinel , which occasionally blows its whistle in a significant way quite unlike the bray of the usual tug hurrying up and down during business hours . At midnight it blows a long blast , and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep sound of rushing water , incredibly sudden ; and with increasing speed the whole side of the city seems to leap out toward the New Jersey shore . It grows bigger , and there is the sound of distant cheering followed by a silence . Out in the river there is the huge silhouette of a boat , turning slowly . Then you go home to sleep , and in the morning , you get up and go to work . Passing WE are moved to shed a tear over the transformation of a nice greasy little place on East Eighty-sixth Street next to the Hell Gate Republican Club , which is n't , alas , what it once was . Some too well dressed women began frequenting it lately and the proprietor has gone mad with the taste of " quality " and has dressed the place all up in chintz and things . In fact , things have come to such a pass that our friends wo n't take us to such places any more unless we need a shave or look disreputable in one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell just where a little German restaurant on the East Side uptown is located . But it is a place where we were served with steins without ordering , and where we saw two ladies offered drinks by an ogling old Teuton who was immediately squelched by the proprietor in good Bavarian : " Do n't you know these ladies are n't looking for some one to buy ' em a drink ? Ca n't you toll the difference ? Ca n't you see they come from Broadway  --  and even better places ? " And a place where we drank beer with a policeman until four in the morning : a nice fatalistic cop who hates walking about in the rain looking for crime and says if a guy wants to moider a Jane he 'll do it whether he ( the cop ) is on his heat or not ; who says there are guys who ca n't be stopped moidering janes when once their mind is made up  --  a cop can make them unpunctual about it but he ca n't stop ' em ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uniform when it cost him three hundred bucks when he entered the force ; and who says he has to buy his own bullets , and so what 's the use ? Trinity Churchyard AMAN who has missed church only three Sundays in sixty-seven years ( which is the record of Trinity 's sexton , William J. Boyd ) deserves notice in this pagan city . Born almost in the shadow of the church seventy-two years ago , and progressing from Sunday school teacher to verger , to sexton , Boyd knows , of course , the story of each grave in his churchyard . There lies General Phil Kearney , the Civil War hero , there Robert Fulton , who ran the first steamboat up the Hudson , then James Lawrence , who was the first to say , " Do n't give up the ship , " and Alexander Hamilton ( buried fittingly at the head of Wall Street as the " father of American finance " ) , William Bradford , Livingston , Lewis ? and then , Charlotte Temple . Poor Charlotte Temple ! Our **30;31;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some people persist in saying , is only a heroine of fiction . Certainly , there was a novel written in 1790 by Mrs. Row-son : " Charlotte Tem-ple , a Tale of Truth . " It was all about an English schoolgirl who eloped with her lover , an English officer , came to New York , was betrayed , deserted , and died of a broken heart of course . When they were burying her in Trinity Churchyard , along came the faithless officer and urged the girl 's father , who seems to have turned up for the interment , to kill ' him and bury him also in the grave . The father refrained in spite of the provocation , and the officer could only return night after night to fling himself in sobs across the tombstone . It is part of Mr. Boyd 's serious duty to refute skeptics who look askance at this story . There is the slab , and though it has now no date of age or death upon it , only the carved name of " Charlotte Temple , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vandal , years ago , dared to steal the silver plate with all the data . And obviously , Mr. Boyd should be the final authority after his long career . Doubtless , the ghosts of the poor English schoolgirl and her ruthless but repentant soldier lover still haunt the byways of Wall and Cortlandt when bulls and bears have retired to their uptown clubs . And we can only hope he is right when he declares : " Old Trinity would hardly lend itself to the burial of mythical people . " THE STORY IS alcoholic and , we are sure , not new but it amused us . It tells of the obdurate refusal of a guest upon being urged by his week-end host to take " just one more . " The reason , the guest explained , was that he was quite cornplet . " But , " he added , " tell you what . . . . You just pour a lil over me . . . . At least I can still smell the stuff . " Room 228 NE may go on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is , for instance , a little room up on the second floor which is known as the Library 's economic division , where the fullest information is offered on stocks , bonds , and investments of all kinds . Here all day long , and at night too , men and women pore over reference volumes and papers giving the facts about the companies whose stocks are listed on the various stock exchanges . The spirit of the stock market hangs over the place , quiet as it is . Occasionally a reader who has been scribbling in a notebook , rises and rushes out to one of the telephone pay stations , presumably to give an order to his broker . No one knows or is willing to state that the market is actually played from the quiet seclusion of the Library , but it is easy to imagine so , for the files are kept up to date , and the books , papers , and cards containing the much-sought information are never idle .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
