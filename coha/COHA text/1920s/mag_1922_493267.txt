ably upon experience , that the scientific sceptic himself must accept . The inadequacy of Arnold 's answer must not blind us to the fact that no more fruitful and sagacious question has ever been asked . One after another he takes the conceptions of Christian faith and translates them into the language of human experience and salutary con ? sequence . The points of view of science and of biblical research he supplements with that of hu ? mane history and letters . What he does not ade ? quately take is the point of view of religion itself . He is moralistic , not sufficiently spiritual . There are sides of religious experience lighting up the whole problem of which he knows too little . He can even write of the idea that God is personal , " a being who thinks and loves , " that the stress upon it is due to the Aryan love of metaphysics , not to Hebrew religion at all , that it has no deep value for human life . Still , his statement of the question of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer , are work of a states ? manlike courage and grasp that have not been sufficiently acknowledged . The truth is that be ? cause Arnold wrote on the most deep-reaching problems with a sustained simplicity of language and of touch academic scholars have at no time fully perceived his power as a philosopher . AFTER Mr. Bryan had confounded the evolu ? tionists , and Voliva the astronomers , it was only fitting that some equally fearless knight should stride forth in righteous wrath and annihilate that other group of pseudo-scientists known as " intelligence testers . " Mr. Walter Lipp ? mann , alone and unaided , has performed just this service . That it took six rambling articles to do the job is unimportant . It is done . The world is deeply in debt to Mr. Lippmann . So are the psy ? chologists , if they only knew it , for henceforth they should know better than to waste their lives mon ? keying with those silly little " puzzles " or juggling IQ 's and mental ages . What have intelligence testers done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what have they not done ? They have enunciated , ex cathedra , in the guise of fact , law and eternal verity , such high ? ly revolutionary and absurd doctrines as the fol ? lowing ; to wit : ( f ) That the strictly average representative of the genus homo is not a particularly intellectual animal ; ( 2 ) that some members of the species are much stupider than others ; ( 3 ) that school prodigies are usually brighter than school laggards ; ( 4 ) that college professors are more intelli ? gent than janitors , architects than hod-carriers , railroad presidents than switch-tenders ; and ( most heinous of all ) ( 5 ) that the offspring of socially , economic ? ally and professionally successful parents have bet-ter mental endowment , on the average , than the offspring of said janitors , hod-carriers and switch-tenders . These are indeed dangerous doctrines , sub ? versive of American democracy . The crime of the " intelligence testers " is made worse by the fact that they have attempted to gain credence for their nefarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do not understand . It is true that some of these doctrines-had been voiced before , but as long as they were ex ' pressed in ordinary language they passed as mere opinion and did little harm . But to talk about mental differences in terms of IQ 's , or to reckon mental inheritance in terms of a " . so coefficient of resemblance between parent and offspring , " is a far more serious matter . In the interest of freedom of opinion there ought to be a law passed forbidding the encroachment of quantitative methods upon those fields which from time immemorial have been reserved for the play of sentiment and opinion ' For example , why should not one be allowed to take his political or social theory as he takes his religion , without having it all mixed up with IQ 's , probable errors and coefficients of correlation ? At any rate , it will not do to let the idea get abroad that human beings differ in any such vital trait as ability to think , comprehend , reason ; or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of anyone ever being able measure them . If the psychologists should suc " ceed in getting the intelligentsia to swallow this vanity-satisfying doctrine , who knows that theY WOuld not next succeed in putting over a system of ' Plural voting based upon intelligence indices ( to be determined by these self-same psychologists ) ? Ab ? surd ? By no means . Suppose , for example , they should somehow manage to give a test to the mem ? bers of Congress ( it might be done without their knowing it ) and should then shrewdly award to each and every one a flatteringly high IQ . Sheer instinct on the part of the recipients could be de ? Pended upon to do the rest . Let there be no misapprehension ; the principle ? f democracy is at stake . The essential thing about a democracy is not equality of opportunity , as some foolish persons think , but equality of mental en d ? wrnent . Where would our American democracy be if it should turn out that people differ in intel ligence as they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appear that he had dis covered a method of triangulating everybody 's in tellectual altitude ? The argument of the psychol ? gists that they would use their method in the dis covery and conservation of talent , among rich and Poor alike , is brazen camouflage . They do n't care a twirl-o ' - your- thumb about the conservation of talent . Their real purpose is to set up a neo al.lstocracy , more snobbish , more tyrannical and on every count more hateful than any that has yet burdened the earth . Inasmuch as the psychologists knoll ' their little " puzzle " stunts better than any ? fle else can hope to know them , they are doubtless entertaining ambitious visions of themselves forming the cap stone of this new political and social structure . As Mr. Lippmann well says , " if the tester could make good his claim that his tests test intelligence he would soon occupy a position of f ? Wer which no intellectual has held since the colmotivated of theocracy . " In short , the whole thing is ' ? tivated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were penetrating the : ea of this crafty cult . We have been entirely t line deleted this very moment . Hardly had the old govern ? ment of Germany crashed , when the educational lauthorities of the newly established republic al ? t/Wed the psychologists to launch a wild orgy of litelligence testing in the schools . The orgy con-tinue th s unabated . The ostensible purpose is to sift the schools for superior talent in order to give it a chance to make the most of itself , in whatever - aturn of society it may be found . The psychol-is pretend that they are trying to break up is th ? Id Prussian caste system . They are not . It d e Impulse Imperious . If the German people 2 : ' t Wake up they will soon find themselves in the grip of a super-junker caste that will out-junker anything Prussia ever turned loose . England and : the other European countries are in similar danger . The conspiracy has even spread to Australia , . South Africa and Japan . It is world-wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing red ; also , that seeing red is not very con ? ducive to seeing clearly . The impassioned tone of these six articles gives their case away . Clearly , something has hit the bull's-eye of one of Mr. Lippmann 's emotional complexes . From the con ? centration of attack upon me one would infer that ' I had caused all the trouble , even to the point of seducing such an eminent psychologist as William McDougall . If such is the case , my responsibility is very great , for a majority of the psychologists of America , England and Germany are now en ? rolled in the ranks of the " intelligence testers , " and all but a handful of the rest use their results . The six articles are introduced by the editors of the New Republic as a critical " analysis and esti ? mate of intelligence tests . " As it turns out , the estimate is considerably more in evidence than the analysis . The former rings out clearly in every paragraph ; the latter , when it is not downright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ? ever , that Mr. Lippmann thinks he has a mission to perform and that the end justifies the means . This is not an accusation ; it is a charitable way of explaining his misuse of facts and quotations . The validity of intelligence tests is hardly a ques ? tion the psychologist would care to debate with Mr. Lippmann ; nor is there any reason to engage in so profitless a venture . It is only necessary to examine casually a few samples of his allegations . in order to show what weight they should carry. * Sample No. i . The belief that our draftees in the war had an average mental age of only four teen years rests entirely upon the mental age stand ? ards embodied in the Stanford Revision of the Billet tests . These standards were based upon a mere handful of samplings and are entirely over thrown by the army results . The army tests have " knocked the Stanford Revision into a cocked hat . " As a matter of fact , the belief in question does not rest at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent age norms have several times been derived for the army tests by applying them to large groups of unselected school children . I have presented some of these norms in the very report from which Mr. Lippmann quotes a few of the facts he is unable to interpret . ' ' Such * His allegations are here stated in highly condensed form , as the text is much too verbose for literal quotation . t Psychological Examining in the United States Army . Vol. 15 , National Academy of Science Memoirs , p. 536 ff .. THE NEW , independently derived norms for the Alpha test , for the Beta test and for the Yerkes-Bridges Point Scale ( all used in the army ) , agree with the Stan ? ford-Binet in the verdict as to average mental age of our drafted soldiers . On every kind of test that was employed , even the most non-verbal , the aver ? age score earned by draftees was less than that earned by average fourteen-year-old school chil ? , dren . Psychologists are not entirely agreed as to how this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point Those who accept the army data at their face value think that the " Fourteen-Year " tests of the Stanford-Binet should be renamed " Average Adult " tests . The possible desirability of such renaming has no bearing whatever on the average mental age of soldiers or , for that matter , . on the validity of the Stanford tests as a measure of intelligence . Sample No. 2 . The intelligence rating earned by a soldier was determined chiefly by the time limits used in giving the tests . The effects of increased time limits were thor ? , oughly investigated by the Division of Psychology , ' Surgeon General 's Office . The results of the ex ? periment , which was carried out under my direc ? tion by Dr. Mark A. May , are stated in the fol ? lowing words : " In general , then , we have no rea ? son to assume that an extension of time limits would have improved the test or have given an opportunity to many individuals materially to alter their ratings . " * In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlated with scores earned by the same group on double time to the extent of .965 . This means , of course , that the top five percent by one method included almost exactly the same men as were in the top five percent by the other method , and similarly for a cross section in any range of the score distribution . These facts are to be found just three pages from a statement which Mr. Lippmann takes out of its setting and quotes in a manner certain to mislead . Sample No 3 . The symmetrical distribution of IQ 's resulting from application of the Stanford-Binet to unselected children is no proof whatever of the validity of the test . Perfectly true and perfectly irrelevant . I have never made such a claim , although Mr. Lippmann tries to give the impression that I have It is true , as he asserts , that coin-tossing gives an even more symmetrical curve of distribution . Mr. Lippmann uses this illustration in order to suggest that in ? telligence score distributions , like those for coin- tossing , are mainly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not quite as chancy as that . " ) - What are the facts ? Over and over again the * Psychological Examining in the U. S. Army , p. 416. // experiment has been made of testing a large grouP of children twice , with an interval of several days , or months , or even years between the tests . Each pupil 's original score is then paired with his later score , and a correlation coefficient is computed for the two series of tests . If the scores were due to chance , the resulting correlations would of course be .00 . Actually they are nearly always above .8o , and occasionally above .9o . If Mr. Lippmantv will make two one-thousand series of coin-tosses and then correlate the results of the two series by pairing first toss with first toss , second toss with second toss , etc. , he will get , not .8o or .90 , but .00 , plus or minus a small probable error . Sample No. 4 . The tests are doubtless useful in classifying school children , but this is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or possibly it depends uP ? 11 one 's definition of intelligence . Most of us have uncritically taken it for granted that Children wh ? attend school eight or ten years without passing the fourth grade or surmounting long division , are probably stupider than children who lead their classes into high school at twelve years and int ? college at sixteen . Mr. Lippmann contends that we ca n't tell anything about how intelligent either one of these children is until he has lived out his life . Therefore , for a lifetime , at least , Mr. LiPP ' mann considers his position impregnable Sample No. 5 . Although intelligence tests are capable of rendering valuable service in classifying school children , they are in great danger of becoln : ing an " engine of cruelty " by being turned into a method of stamping ai permanent sense of feriority upon the soul of the child . " Nothing could be more contemptible than to ? etc. , etc . Mr. Lippmann does not charge that the tests have been thus abused , but that they easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . That iS one of the recognized rules of the game . Is n't it funny what horrible possibilities an excited brain can conjure up ? I recall a patient who had worked himself into a wretched stew from thinking 10 terrible it would be if butchers by concerted action all over the country , should suddenly take it int ? their heads to slaughter their unsuspecting Cus ' tomers . He was actually determined to get a lalt passed that would deprive these potential murder ' ers of their edged and pointed tools . Sample No. 6 . There is no proof that mental traits are inherited . Goddard thought he had proved it for mental deficiency , but Cattell goes ; lions his evidence . Galton thought he had proved it for , genius , but Cattell does n't seem to think 1110 " of that proof either . Note how cleverly Mr. Lippmann strives for December 27 , 1922 THE NEW effect by playing off one psychologist against an other . He resorts to this frequently . The trick is Very simple ; all you do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original setting and quote it in a setting made to order . In that way you can have all the expert opinion on your side . Mr. Bryan is Said to use this method with telling effect against the evolutionists . Not that psychologists do n't Sometimes disagree , even as doctors do . It would be a sorry outlook for their young science if they did not . But when the outsider comes along and tries to make capital out of such differences , it is Well to be on one 's guard . In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it means that an unfair advantage is being taken both of the reader and of the author quoted . Think , for example , of Mr. Lippmann 's quoting Cattell in support of his tirade against in telligence testing ? Cattell , the pupil of Galton , the father of mentality testing in America , the in ? ventor of new methods for the study of individual differences , the author of important studies ( in Progress ) on the inheritance of genius ! Sample No. 7 . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph , always with signs of greatly increased blood pressure . ) The intelligence tests do n't test pure intelligence . Any appearance to the contrary is due to " a subtle sta- tistical illusion . " The psychologist 's assumption that his questions and his puzzles can in fifty min-hies isolate abstract intelligence is vanity . " It is tor L se than vanity ; it is an attempt to restore the " ' doctrine of predestination and infant damnation " n favor of an " intellectual caste system , " etc. , etc . It is evident that Jack has prepared an imposing giant for the slaughter . No matter that it is stuffed W ith straw or that it is set up in a fashion to make ' t the easy victim of a few vigorous puffs of super ? Lli , ! ated atmosphere . As a matter of fact , all the ' T , 11felligence testers " will readily agree with Mr. ' 117 ) Pmann that their tests do not measure simon Pure intelligence , but always native ability plus ? Iither things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the other things affect the score . Hownearly all the psychologists believe that native , ability counts very heavily . Mr. Lippmann doesn't. e prefers to believe that more probably an in ? , iviclual 's IQ is determined by what happens to him ine the nursery before the age of four years , in con- tetion with the " creative opportunities which the parents and nurse girls improved or missed or bungled " 1 After all , if our experiences in the Ilursery p J gave us our emotional complexes , as the endians say , why should n't they have determined our IQ 's at the same time ? ? , lie wonders why Mr. Lippmann , holding this belief , did not suggest that we let up on higher education and pour our millions into kindergartens and nurseries . For , really and truly , high IQ 's are not to be sneezed at . The difference between so IQ and so IQ is the difference between an in ? dividual who will be able , if he half tries , to grad ? uate from college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual who at that age can hard ? ly do long division , make change for four cents out of twenty-five or name the months of the year . Even the difference betwen roc ) IQ and 75 IQ is the difference between the ability to graduate from high school or possibly from college , and inability to do even first year of high school work satisfac torily . And just to think that we have been allowing all sorts of mysterious , uncontrolled , chance influences in the nursery to mould children 's IQ 's , this way and that way , right before our eyes . It is high time that we were investigating the IQ effects of different kinds of baby-talk , different versions of Mother Goose , and different makes of pacifiers and safety pins . If there is any possibility of identify . ing , weighing and bringing under control these IQ stimulants and depressors , we can well afford to throw up every other kind of scientific research until the job is accomplished . That problem once solved , the rest of the mysteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's of I 8o or 200 . Does not Mr. Lippmann owe it to the world to abandon his role of critic and to enter this en ? chanting field of research ? He may safely be as ? sured that if he unravels the secret of turning low 1Q 's into high ones , or even into moderately higher ones , his fame and fortune are made . If he could guarantee to raise certified roo 's to certified 140 's , or even certified 80 's to certified zoo 's , nothing but premature death or the discovery and publication of his secret would keep him out of the Rockefeller Ford class if he cared to achieve it . I know of a certain modern Croesus who alone would probably be willing to start him off with ten or twenty mil ? lion if he could only raise one particular little girl from about 6o to 70 to a paltry zoo or so . Of course , if this man had only understood the secrets of " creative opportunity " in the nursery , he might have had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter were put up to him in the right way he would he willing to endow for Mr. Lipp ? mann a Bureau of Nursery Research for the En ? hancement of the IQ ? If Mr. Lippmann gets this Bureau started there are several questions I shall want to submit to it for solution . Some of these have been bothering me for a long time . One is , why both high and low IQ 's are so often found in children Of the same family and of the same nursery . To be sure , parental habits change more or less as children come and grow up ; nurse girls arrive and depart ; toys wear out . The problem admittedly is com ? plex , but by successive experiments in which one factor after another was kept constant while the others were varied , the evil and beneficent influ ? ences might gradually be sorted out . Next , I should want to propose a minute com ? parative study of the influences operative in our California Japanese nurseries and those of our California Portuguese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lippmann can get together , for notwithstanding the apparent similarity of nursery environment in the two cases , the IQ results are markedly different . Our average Portuguese child carries through school and into life an IQ of about 8o ; the average Japanese child soon develops an IQ not far below that of the average California white child of Nordic descent . In this case the nurse girl factor is eliminated ; one might almost say , the nursery itself . But of course there are the toys , which are more or less differ ? ent . It is also conceivable that the more liquid Latin tongue exerts a sedative effect on infants ' minds as compared with the harsher Japanese lan ? guage , which may be stimulating in comparison . Another problem would relate to the IQ resem ? blance of identical twins as compared with that of fraternal twins . The latest and most extensive investigation of this problem* indicates a consider ? ably greater IQ resemblance for the former than for the latter . This is a real poser ; which I leave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B a Stanford student and not yet published . A LL of a sudden , when he is sitting at work or aimlessly musing , or wakeful in the night , he knows his visitor has come . She is well inside the room , though not clear to his perceiving .

Already he has be ' come aware of something faintly luminous , to ' ' vague for form , at the entrance . White things with wings they seem to him , like the one already with him . She helps them over the threshold , one and another .
