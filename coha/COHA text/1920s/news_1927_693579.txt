The text of the letter follows : You will find enclosed contract for 1927 which I am returning unsigned because of the $52,000 salary figure . I am leaving Los Angeles Feb. 26 to see you in New York and will be prepared to report at St. Petersburg , but only on the basis of $100,000 per year for two years , plus refund of $7,700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you are entitled to know what terms I honestly expect and therefore the figure is not padded with intentions of accepting less . Nor is it based on the suggestions I have received from thousands of fans nor from newspaper articles that have appeared in many parts of the country , but on what I feel I am worth from past performance and prospects . In fine physical condition today , I hope to play as good a game or better than last season . I have exercised all Winter and for the past twelve weeks have been working out of doors . At my own expense I have brought Arthur from New York to condition me . The New York club has profited from five of the best years of my baseball life . During that period my earning power to the club has greatly increased , while my salary has remained unchanged . According to baseball custom , if 1926 had been a poor playing year my salary for 1927 would now most likely be reduced . If I were in any other business I would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rival employers could bid tor my services . Baseball law forces me to work for the New York club or remain idle , but it does noto prevent a man from being paid for his value as a " business getter " as well as for his mechanical services . During the Winter season I book my own exhibition games and without support from other professional players I have received more in three weeks than the New York club pays me in three months . The New York club plays more exhibition games than any club in baseball , but I receive nothing for such games . All your exhibition contracts oblige me to play and as you do not have to guarantee the appearance of any other player it is evident what other managements think of box office values . Taking all these things into consideration , I sincerely believe I am entitled to *100,000 per season . I realize your expense and risks and want to be fair and friendly , as you have always been to me , I have made no threats to quit baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept your figure I will be prohibited from playing with any other club and barred from baseball , regardless of my own desires . I have refused to discuss my new contract or salary during the Winter , but now that I have returned the contract unsigned an explanation will be expected . and I wish you would show this letter to any newspaper writer who may ask to see it .

Ruth is scheduled to meet the Yankee owner on Wednesday . Rogers Hornsby of the Giants is the highest paid National League player , receiving $40,000 .
