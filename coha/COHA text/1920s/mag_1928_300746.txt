New Bedford , Mass. , is a city of some 120,000 inhabitants . Ordinarily , it is a pleasant and prosperous city to live in . Dominating its industrial life , chief support of its storekeepers and its landlords , are , of course , its famed cotton textile mills . And since the War , New Bedford mills have done exceedingly well , declaring cash dividends of over $32,000,000 , stock dividends of about half that sum . They employ 35,000 operatives . They produce a high grade of cloth , so high that they are virtually free from the competition of Southern mills . <P> Only one thing has troubled the serenity of New Bedford . Wages of the textile operatives , averaging $19 a week , were undeniably low . And when the mill owners announced , early last April , that wages were to be cut by 10% , reducing the average wage to $17 a week , the workers were stirred to serious and active protest . Out of 27 mills walked some 27,000 operatives , spinners and weavers , loom fixers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 looms . <P> Last week , the 16th of the dogged strike , New Bedford industry remained at a standstill , rents remained unpaid , stores were without customers , national guardsmen cleaned their rifles . In the greatest labor protest in the history of the textile city , strikers had lost some $9,600,000 in wages , at the staggering rate of $600,000 a week . Mill securities had fallen to purely nominal values , a few dollars a share . Both owners and strikers had rejected arbitration , had agreed without hope to allow the State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation to ' " investigate . " So far as New Bedford could see , the strike might last until winter . If the strikers could find fuel , it might last until another summer , indefinitely . <P> Surprisingly , the once-prosperous city takes its financial troubles cheerfully . <P> Back of the strikers are a united press and a supporting clergy . Landlords accept the total loss of rents without grumbling . In spite of hard times , merchants keep on extending credit , postponing payments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and police departments , but New Bedford firemen and policemen contribute to the strikers ' funds from their own pockets . <P> And in this idyllic era of goodwill , the strikers themselves have played model parts . Not a single crime , major or minor , has marred the dignity of their protest . Many a spinner , wearying of charity , has reverted to the occupation of New Bedford 's colonial days . Borrowing or building a boat , he has gone fishing , bringing in a catch he could market in the city . Gravely , the strikers ' womenfolk gather in the streets to discuss the day 's events in a babel of tongues . Never has the U. S. seen such a rebellion . <P> Both groups , striker and citizen , recognize the danger which hangs over the city . Last week , it loomed menacingly . To New Bedford had come a strike leader of a new type , with different and dangerous ideas . To the history of textile troubles in Passaic , N. J. , Albert Weisbord* has contributed many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form the Textile Mills Committee , the heads of the old unions were disturbed . Weisbord 's ideas were of violence and force , parades and riots . Public sympathy , most surprisingly with the strikers , might well be destroyed by violent methods .
