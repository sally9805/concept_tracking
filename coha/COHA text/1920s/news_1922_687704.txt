txt Acting on information that the present building boom would be halted shortly because prices in the building material market had got beyond all control , the Lockwood committee yesterday empowered Samuel Untermyer , its counsel , to draw up a memorial to Congress asking for emergency legislation which will permit foreign building materials to . enter this country on a tariff based on the cost of manufacture and adjusted so as to assure Anierica.n industry reasonable profits , but not " gouging profits . " Mr. Untermyer will draw up the memorial , which will give the costs of manufacturing and producing brick , cement , sand and other building materials , together with the duty according to the Underwood tariff , the duty as proposed in the Fordney tariff , and the suggested changes by the Lockwood committee . So long as the building material manufacturers were permitted to profiteer at the expense of the housing boom , said Mr. Tinterrnyer  --  in proposing the remedy of a memorial to Congress , the building boom in this city , as well as in the entire country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union exactions with the building material profiteering in his summary of the causes that would halt construction , calling attention to the testimony regarding the unstable wage in the building trades , but he'declared that the material situation was far more important than the labor situation .. Wage " Snowballing " Halts Building . The remarks of counsel were made after the committee had taken testimony showing that large building operators in Brooklyn , engaged in vast construction enterprises , were ready to quit all construction when pending contracts were completed because of the " snowballing " of wages by workers . It was also reported that the main obstacle to the $10,000,000 building project by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was the high cost of materials . Because of the practices of Wood , Wire and Metal Leathers 6 of Brooklyn , which Mr. Untermyer declared were " ' criminal and illegal . " he announced he would recommend that the testimony taken against the union be sent to the Grand Jury . The sugwstien of an emergency tariff remedy for saving the housing boom now in progress was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Untermyter , who pointed to the exceptional activity in building operations and discussed the obstacles in the way of a continuance of the pnssent activity . " The brick market has gone beyond control , " he said . " I do not believe that the dealers are responsible . for it . I believe that-the manufacturers ' are responsible . The yards are not being operated to anything like their capacity . The operations were not started sufficiently early and the stocks ' ere not accumulated before the yards closed for the Winter . Whether this was ? by design and arranmetnent we have not yet ascertained . but we are investigating and hope to get at the bottom of the reason 1* the exceptional situation whereby the yards were closed without the usual supply of brick on hand for the Winter . " Because of the great building activity the price of brick had gone up to $24 or $25 a thousand , while the cost of manufacture was $11 , according to the books of companies examined by the committee . Charges of Profiteering in Brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lower todai than when the committee looked into it and declared " there has been worse profiteering than that going on now in the building material market . " Either the building material manufacturers had not the capacity to cope with the present situation in view of the exceptional activity and the shortage is due to that cause , or it was clue " to some sort of secret arrangement whereby the price is being boosted . In either event , the cause had to be overcome . " And this is the way I recommend being pursued by the committee and being . instantly pursued , " he added . " The , way is to address a memorial to Congress asking that there be an emergency measure introduced fixing the tariff on building materials at figures that will allow a reasonable and legitimate profit and allow it to come in from the other side . There is no dearth of material , brick , cement and other material , to be had on the other side . They can - come in ballast under certain conditions . The cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they should not be allowed to come in . Brick , for instance , could come in on a basis of a tariff duty that would enable us to buy them at the ballast here , at $14 a thousand . That will allow the brick manufacturers here ? a legitimate profit , a yvry substantial profit , and the same thing- is true of cement anti of a great variety of building materials , because if our own people here can not or will not supply the demand or are holding up building construction , there is not only a justification but a need for allowing this merchandise to come here protected only by a tariff sufficient to give our people a reasonable profit and not a profiteering , gouging profit . It ought not to be , and I do not think we should allow it to continue longer , because if it is continued longer , it is going to paralyze this movement that is well on the way and which would continue on the way toward curing the housing shortage , not only in the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can not build unless you get materials down to a reasonable figure , because , in the first place , the rents will be prohibitive and in the second place , people will not lend money on inflated cost of building . " I propose to take the present act under which we are now operating , covering building materials  --  the act that is now before Congress , adding a proper duty an . dask that action be not held to await the settlement of the entire tariff bill but that action upon certain leading items of building materials shall be taken now by Congress as an emergency measure . Then housing construction would not be dependent upon the present situation . " Union Fixes Prices . The first witness of the day was Edward Auglen , of 286 Lexington Avenue . Brooklyn , financial secretary and treasurer of Wood , Wire and Metal Lathers ' Union No. 6 , who testified that the rule providing one apprentice for fifty journeymen " was not lived up to . " Mr. Untermyer read into the record the by-laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price for lathing and plaster boards as well as labor . The by-laws revealed that nobody could " make a contract to put on plaster boards " unless lie were a union member , and that builders were not allowed to engage ' their own journeymen lathers , but had to do business with boss contractors who were members of the union . Apprentices as young as 17 were paid at the same scale as veteran workers , the witness testified . Mr. Untermyer brought out that under its rules employing lathers were fined by the union for breaking the by-laws and were sometimes barred from continuing as boss lathers and forced to revert to the status of journeymen . A man could not become a boss lather unless he had been a journeyman . The witness could not say why the union was " a closed corporation , " furnishing men only to employers who were in the association . He thought the idea of having the bosses in the union was legal and said that Evart L. Prentiss , a lawyer of 74 Broadway . had advised the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any illegal rules pointed out by the committee . William Cohen of 1,200 East New York Avenue , Brooklyn , a former boss lather , now a journeyman , said that he had been approached by some employers who wanted to get out of the union but were afraid to do so because they felt they would be unable to get union labor . Auglen was recalled and questioned concerning the rule of the union preventing boss lathers from " butting in on other bosses ' work . " He said the rule had been in existence forty years , and Mr. Untermyer charged that under the rule once a boss lather was hired by a builder the latter had to use the same man " forever . " Club Held Over Employers . Joseph Feldstein , a boss lather , of 406 Chester Street , Brooklyn , said that the union compelled the employers to remain as members because if they got out a general strike would be called on their jobs in the event they used non-union men . They could obtain union men only if they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the union , but were compelled to rejoin . They had made requests to leave the union several times , he added , but the requests were nver put to a vote . He said the union teas dominated by James Shepherd of 842 Macon . Street , Brooklyn , business agent and " Czar " of the lathers . Shepherd refused to wave immunity and was excused . " I will not take- any more contracts under present conditions , " said Joseph Aaron , a Brooklyn builder , now engaged in completing 125 one and two-family houses , in referring to the exactions of the plasterers , bricklayers and other unions in Brooklyn . A saving of $300,000 to Brooklyn builders on plastering work done in one operation embracing more than 2,500 one and two-family houses was instanced by Aaron , who testified that the Lockwood committee had forced Operative Plasterers ' Union No. 6 in Brooklyn to rescind a by-law calling for three coats of plaster when two had always been applied on one and we-family houses . Aaron said that in his eighteen years of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two-family houses . Recently the Operative Plasterers ' Union No.60 in Brooklyn to rescind a a rule calling for three coats of plaster , one of which was unnecessary , he said . The additional coat added about $110 to $140 to the cost of a small building , of which 70 per cent . represented labor and the remainder material . The law provides that three coats be applied to tenements and public buildings . It was estimated by Mr. Untermyer that the total saving to builders in Brooklyn because of the rescinding of the rule was $500,000 . How " Snowballing " Works . The shortage of plasterers , according to Aaron , has resulted in " snowballing " practices by which plasterers and bricklayers received up to $12 and $14 a day instad of the $9 paid bricklayers and $10 to plasterers according to the wage scale . " Few houses will be begun if such practices continues , " he said . " I will keep on and finish the houses I have contracted for but will not take any more contrkacts . Other men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wages is essential if prosperity is to continue . " James B. Allen . business agent of the Brooklyn Plasterers ' Union , refused to waive immunity and was excused . John Sutherland of 250 Wyckoff Street , Brooklyn , Recording Secretary of the plasterers ' union , suggested that the only way to stop " snowballing " practices by the union men was for the employers to refuse to pay the higher wages , but , he said , the employers were offering the men additional pay , and as there was no agreement between the plasterers and the employers the men were taking as much as they could get . Some time ago , he said , the employers signed a voluntary statement to the effect that they would pay the workers $10 a day , but the agreement was one-sided and did not bind the ' workingmen to work for no more than $10 a day . He admitted there would be no wage stability until there was a contract which would bind both sides equally to pay and receive a certain wage for a stated period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . to agree to work for no more than $10 a day " they would say they are out for all they can get . " The witnesses estimated that 70 per cent . of the SOO members of his union were receiving a wage higher than the $10 scale . He said the builders themselves were to blame for " snowballing. " and declared the condition could not be remedied until the builders and contractors joined to refuse to pay excess wages . He admitted that the revocation of the three-coat. plastering rule I had saved builders $500,000 . The committee will meet at 10:30 this morning at the City Hall .
