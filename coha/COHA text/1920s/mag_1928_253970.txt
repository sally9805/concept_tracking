Historians of another century will record the rise of the Ku Klux Klan during the " World War , " and its fall thereafter , according to humor . A Carlyle will call it a peculiarly malignant form of social indigestion , where avaricious scoundrels milked a large and ignorant public of great sums in " membership fees , " in return for inflaming mass prejudices against <P> 20,000,000 Foreigners <P> 16,000,000 Catholics <P> 10,000,000 Negroes <P> 4,000,000 Jews <P> or nearly half the U.

" <P> The repetitious , childlike pomposity of this " edict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mental calibre , for with the edict went a rider . Wizard Evans , who gained his knowledge of human nature as a dentist , had invented the " Knights of the Forest " as a painless method of extracting $1 from each &; every Klansman . Salaries had to be paid , and it would have been unwise to levy an unembellished assessment . The " Knights of the Forest , " therefore , constituted an obligatory degree palliated by the following ritual :
