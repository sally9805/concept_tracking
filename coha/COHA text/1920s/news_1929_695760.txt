txt Will Rogers Defends Boy Who Ran the Wrong Way 2'o the Editor of Mc Nov York Tinics . Everybody is a-picking on that poor boy out there in California that run the wrong way with that football . If I was an editorial writer I would ask how many out of the hundred and ten million of the rest of us are headed the wrong way ? How many out of us have even had presence of mind enough to pick up a fumble ? How many grabbed out of the scramble what they think is success and do n't know till they reach the goal line whether it 's the right one or not ? So come on , preachers , hop on this as your text . All I want is 10 per cent of that Sunday 's collection to get this boy a medal for at least doing something different from one million other college boys . Even if it was wrong , his mind was n't standardized . Yours , WILL ROGERS . New York , Jan. 3.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
