" I congratulate you heartily on your victory and extend to you my sincere good wishes for your health and happiness , and for the success of your administration . <P> Alfred Smith . " <P> Doom came to the President-reject in a cavernous Manhattan armory . He went to it , with a plentiful supply of cigars , from his wife 's birthday party , a strange party over which had hung the atmosphere of a tremendous uncertainty . <P> He sat down among some 700 other anticipants , most of them Tammany politicians but with a sprinkling of the general public . A girl , just " a " girl , had the chair next him . He had never seen her before , did not know her name ( Edna Ryder ) but he talked with her from time to time . He looked thoughtful , years older than when he voted in the morning . He heard the encouraging early bulletins and the later , foreboding ones , without comment . <P> " The man who gives it must be ready to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " There is n't any doubt about it now . Hoover is elected . " <P> He went back to the Biltmore to see Mrs. Smith . She had been crying , but smiled when she saw him . Others there could not stop crying . " Now , now , do n't do that , " he said . He was smiling , with a white daisy in his buttonhole . <P> He went over to the General Motors Building to telegraph Mr. Hoover and say goodnight to Mr. Raskob . John William Davis was there , smiling . " We 're used to it , " said Mr. Davis . " Maybe 25 years from now- " <P> Empty Measure . If it is bitter to lose the Presidency , how much more bitter it must have been to lose one 's right to run for the Presidency . His supposed ability to carry mighty New York had been the President-reject 's right-to-run . Many a Democrat had regarded the Smith candidacy of 1928 as a test of what might be in 1932 . Among more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York was not numerically enormous . But psychologically it loomed as the terminus of the brief , embattled Smith leadership in the national Democracy . It silenced any reproaches that might have been uttered against the party-faithless South . The victories in Massachusetts and Rhode Island only intensified the disappointment in New York . If those people had voted for him , and if arch-Republican Connecticut had come within 40,000 of chiming in , why had his own people forsaken him ? The four times they had sent him to Albany , his plurality in New York City had always been about half a million . That would probably have been enough this time , at least to give him a start towards Washington . <P> Evidently a man could be a hero at home so long as he did not leave home . There was , of course , talk that Tammany Hall had " laid down " on the man that tried to outgrow it . But no such talk came from the man . He knew that people think differently about their Governor and their President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that politics is not an exact science .
