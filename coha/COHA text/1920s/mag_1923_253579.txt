" Big Jim " Larkin , Irish labor agitator , who was pardoned from Sing ' Sing by Governor Al Smith of New York after having served more than two years of a ten year sentence for criminal anarchy , was deported to Ireland . <P> He sailed as a steerage passenger on the White Star liner Majestic , disillusioned but cheerful . At Ellis Island one of the attendants jokingly inquired for his baggage . " Everything I own is on my back , " said Larkin .
