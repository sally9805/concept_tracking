Dr. John Stella , Coroner ' of Westchester County , and Captain Andrew Monroe of the Harrison police believe the young man committed suicide , but they are puzzled to find a motive and are inclined to believe that he killed himself because of an altercation with , somebody before he returned to the Hogan residence at 5:30 o'clock on the ' morning of the days he was found dead.1 Lieutenant ' Parsons had lived with his aunt and her eon , Arthur P. Hogan , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit of the American army with which he served in the World War .

By questioning persons at the Hogan home yesterday Dr. Stella and Captain Monroe learned that at about 3:30 o'clock Thursday morning Lieutenant Parsons rode up to the servants ' entrance and rang the bell . A cook came he the door and found the young man bleeding from a wound under his right eye . He was trying to stop the flow of blood with his handkerchief , and when the cook opened the door leading to the servants ' quarters , Lieutenant Parsons asked her to give him a ' towel . When the cook had given him the towel , she said , the young man requested her to open the front door of the house , and as she closed the back door behind her , she said , he drove his automobile over to the garage on the estate , about three hundred feet from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the house until Mr. Parsons came in , and as he started across the foyer in the direction of the stairway leading to his room on the second floor i she noticed that his evening clothes were rumpled aS though he had been in a struggle . She said his . pleated evening shirt was covered with bloodstains and there were , marks as though somebody had clutched the shirt bosom in his hand . She asked him if he wished her to call his cousin , Mr. Hogan , who was asleep in another part of the house , but , according to the cook , he admonished her not to do so and to say nothing about his appearance . Went Upstairs Sobbing . As Parsons started up tite stairs leading to his room , the police say the cook informed them , . he began to sob , but evidently realizing he might arouse his aunt or her son , he regained control of himself , and the cook heard nothing more from him . When Mr. Hogan was preparing to start for business in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stella and Captain Monroe , he went to the door of his cousin 's room and knocked several times . The Lieu- tenant did not respond at first , but when Mr. Hogan rapped louder the young lawyer coaled : " Who 's there ? " " It 's Arthur , Henry , " Mr. Hogan replied . " Are you going to the city this morning ? " " No . Arthur , " Parsons is quoted as having replied . " I do n't feel well today and I believe I will stay in my room a few hours . " Mr. Hogan said he then joined his mother at breakfast and nothing more was thought of the incident , for Mr. Parsons frequently remained away from his office for two or three days at a time . When he did not appear for luncheon about 2 o'clock in the afternoon , ' however , his aunt sent one of The servants to his room to inform him of the hour . The servant returned in about , ten minutes and told Mrs. Hogan that Mr. Parsons . did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was locked . Mrs. Hogan then sent the butler to Parsons 's room , but he got no response . The butler later told the authorities that he then peered through the keyhole and discovered that Parsons was not in his room . Then ' he went to the bathroom , about twenty feet from the young man 's room . ' When he pus. , ed open the door he discovered Lieutenant Parsons lying in the bathtub , which was filled with water to within two inches of the top , with his legs partly over the side ' of the tub , and his head entirely submerged . Bullet Passed Through Head , The butler and another man servant pulled the young man 's body out of the bathtub , and found he was dead .

When the policeman began to examine the body Dr. Corwin pointed out the wound under the dead man 's right eye . Dr. Corwin said the wound was received hours before death . On the arrival of Coroner Stella . lie ordered the police to search the young man 's effects to see if he had been robbed . Mrs. 8 Ho " ' an previously had informed Policeman Welsh that she believed her nephew had a large sum of money when he left in his automobile- for this city Wednesday morning . After Captain Monroe had made a careful search of the dead man 's clothes and room it was discovered that he only had fifty-nine Coroner Stella then asked : Mrs .. if . she ' knew ' ef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she . declared : that she . did not. - She - said his father , the late Charles Parsons , was . her brother , and that she could not believe that her nephew would engage in an altercation with anybody . Soon after Arthur P. Hogan , her son , reached the Hogan estate in his automobile from this city . having been ? notified of the death of his cousin ? by telephone . He declared that his cousin was in good ? spirits when he saw him at breakfast Wednesday morning , and that ? he at ? no time since his . return fromFrance ever hinted at suicide . Captain Monroe said last night that Mrs. Hogan was so overcome by the death of . her nephew that it was impossible to get much information from her . Ho . intimated . however , that . Lieutenant ' Parsons , had ' been in ' ' sortie minor financial difficulty , but refused to say what it was . , Letter Signed " James . Vanderbilt : " Coroner Stella last night said ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man he ran across a letter in Parsons 's room . which was ' written by.a man , who signed " - Jame : : Irtinderbilt . " ? " I do not believe the signer of the letter was in any way related to the prominent Vanderbilt family , " said Dr. Stella , " although the letter clearly indicated that it was written by an educated person . The letter was dated May 20 , and evidently was written in New York . The writer , in very polite language asked Lieutenant Parsons to - settle a bill , and said something to the effect that he had owed ? long enough . That is the only thing found in his room that indicates that Lieutenant Parsons had anything to trouble him since his return from France . " Neither Mrs. Hogan nor her son would discuss the death of the young man . It was learned , however , that Coroner Stella had received information during the day that a sister of Lieutenant Parsons committed suicide over a love affair a few . years ago . Dr. Stella and Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lieutenant . Parsons 's automobile , ' and could find no , evidence of a struggle having taken place in it . There were no blood stains on the seats , nor was the steering wheel of the machine stained . We at first thought that possibly he had been attacked by footpads , but I believe that if such were the case he surely would have said something about it to the cook when she admitted him to ' the house . " He was a magnificently built young man , standing about 5 feet 10 in his stockings and weighing about .175 pounds . From the little information I received about him I learned that he was of an exceedingly sensitive nature , and I believe his suicide was due to depression following a quarrel with an intimate . " Although he was not married I have not been able to learn ' that he had a love affair . His aunt and- his cousin - are mystffied by his suicide , and so am I. I believe the . altercation ? in which he was engaged some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his act .

To rent " signs were on the front door . Captain Monroe sentsa policeman ' to this city to learn something about Lieutenant Parsons 's movements between the time . he left the club . at 0:30 o'clock Wednesday night and his appearance at the Hogan estate at 5:30 Thursday morning ..
