txt One of the reasons which President Comm is understood to have given for declining to intervene in Mexico is that such a step would endanger our relations with the South American republics . With them our standing , the President explained to the correspondents , is excellent . He thought it would he a pity to disturb it . In a general WZI.V. his pictuye of the situation is no doubt correct . But there is one smudge upon it . This is our failure as yet to compose the difficulties between Chile and Peru respecting the disputed territory of Tacna-Arica . It was a work which our Government undertoe% in an unselfish spirit , but which it has not till now been able to carry through . That this has hurt our prestige in the countries to the south can hardly be doubted by one who reads what their newspapers have to say about it . The same thing is partly the theme of an article in the October Current History by SAMUEL A. NIACIN:Cis , formerly United States Minister to Bolivia . On the technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Peru and Chile , the chief point made by Mr. 11. - tonixis is that it was a mistake to order a plebiscite in the debated territory . In the agreement signed by the Chileans and Peruvians when submitting their controversy to the arbitral oecision of the President of the United States , it was left open whether " in " the present circumstances a plebiscite " shall or shall not be held . " Our Government decided that it should be held , but subsequent events have shown that , with the best intentions in the world on our part , it could ' hot be . That is to say , it could hot be held satisfactorily or fairly . Such was found to be the case under both Gentral PERK-11N ? and General LASSIM . It would therefore appear to be time to proceed to the alternative specified in the agreement between Chile and Peru to the effect that if the plebiscite was not to be held , " both parties , at " the request of either of them , shall " discuss the situation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain extent . Nor has our State Department been indifferent or aloof . It has sought to bring ail the parties and - interests together for a discussion and is understood to have made different suggestions for a settlement . But it apparently can do little beyond pro- I posing its good efficas . The final solulion must be worked out by the three ; countries involved . We say three countries , because Bolivia has a vital interest in securing a port on the I Pacific , and the plan to give Arica to I her , under proper conditions , has often been broached . ' In the opinion of Mr. MAGI Nis that would be- the sure means of making a comprehensive setClement of this particular " problem of the Pacific . " If our Government made a mistake in the matter of deciding that there should be a plebiscite , it can best make amends by keeping its hands off the question directly , and by exerting every friendly influence to lead the parties td the old quarrel to compose it between themselves as quickly as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
