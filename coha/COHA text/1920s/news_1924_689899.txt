txt There is good news in the story from 1Paris that the Dawes committee will report not only that Germany can paY , but that after a brief moratorium she  - -  can pay substantial annuities toward a total of seventy billion gold marks . Inasmuch as this would be sufficient to allow to France twenty-six ' billion gold marks for the repayment of the reconstruction of the devastated regions plus twelve billions for the payment of interallied debts , and to England the fourteen billions which she has asked in order to pay America what she owes , as well as to allow to Italy and Belgium five billion gold marks , it should go far toward making possible a definite settlement . Even if no direct attempt is made to name the total sum at present  --  and all indications are that this will not be done ? the plan should provide , at least for a period of years , for sufficient payments to do much to - relieve the financial troubles of the allied nations . The basis of this plan is to fix upon Germany taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and British taxpayers . Inasmuch as Germany has no internal debt , she is expected to be able thus to make large Payments annually - to the Allies . It is not yet clear what guarantees or pledges will be asked . The French express the fear that the Germans may endeavor to avoid reparation payments by increasing or reviving their internal debt . Under the terms of the Versailles Treaty , however , reparation Payments constitute a prior lien , except for the costs of the armies of occupation , upon Germany 's resources . There remains the . question of the control of the German railways and the surrender of certain properties as security . France is reluctant to relinquish the specific pledges which she has seized in the Ruhr and elsewhere . She distrusts the Germans and is unwilling to resign her future to a new agreement which may have the same fate as the tripartite treaty of defense in which Great Britain and the United States promised to come to her aid in case of unprovoked German aggression within fifteen years . The French have not forgotten that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made so much of their claim that an impartial committee on which America was represented would find that Germany could not possibly pay , that discontent is sure to arise from them if the forecast of the Dawes committee is finally confirmed . If the annuity should be fixed at as high a rate as 4,500,000,000 gold marks , a chorus of condemnation of the committee may be expected both inside and outside of Germany . In place of the compliments formerly addressed to the plain-spAen General from Chicago about the impartiality of American participation , we may expect to hear something very different . But whatever the findings of this committee , they will be received by an anxious world with an open mind . That Germany must pay has never been disputed except by her own people . That she can pay has been questioned by her friends . It would be heartening to have the Dawes committee tell the world that Germany now will pay , and recommend the methods for her so doing .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
