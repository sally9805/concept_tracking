CLOSE VIEW &nbsp; NARRATION of the first page of the Preface which reads : To whom it may concern : Before unfolding my hair-raising experience in making an investigation of the murderous crimes attributed to the " Opera Ghost " it will be necessary for me to relate a few interesting facts concerning the Paris Opera house , where the Ghost existed . The Paris Opera house was conceived by Louis Napoleon III , after an unsuccessful attempt to duplicate the world power of his illustrious uncle , the great Napoleon , as a sop to his suffering and war-ridden subjects .

( A hand turns the page over revealing a picture of the Paris Opera house to show its magnitude and decorative design . ) Its construction began in 1851 , and was estimated to cost thirty-five million francs , and it required twelve years for completion . It contains  --  3  --  583 dressing rooms , 2551 doors and 7893 keys ; 14 furnaces and 450 grates ; 16 miles of gas pipe , 9 reservoirs and two tanks holding 22,222 gallons of water .

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used as a military headquarters . Its vast cellars turned into dungeons for prisoners , and secret passages and torture chambers installed to satisfy the blood lust of a crazed populace . ( A hand turns the page over revealing the first page of M. Faure 's memoirs . ) Many were the skeptics who scoffed at the idea of the " Opera Ghost " but the few upon whose word I could rely believed in its existence ; vowing that the opera house bore a curse , dating back to the time when the Second Commune carried on a wholesale massacre of the Nobility in the dark cellars .

Thousands of tons of masonry is above and are being upheld by the arches and walls of the room . There is nothing of fantasy in the actual lines and construction of the suite . The fantastic is applied by Erick 's hand in the lighting , furnishings and draperies . Artistically arranged with many variations of freshly cut flowers . Each of the furnishings  --  59  --  is old-fashioned , the idea being that it belonged to Erick 's mother . The couch is very light , much higher than an ordinary couch .
