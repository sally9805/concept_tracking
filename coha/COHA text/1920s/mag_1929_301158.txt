Stock companies are often pitiful , struggling organizations . Their managers bear incalculable woes . One of these was voiced last week by George J. Houtain , counsel for the Theatrical Stock Managers Association . Declaring in a letter to the American Federation of Musicians that prohibitive union wages and regulations had made music scarce in stock productions , he added : " If a phonograph needed operating behind scenes , you would n't allow the manager or one of the company to turn it on or off . . . . It had to be done by a union musician at a full week 's wage , and he was n't allowed to play in the orchestra either . "
