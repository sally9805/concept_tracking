refineries did not follow suit , prices continued around the dollar level , and the producers simply kept on draining the deposits as before . Indeed , they could hardly have done otherwise . They themselves are under contractual obligation to the land-owners . The American land-owner is sovereign of his ground to the exact center of the earth ; he knows that when a producing oil-well is " brought in " on adjacent prop ? erty he , too , must have a well drilled or the wealth beneath his surface will be gone ; and as a rule the company that proposes to do the most vigorous im ? mediate drilling will get the owner 's signature to the lease . Production , not demand , is the primary law in the hindside-before economics of petroleum . Other nations , wiser than ours , have prevented all this by abolishing the individual 's sovereignty over subsurface minerals . But that , of course , is a thing neither the Standard Oil Company nor the beloved American doctrine of " private initiative " could agree to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news from China is from sources prej ? udiced against the National government , it must be recognized that the military situation is now a highly critical one . The rebel forces of Feng Yu-hsiang have mare substantial progress , and the overthrow of the National government is a possibility which must be faced . The recent fighting has been far more severe than is customary in Chinese wars , with a large number of casualties ; the hospital facilities are as usual inadequate , and the suffering has been appalling , even in a land where misery is universal and chronic . Shanghai is frightened over the possi ? bility of capture by the rebels , and insurance against such a catastrophe is being bought by the wealthy Chinese residents , who have been bled almost white by one faction or another in recent years . The next few weeks may see a turn of events which will de ? termine the future of the Chinese nation for decades to come . It may even determine whether China is to remain a single nation or whether it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be Stabilized ? I T WAS a courageous act for Mr. Hoover to call into conference leaders of industry , agri ? culture , trade and labor in order to lay plans against any possible setback of production following the Wall Street panic . How courageous , we may judge by comparing it with the way in which Mr. Coolidge would probably have behaved in the same circum ? stances . An over-cautious man would have feared to admit that anything at all might need to be done . He would have refrained from saying anything that would have implied the existence of danger . He would simply have pretended that everything was going smoothly and would continue to do so . He would have played strongly on " confidence , " and let it go at that . And , no matter how much he hadboasted previously concerning the administration 's part in prosperity , he would have been ready with the alibi that , after all , government has nothing to do with business ; if business falters , the government can do nothing . What the conferences can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives seem to be in view . One is to increase the expenditures for construction work , both by governmental agencies and large industries such as railroads . Many eco ? nomists have held that such activity , when a depres-  --  sion is in sight , would do much to furnish employ ? ment , both directly and indirectly . Mr. Hoover himself long ago endorsed the plan , in general terms . Another objective is to enlarge the market for any American surplus production by stimulating foreign trade ? an endeavor with which Mr. Hoover has long been closely associated , through the Department of Commerce . And the third is to bolster confidence by some definite action . Worthy as these objectives may be , we fear it is now too late to expect them to help much in the , present situation ? if the present situation really calls for help . And we are confident that they are all dwarfed by the importance of another type of decision which the conferences might take . If there is danger of serious unemployment , it will come this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It requires appropriations by legislative bodies , preparation and sale of bond issues , drawing of plans and specifications , advertis ? ing for bids , preparatory work on the part of the contractor . Expansion of private construction work likewise can not be effected on the impulse of the moment . No corporation president in his senses will enlarge his capital facilities unless he is fairly certain his concern will need the extra plant . No speculative builder will undertake new operations unless he has sold what he has already built , has funds available , and believes there will be a profitable sale for his new product . In all these cases , if extra construction work is to be started in time to do anything to relieve a depression , it must be preceded by careful advance planning . Governmental agencies must have in hand completed blue-prints , and money in the bank . Corporations must be ready with a program of expansion worked out for a long period ahead , on the basis of needs deferred during the time of na ? turally booming construction . Speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operations during the peaks of building activity , so that they may be ready to take advan ? tage of low material prices and interest rates when they come . All this preparation can not be impro ? vised . The utmost Mr. Hoover can now do to stimulate construction will not result in employment until after the worst need has passed . European commentators who fear that Mr. Hoover intends to dump American surplus produc tion abroad , to their disadvantage , are shiverit4 -- at a ghost . The Government , through the Depart . runt of Commerce , has long sought every oppor ? tunity to enlarge our foreign sales . It can do no more than it has been doing in this direction . The credit ease consequent upon the break in stocks may , It is true , stimulate the flow of American capital abroad again , but this would have happened with ? out the President 's intervention . The influence on our exports can not be felt promptly . Aside from this , if the administration had taken the most effective measures to facilitate American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff policy and reduction of European war debts ? two meas ? ures which even now it does not favor , and which , if it did take them , could have an effect only after a considerable passage of time . The immediate possibility of the conferences sim ? mers down , then , to the sort of inspirational talk which a head coach gives a football team which has suffered from an attack of nerves on the eve of its big game . The talk may help , if the preliminary training in line play , interference , passing and the rest has been skillful . But it can not be a substitute for the elements of good football . In so far as the practices of American business are already sound , and have been so for many months , the President can instill confidence by pointing out how sound they are , and how they should be continued . Beyond this , he can not help . The conferences , meeting on the occasion of a bad scare , would , however , show real courage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the present crisis , and should re ? solve now to set up a continuous machinery which might help to avert future scares of the same kind . Every hazard which now faces business has been in the making for months , some of them possibly for years . Virtually every one was pointed out , long before the market smash , by competent au ? thorities . Remedies which might be available to ' deal with the eventualities of industrial depression have long been proposed . Failure to take heed of these warnings , and to inaugurate the agencies which might administer the remedies , is the real cause of what has happened . Does a falling off of building construction threaten industry ? That does not result from the recent losses of speculators . It has two main causes ? speculative overbuilding in times of easy money and of unregulated city development , and subsequent tightness of credit during the market boom . If there had been an Economic General Staff watching our business situation continuously , it would long ago have taken steps to encourage sta bility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of demand and supply in every class of building , it would have brought city and regional planning into play , it would have noted the vagaries of building credit and would have proposed means of holding it to a more sta ? tionary level ? including of course , measures to pre ? vent the diversion of credit to market speculation . It would have discovered the lack of good housing for those of small means , and would have studied ways of providing such housing as is not a profit ? able enterprise for speculative builders . A national housing program , if it were now ready to be exe ? cuted , would be a boon indeed . Futhermore , this General Staff would have studied the various pro ? posals like Senator Wagner 's for advance planning of public construction , and , in so far as these pro ? posals are sound , it would have encouraged the en ? actment of the necessary legislation so that we might be prepared for a situation like the present . And it would have done something to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this pro ? gram . Arc we faced by a shrinkage of motor-car pro ? duction , with its reverberations of lessened demands on steel and other basic industries ? If so , the mar ? ket crash is only to a minor degree responsible . Automobile output was drastically reduced before the panic , on account of feverish over-production ' during the first part of the year . An Economic General Staff would have studied the automobile market , it would have some fairly definite ideas as to the saturation point of domestic demand at the existing levels of prices and incomes , it would en ? courage advance planning of production schedules within the industry . It would understand the im ? portance of the export market , and the effect upon that market of protective tariffs and international loans . And of course an Economic General Staff would long ago have recognized the dangers of specula ? tive inflation in the stock market itself , just as so many experts in both private and official positions have recognized it . It would have studied the ex ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work on plans for new measures which might have stopped the leaks in Federal Reserve control of speculative credit . It might easily have done some ? thing to educate the public so that the market would not have soared to the dangerous height from which it fell . An agency constantly at work on national eco ? nomic problems would not only have prepared us to deal with a crisis , but it would have done much to avert that crisis itself . It would be fed by the many streams of statistical information which we already have , and it would establish liaisons with the numerous agencies of control which already exist in this country . In addition , it would seek to round out our statistics , and , after careful study , to propose necessary new agencies and methods of con ? trol . It would draw together the threads of our economic fabric so that we could see the pattern . It would constantly be atacking the new problems which are bound to arise . It would not be a dictator ? ship ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its judgment . In so far as it could show us the better way , we might be induced to follow . If this could be made the occasion for starting something to deal with the next crisis , the Presi dent 's conferences will have been indeed worth while . We do not want merely another report , hastily improvised ad hoc by experts taken from other tasks , and followed by no systematic action . We must begin to experiment with a governor for our engine . We must frankly recognize that the wild play of individualistic forces out for private gain does not automatically result in a desirable eco ? nomic equilibrium . We must understand that when the equilibrium is most painfully disturbed , we can ? not right it simply by momentary inspirations . In order to do what needs to be done , we must begin modestly to develop a better means of regulation . Hitherto , the attitude of our political and indus ? trial leaders has been to regard our economic order with superstitious reverence when it is running at high speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steam falls , the oil gives out , or a part breaks . Fortunately , the present breakdown is not likely to be serious in any case . But it warns us that we need , not industrial playboys , but skilled engineers . We need to apply some of our mechan ? ical ingenuity to the ordering of larger affairs . Mr. Hoover against the World M R. HOOVER 'S suggestion that food-ships should be exempt from blockade in time of war has met with a bad press in Great Britain , France and Italy . Only the Germans have received it cordially , and the historic reasons for their sym ? pathy are only too apparent . British Conserva ? tives feel that England 's safety from starvation is so important a matter that it must be proteced only by the strength of the British Navy ? which , as the Tories conveniently forget for the moment , came so near to permitting Britain to be starved out in the closing days of the War . The British Liberals recognize that England has more to gain than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they regard it as an idealistic gesture which has no hope of realization . From the Con ? tinent comes more concrete objection . The French , somewhat cynically echoed by the Italians , urge first of all , of course , that the plan is in conflict with the League scheme for complete blockade against a country which is guilty of an act of aggression . Second , they say that while its purpose is humane , its results might be of a contrary character , since it would serve to prolong a war which would other ? wise be terminated quickly . Even without these objections , the proposal is declared to be imprac ? ticable : it is said to be impossible to distinguish be ? tween food and other products which would remain legitimate contraband , and in any case , no country could continue to import food if its exports of other material were cut off , since such a trade would only last a short time unless it were on a basis of barter . These objections have varying degrees of valid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ties of the existing situation . The New Republic observed last week that when it came to the actual test of conflict , whether in " public war " against an aggressor , or in " private war " between two states as to which the rest of the world made no moral judgment , Mr. Hoover 's proposal would be as likely to break down as would all other attempts to humanize war . The usefulness of any such scheme is like the usefulness of the League itself and of the Kellogg Pact : it lies in helping to pre ? vent war , and not in anything that could be done after the catastrophe has taken place . In the preven ? tion of war , Mr. Hoover 's plan might easily have a usefulness which European commentators seem en ? tirely to miss , probably because they do not take into sufficient account popular American psy ? chology . Europe is at present committed , through the machinery of the League , to a scheme which France accepts enthusiastically and Great Britain more re ? luctantly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In theory these sanctions might indude the use of armed military force , but in general discus ? sion , they are regarded as being confined to an eco ? nomic boycott , and this in turn is thought of chiefly in terms of a blockade by sea , for which the British navy would be the chief implement as it was in 1914-18 . But the threat of such a blockade is in ? validated at the present time by uncertainty as to what the United States would do . British leaders admit that they would not attempt to enforce one against our wishes ; they can think of no advantage to be gained in relation to Europe which would be worth a war with America . Efforts have been made to obtain a promise that America would not insist on its right to maintain trade with a vio ? later of the Kellogg Pact , or with anyone engaged in a private war , but these efforts have thus far , been unavailing . But with Mr. Hoover 's proposal adopted , the chances that America would participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tainly be very much better . It could not then be said , as in the case of a 100-per cent blockade , that we were making war on women and children . The very fact that , on America 's initiative , food was exempt , would be a powerful factor in urging us to cast in our lot with the rest of the world in exercis ? ing pressure against the aggressor by holding up other products . Such a blockade would , in fact , be virtually as effective as the sort which Franco is now contemplating ? and will never get , until America agrees to it . The threat of a cordon sant. faire which would put an embargo on all other raw materials , on munitions , on international credit , on manufactured exports , would be almost as useful as one which added food to all of these . And if you think of it in terms , not of threats , but of actual overt acts , such an iron ring should be highly effec ? tive . Rare indeed are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to last them for the first few weeks or months of
