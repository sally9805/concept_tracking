Only when startling records are set does cold weather become hot news . Startling , last fortnight , was a whole series of such records , observed with attendant local hardships throughout most of Europe and the Near East . Parisians had not been so cold in 15 years , Londoners in 32 , Romans in 80 years . . . . <P> Italy-Dalmatia . Not only were Naples and Sicily snowmantled , not only did Vesuvius and Mount Etna spurt red ashes into a white storm ; but the cold grew so intense in Dalmatia-across the Adriatic Sea from Italy-that the surface of a minor mountain range contracted , causing severe landslides near Spalato . <P> At Rome the temperature touched 23 Fahrenheit-lowest at the season for 80 years-and a slight earthquake added to the general misery . The Beatissimus Pater , Pius XI , remained imperturbably seated in his study during the four minutes of earthcrust wabbling . <P> England . Sudden snow , quick-freezing sleet caught Londoners so unawares that within 24 hours 30 hospitals were tending 1600 patients injured by slips and falls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was victim of a vicious skid , overturned . Nonchalant , His Royal Highness crawled from the wreck , straightened up , lit a cigaret , hailed a taxi . <P> Meanwhile the King-Emperor and Queen-Empress sojourned amid huge drifts of country snow , at Sandringham . George V was known to have telegraphed his Keeper of the Swans certain instructions as to their wintry care . <P> Throughout England the freezing of rivers which generally remain liquid all winter was so exceptional that skates to the value of 1,000 ( $4875 ) were purchased within three days from one London firm alone . <P> Five days afterward came a sudden thaw . From ice into water turned many a stream-including the Serpentine , that storied streamlet of Hyde Park , London , in which swam Peter Pan . Thus , it became possible to hold last week , the famous 110-yard Serpentine Swimming Race which is sponsored each year by Sir James Matthew Barrie . Last week he stood at one end of the Serpentine under an old , sopping umbrella and awarded to the winner of the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated Peter Pan Cup . <P> France . Since Frenchfolk are proverbially less hardy than Britons , despatches reported no skating orgies or icewater swims in France , but rather much stark misery . <P> At Paris seven paupers froze to death in the streets . Some , it was told , had refused to accept warmth and shelter for winch they could not pay . Misjudging their powers of resistance to the unfamiliar cold , * they had stumbled on through the snow - too long . . . . <P> Fortunately-at least for such poor-proud folk-the French concept of a policeman 's duty is paternal . It was so interpreted , last week , by M. Jean Chiappe , the Prefect of Police of Paris . With firm wisdom M. le Prfet ordered his gendarnes to take into custody every vagrant . Soon , in warm Paris jails , the needy were served hot soups and stews which they could accept without loss of honor . When the weather moderated they were released .                 @ @ @ @
