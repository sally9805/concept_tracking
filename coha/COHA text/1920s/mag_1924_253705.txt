The unsuccessful endeavors of Peter Augustus Jay , U. S. Minister to Bucharest , in attempting to dissuade the Rumanian Government from enacting a bill prejudicial to the interests of U. S. capital in Rumania had but one result : able Diplomat Jay is returning to the U. S. to explain to the State Department the complicated situation . <P> The situation is that U. S. concerns have upward of $150,000,000 invested in Rumania of which $70,000,000 alone represents the investments of the Standard Oil Co . The Bratiano brothers ( Jon Bratiano , Premier ; Vintila Bratiano , Minister of Finance ) piloted through the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies a bill , known as the Mineral Rights Bill , which makes it obligatory for Rumanians to hold 60% of stock in all industrial enterprises , and which provides for State confiscation in the event of foreigners failing to comply with the law . <P> The finances of Rumania are in a terrible tangle and the country owes more money than it can pay off in a donkey 's age . Moreover , there is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign concerns in Rumania . Consequently , under such conditions , the Government is accused of trying to enrich Rumania at the expense of foreigners without paying a cent in return . <P> The political ramifications in Rumania , consequent upon this proposed law , are indeed manifold . The Bratiano brothers are supported by the Liberal Party , which has an overwhelming majority in the Senate and Chamber . Most of the Government Opposition disapproves of the bill , and supporting the Opposition is the Catholic Hohenzollern , King Ferdinand and his beautiful consort , Queen Marie . The issue is , therefore , between the King and his Government . The former has so far declined to sign on the dotted line and the bill can not become law without his signature ; neither can the Government force the King to sign , because he holds a Constitutional right to veto legislation . The Government , however , is " dead set " on getting the bill enacted and has so far declined to heed the remonstrations of King , Queen , Opposition and foreign Powers . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain . Their objects were : <P> 1 ) To raise money ; <P> 2 ) To seek military support against Russia with whom Rumania is at leashes strained over the Bessarabian question ( TIME , April 14 , May 5 ) . <P> In neither one nor the other of these plans did they succeed and , after being made to feel by both France and Britain that they had outstayed their welcome , they were forced to return empty-handed to Bucharest . The Bratiano brothers stuck another feather in their caps by having the Mineral Rights Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament . <P> The King would not sign the bill . Rumors emanated from the Court that Queen Marie would yield to pressing invitations from prominent American friends to visit the U. S. The visit would be purely social , but the inference was that the beautiful Queen would try to influence American financiers to lend money to her distressed but obstreperous country .
