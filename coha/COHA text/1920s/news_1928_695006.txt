txt Wants Shuttle Extended . To tire Editor of The New York Times : I rejoice to see in today 's TIMES that at last a voice has been raised.in protest against the inane arrangement for the long-suffering public who have been " temporarily " shuttling for the last ten years at Times Square . All west side trains pass within a stone 's throw of the shuttle platform , and yet we must he carried to some remote station in order to walk back . There also seems to he a perfectly good track clear through to the Lexington Avenue subway , but the passengers get out from the shuttle trains about half way there and tramp the subterranean board walk beside this unused track . We are usually in a mad rush from green line to black line . When one does occasionally perfo ? m the stunt in a leisurely manner , the extra time Is consumed in wondering how a worse arrangement could be possible . ELIZABETTI S. BALLIIET . New York , May 2 , 1028 . Methodists and Lutherans To the Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forthcoming gathering of Methodist In Kansas City contains a statement to the effect that the Methodist Church " has become the world 's largest Protestant denomination . " The Lutheran World Almanac for 1028 allowe to the Methodists about C.00 ( 1.000 to cover the adherents In England and Wales , where there is no religious census of the population , and in the United States over 7.0 ( 10.000. where there is also no religious census of population . An estimated total of 28.287,207 is given as the number of Methodist adherents in the world . This is over 3.000.000 more than the round number referrel " to in Tile Timns correspondence . Drs . H. K. Carroll and 0 . S. BaltetPL Methodist sta.:sticians. claim a grand total of 52.7211 , - 5.17 Methodists in the world in 1921 . All . when compared with the estimated total of Lutherans in the world , 31,023.180 , is rather far from the mark of being " the world 's largest Protestant denomination . " C. L. KIEFFER , Associate Editor Lutheran World Almanac . New York . May 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May Lead to Deadlock , In Which Case There Is Dr. Butler . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES of . April 28 printed a letter from Frank G. Morris in which he criticized George IC . Morris , the Republican State Chairman , and Charles D. Hines , the , National Committeeman , for holding back from the endorsement of the candidacy of Mr. Hoover , questioning their political judgment and even their good faith in this matter . The problem of political leaders in deciding what candidates to support for the Presidency is not only one of fitness for the position , but vote-getting ability , and in Mr. Hoover 's case there is a grave question in the minds of many of the important leaders in the Republican Party as to whether he could carry either the wet Eastern States or the agricultural Western States against a candidate like Governor Smith . The people who are most vocal in registering their opinions in straw ballots are frequently not the ones whose ears are close to the ground politically . The Republican Party desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and duty of the leaders to consider with the utmost care the availability of the candidates from this point of view . In the opinion of many shrewd observers Mr. Hoover 's strength in the Republican National Convention will be greatest at the outset , and will never attain sufficient proportions to secure his nomination . A condition of deadlock may well develop , in which it will be necessary to turn to some one other than the present active candidates . A nomination dictated in a back room by a small group of leaders , as was the case in 1920 , will not be tolerated , but in the event that it becomes necessary to turn to some outstanding man of unquestioned Presidential calibre for the solution of the situation , New York State has such a man available in the person of Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler . His record is such that he would stand the best chance of any of the possible candidates of defeating Governor Smith in the East , while his broad understanding of our national problems and his sympathy with the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate in the West . He is the one man who has been prominently mentioned over whom Governor Smith would have no decided advantage in any section , save the . South , which the Democrats will carry as usual . Mr. Hoover has done r. constructive work in the Department of Commerce in bringing better coordination into the business of the country and would be a strong candidate with the business community , but it is such questions as I have suggested which have to be considered by the responsible leaders of the party , if victory is to be assured in the coming campaign . W. FRANCE , New York , May 1 , 1928 . WHY THE SENATE ? Presidential Committee Suggested for Campaign Finance Control . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES exposition today of the reasons for the publicity and control of Presidential campaign financing provided by the Robinson resolution is cogent and to the point . But why the Senate ? What is there in the Constitution which makes that body , rather than the House , or both conjointly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , we have the example of 1920 when a similar Senate committee undertook to supervise the campaign management , whose activities , no doubt , made it harder for the money-raisers . Yet the moneyspenders were not curbed , as witness the scandals growing out of the deficits . So it is not the contributions to the campaign committees that need watching as much as the contributions from those committees . If a Federal author$ty is to do the watching , why not one duly constituted by law with distinctly defined powers and duties ? Why , too , confine it to Presidential elections when Senatorial and Congressional campaigns differ only in magnitude and degree ? Again the question , Why the Senate ? Why a committee appointed by the Vice President ? Why not inquisitors appointed , as the Constitution contemplates for such functions , by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate ? VICTOR ROSEWATER .

Waits from twenty minutes to two hours have occurred there in the last week or two . 1 live in the 13ayswater section and have missed several trains lately owing to the delay . I take a taxi down ; and when I ? get to Sheridan Boulevard there is a line right up to the railroad crossing caused by the gates being lowered . I either have to wait there or get out and run from Sheridan Boulevard . and ten to one I miss my train . I think that where they have two men at a crossing , as they have at Mott Avenue , " blinkers " are not necessary . DAVID KASSEL . Far Rockaway , N. Y. , May 1 , 1928. - To Keep Our Streets Clean .

TAY t . OLD AGE PENSIONS . Representative Sirovich Disagrees With Mr. Sherman 's Views . To the Editor of The New York Times : Permit me to call the attention of your readers to the statement carried in Friday 's TIMES in which P. Tecumseh Sherman of the National Civic Federation was quoted to the effect that State old age pensions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , knows that this is not quite true , since something like thirty-five nations today are caring for their dependent aged through systems of old age pensions or insurance . Since the World War fourteen additional countries adopted such plans and only a month ago , France , the most thrifty and individualistio nation , enacted one of the most comprehensive systems of social insurance . This record is hardly " discrediting . " Mr. Sherman 's contentions that somehow the United States alone can escape sound . State or Federal provision for the aged are based solely on the conclusions drawn by himself of the findings of the recent report of the National Civic Federation conducted under his general direction . The conclusions of that report have become so discredited everywhere that one is surprised to find Mr. Sherman bringing them up again . The very facts contained in that report repudiate Mr. Sherman 's conclusions . In a recent article in The New Republic Dr. I. M. Rubinow , one of the leading authorities in this field , showed that in-spite of the fact that the cases selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of the general working population , since it included more than twice the normal percentage of manufacturers , merchants , professional persons , and so forth , and . aside from the ' fact that the enumerators excluded entirely the aged already provided for in public and private relief institutions , the Federation 's own investigations showed that : ( 1 ) Twenty-five per cent . of the men and 34 per cent . of the women . over 65 years of age own no property at all . ( 2 ) Forty per cent . have no income from work or business and some 17 per cent . have neither property nor income . ( 3 ) ' Over 25 per cent. , by their own admission , are totally unable to work , and 30 per cent . are able to do only light work which , added to the disqualification of age , makes them practically unavailable for industry . The comparatively high percentage of those still able to work ( about 45 per cent. ) is probably largely due to the peculiar occupational distribution , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Many of those who were forced to retire are , in addition , afflicted by chronic illness , rheuatism , invalidity due to accident , and so forth . ( 5 ) Of the total number , some 60 per cent . receive no aid , and 40 per cent . are assisted primarily ' by children and to some extent by other relatives and friends . The number of those supported by public charity is very small , less than 1.5 per cent . That , of course , is largely explained by the failure to include any old people maintained in institutions . It is in order to clarify the atmosphere in this controversy that on April 19 I introduced in Congress joint resolution No. 278 providing for the creation of an impartial United States commission to study the entire subject from every angle . The commission is to be made up of four Senators , four Congressmen , two rept esentatives each of employers and organized labor and three public spirited citizens to be appointed by the President of the United States . An appropriation of $75,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only prove of immense value to all persons interested in the subject , but would , once for all , settle scientifically and properly this mooted question . le view of the fact that about the same time as my resolution , was introduced Representative Johnson of Washington introduced another resolution appropriating from $25,000 to $50,000 for a commission to study the destruction of fish in certain darns and rivers , 1 feel it would be comparatively cheap to invest a similar sum in the study of the conditions of and proposed remedies for our destitute , and dependent aged , who ' have given their lives to our industries and to our welfare . If Mr. Sherman and his supporters are really sincerely desirous of the actual facts in the case , I hope they will do everything possible to -- help the establishment of such a commission . Mr. Sherman 's present remedies along the lines of poor relief and the adoption of industrial pension plans by private corporations can hardly meet the present needs . The poor relief system stands indicted beyond redemption . Industrial pension plans with their long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since only a small percentage of workers stay with one corporation long enough to qualify for these benefits and only large industrial establishments can afford to undertake such provisions . It is true that the contributory in ? surance plan- is spreading abroad . Side by side with this system , however , there is everywhere in existence a non-contributory system of pensions supported entirely by taxation which aims to alleviate the immediate needs . ' ' lans along the ' same lines are urged by the advocates of humane care for the aged in the United States , since the old men and women now destitute can hardly be expected to- make contributions for their own support. - The American Association for Old Age Security , the . leading organization promoting ' this subject , is working toward this entire program . If , as Mr. Sherman suggests , the poor taw : system , which in essence dates back- to the period of Queen Elizabeth , is not archaic , then by the sane logic the stage-coach - in these days of transatlantic flying remains the most up-to-date method ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
