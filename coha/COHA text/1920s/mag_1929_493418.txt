Justice for India ? THE British Empire has given to India an assurance that it is marching towards the status of a self-governing Dominion . That the Viceroy should issue such a statement as he has , may not , to the distant observer , seem an earthshaking event . Declarations which had this meaning , or very nearly this meaning , have been made at intervals since the War . Indeed , the Viceroy in this statement says that it is his purpose to remove all doubt about their meaning . In a sense he has said nothing new . Nor has lie said anything perilously precise . All that he has said , " on behalf of His Majesty 's Government , " is that " the natural issue of India 's constitutional progress is the attainment of Dominion status . " That progress may be fast , or slow : the transitional stages may occupy a decade or a generation : all that is said , though it is very plainly said , is that " the goal of British policy " is to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an independent nation ( for these are nothing less ) within the British Commonwealth . Why is it that the repetition of this far from novel promise seems , both in India and in England , an event that must make history ? The sands were running very low in the Indian hour-glass . Last Christmas , at its annual meeting , the Indian National Congress made a perilous and challenging decision . It pledged itself , unless the Dominion status should be granted within this year , to set in motion a nation-wide campaign of " passive ' disobedience , " with the object of attaining , not the status of a Dominion within the British Empire , but absolute independence . Mr. Gandhi was ready to lead in this effort , which would have involved the refusal , by scores of millions of Indians , to recognize British courts or to pay their taxes . One might doubt whether the Moslem minority would join in this campaign , and the hardened Anglo-Indian might predict an early and inglorious end to it . But if once it had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British government with the Indian people an insoluble problem for years to come : our rule would rest upon unsheathed bayonets , and before the passive revolt ended , we should have been fortunate if we had escaped a whole series of Amritsar killings . This nightmare lay before us . The months of relative sanity and peace grew shorter and fewer , and half-way through the year , the responsibility for dealing with an India who promised to fold her arms in a quiet refusal to be governed , shifted from a Tory to a Labor government . Captain Wedgwood Benn , who went to the India office , is not the man to await , inactive , the slow onset of destiny . He is young , he is quick-witted , he has principles , and , above all , he is a fighter . Fortunately , the Viceroy of the day is also an unusual character . He was one of those Tories of the Left Wing , whom Mr. Baldwin , when left to his own devices , tended to favor . He had been Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least imaginative organ of reaction , attacks him from time to time as no better than a Socialist . Between them , Mr. Benn and Lord Irwin ( who used to be Mr. Wood ) may have saved India from a very terrible ordeal , but if they have saved her , the credit will be theirs alone . They saw that something must be said , and something must be done , to avert this threat of passive resistance . They realized that Indian opinion had a case against the Simon Commission , which was sent out , without a single Indian member , to judge the Indian capacity for self-government . They understood that India will not wait in patience until ( somewhere in the spring of next year ) this Simon Commission reports . They foresaw that amid the passionate drama of tax-resistance and official repression , with India 's jails packed with the leaders of Indian opinion , there could be no hopeful discussion of the next stage in the progress to self-government . Just in um ' e , with a margin of eight weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian mind some faith in British good will . The declaration would not have sufficed , if it had stood alone . Words can no longer pacify India . But simultaneously , with the help of the Simon Commission itself , another step towards appeasement was taken . The real issue behind this controversy over the Simon Commission turns on the ultimate responsibility of the British Parliament for the destinies of India . Who , in the last resort , shall decide when and how India shall become self-governing ? A Parliament of Englishmen sitting in Westminister , or the elect of the Indian people sitting ( vocal but powerless ) in Delhi ? If you answer " Parliament , " you take your stand on the rights of conquest , for we hold India by no other title . On the other hand , can we , after a century and a half of direct rule , suddenly wash our hands of all responsibility , careless whether the transition is made at the right time and in the right way , as though we were indifferent to the fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way by which Delhi and Westminster could think out the next step together . Indians asked for what they called a round-table conference . The appointment of an all-English Commission came as a blow. ? in the face , and Mr. Baldwin made things worse by his fatuous quotation from Milton ; " God 's Englishmen " . ( as he called them ) were boycotted when they went to India , and none of the substitutes for a conference which was afterwards offered availed to heal the wound to India 's pride . Now , on the plea that it will be necessary to bring the nominally independent princes into any discussion of India 's future , a procedure is offered which concedes what Indians mean by the round-table conference . The spokesmen of the Delhi Assembly will sit on equal terms with the spokesmen of the Westminster Parliament . They will have the Simon report before them , but , equally , if they agree among themselves , they may bring their own draft ola constitution with them . The ultimate question of right is not settled : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . India can be liberated happily and hopefully only if Delhi and Westminster act in concert , with mutual respect for each other 's duties and rights . The conqueror will not dramatically fling ' down the sword , but neither will he gird it to his belt , even when he wears court dress . Lord Irwin has himself said the same thing wisely and well : " It is as unprofitable to deny the right of Parliament to form its free and deliberate judgment on the problem , as it would be shortsighted of Parliament to underrate the importance of trying to reach a solution which might carry the willing assent of political India . " As- yet I have said nothing which might persuade the American reader to regard the issue of this ' declaration as an earth-shaking event . We have promiied to India , at some unspecified time in the future , the status of a Dominion , which , though never in these exact words , we had promised before . And after the Simon Commission has reported , - we have offered to meet Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards this goal . " Very wise , " you may say , " very prudent , very liberal , but surely no more than one would expect from any British government in its senses . " That might have been my own comment , were it not that I know a little of what has been passing behind the scenes . It was not easy to issue this declaration : it ranks , in all the circumstances , as an act of unusual political courage . One may say , as Lord Irwin says , that this promise of Dominion status was " implicit " in earlier statements of policy , but it ? was not perfectly explicit , and it is clear today that a part of the Tory party , perhaps the more influential part , did not hold itself bound by these previous promises , or did not interpret them as Lord Irwin and the Labor government do . In the late summer , during a brief visit of the Viceroy to England , the Labor government very properly consulted the leaders of the Opposition . hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new departure in foreign or imperial policy is contemplated . A minority government must make a constant habit of such consultations . ? Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Lloyd George seemed at first to approve the issue of the Declaration ? which is not surprising . But when Lord Birkenhead , lately the Secretary for India , and so often the evil genius of the Tory party , heard of it , he led a revolt within the inner ranks of the leaders , and compelled Mr. Baldwin to withdraw his tentative approval . Something similar happened in the Liberal camp . Lord Reading , a former Viceroy , took the same view , and he in his turn influenced Mr. Lloyd George . Sir John Simon was also hostile to the Declaration , not perhaps on its merits , but because he held that it was improper to issue any statement of policy until his Commission had reported . Lord Irwin , meanwhile , had in confidence shown the Declaration to certain Indian leaders , and something of it , both here and in India , had leaked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication , the Labor Cabinet ( with Mr. MacDonald in mid-Atlantic ) was suddenly confronted with the withdrawal of both Liberal and Tory support . What was a minority government to do ? If it stopped or altered the Declaration , Indians ( aware that it had been drafted ) would have interpreted its nonappearance as a withdrawal of the promise of Dominion status . Even the moderates would then have supported the outbreak of passive resistance at the New Year . On the other hand , if they risked defeat and repudiation by a Tory-Liberal combination in Parliament , they would no less certainly provoke the storm in India . It is small wonder that the Cabinet , faced with this dilemma , vacillated . Mr. Benn was strong enough to prevent the withdrawal of the document , but he had to agree to the dispatch of a cablegram to Lord Irwin , which informed him that Mr. Baldwin and Mr. George had withdrawn their support , and authorized him , if he thought fit , to alter its terms . He did not change a word . The Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Parliament might repudiate them , took their risk , and in taking it saved India from despair . The sequel , as I write , remains to be told . You will know it before this article can cross the Atlantic.1 But it is clear that there will be no hostile action from a united Tory party . Lord Rothermere 's Daily Mail , the most mischievous but happily the most tactless of British newspapers , has made that impossible . It chose to appear on the day on which I write , with a furious attack upon Mr. Baldwin for his original approval of the Declaration . It disclosed much that ought to have remained confidential . Finally , it used the incident to clamor for the deposition of Mr. Baldwin from the Tory leadership . The result was to stiffen that gentleman 's far from heroic spine . He will not use this episode to unseat the Labor government . Mr. Lloyd George , who is often thought to be an ally of Lord Rothermere , may play a disturbing guerilla game , but he will not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My per
