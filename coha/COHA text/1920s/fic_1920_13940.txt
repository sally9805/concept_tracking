SCENE .  --  Kitchen of STEPHEN HARDY 'S farmhouse on the road to Northport ( Long Island ) , a simple , homelike room quite without any of the conveniences of modern invention , and equally without any studied air of grimness . The room should be as unpretentious as the play and as far away from symbolism ,  --  just the plain home of plain people . Door back left to yard ; a rather wide window back right looks out upon side veranda . Door to hall at left . Cook stove right . Sink above stove . This kitchen , out of respect for the " parlor " , is used as the family living room , and the small dining table at right is now covered with a dull red cloth . Door to a " pantry " at right below stove ; when this door is open it is possible to see the usual flour barrel , sugar bucket , etc . Near the window at back is a cheap easel on which is a conventional water color ; on a stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist 's paraphernalia . There is a shelf above the stove , and among the articles on this shelf is a rather hideous old jug in which is a bunch of artificial flowers . It is early afternoon of a July day . At right center , seated by the table , is KATE HARDY , a girl of eighteen ; HELEN HARDY , her mother , is in the doorway looking out . HELEN All right ! She crosses down to shelf above the stove and taking the jug in which are the artificial flowers , she crosses to the table at right center p. 3 KATE Somehow it always frightens me ! HELEN It need n't ! What 's here is ours . She removes the artificial flowers and turns the jug upside down . The jug was about one third full of money , old bills , one or two gold pieces , and silver . Kate takes five dollar bills from her little pocketbook and adds them to the pile KATE It 's the last of my school-teaching money until September . HELEN You 'll get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sits by tableHow much did you put in just now ? KATE Five dollars . HELEN Where 's the rest of it ? KATE hesitates.I  --  I was going to buy some goods for a dress ; we could make it ourselves , of course . Just a little organdy or something . HELEN You can get along , I guess , without it . KATE wistfully.I 'm ashamed to go to the pictures Saturday nights ; I have n't a thing ! HELEN firmly.Your blue dress will do well enough , put it all in . KATE reluctant.Yes , mother . She takes a few more bills from her pocketbook and adds them to the pile p. 4 HELEN I 'm going to count it . KATE You 'll wear it all out before it 's any good to us ! HELEN almost gaily . Starting to count money.I 'm like a miser I saw once in an opera ,  --  I think it was " The Chimes of Normandy . " He took me to the theatre in New York three or four times the first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piling up the coins.Some of the summer people from here , and even as far down as Shoreham , drive their automobiles up to New York almost every day ! HELEN counting bills.I know . KATE And I 've never been there ! HELEN You will ! KATE I never used to believe it , but we 've saved a lot . HELEN looking over at her.How much ? KATE Sixty dollars and fifty cents , counting the gold pieces . HELEN I 've got six hundred and forty ; let 's see  --  that 's six hundred and forty and sixty dollars and fifty cents  --  ? KATE promptly.Seven hundred dollars and fifty cents . p. 5 HELEN You 're quick at figures ! KATE laughs.You 're not ! HELEN I get it mixed with receipts for gingerbread and when to give the calf that medicine your father left for it . She starts to put the money back into the jarSeven hundred dollars and fifty cents ! Just my chicken and egg money and little odds and ends , and your pay for school teaching and for clerking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaves and fishes in the Bible ! KATE If you 'd only let me go with that ! HELEN No , not till we get a thousand . KATE sadly.Three hundred dollars more ! HELEN All but fifty cents . KATE impatiently.What 's fifty cents ? HELEN If you 'd remember how we 've had to scrimp for every penny , you would n't ask that . KATE How could I help remembering ! Sometimes I hate that money ! It 's all the good times I 've never had , and all the things I 've done without ! HELEN You 'll thank me for it some time . p. 6 KATE Oh , yes ! Only could n't I just take this seven hundred and make it do ? HELEN No , I always said a thousand . It would be so awful if you had to come back ! Two years it might take you , and he wo n't want you to go ; he would n't send you anything ; good teachers cost money , and painting things , and a studio ! We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another year . KATE We never have saved that much . HELEN All the more reason why we should this time . KATE A year  --  She sighsIt 's so long to wait . HELEN I been here twenty . KATE But not knowing that pretty soon you were going ! It was your home ; you knew you were going to live here always . HELEN I 've told you times enough about that , how hard it was for me to settle down . KATE But , mother ! I 'm young ! HELEN So was I , once , and as far as that goes , I 've still got my teeth ! I guess you can stand it another year . KATE You would n't go away from here if you could ! HELEN Yes , I would  --  quick ! Lookin ' back , it seems like I was crazy I did n't go ! p. 7 KATE shocked.From father ? HELEN bitterly.From this ! She looks about the room bitterlyIt ai n't enough ! Life ought to be bigger than  --  than this kitchen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep those old pots and pans ! I knew that , when I was your age , but somehow I forgot it for a while . I 'd always meant to get away and go to New York , or somewhere 's where bein ' born an ' bein ' dead was n't the only things that ever happened . I 'd made my mind up to go , I 'd saved for it harder even than we 've been savin ' ; one more term of winter school teachin ' an ' I figured I 'd have enough . KATE But you did n't go ! HELEN No , I took my money and bought my weddin ' things . It was awful lonesome around here winters , and your father 's got a way of gettin ' what he wants . KATE Mother ! You 're not sorry ! HELEN I tell you it ai n't enough . She looks out the window at the vista of truck gardens then half-turns toward KATEAt first , when we were married , I thought it was . Then it got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other part of me just shriveled up . She walks slowly down to tableWhen I was a girl I used to watch married folks and I thought it was like that , but somehow I got to loving him before I knew it . I did n't have any talent like you have ; I just had the hunger to do things . p. 8 KATE But if we 're wrong ? If I have n't really a talent ? HELEN No , there 's more justice than that in the world . You 've got what I did n't have . KATE We ca n't be sure . HELEN You 'll be a great artist ! KATE Mother ! HELEN You will ! I 've known it ever since I got you that first box of water colors when you were a little girl . You 're more like his people in looks , but the rest of you is me ! The thing I wanted to do you 're going to do ! KATE Yes , mother ! HELEN As soon as I saw you favored me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , I knew just what we had to do , and I started over again saving for it . Your life is n't going to be like this , not even with a good man like your father ! KATE He is good , but he 's hard . HELEN He 's had to be , to live ! KATE But he never thinks of anything but land , then more and more ! HELEN There 's no money in garden truck unless you have a lot of land . KATE But he keeps us so poor , buying it , and he 's always so worried about the taxes and the mortgages  --  and before he 's paid for the last piece he 's always buying another . p. 9 HELEN He loves it ! Just land ! KATE It 's merciless , the way he makes you work , and the way he works himself ! HELEN It 's being a slave just to things , just cooking and cleaning and digging and planting ! You sha' n't be that ! She picks up the jug and puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about that money ; supposing something happened to it ? HELEN Nobody 'd look in here . She crosses to shelf and puts the jug away KATE They might ! HELEN No , it 's safe ; it 's been over ten years I 've been saving up and no one but us two knows about it . Your father do n't notice things much . KATE Only if it 's good growing weather , or if it is n't ! Or if it 's an acre of land he could buy ! Mother ! Was he always like that ? HELEN I guess so , only I did n't know it ! She sighs and crosses and stands in the open door I guess folks do n't change much . She stands for a moment looking outHe 's comin ' , they 've finished pickin ' the string beans ; were n't many of ' em , I guess . She sighs againNo , folks do n't change much ; he 's heavier than he was , and he do n't hardly ever smile . He used to , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to KATEFarmin 's pretty hard on a man . p. 10 KATE And on a woman too . HELEN Yes . STEVE HARDY enters , a tall , strong farmer of forty-five , dressed for his work in the fields HARDY We got the beans all picked . He crosses and draws a dipper of water from the sinkI 'm goin ' to make up the truck load with the summer cabbages  --  what there is of them . He drinks heartilyIt 's hot out there ? KATE I picked beans for an hour ; then mother made me stop . HARDY Your mother 's spoiled you , but that 's all right . I do n't want you working in the fields . HELEN I wo n't have it  --  you both know that ; that 's why I called her in ! I do n't want her to neglect her painting . HARDY pleasantly enough . I guess the world would get along without her painting , all right . You 're going to work at Nepper 's to-morrow , ai n't you ? KATE Yes , I promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't seem as though I could begin that all over again ! HARDY How much is he giving you this year ? KATE Fourteen dollars a week . p. 11 HARDY That 's a lot for just standing behind a counter and waiting on folks , and it 's cash every Saturday night . I 'd feel rich if I had it after I pay my help and put aside for my taxes and interest . HELEN That 's because we 're land poor , the same as we 've always been . HARDY angrily.It 's because I have n't land enough to make truck farming a business like it ought to be , so as I could have help and teams and tools and do things right , and make money ! I need twice the land I 've got , and I 'm going to have it . He turns on the water at the sink and holds his hand under it ; for the first time it is seen that he has hurt his hand slightly and that there is blood on it HELEN Your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , to tie it up . I sprayed the cabbages only Tuesday and I do n't want to get the poison in it . HELEN Let 's see . She takes his hand and looks at it HARDY Knife slipped . I would n't notice it only for the poison . HELEN I 'll fix it before you touch the cabbages ; clean it good , I 'll get a rag . He holds it under the water as she selects a bit of cloth from the table drawer p. 12 HARDY Tom Lane 's opening his garage to-day . KATE I know . HARDY No fool like a young fool ! HELEN crosses with her improvised bandage.Here ! He holds out his hand and she deftly binds it upI never saw so many cars as there are this year , and the summer business has hardly started . I should n't wonder if Tom made money . HARDY A man 's a farmer or he ai n't ! HELEN There 's money in other things besides truck farming . HARDY The twenty acres this side of his house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man had it that knew how to lay it out . HELEN finishes bandage.There ! HARDY I must get them started at the cabbages . He turns and stops in front of the easel . The picture on the easel is facing the window and he sees only the back of itWhat 's that ? HELEN Kate 's painting . I made her bring it down ; I wanted you to look at it . KATE nervously.No , mother ! p. 13 HARDY What do you want me to look at it for ? HELEN She 's your daughter , too ; it do n't seem right your not knowing what she 's doing . HARDY She paints good enough . I always thought . What of it ? HELEN She 's an artist ! I mean a real artist ! Two or three years ' teachin ' in New York will make her as good as any of ' em . He laughs a rather coarse and jarring laugh KATE hurt.You see , mother ! HELEN It 's your father that do n't see , but he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this painting right now ! She faces him angrily HARDY What do I know about pictures ? HELEN You 've got eyes ! She crosses to paintingIt 's just a painting she 's made sitting in her window . It 's just what you see every day of your life . Look ! She turns the painting to face him and the audience . A simple water color of a rural landscape HARDY I see ! KATE fearful.I do n't think father cares about  --  STEVE bends forward and takes the painting from HELEN . KATE stops p. 14 HELEN greatly pleased.He does ! He likes it ! KATE proudly.Father ! HELEN You see something in it , do n't you , Stephen ? HARDY I see Tom Jones ' twenty-acre field in it . Look how it lies to the sun there , sloping just enough ! I 'm going to have that land . I 've got to ! HELEN anxiously.But the picture ! HARDY Here ! Take it ! He drops it on tableAll Tom can think of is his new garage . He 'd sell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops and turnsKate ! KATE quite crushed.Yes , father . HARDY I 've got to ask you to help me out with the money you earn from Nepper this summer ! HELEN alarmed.Stephen ! HARDY She had her school money , I never touched it . It ai n't a thing I want to do , but I 've got to ! He turns to KATEYou give your mother ten dollars every Saturday . I 'll be expectin ' it . He exits p. 15 KATE takes up picture.He did n't care about my painting  --  all he could see was the land ! HELEN sadly.He 'll take your money ! Now we ca n't do it in a year ! KATE angrily.It is n't fair . What right has he to make me  --  HELEN interrupts her.Hush , dear ! I 'm going to find a way ! KATE You ca n't ! HELEN I do n't know . TOM LANE , a young fellow of about twenty-five , comes to the open door . TOM is in working clothes , a healthy , sturdy young animal LANE Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , Tom . As he enters KATE smiles at him.How 's the new garage ? LANE Great ! My stock 's in  --  more'n a thousand dollars ' worth , and five hundred gallons of gas . KATE So you 've really started ! LANE proudly.My sign 's out ; looks good if I did paint it myself . He grins cheerfully at KATEI do n't pretend to be an artist . p. 16 HELEN proudly.Artists do n't paint signs ! LANE I got my first job , too , fixing a car for a man named Lamont , Dana Lamont . KATE looks up at the mention of the name , then looks closely at her paintingHe 's taken the Curtis bungalow for the summer . HELEN busy about kitchen.His wife 's been here twice for eggs and butter ,  --  she 's a nice woman ; she made me show her all over the house yesterday . I never saw anybody make such a fuss as she did over mother 's old curly maple bed and dresser . LANE Why ? HELEN She liked it , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the covers off the red plush set in the parlor she hardly so much as looked at it ! LANE Well , they 've got money , and they 're going to be good customers of mine . His car 's in my place now . KATE I think it 's better than farming . LANE I know it is . I 'm worried about the roads being so bad just below ; that 's going to hurt . Some folks will go up the Middle Island Road , and I 'll lose them , but I 'm bound to make good money . HELEN That Mrs. Lamont is coming for a dozen more eggs to-day . She 's expecting company . She takes a basket from shelfI 'll get them for her . p. 17 KATE I 'll do it . HELEN No , show Tom your painting . You 've been out enough in the hot sun . She exits LANE She 's good to you ! KATE Mother 's wonderful ! LANE She takes care of you just like you were some  --  some sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough things  --  too good for rough people  --  and she thinks I 'm one of ' em  --  and I guess I am . KATE My painting 's finished . LANE Is it ? Let 's look . Crosses and looks KATE anxiously.I tried so hard , and now I do n't know . LANE Do n't know what ? KATE If it 's really good . LANE after a long look.It 's great ! KATE Do n't say so if you do n't mean it ! LANE It 's great ! He points with his fingerThat 's the fence between your place and mine , and that 's my twenty-acre lot ! Any fool knows that 's a good picture ! p. 18 KATE I think it 's good . I 'm almost sure of it ! I 've worked so hard , Tom , without anybody much to help me  --  sometimes I 'm not sure , and that 's awful  --  it would break mother 's heart , and mine , of course ! LANE It 's a nice way to spend your time , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come over . KATE The movie theater 's opening to-night for the summer . I sort of thought I might walk down there with  --  with one of the girls . HELEN re-enters at back with a dozen eggs in her basket LANE very reluctant.I  --  I 'll take you , if you want to go . KATE Do n't you ? LANE They bother me , movin ' pictures , all about other folks ' wives and murders and poor girls gettin ' married to rich men , an ' young fellers makin ' a million dollars in a couple of days , when everybody knows they ca n't . It wastes your time , and I do n't know as it 's right , puttin ' ideas into peoples ' heads . HELEN What would you put there ? LANE It 's hard enough to keep on your job without thinking about things . KATE But you ca n't just work ! p. 19 LANE Why ? KATE I think the pictures are fun , and they 're a change from reading . LANE Book reading ? Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to writin ' books ! I gave ' em ' all up but one . KATE What one ? HELEN dryly.His account book . LANE grins at her.That 's right . HELEN Maybe it ai n't right , but it 's true . LANE Laugh , all you please , and of course I know you 're laughing . I ai n't mean , anyhow , I ai n't dog mean  --  but what I want is money . When I get enough of that I guess folks will forgive me if I do n't know Charlie Chaplin from Douglas Fairbanks , an ' even if I ai n't a fancy dancer . He steps toward door HELEN There 's more folks know how to save money than there is that know how to spend it . LANE By the time a feller learns enough to save it he 's got too much sense to spend it . I 'm going back to the garage and sit and wait for trade . That 's got the pictures beat , I guess ! He crosses stage . KATE looks after him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See you later . He exits KATE It 's funny  --  in some ways he is so like father , and living right next door to us . HELEN Maybe it 's catchin ' . She crosses to KATE and putting her hand on KATE 'S shoulder she looks down at her gravelyKate ? KATE Yes , mother . HELEN He 's been around a lot lately ! KATE Yes . HELEN You 're not thinkin ' of him ? KATE drops her eyes . HELEN looks frightenedKate ! If you was to do that , what 's the good of all we 've done ? KATE Oh , I would n't . Not  --  not the way you mean  --  only  --  only I think he likes me  --  and  --  and  --  She stops HELEN And he 's the best you know . KATE Yes , he 's that . HELEN But not the best you 're going to know ! We think that thousand dollars it will take us most ten years to save is a lot of money ? KATE I should say so ! p. 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried.But  --  HELEN Do n't be silly ! You 've got a talent ! They 'll make room for you ! KATE I hope so . HELEN They will  --  if you work hard  --  and you must ! If you was to fail , I 'd feel somehow as if all my life had been just wasted ! KATE earnestly.I 'll work . HELEN tenderly.I know you will . KATE touched.You 're the one who ought to go , mother ! HELEN I 'm going , the very best way  --  the part of me that 's in you is going  --  what I was once  --  what I wanted to be  --  I gave all that to you . When they all come crowding around you some day , saying you 're a great artist , men and women , different from the kind we know , you 'll be proud , but you wo n't be so proud as I 'll be ! DANA LAMONT , a New York artist , comes to the door . LAMONT , although an artist , is not at all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-mannered man of middle age DANA I beg your pardon , but I was to meet my wife here , Mrs. Lamont . p. 22 HELEN She was coming for some eggs , but I have n't seen her . Come in and wait , wo n't you ? DANA enters.Thank you . She asked me to meet her here . HELEN This is my daughter , Mr. Lamont . DANA Good morning , Miss  --  Hardy  --  is n't it ? KATE Yes , sir . HELEN Wo n't you sit down ? Offers chair DANA Thanks  --  no  --  I am going to leave a message for my wife , if you do n't mind . Please say that I have walked on to the new garage to see what is being done about my car . If the man here ca n't fix it . I shall have to arrange to have it towed to Huntington HELEN Tom Lane will fix it ! DANA Really  --  is he a good mechanic ? HELEN He 's a good business man . KATE He 's a good mechanic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wo n't let it go to Huntington . DANA Would you mind asking Mrs. Lamont to walk along and meet me on the road ? HELEN I 'll tell her if she comes . p. 23 DANA She 'll come ! Thank you very much . He turns to doorwayI envy you the view from your front windows , Mrs. Hardy ; it 's quite unusual . HELEN That depends on how long you 've been looking at it . DANA I think I could enjoy looking at it forever . HELEN I have n't tried that yet , but I was born right on the other side of the road . DANA And you are tired of it , of course . Just as my eyes have grown tired of bricks and mortar , of curbstones and asphalt ! Beauty , after all , is in contrasts . HELEN We do n't raise ' em around here . DANA You have managed to keep a twinkle in your eyes , in spite of monotony  --  so you 're all right ! Good afternoon ! Good afternoon , Miss Hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him.That 's what I meant , a gentleman ! That 's the kind of men you 're going to know ! KATE Dana Lamont ! Do n't you know who he is ? Wait ! She selects a magazine from the small table and turns the pages until she finds the page , then crosses to HELENLook ! I knew as soon as Tom spoke his name . p. 24 HELEN awed.He painted that ! She looks at the reproduction in the magazine with something almost like reverenceDana Lamont ! Kate ! Why did n't you show him the picture ! She points to KATE 's picture KATE Mother ! I would n't have dared ! HELEN firmly.I wish I 'd known ! KATE Mother ! HELEN That 's the way to learn , from the real big ones ; from folks that know ! KATE But I would n't have any right to bother a man like Dana Lamont ! HELEN Why ! I showed his wife how to bake corn bread yesterday . KATE That 's different . HELEN It ai n't ! I know how to bake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean ; it 's only fools . DORA LAMONT comes to door . DORA is a pretty and beautifully dressed woman with a frank , jolly nature , quite unaffected and kindly DORA Was that my husband I saw disappearing down the road ? HELEN Yes , it was . Come in , Mrs. Lamont . DORA entersThis is my daughter . p. 25 DORA How do you do ! KATE shyly.I 'm pleased to meet you . HELEN shows magazine.We were just looking at this . DORA looks . " The Harvest . " Is n't it lovely ! HELEN gravely.Yes  --  lovely ! She puts magazine on tableShe paints too ! She looks proudly at KATE DORA Really  --  that 's splendid ! KATE Please , mother ! HELEN gets basket.Here 's your eggs  --  Mr. Lamont said he was going to the garage and you was to meet him on the road . DORA Thank you , but these are only eggs  --  where is my butter ? HELEN You got a pound yesterday ! DORA But I want it every day ! HELEN Oh  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of butter from the spring house , Kate . KATE Yes , mother . She crosses and gets a plateI wo n't be a minute . She exits p. 26 DORA She 's pretty ! HELEN She 's more than that  --  I want to show you something  --  that 's why I sent her . She crosses and turns KATE 's paintingLook ! DORA looks DORA Why , it 's really very nice ! HELEN Yes . DORA You must be proud of her ! HELEN Yes . DORA looking at picture.What a lovely country it is about here . The slope of that hill side is exquisite ! HELEN That 's what my husband says , but he was thinking of the drainage . DORA laughs.That 's like a husband ; not mine , of course , but artists are different . HELEN Yes  --  you think it 's good , that picture ; I mean , really good ? DORA I am sure it is !

All the help she 's had was a Miss Crosby at Northport . You think she 's got talent  --  I mean real talent ?

DORA Of course he would . HELEN And tell her where to go when she gets to New York ,  --  who the best teachers are ? DORA I am sure he would ; I 'll bring him here myself . HELEN It 's awful to ask favors , but you do sometimes , for people you love enough ! DORA Of course you do , and it is n't a favor . My husband says one proof of a real artist is his willingness to help another . HELEN I knew that . DORA laughs.You know a lot , do n't you ? HELEN Yes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tall , lank , serious-looking fellow who is in his shirt sleeves .

Holds up the signGoing to close the road and send folks around Smithtown way . I thought I had nails with me , but I ai n't . KATE at drawer of table.This big enough ? She holds up nail GLENNY About right . KATE Here . She brings him four or five nailsSure they 're enough ? GLENNY Plenty , thanks ; the men are closing the road now and I ought to get this up quick . He exits .

HELEN Oh , well , so long as a person gets where they want to go , I guess a detour do n't matter much . p. 29 DORA lightly.Unless it takes you where you do n't want to go . She takes out her pocketbookHow much do I owe you ? HELEN Sixty cents for the butter , and eighty-five for the eggs , a dollar and  --  and  --  KATE Forty-five . HELEN to KATE.When you go I 'll get a slate . DORA puts the money on the table DORA And thank you very much ! Oh ! I knew I was forgetting something .

I would n't be able to get along without ' em . DORA Oh  --  I thought you would be glad of the chance of disposing of them . p. 30 HELEN No , I guess not . They were mother 's , you see . I do n't think I 'd like other folks having them . DORA Just tell him so then . I thought you cared more for your parlor furniture . HELEN I do ; nobody can help liking fine things like my parlor set better than old truck , but being mother 's makes a difference . DORA Of course it does .

She goes to shelf and drops the money in the old jar , then crosses to where KATE stands looking down at her painting . HELEN puts her arm about her and they stand together looking at it p. 31 KATE It frightens me to have him see it ! HELEN Because he knows ? KATE Yes . HELEN That 's why I want him to . KATE He may just see the faults , not all it 's meant to us ! HELEN It 's all there ! Sometimes it seems like a part of it was mine . KATE Of course it is ! HELEN The hope that was in me , the wanting to see something different to do something bigger ! KATE anxiously.How can he see all that ? HELEN It 's there ! I see it !

She is dismayed LANE Yes  --  they got me shut up like I had the smallpox ! HELEN shocked.I 'm stupid ! I did n't think ! LANE I guess I 'm the stupid one ! Anybody that buys gas of me now would have to come for it in an airship . HELEN I 'm sorry . KATE It 's a shame ! LANE bitterly.I did n't plant much more than half a crop , countin ' on this garage !

He turns on herAll the cash I had , and I owe most a thousand that 's past due . I tried to save money by doin ' the concrete work myself , and I lost a month ; my stock 's been here five weeks and I had it on thirty-day notes .

The knock is repeated KATE There 's some one at the door ! LANE You do n't mean that . KATE turns and crosses and opens door . WEINSTEIN , a Jew , a trader in furniture , is in the doorway .

KATE Yes . WEINSTEIN I am Weinstein . I haf a store by Huntington . There is some curly maple furniture ; I come to see it . KATE Grandmother 's curly maple ! Mrs. Lamont sent you ! WEINSTEIN She said you haf some old furniture ; maybe it ai n't so good but I buy effery thing . KATE I am almost sure mother wo n't sell it . WEINSTEIN Maybe I gif you something pretty good ! p. 35 KATE Oh , I 'll ask her , but I do n't think it 's any use . Come in .

WEINSTEIN Curly maple bed it was , and a dresser. p. 36 HELEN It 's all a mistake . I 'm sorry you came so far . I do n't want to sell it . KATE I told him that . WEINSTEIN I might look at it ? HELEN I do n't see what good that would do , but do n't mind if you want to . WEINSTEIN If it 's good curly maple I like to buy it ; if I ca n't buy it , I like to look at it anyhow .

KATE When I can . Not for a long time , but I 'm going ! LANE This summer ? KATE Not till we can get the money .

She steps away from him nervously , he follows LANE You could ! KATE desperately.No  --  No  --  I do n't even want to ! LANE I 'm in trouble , I 'm going to lose a lot of money  --  maybe all I 've got  --  if it was n't for that I would n't let you go  --  I 'd keep you  --  in spite of her ! p. 38 KATE Do n't , Tom ! Mother 'll hear you ! She steps away from him as HELEN and WEINSTEIN enter HELEN as she enters.I do n't care ! Somehow it would n't seem right ! WEINSTEIN It 's a good offer ! HELEN Oh , yes , but I could n't ! That set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ! It seems as if it was one of the first things I can remember ! Mostly when I think of her , it 's the way she looked lying there so long . WEINSTEIN Vell , I gif you a new bed for it that nobody effer died on . HELEN No . WEINSTEIN And maybe a hundred dollars ! HELEN I could n't . WEINSTEIN Even a hundred and fifty ! HELEN No , I wo n't . I do n't care what you offer ! I would n't sell it for  --  She stops and turns on him suddenlyYou would n't give me three hundred dollars for it , would you ! WEINSTEIN steps back in alarm . Three hundred dollars !

He exits , shutting the outside doorThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have been ashamed always ! LANE faces her angrily . Kate was tellin ' me that she 's going to New York as soon as she can . HELEN Yes , she is . LANE bitterly . And I was tellin ' her that if it was n't for you she would n't ever go . HELEN Maybe , but you see there is me ! LANE And there 's me ! She ca n't go till she gets the money , and money 's scarce around here ! HELEN Yes . LANE Maybe I 'll have something to say before that time comes ! HELEN Say it now ? p. 40 LANE I ca n't ! You know that ! HELEN Now 's the time ! You want to go , do n't you , Kate ? KATE I told him I did . LANE I got a year anyhow ! I wo n't let her go ! There is a knock on door HELEN Wait a minute .

HELEN I thought you did n't want to pay me three hundred dollars for it ? WEINSTEIN I do n't , but I got to . Come in , Jake . He enters JAKE All right , popper . JAKE enters  --  a Jewish boy with a comic likeness to WEINSTEIN HELEN looking at TOM.You 've got a year anyway , you said , Tom ! WEINSTEIN counting money from pocketbook on table . Three hundred dollars ! KATE You 're not going to sell it ! p. 41 HELEN Yes  --  I am ! I 'll move your bed into my room . There 's that old cot you can sleep on to-night  --  You 're going to New York to-morrow ! KATE To-morrow ! HELEN turns to WEINSTEIN HELEN Where 's the money ! She takes it from WEINSTEIN and countsYes . She turns to KATETake him upstairs . KATE Without father 's knowing ? HELEN The bed and the dresser ! Go along ! KATE Yes , mother .

That 's why you took that money ! HELEN No , I did n't know it . I do n't think you could . LANE But you were n't sure . HELEN No ! LANE How do you know she 'll be happier there than she 'd be here with me ? p. 42 HELEN I do n't know much about there , Tom . But I know a lot about here , so she 's going ! LANE Nobody 's got a right to spoil another person 's life ! HELEN That 's why I ai n't going to let anybody spoil hers ! You say you could stop her going if you had another year . Perhaps you could  --  you live next door , you see her every day and there 's hardly anybody else  --  and you 're young , and she 's young ! Do n't I know ! Have n't I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's fine , and you want to take it for yourself ! You want to make her stay here and do ugly things , dirty things with her hands , all day long  --  and I want her to go where she can be big , and free  --  and use her hands just to make things that 's beautiful . STEPHEN HARDY enters from outside HARDY Hardly enough cabbages to pay for pulling . I scarcely made up a truck load between ' em and the beans . LANE You saw what they 've done to the road , did n't you ? HARDY Yes  --  I guess it wo n't help you much with your new garage business . I never did believe in it ; a man 's a farmer or he ai n't ! LANE It 's deeper than that . A man 's a fool or he ai n't . I guess it 's easy enough to tell about me ! WEINSTEIN 'S voice is heard out left p. 43 WEINSTEIN outside . Easy now ! Hold your end vay up ! At the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S voice goes onHold your end vay up , Jakey ! JAKE outside . All right , Popper . HARDY Who 's that ? HELEN It 's the man from Huntington ; he buys furniture . I sold him a couple of things . KATE enters and holds the door open . She is followed by WEINSTEIN and JAKE , who carry the headboard of a wooden bed covered by one of their old quilts KATE Be careful of the door ! WEINSTEIN Careful , Jakie ! JAKE All right , Popper . As they start to cross the stage , STEPHEN steps forward and speaks HARDY What you got there ? WEINSTEIN Vot ? He is carrying his end of the bed in such a way as to practically place himself behind the bed so that he ca n't see STEPHEN HARDY repeats sternly . What you got there ? p. 44 WEINSTEIN Vot ? He lowers his end suddenly . JAKE Look out , Popper ! He catches it WEINSTEIN sees STEPHEN . Excuse me . I did n't see you ! HARDY to HELEN . What 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our room . HARDY Have you gone crazy ! HELEN No . HARDY to WEINSTEIN . Take it upstairs again . WEINSTEIN I bought them of the lady ! HARDY You 'll get your money back ; do as I tell you . WEINSTEIN But  --  HELEN I sold ' em to him , Stephen ! HARDY Put it back ! This is my house ! HELEN ' T was mother 's and she gave it to me , and I 've sold it ! HARDY to WEINSTEIN . I would n't advise you to make any trouble here , not with me ! I tell you to take that thing upstairs ! p. 45 WEINSTEIN It was a fair bargain . HARDY bitterly . Fair ! What does your kind know about fairness ? You come here when you see there 's no man around and start to strip my house , leave me without a bed to sleep in ! We 've had talk enough . He steps forward angrilyYou 'd better put it back ! HELEN I 'm going to move Kate 's bed in our room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , because it 's his and I 'm going to keep what I got . HARDY I suppose you want to be robbed ! That set 's worth money ! Nevin 's wife sold an old bed and dresser no better'n that a while ago for almost a hundred dollars . HELEN I know , she was always flighty . She holds up her roll of billsI sold mine for three hundred . HARDY in awe . Three  --  hundred ! HELEN Dollars ! HARDY Three hundred ! WEINSTEIN looking at him anxiously . Vell ? HELEN Go on . She nods toward the door . JAKE and WEINSTEIN exit with the bed@@ The HARDY 'S side porch a few hours later . The porch , which is not raised above the stage level , takes up the greater part of the stage . Over this porch is a pagoda-like roof above which the second-story windows of the house are shown . A door and a window at right of the door open onto the kitchen . On the porch are two chairs , a small table , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning , as though here was a sharp curve in the highway ; a tree is near by , and just inside of this fence and on this tree the detour sign . A gate just above this opens into the back yard . In this scene everything must be sacrificed to the acting space which is the porch itself . At rise of curtain , STEPHEN HARDY , a pipe in his mouth , sits alone on the porch , he is thoughtful and silent , he just sits slowly puffing at his pipe . In a moment TOM LANE enters in the road at back , walking slowly . He enters the yard through the gate and steps onto porch . STEVE glances at him without moving . HARDY Oh . TOM sits , takes out his pipe and fills it but makes no answer and hunts in his pocket for a match LANE Light ? STEVE throws him a box of matches , TOM lights his pipe and tosses them back ; both smoke in silence p. 47 HARDY Ought to cut that field of yours down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . For a moment they puff awaySteve  --  I 'm in a hell of a mess ! HARDY Yes ? LANE Yes ! HARDY Talkin ' wo n't help it . There is a pause You do n't half farm your place lately ; seems like you had something better to do . Maybe you got too much land . I do n't know but I 'd like to own that twenty acres of yours  --  join ' onto mine . LANE You can . HARDY You mean that ? LANE Yes , you 've always thought you could do more'n I could with it . HARDY I 'd lay it out different . I 've had my eye on it ever since I was a boy . LANE I always thought you had . Well if I 've got to sell , I 'd rather it would be yours than anybody 's . HARDY All that bothers me is cash . LANE alarmed . I need cash bad . HARDY What 's the twenty acres worth ? LANE Six thousand . p. 48 HARDY Five 's enough , two-fifty an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . You want that land ? HARDY earnestly . Yes  --  I do ! LANE You can have it for five thousand . HARDY It 's the cash bothers me ! LANE I telephoned the jobber to New York just now an ' I asked him for an extension on my note ; he would n't do anything . I offered him his stock back and he laughed at me ! He 's going to get out an attachment , if he ai n't already . HARDY That 's bad ! LANE What 's the most cash you could raise for me to-day ? HARDY Five hundred . LANE It would n't help ! He sits back and draws on his pipeMy pipe 's out ! HARDY tosses him box of matches . Here ! TOM relights pipeI 'd pay another five hundred in four weeks ; my potatoes will fetch that . LANE It 's to-day I want it . I 'll sell you my twenty acres for five thousand  --  that 's fifteen hundred cash above what it 's mortgaged for , and you can let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent I 've got in the bank , an ' I was figuring that for something else . LANE Then we ca n't trade . For a moment they both smoke in silence HARDY Gim me back my matches ! TOM tosses them to him and he puts them in his pocketGimme two days to raise this money ? LANE Two hours . HARDY I 'll try ! He rises from his chair I only got one chance ; wait till I telephone . He exits into kitchen , TOM sits in thought . HELEN 's face is seen for a moment as she glances out of window from the kitchen . A moment later she comes to the open doorway ; she has evidently been baking , as her arms are covered with flour , and as she speaks to TOM , she wipes them on her apron HELEN What 's he calling Ben Glenny for on the telephone ? LANE He did n't say . HELEN opens the screen door and steps out on porch HELEN Nothin 's upsets me more'n his law business with Ben Glenny ! Ben 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to think of him like he was human . To me he always seems sort of a walking calamity ! p. 50 LANE Ben ai n't got no law business ! He never was admitted to the bar ! HELEN He 's County Clerk , Notary Public and most everything , especially Tax Collector . Last time he was here I told him as long as he was Tax Collector I did n't know but what it would be more convenient if I was to arrange to board him . LANE That 's like the sort of things you 're always sayin ' ! Things you do n't mean , and you know folks know you do n't mean . You say ' em just because they seem kind of funny to you . HELEN I s'pose so  --  LANE It 's sort of an aggravatin ' habit . HELEN So he 's told me , often ! LANE Excuse me for speakin ' of it . HELEN Oh , I do n't mind ! It 's just my way of being impolite , like you smokin ' your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . LANE Oh ! He knocks the ashes out of his pipe hastily and drops it in his pocket HELEN You did n't have to stop . I ai n't goin ' to . LANE I guess you could n't . HELEN I guess not  --  I get so tired of sayin ' nothin ' but just exactly what 's so , and listen to folks that do n't ever mean the least mite more'n they say , or the least mite less ! What 's the use of your imagination ! p. 51 LANE Mine ? I ai n't got any , have I ? HELEN Oh , I guess so  --  but it 's like a muscle ; it gets awful puny if you do n't use it . LANE I 'd rather have one real dollar than dream I was a millionaire ! HELEN I s'pose so  --  I 'd rather have one real dream than be a millionaire ! LANE Well , it 's all right so long as we 're both satisfied . Where 's Kate ? HELEN At the Port , buying some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago  --  that she was goin ' to New York to-morrow ? HELEN No . LANE Just another dream ? HELEN She 's goin ' to-night . LANE To-night ! When did you settle on that ? HELEN Just a minute ago  --  She looks at him I happened to think of something that frightened me . LANE If I was her father I would n't let her go . HELEN I believe you ; you 're a lot like Steve  --  LANE I hope so , Steve Hardy 's a sensible man , and an honest man ! p. 52 HELEN And a good man . Never was wild in his life , an ' he 's truthful , and he never drank or gambled . LANE I know . HELEN And you never did . LANE Never wanted to . HELEN That 's a comfort . LANE A lot of good it does me ! You do n't want her to marry me . HELEN No . LANE Why ? HELEN Oh , I guess it 's because she 's got too much of what I used to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's like you , why ca n't we be married same as you was ? HELEN I said she was like what I used to be . LANE If you ask me I 'd say it 's him she takes after . HELEN laughsShe does ! She 's slower thinkin ' , like him , and more set , more contented . She 's quieter than you , and she ai n't so smart . HELEN You flatter me ! LANE seriously.That ai n't how I meant it . She 's just what I like ; that 's why I do n't want her to go . I want to marry her ; I been figurin ' on it two years . p. 53 HELEN That 's longer than you 've been planning your garage ! LANE Yes , I been so busy buildin ' the garage I ai n't seen much of her . HELEN But it would n't have done to neglect the garage . LANE No . HELEN There 's something in the Bible about trying to serve two masters . STEVE enters from kitchen and sitsWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN You 've got more imagination than I gave you credit for . HARDY He 's goin ' to drive around pretty soon . HELEN alarmed.You ai n't tryin ' to raise more money on this place ? HARDY I 'm tryin ' to . She looks at him and sighs at the hopelessness of it as KATE comes rapidly along the road and enters gaily through the gate . She has with her a long cardboard box , a hat box and several small packages . As she turns a corner of the house and sees them , she stops for a moment startled KATE Oh ! HARDY Been down to the Port ? p. 54 KATE Yes . HARDY To Neppers ? KATE evasively.I was there for a minute  --  yes . HARDY It did n't take you long to learn the stock . KATE I  --  I  --  HARDY rises , sternly.What is it ? You 're hidin ' something ' ! KATE desperately.Mother ! Does n't he know ? HELEN It 's all right , dear ! She puts her hand on KATE 'S shoulder and turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , Stephen ; she 's going to New York . HARDY No . HELEN She 's going to study art . HARDY That 's nonsense ! HELEN We do n't think so ! HARDY Think ! That 's the trouble with yer , both of yer ; you do n't think ! HELEN Maybe not , but we feel a lot . HARDY Study art ! HELEN Yes . HARDY I wo n't have it ! p. 55 HELEN I made my mind up to it , whether I think or I do n't , over ten years ago . It 's just as much a part of my life  --  what I 've planned she 's goin ' to do and be  --  as the work I do is , or this old dress that I 've worn and worn and worn until I would n't know myself in any other . I could n't any more live without the hope of what 's coming to her than I could live without drink or food . HARDY She 's my child as much as she 's yours ! HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , but I guess I did a little more for her than you did . HARDY When was you plannin ' for her to go ? HELEN To-night ! KATE startled.To-night , mother ? HELEN Yes . Mary Barton 's going up on the six o'clock train . She was here just after you left . She is going visitin ' her sister way up town in New York , an ' she said she could keep you over night just as well as not . HARDY What would she do to-morrow ? HELEN That Mr. Lamont , an artist , that 's taken the bungalow for the summer , is goin ' to tell us the names of the best teachers  --  his wife promised  --  and the Y.W.C.A. folks in New York will help her find a place to board . p. 56 HARDY How long before she comes back ? HELEN bitterly.Here ! HARDY Yes . HELEN That 's for her to say  --  I been workin ' a long time ; she 's got to do the rest . HARDY What 's the sense of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LANE There ai n't any . HARDY There ! You heard that ? HELEN wearily.I was n't listenin ' ! LANE I guess she heard me right enough , only I guess she thinks it ai n't any of my business . HARDY It could be easy enough ; I always thought ' t would be ! I thought , seein ' you two together so much , that sooner or later you 'd ask her to marry you . LANE I did . HELEN And she said no . HARDY angrily.She did . LANE spitefully.She did n't  --  she would n't say yes , but she never really said no , so as a fellar would know she meant it ! The no come from somewhere 's else ! p. 57 HARDY What do you mean ? LANE From her ! He looks at HELEN bitterly HARDY Hold on . Let 's get the rights of this ! HELEN That 's easy . Do you s'pose I 'd try to make her do anything she did n't want to do ? LANE Yes , I do . HARDY She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN I would n't ! Kate ! KATE Yes , mother ! HELEN You 've heard them  --  I want you to tell your father the truth ! LANE One way or the other . You know what I want you to say . I may be in hard luck now , but I wo n't be always . I 'm a man that means to get ahead ! HARDY And he will ! I know Tom . I want you to answer him , Kate ! HELEN And so do I ! He offers you one thing  --  I guess you know what it is  --  all 's you 've got to do is to open your eyes and look around you . HARDY What are you offerin ' her that 's so much better ? Just what is it ? HELEN It 's hard to say  --  just in words , but I think she knows . p. 58 HARDY Well , I do n't know ! HELEN Tom here said a while ago I was always dreaming  --  that 's so I guess  --  She turns to KATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm offerin ' you , my dear ! One of my dreams  --  come true . KATE And I 'm going to take it , mother , and make it true . HELEN I knew you was . She puts one hand on KATE 'S shoulder and faces themThere are times when I 've got courage enough to laugh even at a man ! She turns to KATENow you run upstairs . There 's lots for you to do if you 're goin ' to-night . KATE But father ? HELEN I 've tried hard to be a good wife to him , I guess he knows that . I hope he does n't think that because I never made a real fight before that I ai n't got the spirit to make one now . You run along  --  I 'll tend to everything . KATE Yes , mother . She exits HARDY You talk big . Where 's the money comin ' from ? Three hundred dollars wo n't last forever ! HELEN We got a little more . HARDY How much ? p. 59 HELEN Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one around this place that could n't save nothin ' . Seems like what happened to a girl like that was more important than what happened to me ! We 'll talk about this again after I see Ben Glenny , but I do n't want you to think I 'm going to stand for any nonsense . He exits at left around the house LANE with rather malicious pleasure.He 's mad ! HELEN He 'll get over it . LANE doubtfully.I do n't know ! HELEN You 've never been married . If you had you 'd know there ai n't anything else for married folks to do . LANE I do n't blame him none for bein ' mad ! HELEN It 's natural . He thinks he ought to be let to say what Kate does with her life . LANE Of course . HELEN Because it 's right that every man should be the master , and decide things that really matter . Women ought to just cook , and clean , and sew , and maybe chop a little wood , and have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . p. 60 HELEN And if a woman sometimes gets to thinkin ' it ai n't quite fair , if she sets herself to sort of change things a little , she 's flyin ' in the face of Providence ! LANE I look at it like this  --  a fellar ought not to be hard on a woman if she kinder fusses once in a while . HELEN So long as she ai n't let to do anything ? LANE That 's it ! HELEN That idea ai n't original , is it ? LANE suspiciously.Whatter you mean ? HELEN You borrowed it ! LANE Who from ? HELEN Adam ! She exits to house and through the window she is seen for a moment at her kitchen work . TOM turns sulkily and crosses left as DORA LAMONT crosses in from left on the road DORA Oh , Mr. Tom ! I was on my way to see you ! TOM crosses to her and they stand with the fence between them LANE There ai n't much use my hangin ' around my place with the road blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treeThis is as far as anybody can go . p. 61 DORA That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . They have put this barricade up , but the workmen are n't here yet . LANE They 've been here and gone . Nobody 's goin ' to do any hurryin ' about this job , you know ; it 's the taxpayers ' money . DORA My husband wants you to let our car out of your garage and bring it up to the bungalow right away . LANE Oh ! DORA You could lift that barricade away , could n't you ? LANE Yes , I could . DORA Well ? What is it ? LANE Nothin ' , only you see your car was all I had , the only one  --  I sort of hate to part with it . DORA smiling.That 's about the way we feel about it . LANE I know . I 'll bring it up . DORA I 'm sorry , but after all you have that great big farm ! LANE Oh , I 'm all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time to-day . LANE You 'll get it . DORA exits at left the same way she came . TOM stands for a moment in gloomy thought as KATE enters to the porch from the kitchen . KATE has put on her pretty new dress  --  quite modern in cut  --  and with it she has put on a new air of coquetry as though she had suddenly blossomed into womanhood and rejoiced in its power p. 62 KATE Hello , Tom ! LANE Kate ! He steps toward her quite overwhelmedKate ! What you been doin ' to yourself ? KATE Oh , just trying on my new dress . LANE Yes  --  yes  --  I see ! He turns away as if to go KATE Tom ? He takes another step and she speaks louderTom ! LANE Well ? He stops but he does n't turn KATE Turn around here , Tom Lane ! He turns slowly and faces herAre n't you going to tell me how you like it ? LANE About as much as the fellar likes to hear the Judge say , " And may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're spoiling everything ! LANE sadly.Something is , right enough . KATE The only decent dress I ever had . LANE I did n't say it was pretty  --  I did n't say how I thought you looked in it  --  I did n't dare to . KATE Why not ? p. 63 LANE I ai n't an artist  --  artists like things that are pretty just because they are pretty  --  I do n't care nothin ' about ' em unless they 're mine ! KATE archly.Meaning the dress ? LANE You know well enough what I mean ! KATE Yes , I know . I 'm sorry , Tom ! I do n't want to go away  --  with you hating me ! You 're mad with me now , and I know how hard it is for you to forgive anybody that makes you mad  --  but , Tom  --  you 're not going to be angry with me always . LANE A lot you 'd care ! How much will you think about this place , or anybody here , once you get out of it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANE darkly.I know , plenty of girls get to be ashamed of their folks ! KATE I would n't , and of course I could n't help thinking about you sometimes . Tom , remembering things  --  we 've been such good friends . LANE It do n't take long to lose a friend . KATE You 're blaming me because I 'm going ! LANE bitterly.No ! I 'm blaming her ! p. 64 KATE You must n't ! All that 's good I 've ever had she gave me . LANE Maybe it wo n't be so good as you two think it will . KATE frightened.You think I 'm going to fail . LANE All I 'm thinkin ' about is if you 'd stayed here we 'd have been happy . KATE Not unless  --  unless I 'd  --  I 'd cared . LANE She would n't let you care ! KATE You just wo n't try to understand ! This is something mother 's planned for me all my life . I ca n't help doing it . LANE Your mother gets ideas ! KATE She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and talk about it when I was a little girl . Daytimes she 'd take me walking with her and point out the pretty places in the woods , and the colors in the sky , and show me how different they were , and how wonderful . How could I help getting so I wanted to paint them ? How can I help wanting to go where some one can teach me to be what she 's so hungry for me to be ? LANE I guess you could n't , not unless it was like you said . Unless you cared about somebody else more'n you do about her . p. 65 KATE And I do n't ! If I did , I 'd hate myself ! LANE It 's all right ! I ai n't goin ' to take no advantage , I ai n't goin ' to try to keep you  --  but I could ! KATE No ! LANE Oh , yes , I could ! Your father 'd stop your goin ' , quick enough , if I was to tell him a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ! LANE I guess he 'd say if you was in love with me you could n't go , and if you were n't in love with me  --  and he knew about your lettin ' me kiss you four or five times , like I did last winter , and your puttin ' your arms around my neck  --  then I guess he 'd say he would n't trust you out of his sight . KATE You 'd tell him that  --  when you begged me so  --  when I was so lonesome ! LANE I do n't say I 'll tell him , but it 's a satisfaction knowin ' I could stop this thing if I was n't so sort of sentimental . KATE angrily. I 'd go now , no matter what you told him ! If he said I could n't go , I 'd run away ! LANE thoughtfully.You 've got spirit in you once in a while like your mother 's I wonder if maybe you do n't favor her more'n I figured you did !

LANE No , you 'll give me one kiss , I suppose , and you 'll think it 's damned funny if I do n't think anything you want to do is right . KATE I 'm going in , you can suit yourself ! She exits , to kitchen ; after a second 's sulky hesitation he follows . STEVE has joined BEN GLENNY at gate and they cross downstage together HARDY Well ? GLENNY I saw both of them . HARDY Sit down . They sit GLENNY It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face with a cotton handkerchief HARDY Saw both of ' em ? p. 67 GLENNY Yes . HARDY Already ?

Billings said you had so many mortgages on it now he did n't see where you found any room to raise crops . He was sort of jokin ' . HARDY He 's a fool ! GLENNY Allers was . HARDY But he 's got the money and I have n't ! GLENNY And he keeps what he 's got , and you do n't . HARDY I ai n't throwed away a dollar in twenty years , not so much as fifteen cents for a movin ' picture ! GLENNY You 're land hungry ! HARDY I 've got to get more land ! I 'm bound to do it !

But I was figurin ' to use it to buy Tom Lane 's twenty acres , if I could raise the balance . GLENNY And you need a thousand ? HARDY Yes . It 's a chance I wo n't get again . If Tom 's sold up for what he owes , the land 's gone for good , an ' if he pulls through an ' makes money with his garage , he would n't want to sell . p. 68 GLENNY They was some talk about Tom Lane an ' your girl Kate 's runnin ' around together . That 'd be one way of gettin ' that land in your family . HARDY I stopped dependin ' on a woman the day I was weaned . GLENNY Well , I ca n't do nothin ' fer yer . He rises I tried .

GLENNY Well if you 'd got it I s'pose ' t would have been all the harder for me to get your taxes out of yer . HARDY Maybe  --  but I 'd of had the land . GLENNY Well  --  good day . It 's some hot . HARDY An ' we need rain  --  good day , Ben . BEN exits out gate and along the road at left . STEVE sits in deep thought . HELEN comes to window and looks out , then crosses to door and standing back of the screen door , she speaks p. 69 HELEN I heard Ben Glenny 's voice . HARDY Yes . HELEN You did n't get the money you wanted out of him ? HARDY No . HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a minute , I want to talk to yer . HELEN opens the screen door and steps out on porch HELEN Kate an ' Tom Lane are in the parlor . She ought to be packin ' her trunk ; you 'll have to take it to the station . HARDY You get three hundred dollars for that old truck of your mother 's ? HELEN Yes . HARDY And I 've got five hundred in the bank . I 'm going to ask Tom if he 'll take eight hundred and my note for the balance . HELEN You 're going ' to give Tom Lane my three hundred dollars ? HARDY If he 'll take it . HELEN No . HARDY He 's got to take it ! He would , I know , if we was to get Kate to ask him . HELEN You do n't mean that ! HARDY Yes . p. 70 HELEN You 'd do a thing like that just for more land ? HARDY For that land ! HELEN I 've been a slave to land ever since I married you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been any more of a slave than I 've been ! You 're a good worker , but you ai n't worked like I do ! There ai n't a foot of this land here I ai n't watered with my sweat ! HELEN And you want more , and it 's all you do want ! More work for you and for me , more taxes and mortgages hangin ' over us . HARDY I want a farm ! I 'm bound to get it ! I 'm no damned Japanese ! I tell you this is my chance ! HELEN It 's Kate 's chance too , Steve . You 're forgettin ' that ! You would n't take her chance away from her ? HARDY Yes  --  I would . I 'm goin ' to ! HELEN I wo n't let you  --  that 's all  --  I just wo n't ! He rises without a word and crosses into the house . She looks distressed and anxious . In a moment he returns , in his hand the jug in which is the money and the dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , she steps back almost in terrorStephen ! HARDY There 's money here . I always knew you kept somethin ' in here , but it was no business of mine ! That three hundred dollars is here ? p. 71 HELEN nervously.Yes . HARDY There 's more , too ; it 's heavy ! He shakes the jar and the sound of the silver is heard HELEN All that 's there is mine and Kate 's . HARDY How much ? HELEN You said just now that what I kept in there was n't any business of yours , and it ai n't ! HARDY How much ? HELEN If I 've got any rights at all ! If you 've got any bit of feelin ' left for me , or for what I ask of you , I want you to put that down ! By way of answer , he throws the artificial flowers contemptuously aside , and turning the jug up he pours the contents out on the table HARDY as he sees.By God ! HELEN It 's just like you struck me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with her fingers . He counts the money eagerly and with growing joy and excitement HARDY Over a thousand dollars ! HELEN More'n ten years I done without  --  I made her do without ! Many a time I took her teachin ' money when she wanted a pretty dress , an ' I cried myself to sleep that night  --  but took it ! p. 72 HARDY With my five hundred it 'll be enough ! Tom 's in the parlor , you say ? He crosses to door of kitchen and callsTom ! Tom ! I want you ! As he turns back , HELEN springs between him and the table HELEN Do n't shame me before them , Steve , do n't . HARDY sternly.I want you not to make a fuss now , Helen . HELEN I tried to be a good wife to you all these hard , hard years . Once before I had money  --  I 'd saved it , just like I saved this  --  ' t was like a key  --  a key to the door that was shuttin ' me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you  --  because you made me love you  --  when I did n't want to . Now , when I ai n't got anything but that , too  --  do n't make me hate you ! TOM and KATE enter from the kitchen . KATE looks at her father and mother with dismay KATE What is it ? HARDY I 'll take that offer of yours , Tom . We 'll get Ben Glenny to draw up a bill of sale . Fifteen hundred cash and a mortgage for the balance ! HELEN to KATE.It 's your money ! He 's takin ' it . KATE Father ! p. 73 HELEN You 'll waste your time beggin ' him ! He 's a hard man ! LANE to STEVE.You 're goin ' to buy my land ? HARDY Yes . HELEN turns desperately to TOM.Tom ! You wo n't take it ; tell him you wo n't take it , knowin ' what it means to me an ' Kate ! KATE Of course he wo n't take it , mother ! HARDY Why wo n't he ? He needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , wo n't you , Tom ? KATE proudly.He wo n't ! LANE I want the money and he wants the land . I do n't see no reason why I should n't take it . KATE scornfully.After the way you were just talking to me in there ? She points to house LANE Buyin ' land , or sellin ' it is a matter of business . HELEN to KATE.We might have known he would ! HARDY I 'll telephone fer Ben Glenny ! He steps towards table , putting out his hand for the money p. 74 HELEN steps in front of him.You 're a thief , Steve Hardy ! HARDY Helen ! He draws back , horrified HELEN Just a thief ! A common thief ! Ai n't you robbed me always  --  of my youth  --  of my life  --  of my looks  --  I ai n't forty  --  and look at me  --  look what you 've done to me ! You thief  --  and now it 's her ! HARDY Nobody ever called me a name like that ! Nobody ever dared ! HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to me ! HARDY You ca n't call me a thief ! This is my house ; what 's in it is mine , all of it ! HELEN My mother 's furniture was n't yours ! HARDY It 's been part of the furnishin ' of my house for twenty years . Of course it 's mine ! So 's the rest of this money ! HELEN The savings out of her salary , teachin ' school and tendin ' store ! HARDY She 's my daughter , and she ai n't of age ! HELEN And ten years of savin ' dime by dime out of my egg and chicken money ! HARDY That 's the thanks I get fer lettin ' you call ' em yours  --  the hens was mine ! p. 75 HELEN Everything is yours ! HARDY Of course it is ! HELEN And I get my keep ! I have n't had a dress in two years , and then one I made myself . I get my food , but I have to cook it first . Where else would you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her keep ! They ai n't but one way to get a girl as cheap as that , and that 's to marry her ! KATE Like Tom Lane wanted to marry me ! HELEN The summer folks here pay a cook seventy-five dollars a month who 'd be too proud to do the work I do ! That Mrs. Lamont paid an agent ten dollars just for gettin her a cook ! That shows how smart you are , Steve Hardy ; alls you paid was one dollar for a weddin ' license ! HARDY putting money back into jar.You 're callin ' pretty hard names , wife , and I ai n't a patient man ! HELEN I 've been a patient woman , but I ca n't be any more ! Kate ! She throws her arms about herI do n't seem like I could stand it ! KATE clinging to her. Do n't , mother ! Do n't ! You break my heart ! HARDY What 's all the fuss about ! Why not let her stay here , same as all the other girls , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN Another wife  --  to another man like you ! HARDY Better maybe than sendin ' a young girl like she is out alone to mix with strangers in a place like New York City . HELEN Why is it ? Why ? How could it be ? HARDY How do you know what would become of her ? HELEN How could I know ? I only know what would become of her here ! HARDY You never thought about the other thing , did you ! About who she might meet , alone there  --  about what she might get to be . HELEN She might get to be a great artist , like I 've prayed she would . HARDY And she might get to be a woman of the streets ! HELEN And if she did would she sell herself as cheap as I did ! Would she fall any lower than I am ? She 'd have had her chance ; win or lose , she 'd have had it , she 'd have had some hours , anyway , somethin ' to remember ! HARDY shocked.You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you 've been here with me ! HELEN Yes ! HARDY All right ! My house is no place for you , not if you feel like that . He holds the jug out to her You claim this money . p. 77 HELEN I do ! I 'll keep on claimin ! it ! HARDY Take it , then , but remember this  --  if you do take it , and if she goes against my will  --  you go with her ! KATE Father ! HARDY to HELEN.You go , and you do n't come back . HELEN Wait  --  we got to understand each other ! You 're turnin ' me out ! HARDY You always claimed to be smarter than I was . I guess you got my meanin ' ! HELEN Oh , yes , I got that long ago  --  that everything must be for you , and nothin ' for me ! The only thing you ever gave me was your name , I bought that from you when I was young . I paid you for it with all I had  --  now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're sick of your bargain  --  you want to call it off . I wish to God you could  --  I 'd give you back your name if you 'd give me back what I paid for it ! HARDY Just words ! That 's all ! You heard mine ! If she goes  --  you go ! KATE You do n't mean it , father ! You ca n't ! HARDY to HELEN.I 'm going to let you choose ! HELEN All right ! There 's a train at seven ! She puts her arm about KATE and they turn and exit to the kitchen@@ SCENE .  --  HARDY 'S kitchen same as Act I about an hour later . STEPHEN , his pipe in his mouth , sits moodily by stove . TOM LANE , also with a pipe , stands in open doorway to the hall , shamelessly listening . LANE Wait a minute ! He bends eagerly out into hall , STEPHEN rises from his chair and stands looking at door . In a moment TOM turns back into roomNo , they 're movin ' around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARDY Oh ! He drops back into chair LANE contemptuously.And you 're going to let ' em go ! HARDY I ai n't goin ' to stop ' em . LANE You could  --  if you was to show a little spirit ! HARDY It 's for them to say ; only if they go they ca n't come back  --  not ever ! LANE As far as that goes , maybe they 'd never want to . He hears a soundWait ! They 're movin ' again ! He puts his head out into hall . STEVE looks at him but does not again get up . In a moment TOM turns backWhat do you s'pose I heard ' em doin ' ? p. 79 HARDY Cryin ' ? LANE Singin ' ! HARDY No ! LANE Yes ! And not hymns  --  tunes ! I guess you can take a rest from feelin ' like you was Simon Legree beatin ' Uncle Tom to death ! Looks to me like they was glad they was goin ' ! HARDY sternly.Then it 's best they went ! LANE It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! HARDY Yes . LANE It 's awful when she takes a thousand dollars with her ! HARDY Yes . He smokes in silence . TOM sits moodily in chair LANE If they was mine they would n't go ! HARDY coldly.Well  --  they ai n't . LANE a little resentful.I got to give you credit for one thing ; everything you say is always true , even if it ai n't very interestin ' . HARDY thoughtfully.It takes a lot of patience to get along with any woman . LANE Seems so . p. 80 HARDY She had her faults . LANE I know it . HARDY In most ways she 's been a good wife to me . LANE She 'd ought to be . HARDY I ai n't defendin ' her . LANE She was the kind I could n't ' a got along with . HARDY Why could n't you ? You wanted to marry Kate ! LANE She ai n't like her mother , she 's the " spit and image " of you . HARDY Kate ? LANE losing confidence.Leastways I always thought so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an automobile than you do about a woman , I guess it 's just as well they closed the road . He turns disgusted LANE Hark ! He rises suddenlySome one 's on the stairs ! He crosses and looks out to hall , then turns in great excitementYes ! Now we 'll know ! HARDY What will we know ? LANE If they 're really goin ' ! I bet they ai n't . HARDY Humph ! TOM sits ; in a moment KATE and HELEN enter . Between them they carry a trunk , and HELEN has an old cardboard box under one arm . They pay not the slightest attention to the men but put the trunk down left of center two or three feet away from where STEVE is sitting p. 81 HELEN Now we 'll get the trays . KATE without glancing at TOM or STEVE , who sit stolidly smoking their pipes . It 's too bad they 're no men in the house to help us . HELEN sniffs scornfully.You do n't smell anything peculiar , do you ? KATE doubtfully.I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine ; of course nobody would smoke in my kitchen ! HELEN and KATE exit to hall LANE They are goin ' ! HARDY After this I ai n't never comin ' in here without I smoke ! LANE Yes , sir ! They 're goin ! HARDY What time is it ? LANE You asked me that twice already ! What do you care ; you never do nothin ' ! HARDY wistfully.We used to eat at six . LANE Well , it 's about that now . Who 's going to get your meals for you ? HARDY It do n't take no brains to cook ! I can run a house as good as a woman . I ai n't going to have no hired girl ; I 'll do for myself ! p. 82 LANE Anybody can ; it 's nothin ' to make a fuss about . HARDY anxiously.I do n't s'pose she 'll take her cook book ? LANE What if she does ? All you need is a little common sense and a good appetite . HARDY You said ' t was six , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of yer ! They sit back puffing at pipes . HELEN and KATE enter ; in their hands they carry the two trays of the trunk HELEN Wait , I 'll open it . She puts the tray on the floor and opens trunk . KATE puts her tray in . HELEN sniffs at the tobacco smoke and crosses and opens the window directly back of TOM 'S chair , then goes and opens door ; a strong wind outside blows the window curtains and the draft annoys both TOM and STEVE KATE takes a deep breath.Ah ! That 's better ! HELEN pleasantly.It 'll air the room . KATE with a cold look at TOM.I noticed something disagreeable in here . This , and the cold air blowing on their backs , is too much for TOM and STEVE , who rise sheepishly and exit to the porch and out of sight . HELEN looks after them and laughs p. 83 HELEN I do declare it 's funny . I guess I 'm feelin ' sort of flighty or I would n't act so silly . I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose ! KATE I guess they deserve to be more uncomfortable than anything we say could make them . HELEN We 'd better hurry ; we 've got lots to do . KATE I left that other new dress of mine on a chair in your room ; you 'd better try it on . HELEN I would n't dare to wear it ! It 's cut so young ! KATE You ca n't go to New York in that old thing ! After this , I 'm going to see that you have everything I have , and I 'm going to have all I can get . HELEN We 'll have to be awful careful ! I do n't know as a thousand will be enough ! KATE Your going makes all the difference . I am not afraid any more . HELEN Why should we be ? KATE I 'll be making plenty of money long before we need it . HELEN I 'm as sure of it as I am of livin ' ! KATE Mother ! Just think ! We 're really going ! HELEN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' things ! p. 84 KATE Who 's afraid now ? HELEN It do n't seem real at all ! I guess thinkin ' about it so many years kinder makes it all seem like a story in a book  --  like it was about somebody else . KATE Well , it is n't . HELEN I know it , because every once in a while I get a kind of a sinking here . She puts her hand for a moment on her stomachLike a person does when they go down fast in an elevator ! KATE You do n't think I am going to fail ? HELEN I know you 've got the talent ; that 's all that matters . God gave it to you ; He 'll help us . KATE And you 're not worrying about  --  about father ? HELEN Why should I ? He ai n't worryin ' much about me . KATE No , neither 's Tom Lane worrying ! They do n't know how ! HELEN Some day , when I get settled down to think again , it 's goin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , forgettin ' in a minute all I 'd been to him for half a lifetime  --  but right now about all I 've got room for in my head is we 're goin ' ! KATE And you 're going to wear that new red dress ! p. 85 HELEN I do n't know but I 'd about as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb ! She takes a bulky roll of bills from her apron pocketHere , dear , the silver 's in a bag in the top tray of the trunk ; here 's the rest of it . KATE Why should I take it ? HELEN It 's your money . I 'm just going with you . KATE But  --  HELEN That 's the way I want it ! KATE takes money.I do n't see what difference it makes ; what 's mine is yours . HELEN Two people so much alike as we are , just living together , ca n't help being happy . She puts the cardboard box she has been holding on her arm on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top tray of her trunk and sees her mother sorting over the contents of the box KATE What 's that ? HELEN Just rubbish , things I 've had ever since I was a girl . I s'pose I 'd better burn it . She is looking through old letters , a few dance cards , a photograph or twoGoodness ! What truck folks keep ! She comes across a faded old photograph and after glancing at it , stands looking at it intently p. 86 KATE Let 's see what you 're looking at . She crosses and looks at the photograph at first with simple curiosity , then with amazed recognitionOh , mother ! She laughs HELEN indignant.I do n't see anything to laugh at ! KATE But to think of father  --  young ! HELEN Well , he was ! KATE Of course , he must have been ! I should think he would have lated it ! HELEN He was young as anybody once ! KATE looking at photo.He was about Tom 's age , was n't he ? HELEN He was better lookin ' . KATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She puts the photograph asideI wo n't burn it ! I ght to , but I wo n't ! She starts to art over the other things KATE It 's no use ! I ca n't think him as young ! Did he  --  She ggles  --  Did he use to make love to you ? p. 87 HELEN It might be a good thing if you minded your own business . KATE Wrote you love letters and everything ? HELEN Of course he did ! KATE I 'll bet they 're all there ! HELEN He did n't write many . KATE I 'll bet he did n't . HELEN They 're here somewhere  --  ah ! As she finds a pitifully thin package bound up with a faded ribbon KATE Is that all ? HELEN defencelessly.He was n't any much ! KATE puts out her hand. I want to read them ! HELEN draws away.Well , you ca n't ! She opens one of the letters and looks at it " January tenth , nineteen hundred . " That 's a long time ago ! KATE You ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is ! " My dear Helen ! " She readsI can remember how happy I was the day I got this . Just as if it was yesterday ! She reads " I got to New York all right , about six o'clock and went to the Bartholdi Hotel and got a room . It was most eight before I got through supper , so I went right to bed . " p. 88 KATE Go on ! HELEN That 's all ; he did n't write long letters . KATE Let 's see how he ended it ! HELEN reads . " Yours truly , Stephen Hardy . " KATE laughs.He would . HELEN That was just before we was married ! She opens another oneOh , yes ! As she looks at itThis was the year you was born  --  I was waitin ' for you , an ' he went to New York to raise the first mortgage we ever had on the farm . KATE Regular pleasure trip for him ! HELEN looking at letter.It 's funny , my forgettin ' so much ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that letter ! She points to stain on the old paper " My dear Wife . " She reads " I do n't like it here , and I wish I was back with you ! " She sights " The food here do n't agree with me , and eating costs so much you 've either got to starve , or eat and suffer ! I 've been thinking about you a lot , and about the hard time that 's coming to you  --  You 're a brave girl and a good wife  --  I know you 're going to be a good mother !  --  if the calf wo n't eat , you 'll have to give him a little warm milk morning and night . Remember you 've got to take good care of yourself until the baby comes . The rubbage from the garden will do for the pigs ' til I get home . Your loving husband  --  Steve ! " She sits in the chair and for a moment hides her face in her hands p. 89 KATE Do n't , mother ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted me , I 'd stay , just so long as he 'd let you go ! KATE He did n't want you , and he would n't let me go , not if he could help it ! HELEN I wonder , while God was doin ' it , he did n't fix it so 's we 'd be always young ! KATE Maybe because he meant for us to take all the happiness we could while we could get it , and if we let it slip away from us , nobody but ourselves would be to blame . HELEN Maybe  --  that 's why I do n't know as I deserve another chance . TOM LANE looks slyly in at the window . KATE sees him out of the corner of her eye and stoops close to her mother 's ear and speaks low KATE They 're looking at us through the window ! HELEN straightens up with dignity and puts the letters back into the box and crosses and drops the box into the top tray of the trunk ; then , her head thrown proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE . TOM looks in window again and speaks over his shoulder LANE They 're goin ' ! He and STEVE pass the window and enterI could n't hear what they was sayin ' ! p. 90 HARDY ' T was none of your business . LANE I would n't listen ! Anyhow , they talked awful low . STEVE crosses to the kitchen clock and after looking at it earnestly , he takes it down from the shelf and shakes it HARDY Seems later than ' t is ! I 'm goin ' to get supper . He crosses to cupboard LANE I suppose you 've got to get used to doin ' it . HARDY Any fool can do it ! He looks over the shelves of the cupboardThere 's plenty here , wasteful plenty ! LANE Whatter you goin ' to get ? HARDY W-w-e-l-l ? He takes down a package of prepared buckwheat flourI do n't know but what I 'll make a flapjack . LANE doubtfully.If I was you I 'd boil an egg ! HARDY reading directions.Simple enough ! Anybody can make a flapjack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANE I guess so , I never tried . HARDY There 's directions . He reads what is on packageI see ! He pours some flour directly into the frying panI 'll make plenty and you can stay an eat . He draws a dipper of water and pours it into the flour in the pan and stirs it with a spocn . TOM looks at the resulting mess doubtfully p. 91 LANE No ! No ! I guess I 'll eat at home ! HARDY angrily. What 's the matter with it ? LANE I do n't know . He bends over it curiouslyIt looks indecent . HARDY It 'll be all right ! LANE I was n't hungry even before I looked at that ! He crosses toward door I 'll see if they 've started workin ' on the road . HARDY I 'll be out after a while . LANE Not if you eat them flapjacks ! He exits . STEVE bends anxiously over his cooking as KATE enters with some clothes on her arm and stops in surprise KATE Father ! HARDY Well ! KATE crosses over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HARDY A flapjack . It ai n't quite boiled . KATE If you eat anything like that while we 're away , mother will have to hurry right home and nurse you ! HARDY If she goes she ca n't come back ; I told her that . p. 92 KATE But you did n't really mean it ? HARDY Yes  --  she knows I meant it and she 'll go for good ; she was always proud ! I got some pride myself and I ai n't likely to forget what she said  --  about bein ' unhappy here always . I ai n't likely to forget . KATE She 'd have been happy if you 'd been a little kinder to her . If you 'd showed her a little plainer that you loved her . HARDY It was her business to know it . KATE I do n't see how she could . HARDY A man ca n't be talkin ' about love all the time ! It 's just like religion  --  every day ai n't Sunday ! He looks at the mess in the frying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE Father ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! I never saw anything so funny in all my life ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! She runs out , laughing wildly . STEVE considers his mess gravely then picks up the package and adds more flour , finally emptying the whole package into it . As he bends over the stove , HELEN enters . She has on a smart dark red dress and has arranged her hair to give a new look almost of girlishness . She sees him at the stove and crosses firmly and pushes him away and looks at the mess p. 93 HARDY defensively.It would have been all right in another minute . HELEN I fed the pigs once to-day ! HARDY I was going to eat it . HELEN Go away ! She picks up the frying pan and throws the contents in a garbage pailI 'll fix you something ! HARDY stiffly.I wo n't trouble you . HELEN Some eggs ; that 's quick . She starts to prepare some scrambled eggs . He looks at her furiouslyWhat is it ? What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  different  --  sort of ! HELEN Oh , this dress ; it 's Kate 's . She made me put it on . HARDY It 's  --  sort of  --  er  --  red ! HELEN Yes . I think it 's nice . HARDY I do n't know as I like it so well as the red one you had . HELEN I have n't had a red one for twenty years . HARDY That 's the one I meant . He crosses and sits at table p. 94 HELEN at STEVE.You 'll die if you was to try to look after yourself ! I guess you can get a girl to come in for about seven dollars a week . HARDY in horror.Seven dollars a week ! HELEN About . She cuts him some bread HARDY A man would have a right to divorce a woman that 's actin ' like you 're doin ' ! HELEN Then you could marry a girl and save money ! That Mrs. Lamont will be around for her eggs . I put ' em in this basket . She shows basket on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts food on his tableThere ! Eat ! HARDY looks up at her.Was it twenty years since you had that red dress ? HELEN I made it before we was married . How 'd you come to remember it ? HARDY I do n't know  --  seems like you 'd always had it . HELEN Before it wore out that 's how it seemed to me . HARDY Somehow I sort of see you in it  --  I mean when you ai n't really around  --  and I 'm sort of seein ' you , in my mind like . You were a good-lookin ' girl , a mighty good-lookin ' girl . He looks up at her ; she is quite softenedYou ai n't changed much . She half turns away , confused by his complimentI mean you ai n't changed so much as I thought you had ! p. 95 HELEN angrily.Eat your supper ! HARDY Yes . He draws his place to him and starts to butter his breadIt 's past my time ; I hate my vittals late ! Twenty years  --  I remember the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARDY You was in the kitchen at your house , an ' I came to take yer to a dance down to the Port . HELEN It was New Year 's night . It had been snowin ' , and it was so lovely in the moonlight . You pulled me all the way on your sled , down to the Port ! She drops into the chair opposite him , and bends eagerly across the tableIt was a big party , the only big one I ever went to , before or since . It was the first time I 'd ever waltzed , I mean before folks , with a man . I remember how it scared me , it seemed so bold ! HARDY There 's dances now that 's worse than waltzing ! You 'll see ' em in New York . HELEN My goodness ! She rises hastilyI almost forgot New York . HARDY slowly.Helen ! I want you not to go ! HELEN Talkin ' about  --  about that old red dress of mine has made us sort of sentimental . I guess you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You did n't act right , Helen , but I 'll try and forget it . HELEN And you 'll let Kate take the money and go , like I always planned she should ! HARDY She 'll be all right here . HELEN She 's going , Steve ! That 's settled ! As for me , it 's for you to say . HARDY angrily . I say she ai n't goin ' ! HELEN coldly . Yes , she is , and so am I. You 'd better eat your supper . HARDY I wo n't ! He pushes his chair away and rises angrily I ca n't ! To hell with it ! He exits to the outside , slamming the door . HELEN looks after him for a moment tearfully ; then her pride asserts itself and she crosses grimly to the trunk . Taking her box of treasured letters and photographs , she goes to the stove , and lifting up one of the lids she dumps the whole mass into the fire . Then , thinking of his photograph , she crosses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the flames , and crosses out to hall . BEN GLENNY comes to outside door and knocks . There is no answer and he knocks again . KATE enters from hall and crosses to trunk with a bunch of keys in her hand . She hears the knock p. 97 KATE Come in ! The door opens and BEN entersOh ! It 's you , Mr. Glenny ! She puts things in trunk and clears away the dishes on the table , putting the bread away and throwing the egg out GLENNY I was lookin ' for Tom Lane . KATE coldly . He does n't live here ! GLENNY He 's here a lot , and I 've got to find him . KATE He 's probably at his garage . GLENNY No , he ai n't . KATE crosses to the easel and takes her painting and puts it on table . BEN sees it . What 's that ? KATE My painting . GLENNY looks at it . It 's nice . KATE Thank you . GLENNY It 's as good as some photographs . KATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatter me . I am going to take this to New York with me . Mother and I are going in about half an hour . GLENNY What are you going to take it to New York for ? p. 98 KATE To sell it ! He grinsDo n't you believe I can ? GLENNY Yes , I do ! Ai n't they the darndest fools ! He crosses to door . If Tom comes , tell him I 've got to see him . He exits to outdoors . KATE , who is covering her painting with paper , stops and looks about for something to fasten it with . She crosses to hall door , and raising her voice , calls to her mother KATE Mother ! Mother ! Where 's some string ? HELEN upstairs . Up here ! KATE I 'm coming ! She runs out . STEVE wanders in from outdoors and stops in front of the clock and scowls at it , then crosses to the cupboard and butters the end of the half loaf of bread , and cuts a slice . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock on the door . He pauses , with his mouth open , and looks angrily toward door as the knock is repeated . He puts his bread down with a patient sigh and crosses and opens door . DANA and DORA LAMONT are discovered , as they stand in the doorway DORA We want to speak to Mrs. Hardy . I am Mrs. Lamont . HARDY She left the eggs , they 're in this basket . He crosses and gets basket from tableShe said you 'd be over for ' em in the mornin ' ; it will be ninety cents . p. 99 DORA Ninety ? Why I have only been paying your wife eighty-five ! HARDY Eggs is up . DORA Give him ninety cents , please , Dana . She takes the basket from STEVE as DANA hunts in his pocket then draws out a roll of bills . DANA I 've nothing less than a dollar . He holds out a dollar billYou can collect next time or you may owe me ten cents . HARDY takes the dollar . Looks like it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORA No . She hunts in her bag and finds the changeGive him back the dollar ; here is the right change . HARDY Just as you say . He returns the dollar to DANA and takes the change ; counting it carefully , he drops it in his pocketMy wife 's upstairs if you want to see her , but she an ' my daughter are going to New York in just a few minutes . DORA They wanted Mr. Lamont to look at a painting . HARDY Oh ? He turns to DANAYou 're an artist ? DANA Yes . p. 100 HARDY I 'm glad you 're here . I got a reason for wantin ' you to look at Kate 's picture ! I guess this is it . He crosses to table and removes the wrapping-paper and turns the picture overYes  --  there it is . DANA Yes . He crosses and stands looking down at the painting DORA with him . The mother is so ambitious for her , Dana . I want you to like it , if you can ! There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE enters behind them , unnoticed , and stands in the door , looking on anxiously HARDY Well ? DANA gravely , to STEVE . You said you had a reason for wanting me to see this . What was your reason ? HARDY I guess no man knows less about art , and such as that , than me ; but it happens to be a bit of land around here she painted , and I know land . DANA Your opinion should be of as much value , then , as my own  --  what do you think of this yourself ? HARDY slowly . Somehow , it seems to me it do n't look like it ought  --  not just like  --  I do n't know  --  it 's Tom Lane 's twenty acres all right  --  but it do n't look just like it was alive , somehow , does it ? p. 101 DANA gravely . No . HARDY It 's grass , but it ai n't growing grass ; there 's the spring wheat , but you ca n't somehow think of its ever ripening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean she ca n't paint ? DANA I am afraid  --  KATE gives a moan of anguish , and DORA turns and sees her DORA sharply . Dana ! The two men look around , and see her ; there is a pause . KATE comes forward , trembling , looking from one to another . They all are distressed and uneasy HARDY I  --  I was speakin ' to this gentleman here about your picture . He was sayin ' it was pretty good , real good he seemed to think it was , for  --  for a girl that had n't had much teachin '  --  I  --  I got to see if my stock 's all frixed for the night . He crosses toward doorHe liked that picture real well ; he 'll tell you so himself , if you ask him . He exits . KATE comes slowly down and looks at her painting DORA My husband will tell you how very nice  --  p. 102 KATE Please ! She puts out her hand sharply , and DORA stops . KATE bends over pictureIt does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does n't seem to grow ! I wonder !  --  She looks at DANAWas he right ? I want to know the truth . Ca n't I paint ? DANA That might mean so many things . KATE No , there 's only one thing it can mean ! Have I a talent , a real talent , like my mother 's always told me ? DANA I am sorry , I am afraid you have n't . KATE If I worked hard  --  and I would  --  if I had good teachers , could n't they teach me to be an artist ? DANA That is something that ca n't be taught ; one is or is n't . KATE And I 'm  --  I 'm  --  not ? DANA I see nothing here but the conventional schoolgirl water color . Your color and drawing you could improve , but there is nothing here to justify the effort . KATE No talent ? Nothing ? DANA I am sorry ! KATE You have been honest  --  you are a man who knows . p. 103 DANA It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I do n't just seem to know what to do . DORA My poor child ! She comes forward with ready sympathy KATE No ! She draws away I had to know ! You see , it means so much to us , to mother and me , we 've planned so long ! I  --  She breaks down and turns and almost runs outdoors DORA to DANA . You brute ! You could have lied to her . DANA About anything else . DORA There 're other things in the world besides your paints and brushes ! DANA For girls like her . I 'll take the eggs . He takes the basketPoor kid ! DORA You are absolutely heartless ! DANA New York is full of them , breaking their hearts ,  --  painters , musicians , writers , men and women who want to create something and who ca n't . Wanting to do it does n't help much ; even trying does n't  --  when it is n't there ! We 'll get the butter in the morning .
