txt Why did RAMSAY MACDONALD at Geneva feel so strongly the need of " elaborating " the Covenant of the League of Nations ? By his own account it is already a comprehensive document . " The Covenant of the League of Nations , " said the British Prime Minister , " has ample provisions for varying arbi " tration , for any sanctions that are nec " essary , and for all other eventualities . " Since Mr. lifAcDoNALD had previously declared that he could see " nothing else for the world but arbitration , " he should seemingly have been content with a statute which had ample provisions on the subject . If he felt that there is still a good deal of useful work to be done on ? the Covenant , it was because , as his speech went on to show , he does not really believe that the Covenant is prepared for all eventualities : Alas , the Covenant was drafted immediately after the war and before statesmen were able to see exactly of what precise nature the problems were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two after the armistice . ? ? ? What ought to be done now is to explore this matter , beginning with the Covenant , applying the Covenant to present circumstances . and in the spirit of the League of Nations developing a policy that will give security and reduce armaments . It must be discouraging for a League advocate to be told that within two years after the armistice problems arose which the founders of the League had not foreseen . Such discouragement should vanish before the thought that the framers of the Covenant were not concerned with problems , but with a Problem : and that was to avert war . The League of Nations is concerned primarily with the prevention of war and only secondarily with a study of the causes that lead to war . And the reason is a humanly simple one . To set up machinery - for conciliation and arbitration is much more immediately practical than to delve into the vast complex of motives and conditions that make for war . Of theories why wars arise there are any number . The cause of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialism , in inflated armaments , in the system of alliances . It is entirely within the spirit and intention of the Covenant that efforts be made to study and mitigate the forces that work for conflict . But the first thought , and the first necessity , was to provide an instrument for averting war from whatever cause arising . Reduction of armaments is a contribution to the safeguarding , of peace . An agreement to cut down the European armies would be a response to that will to peace which a writer in another section of THE TIMES today , finds in the minds of the European peoples alongside apprehensions as to the next war . But it would be a pity if failure at Geneva to persuade France to disarm without a guarantee of security should be interpreted as a defeat for the League . The chief evil of armaments is not in the number of men and guns , but in the never-ending competition of men and guns , leading to a neurosis of mutual fears and exacerbations . If it should be shown that France with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is arguable that such a France is much less dangerous to the peace of the world than a disarmed and nervous France . The system of alliances helped to plunge Europe into war ; but after all alliances were not born - out of nothing . They were the reflex of basic conditions . Today there exists in Europe an alliance independent of treaties . It is composed of France and of ' the smaller allied na. - , tionalities . Their cause was cemented in the war and will remain a common . cause because for all concerned it is a Matter of life and death . Even of Great Britain , which Mr. MACDONALD refuses to commit to any Compact in advance , it may be said that her alliance with her allies , when the test comes , will be found real . The Covenant of the . League declared against alliances to the extent of : calling , for the registration of all international treaties . *In other , words , it did not neglect the subsidiary problems of peace . But the outstanding merit of the Covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of minute blueprints of why nations disagree . It concentrated on the basic principle that when nations do disagree they shall go to law instead of flying to arms ..
