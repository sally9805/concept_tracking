I WAS born , " said 0 . Henry , " in a somnolent little Southern town . . . " This statement is almost unique , because in it William Sydney Porter wasted no less than two words ? a record for him . He was born in 1867 , therefore " Southern " was the only adjective he needed ; for in 1867 Southern towns were all little and all somnolent . The town to which 0 . Henry referred is Greensboro , North Carolina , and it was still little and still somnolent when he left it , about the time its population was increased by the birth of the child who was to be his successor in the favor of the story-reading public ; for Wilbur Daniel Steele also first saw the light in the same village . But neither man wrote anything memorable in Greensboro . Steele was taken away by his parents when he was still a child ; and in 0 . Henry 's time Greensboro had no more use for a shortstory writer than a hog has for a hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug clerk he remained until he went , first to Texas , then to jail , and finally to New York , where he became famous . His most vivid memory of his birthplace , thirty years after he had left it , was of summer evenings spent on somebody 's front porch with a crowd of boys and girls . Someone always had a guitar , and the group sang old ballads behind a lattice heavy with honeysuckle . So it happened that the name of the town was always associated in0 . Henry 's mind with soft summer nights whose air was drenched with the scent of honeysuckle and disturbed by no noise harsher than young voices singing " Ben Bolt " or the " Spanish Cavalier " to the twanging of a guitar . The charm of this picture is due , of course , to the haze of memory ; for in the years between , say , 1870 and 1000 Greensboro was desperately poor as well as small and quiet . The struggle for a hare existence was so stern that its citizens had no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were gifted with the magic of an 0 . Henry . So he had to go away to obtain a hearing . To-day this same town still calls its principal business thoroughfare Elm Street , although there has been no elm there for a generation ; but that is almost the only feature of the place that fits 0 . Henry 's description . There are half a dozen skyscrapers on Elm Street . There are traffic bells that jangle , and trolley cars whose wheels screech on curves . There are policemen 's whistles , and thousands and thousands of automobile horns . There is , in short , the same devilish uproar that characterizes every lively American town . Somnolence is no more possible there than it is in the interior of a boiler factory . Universal poverty has disappeared along with tranquillity . There are now a platoon of millionaires and a battalion of bootleggers in the town 's sixty thousand population . The largest denim mill in the world and half a dozen giant insurance companies testify to the vigor and acumen of the business men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent schools for negroes , does credit to the intellectual activity of the place . This transformation has occurred since the turn of the century . It is merely a sample of what has taken place all over the South since the year BOO . It is the work of the new generation , whose youth was not poisoned by the aftermath of the Civil War . Within these latter years North Carolina cotton mills have acquired more spindles than those of Massachusetts . Southern tobacco has produced a group of millionaires with fortunes great enough to impress even Wall Street . Birmingham has become a gigantic steel manufacturing city . Norfolk threatens to dominate the shipbuilding industry . New Orleans claims the rank of the second greatest American port . Nor is the new activity below the Potomac wholly , or most impressively , industrial . Broadway has blossomed with the names of Southerners , picked out in electric lights DuBose Heyward , Laurence Stallings , Paul Green , others . Pulitzer prizes for writing folk stream South ? to Green , to Julia Peterkin , to Robert Lathan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stringfield . A South Carolinian takes the Prix de Rome in sculpture . With Hey-ward , Mrs. Peterkin , and James Boyd at work in the Carolinas , Ellen Glasgow no longer represents the farthest south of the fine novel . Poets , as distinguished from poetasters , pop up like crocuses in the spring ; Addison Hibbard compiles an anthology including thirty who have published each a volume of verse which is better than respectable . The Universities of Virginia and North Carolina publish in the Virginia Quarterly Review and Social Forces a literary quarterly and a learned journal which are viewed respectfully throughout the country . Small wonder , then , that the world has decided the South at last is waking up , and is inclined to give young Southerners enormous credit for having shakenoff the intellectual and moral drowsiness that afflicted their fathers . The South has its glamorous traditions , to be sure , but they come down only as far as 186.5 . George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , John Marshall , James Madison were giants , as everyone admits ; and the South in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Calhoun , and Henry Clay were no weaklings , either ; such men do not spring from a degenerate race . In moral stature and military genius Robert E. Lee overtops George Washington himself , although Lee had not the statesmanship that secures Washington his primacy . And Stonewall Jackson , the two Johnstons , Lougstreet , Beauregard , Stuart , Early , and Forrest were such soldiers as delight the heart of the romancer and flutter the maiden pride of any nation . Tardy justice now begins to admit that Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens also were men of genius . Who was the next Southerner to fire the imagination of the nation in a way comparable to the least of these ? Woodrow Wilson ? but you have leaped a generation to come to him . Furthermore , his notable work was done outside of the South . What happened to the Southern boys just a little older than Wilson , who remained in the South ? Were they really unworthy of the tradition of the South , incapable of greatness ? At New Market , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one occasion they threw into the line of battle the cadets from the Virginia Military Institute . They were largely striplings of sixteen or so , too small to handle a heavy army rifle except by straining , far too young to have anything to do with the business of organized butchery . As they marched into battle the band of a veteran regiment played " Rock-a-by Baby . " But they held their position and actually captured a Federal battery . When the fight was over they buried their dead , gathered up their wounded , and the heroic , pitiful survivors marched back to their schoolbooks . What became of the New Market cadets after the war ? Theirs is the lost generation of the South . Remarque has lately won the applause of the world with his eloquent threnody of the generation that Europe lost in the war of 1914-18 ; but no man has had a good word for the generation represented by the New Market cadets . It was during their maturity that the South lay as in a coma . Economically , intellectually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years away ; and now that the sons of that generation are bestirring themselves enough to make a noise in the world , men congratulate the South on the passing of the Rip Van Winkles ? Walter H. Page called them Mummies . Of this generation the consensus of mankind seems to be that nothing in its life was so becoming as the quitting of it . There is no arguing away a popular superstition , and it is much too late to attempt to retrieve the reputation of this generation if it were possible . The men and women who composed it are already in the graveyard , or so nearly there that another injustice , more or less , affects them but little . The world will doubtless go on believing that the new activity in the South , intellectual and industrial , was generated in a vacuum and that the young Southerners who are now commanding the admiration of the nation sprang from the head of Jove , or anywhere rather than from the loins of their putative forebears . Can the intellectually dead generate intelligence ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing come out of Nazareth ? But while this theory may be well enough for outsiders , to credit it would be shameful in a Southerner of the twentieth century . We can not forget the pit whence we were digged , nor the crushing toil that went into the digging . What went on in the South between1870 ' and 1900 was too completely tragic to furnish material for theatrical tragedy , far too high in spirit for written romance which crawls along the beaten paths of life , too stark for poetry . The New Market cadets went back to their schoolbooks for a little while after the battle ; but a few years later they were flung into the line again , and this time they were never relieved , for the battle never ended . They went home from school to find the old civilization wrecked ; and they spent the rest of their lives fighting hand to hand with intangible foes far more ruthless and far more dangerous than Federal infantrymen . It is all but impossible now to present an adequate picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern states is relatively easy to compute . Most of us are under the impression that the United States fought quite a war ten years ago ; but to survivors of the Confederacy it was a mere skirmish . The war ten years ago cost the country something like an eighth of its total wealth , and called into military service about one-sixth of the men of military age , that is , 4,000,000 out of 23,000,000 available . Suppose the war had taken all the money and all the men ? Suppose we had put into the field 25,000,000 men ? At that , we should have failed to equal the record of the Confederate State of North Carolina , which supplied 120,000 soldiers to the Confederacy when the State had only 105,000 voters , including all those too old and too infirm for military service . This part of the situation can be put into figures . We are also able to construct a statistical representation of the damage caused by a policy of reconstruction of which one is at a loss to say whether its stupidity or its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same State of North Carolina , already so completely bankrupt that Serbia , in 1919 , was by comparison in a flourishing condition , was loaded with an additional debt of $32,000,000 , nearly all of which was stolen outright by officials put in power , not by the votes of the people , but by the bayonets of the Federal army of occupation . Much the same sort of thing happened to all the other conquered States . All this , also , can be represented to a certain extent to the modern world . What can not be represented is not the outward difficulties under which this Southern generation labored , but its own inadequacy to the task which it had to perform . One can imagine the bombardment to which the cadets were subjected at New Market . One can find out the number of troops flung against them . One might calculate the intensity of the rifle-fire along their front . But there is still a factor in the equation not taken into account , and it is the most important factor of all . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . Everyone who has been a soldier knows how a grown man 's arms ache , how his shoulders turn to water , how his back bends and his head droops after he has handled a heavy army rifle in rapid fire for even a short while ; but who can imagine the fatigue of a small boy subjected to the same inhuman strain for hour after hour ? The sheer weariness of that child-regiment makes the heart ache , even after seventy years . But the generation which had to fight its way out of the chaos that followed the Civil War in the South was hardly better prepared for the task than were the cadets for theirs . The great crime of the Old South was its neglect to exercise a larger measure of intelligence in its economic organization . The fact that it was involuntary , that it involved no malevolence , has no relation to the magnitude of the offense . The really great crimes are nearly always committed by stupid people rather than by bad people . When the old order was overthrown by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equipment or the training to establish a new order in conformity with the altered environment . The lack of equipment was a handicap , but the lack of training was a well-nigh fatal handicap . France , after 1870 , and Germany , after 1918 , proved that lack of equipment can not long keep a nation submerged if it has been bred to commerce and industrialism . But the economic system of the Old South was already falling into ruin before the war struck it ; the war itself might be described as the last desperate expedient of a people exasperated beyond endurance by its own inability to devise any better economic order than a one-crop system and slave labor . But it was a suicidal expedient , for no such moribund system could possibly stand the strain of war . As a matter of historic fact , it collapsed so completely that not even the amazing military genius exhibited by Southern commanders could stave off ruin . The world is still unable to comprehend , not their defeat , but how they managed to last so long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the war . It was the deadest system ever killed by a disastrous campaign . So the New Market cadets and all their generation were faced with a worse than Israelites ' task . Not only were they required to make bricks without straw , but also without any adequate knowledge of how bricks are made even with straw . The old system was demolished , and , far from being trained in another , they were hardly aware of the existence of any other . Yet they were required to build a new civilization . And in forty years they had built it . It is no Periclean Athens , or Augustan Rome , but it serves to produce scholars and artists . It begins to bring forth romancers , scientists , poets , playwrights , philosophers . It begins to excite the admiration of its contemporaries , who say that at last the South is undergoing an intellectual and moral regeneration . But those of us whose memories are long enough to reach back twenty years have a different point of view . These members of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw their vigor , their stamina , their intellectual power out of the air . They got it from the hard-bitten old boys who sired them ; and for my part , I cherish serious doubts that , with all their admitted brilliance , they are quite the men their fathers were . That is to say , if they were suddenly stripped , not merely of all they possess , but of all their traditions , all their habits of thought , all their manner of living , and compelled to build anew and in a different order of societai architecture , I doubt that they would build in forty years as high a civilization as the Southern States enjoyed in 1900 . As I write I recall the achievement of a certain Southerner who shall be nameless here for reasons which will presently appear . He was a sehoolman . He was shockingly ill-educated , judged by modern standards and , to adopt the phrase of John Kendrick Bangs , if his mind had been a slot you could n't have inserted a nickel in it . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addicted to pineapple , or any other sort of rum , but otherwise he was a replica of the Reverend Anthony Humm encountered by the elder Mr. Weller at the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association . And his school was like him . In the light of 1929 it seems to have been everything connoted by the Southern word " tacky . " It was a starveling institution in which famished professors half-educated gawky country girls . It was enormously long on piety , and short on good manners and good sense . Nevertheless , this squat , dull , semiilliterate almost single-handed pounded into the head of a bankrupt , starving , and distracted State the notion that it must educate its women at any cost . To this accomplishment he gave his whole life . For it he planned , he spoke , he intrigued , he toiled like a convict in a chain gang . To secure his scanty appropriations from the Legislature he had to resort to every known political device , from eloquence to blackmail . Again and again when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor of the House . He was laughed at , reviled , slandered , and kicked , but he stuck to it , and before he died , in his early fifties , he had committed the commonwealth to the principle of unlimited educational opportunity for every girl . With a little Iess intensity , with a little more easeful living , he might have lasted another twenty or thirty years ; but it is my profound conviction that he would have regarded the shortening of his own life by twenty years a small price to pay for the success of his idea . But in this is no pettiness . Here is no smallness of soul , no cheapness , " nothing but good and fair . " What , then , is the true measure of this man ? the oddities , provincialisms , asiuinities so conspicuous in the eyes of outsiders ? They are attributable , largely if not entirely , to the accidents of his environment . What education he had he scrambled for in the chaotic days immediately following the Civil War ; no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of the world was that of a man desperately put to it to find enough to eat ; no wonder it was narrow and acidulous . But the keen vision with which he pierced the future and saw the future need , and the intense , terrific devotion which made him pour his whole life into one purpose ? these were no accidents . Perhaps he was a fool . Perhaps any martyr is a fool . In any case , he was worth more to his State than five gross of assorted cotton mill barons , plus three dozen Grade A poets , novelists , and dramatists , and a million run-of-the-mine statesmen . His State to-day spawns shoals of pedagogues who are better educated , handsomer , and far more gentlemanly fellows ; but if it can find among them just one who is half as much of a man as was this pot-bellied little ignoramus , then well indeed may it thank God and take courage . I have seen a farmer come in , dripping with sweat , from the fodder-field . He wore half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes without socks , and the ruin of a hat . He plunged his head into a basin of water , splashed vigorously for a moment , and then , looking at me quizzically over the towel as he dried his hands , recited in tones too mellifluous for sincerity , " 0 fortunatos nimium , sua si bona norint , agricolas ! " In 1859 they taught the classics thoroughly at the University of North Carolina , and as a freshman there he had learned his Georgics by heart : but before he could obtain a degree the curse fell upon the land , and he rode away from the campus to follow J. E. B. Stuart , instead of Virgil . " My heart was with the Oxford men who went abroad to die " reflects pretty faithfully the attitude of all England ; but who ever gave a damn for the Carolina men who did the same thing ? The Oxford men won , and the Carolina men lost , which makes all the difference . This man , for instance , when the fighting was over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women and children of his own blood starving . He fed them by the labor of his hands ; and in the sweat of his face did he and they eat bread for the rest of his life . God rest you , happy gentlemen , Who aid your good lives down ; Who took the khaki and the gun Instead of cap and gown God bring you to a fairer place Than even Oxford town ! It brings tears to the eyes of Englishmen , but all it gives North Carolinians is a horse-Iaugh . " A fairer place than even Oxford town " ? to wit , a fodderfield , where back-breaking labor is performed in a temperature of 115 degrees . " 0 too happy husbandmen , if only they knew their good fortune " ? do youwonder at the sarcasm in his voice ? The marvel is not that he was sarcastic , but that he was gaily sarcastic . The man was designed by nature to wear the academician 's robe . He was meant to he a citizen of the gentle and fair republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fortune of war made him a field-hand , and he could smile ironically over the ruin of his own aspirations . And to do this , surely , one must be a manful man . I knew a doctor of brilliant attainments who died in the gutter , died like a dog . Liquor , said the neighbors , dolefully shaking their heads . But nobody ever thought to seek for any reason other than original sin for his drinking too much . He had come out of the Confederate army still a stripling , and how he contrived to get his medical education God only knows . But for forty years he carried on a practice so immense and so widely scattered that it would drive three modern medicos into nervous prostration in six months . The horses the man drove to death would have remounted a regiment of cavalry ; and in the vast , poverty-smitten region over which he ranged , not one patient in five could ever pay him a cent . He could hardly buy a decent coat , not to mention expensive surgical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night through for half a lifetime . Through sleet and snow on many a bitter night alcohol carried him through when he must otherwise have failed some suffering pauper in the remote wilderness . Alcohol got him at last . It was foolish of him to rely on it , of course . He should have guarded his own health and let the poor devils die in the backwoods . Then he might have had time to study , and to become famous in his own profession . Yet I aria inconsistent enough to believe that the old doctor , drunk , was a more valuable citizen than is the soberest prohibition enforcement agent ever heard of . I knew an editor whose paper , judged by every standard of modern journalism , was a lousy one , but who was , nevertheless , a great journalist ? greater , I almost suspect , than the Lathams , the Harrises , the Jaffe 's , and the Halls , although these have won Pulitzer prizes , and the old fellow was hardly heard of across his own State line . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , as well as the mechanical equipment , which fortifies modern Southern newspapers . But in the hate eighties and early nineties , when the South touched its nadir , when passion was most venomous and obscurantism loudest , this man was truthful and fair . Financially , socially , and politically , it was a disastrous policy ; for truth and fairness in journalism , so far from being in demand , were regarded as damnable heresy ; political office , prestige , and such money as was available were all reserved for the kept press . Yet , against every conceivable outside obstacle , and against the more formidable inner handicaps of poor education and narrow experience , he maintained his standard of decency and intelligence so well that his spirit slowly infected the press of his State and hauled it up from barbarism . He made no stir in the outside world , but he was decent when it was harder to be decent than it is now to be great . Yet he was of the generation which we are accustomed to regard as intellectually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatens conversion of the South into a region of brassy , loud , and curiously brutal go-getters , had , in its early days , its magnificent men . In the beginning many a man toiled at the business with no real liking for it , and not much hope of financial profit , because the creation of industry promised to drag his native land from the morass . These , indeed , had their reward , since climate , proximity to the raw material , and an almost limitless supply of pauper labor combined to make cotton manufacturing vastly profitable . None the less , the first venturers into this field were farseeing , bold and vigorous ? certainly no slothful generation . Any Southerner thirty-five years of age or over can remember , if he will turn his mind to the past , such feats of valor , endurance , and resourcefulness as amaze him in retrospect . Money , of course , is a highly deceptive standard of value ; probably most Americans would find it difficult to live on the sums which represented their fathers ' total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation and its predecessor is greater than elsewhere . A dollar was bigger thirty years ago than it is now ; but even then a man who supported and educated half a dozen children on a salary of seventy-five dollars a month was a financial wizard who need not stand abashed in the presence of Henry Ford or Andrew Mellon . Yet the South was full of them . Nevertheless , the impression persists that this was a lethargic , drowsy , dull generation . The truth is , of course , that only those who were vibrantly alive , incredibly keen , superlatively wide-awake survived . The others went to Texas . In the South from the seventies to the end of the century one dared not go to sleep , on penalty of his life . Perhaps he might not actually be carried to the graveyard , but he found himself promptly a charge on the charity of his neighbors , and his children definitely went under ? the boys usually departing for the West , and the girls winding up in the cotton-mill . Art did not flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish on the frontier ? The South after the Civil War was to all intents and purposes a frontier , except for the fact that its fields had been cleared . But this was an advantage more than compensated by the fact that if the fields had been cleared , they had also been sterilized by a ruinous cropping system . For the rest , the old order had been completely wrecked , and the inhabitants were compelled to build anew . Since their training , such as it was , had all been designed for the old order , they were compelled to proceed by the show and expensive method of trial and error . They were surrounded by an economic and moral wilderness , much more difficult to subdue than the physical wilderness their forebears had entered . In such circumstances , mere living is a triumph , and art would be a miracle . The Muses , indeed , are and have always been kept women . Artists may be poor , but art is for the rich , and it flourishes only in rich countries . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as rich and , therefore , devoid of art ; but art can not survive except where the country is rich enough to maintain a certain number of dreamers . In the years immediately following the Civil War to dream , in the South , was death . Every able-bodied man was desperately needed for the task of rebuilding material civilization , and he who abandoned that task , even if he survived physically , suffered the moral death of betraying his people . The least he could do was to take himself away , to do his dreaming in some region where the surplus was sufficient to enable some men to refrain from materially productive labor without inflicting appreciable injury upon society . Perhaps the most tragic figures in the South are the men who might have been artists had not their obvious duty compelled them to throttle their dreams and turn their hands to material labor . Every Southerner knows them ? wistful figures , a little apart from their fellows , even in old age , dimly aware that they have somehow lost , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his latest novel DuBose Heyward sketched one of them lightly ; it is a pity he did not do a full-length study , for they are worthy of justification . But the necessity for that sort of sacrifice is passing , if it has not altogether passed . Heyward himself , with nothing to offer the world but poems and plays and stories , not only survives in Charleston but is acclaimed as a great man there . Julia Peterkin was born late enough to be able , after tong years devoted to the affairs of her house , to lay aside the broom and pick up the pen ; and the Man in the South immediately after the Civil War . But it was no preposterous group of . addlepates striving to give themselves dignity by mysterious trappings . It was an organization of desperate men committed to desperate deeds . When the old Ku Klux Klan donned its robes and sallied out , it was not for child 's play . Before it returned it was more than likely that somebody had died ? far more often than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harried by private detectives , Secret Service agents , organized bands of negroes , and the United States Army , the member of the old Man rode with death on his crupper . How does that compare with the Klan which the modern generation has produced ? Far worse than the Klan , the older generation evolved tolerance of Judge Lynch . For this there are many reasons , but no adequate excuse , so let the reasons go . The modern generation has to its credit the reduction of lynchings from 255 in 1892 to 16 in 1927 . But if we are to believe Walter White , who has made a meticulous investigation of the subject , as the lynchings have decreased in number , they have increased in bestiality . The older generation hanged or shot its victims ; it remained for the younger to invent and apply tortures that might appall a Chinese executioner . In the olden time there was no suspicion that there existed in the South a race of connoisseurs of lynchings ? men who would race across country a hundred miles to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid in dispatching the victim with the utmost possible cruelty . The older generation , as most frontiersmen have done , developed a religious faith as hard , as gnarled and knotty , as were their own lives . Puritanism flourished then in its sternest and stiffest form . But Puritanism in Jonathan Edwards ' day had dignity , at least . The Puritanism of the South 's lost generation had dignity , and more . It was a bleak faith , if you please , but it was a powerful faith , with which nobody trifled . Its priests were frequently austere men , and not seldom terrible men , but they believed themselves to be servants of the Most High God . Nobody suspected them of selling their religion to cotton mill owners as a convenient narcotic with which to keep the wageslaves quiescent . Nobody found them denouncing the carnalities of the poor white trash and discreetly glozing over the faults of the rich and influential . They did not convert their pulpits into sounding-boards of partisan politics . Their bishops did not invade Wall Street . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liking , but they served Mammon in no way whatsoever . The South remains perhaps the most religious section of the country , but it finds it more and more necessary to rely on the strong arm of the police to sustain the faith . Comment is unnecessary . The South may be waking up , as the optimists assert ; but it might be plausibly argued that the reverse is the truth ? that it is just now beginning to drowse , because only now has it dared sleep . At any rate , as it develops the graces of a rich civilization , it begins to develop the vices also ; and it should take heed to these things before it congratulates itself on having produced a finer generation than those who , as children , fought at New Market , and , as men , cleared the way to greatness for their sons .
