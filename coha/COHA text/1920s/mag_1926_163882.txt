Cancer causes one-tenth of all deaths among grown-ups in the U. S. Yearly from 100,000 to 125,000 people die here from this dis ease . It presents itself in four main ways : 1 ) epithelial , in which there is no rodlike framework ; 2 ) scirrhous or hard , in which the framework predominates and the tumor is hard and of slow growth ; 3 ) encephaloid or soft , in which the cellular element predominates and the tumor is soft , grows rapidly and often ulcerates ; and 4 ) colloid , in which the cancerous structure becomes gelatinous . The last three are also called carcinoma . There are no positive ways of curing cancer after it has leached advanced stages . Its progress may be arrested , in some cases , by cer tain treatments . Discovered early and carefully treated by competent physicians or surgeons , it may be cured in most cases . <P> The source of cancer has not been determined finally , whether cellular , blastodermic or what . Certainly a cell , strange to its surroundings , proliferates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair . <P> Prof. Wood 's Report . Last week the American Society for the Control of Cancer met in Manhattan ; heard its Managing Director , Dr. George A. Soper , report on European activities against cancer ; heard too Professor Francis Carter Wood , director of Columbia University 's Institute of Cancer Research , report on most recent remedial research . <P> In England , at Liverpool , Dr. William Blair Bell , Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the University of Liverpool , has been treating cancer patients by injecting into their veins a certain amount of metallic lead in a very fine state of suspension , a so-called colloidal lead . He has treated 250 patients . Of these 50 , or one out of five , showed improvement . The solution is very unstable ; keeps only 48 hours ; can not be transported . Patients must be hospitalized and kept under exceptionally expert supervision . Dr. Wood reported : <P> " Only long and painstaking study of the disease as influenced by this remedy will result in improving the results so far obtained . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone five years without a return of the disease , others from two to three ; but most of the patients are too recent to enable a definite opinion . . . . Unfortunately it is quite impossible at present to determine the type of cancer which will be favorably influenced , so that no guarantee of improvement can be offered to any individual case . Some people bear the lead injections without serious disturbance , while others show evidence of poisoning so promptly that the treatment has to be abandoned . . . . " The gist of the matter is , then , that we have a treatment which brings at least temporary relief to one person in five who takes it , but that the remedy is extremely dangerous ; that the drug is difficult to prepare , impossible to keep , and therefore for the present must be handled only by those who are familiar with its use . This means that all patients who desire to avail themselves of this treatment must go to Liverpool and place themselves under the care of the group of physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient can stand a sufficient dose to affect the tumor.
