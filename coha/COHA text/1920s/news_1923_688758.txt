txt All lawyers and many other people must have read with surprise , and something of a'shock , what Judge K/I , LITS said in the Federal Court in Cleveland , this week , in imposing a maximum sentence on a bootlegger convicted of conspiracy to violate the Volstead act . Neither the surprise not the shock needs imply sympathy for the prisoner . Indeed , both are quite compatible with a feeling that he well deserved the punishment he . received , with a savage denunciation as a. social enemy added for full measure . But two reported statements by Judge lin.i.rrs have a strange sound , coming from the bench . The first one was , " I knew you were guilty when you were afraid to take the witness stand in your own defense , to refute the charges made against ? Of course , , the man was under no obligation to give testimony or to submit to cross-examination , and , however it may have been as to the Judge , the jurors had no right to draw from such refusal or failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary affairs of life people not infrequently are expected to prove innocence when under charges or suspicion , but that is not the case in court , and it is not so many years ago that prisoners were forbidden to take the stand even at their own desire , the theory then ' being that their testimony was made worthless by selfInterest . It seems not impossible that a Judge whose mind had been made up before hearing evidence would make rulings in the course of the trial on which . appeal for a new one could be based with some hope of success . A second thing in What " Guilty " Judge KILLITS 'S reMeans marks to the Lawyers . con-to victed bootlegger that will excite comment among the lawyers was his declaration that he " had no respect for an attorney who will come into this court and plead his client ' not guilty when he knows that client is guilty . " But the plea of not guilty on arraignment is made as a matter of course in the great majority of criminal- cases . quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what his client has done , and the lawyers defend this  --  when they deign to admit that defense is necessary , which is not often ? by saying that " guilt e ' in the eyes of the law , and therefore in theirs , means conviction by due process , and that a man not yet so convicted is entitled to the presumption of innocence from the 1 Judge and jury as well as from his counsel . " Guilty " is one thing , and " guilty as indicted " is quite another , and it is only to the second kind of I guilt that for the lawyer mind the word ils applicable . A man may be indicted for murder in the first degree , and the evidence presented at the trial may reveal to the jurors that the crime committed was of a lower degree , or a different crime , such as manslaughter or mere assault , or that the homicide was justifiable . As a matter of fact , when murder is charged a plea of guilty is not permitted in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney do to gain his respect if the circumstances were such as to leave no doubt in the attorney 's mind that his client really was guilty as charged ? The attorney himself would be in no uncertainty  --  he would make the regular plea of not guilty and then see to it that his client had the benefit of every advantage and privilege accorded by the law to accused persons . It is only laymen who can see anyI thing wrong in that , and the laymen are mistaken . Acting presumably No Exceptions at the Mayor 's reNeed quest , the Mayor 's Be Admitted . secretary has sent to the head of the Fire Department a letter which very well expressed  --  so far as it went  --  what long has been the public 's feeling with regard to the solicitation of funds by - employds of the city . This begging was described in the letter as " a form of molestation for which there is little or no warrant . " and , it was stated that " department heads should issue instructions to the employes under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the collection of funds will not be countenanced . " The letter well might have stopped there instead of going on to admit the existence of exceptional cases in which the " molestation " . could be permitted . Worthy causes sometimes have profited Much that was said in the Weather Bureau 's comment on " rain making " was true  --  perhaps all of it . Like many another official statement of the same kind , however , this one presented the case it decided in a way rather illustrative of the departmental mind than as a conclusion to be accepted with respect to the particular matter under consideration . As a matter of fact , the BancroftWarren scheme for showering clouds with electrified sand was presented by its originators , primarily and chiefly , as one by which fogs could be dispersed over limited areas . Its possibilities in ' the way of causing rainfall Were not emphasized  --  they were mentioned incidentally , as it were , and , whatever the originators may think , they are making no large promises and no large claims of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not by assumptions or preconceived'notions , but in operation . As Professor BANcaorr said when told what the Government 's meteorologists thought of electrified sand , " No use arguing with the Weather Bureau . Prefer to wait for results and let them do the exptaining . " His sin is in telling specialists and professionals something new in their own dcmain .

Few Judges Talk in This Way . from these solicitations , but no. worthy cause ever was in real need of them . And why adaress the first prohibition to the firemen ? The police , much oftener than the firemen , have been used , or allowed to use themselves , in this way , and a request for money from a policeman has behind it , for ' most ' People , more of coercion than does one from a fireman . It is Poor business for either of them , or for any other city servitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretarial letter , but by a city ordinance.
