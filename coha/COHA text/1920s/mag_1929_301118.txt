The Lords : <P> Were warned by Hero-Admiral Earl Beatty , Commander of the British Grand Fleet ( 1916-19 ) , First Sea Lord ( 1919-27 ) , " our situation with regard to cruisers is indeed serious . " <P> He recalled that 9,500,000 tons of British shipping have to be protected every day " on lines of communications extending over 80,000 miles . " For years the Admiralty considered 70 cruisers the minimum requirement ( less than one to every thousand miles ) , but this number has now been reduced to 50 . <P> " Is it surprising , " asked Earl Beatty in seadog peroration , " that there is apprehension among those who have given thought to this vital question , and that there should be dismay among those who can not understand how parity in cruisers can be arrived at unless it is to be a parity having regard to the commitments and obligations of each nation ? . . . There is no nation , whose naval commitments and obligations are so great and so complicated as the British Empire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an honest , candid man , is the train of thought by which 99 Britons out of 100 have arrived at the belief that it is right for them to have a larger navy than the U. S. , which has so many less merchant ships and colonies to protect than they . <P> The Commons : <P> Bristled to attention as the shooting of 18 women by British police and troops in Nigeria , West Africa , was announced by Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies Dr. T. Drummond Shiels . The women , said Dr. Shiels , were Negresses . They had attacked some British officers . Troops rushing to the rescue of their superiors received the order " Hold your fire , men ! " and did so until the Negresses approached , slapped their faces , laid hands upon their rifles with intent to snatch them , whereupon British chivalry cracked and the shooting down of women began . <P> The Nigerian blacks have been in an ugly , riotous mood of late , due to the Government 's unpopular attempts to collect a head tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local British river steamer was chased by tax-indignant blacks in war canoes . " With regard to the women , " concluded Dr. Shiels , " His Majesty 's Government is informed that they were encouraged in their provocation by a man who told them that British troops would never fire on persons of their sex . " <P> Conservative heckler : " Does the Labor Party still believe that His Majesty 's Government should control lands ? " <P> Minister of Agriculture Noel Buxton : Yes . <P> Lady Astor : Whose lands ? <P> Member of the Extreme Left " Clydeside " Labor Faction , with a raucous whoop : Yours ! Yours , my Lady ! YOURS ! ! <P> The House passed 273 to 199 the labor government 's so-called Unemployment Insurance Bill ( TIME , Nov. 25 , et seq. ) amid bitter plaints from Clydesiders ( see above ) who demanded that even bigger doles be handed out to the unemployed . <P> " Scandalous ! " stormed peppery Scotch Conservative Major Walter Elliot Elliot , " Why , the dole is already more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If wages fall below the dole , " roared Clydeside Leader Jim Maxton , " we shall know how to raise wages ! " <P> " Poppycock ! " snorted Major Elliot .
