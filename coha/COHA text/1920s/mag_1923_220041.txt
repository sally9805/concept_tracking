The case for endowed universities has been considerably strengthened by the Legislature of Wisconsin , That body , controlled by friends of Senator La Follette , has passed a resolution denouncing the members of the faculty of the University of Wisconsin , who signed a document criticizing the attitude of the Senator toward the war . The University and its faculty are rather more dependent on the generosity of the State Legislature than any endowed institution upon the generosity of its private benefactors . And no private benefactor has ever publicly prohibited the expression of political views hostile to his own . Furthermore , private benefactors , wicked though they may be , are consistent in wickedness . Not so State Legislatures . The next House in Wisconsin will have full power to repeal the opinions of the entire University .
