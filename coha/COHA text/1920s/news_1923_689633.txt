txt Russian Refugees Coming . To the Editor of The New York Times : Accounts of the work of the Russian Refugee Relief Society , which have reached us , have been passed on to the Disaster Relief Committee , which was handling the evacuation of Russian refugees to , Arnerlea . It was extremely gratifying to me and to our committee to receive this information and to know that the refugees we have been sending to America as immigrants had been creditably selected and were being entered into America without any difficulty . It was the Russian Refugee Relief Society that made it possible for us to carry through this most excellent relief for these Russian refugees stranded here in Constantinople . It was certainly a most worthy piece of relief work and charity . The last convoy that we have prd'vl ? led for leaves this month . We started out to evacuate 1,000 Russians and we have evacuated I.500 . As we could get no more visas , about 100 of this number were sent-to Canada . MARK L. 13RI8I:OL .
