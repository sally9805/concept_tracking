txt Grover A. Whalen 's first month as Commissioner of Police ended yesterday with Mr. Whalen asserting that " the greatest progress has been made in our war against gangs and gangsters , " and predicting success for the system of traffic relief he has evolved for the theatre zone . The Commissioner 's optimism regarding the traffic plan , which begins a fortnight 's trial period Monday night , was met with skepticism by the traffic experts of the Broadway Association , who , while pledging their " undivided support , " pointed out four possible flaws and suggested several modifications . The first public analysis of the Whalen traffic plan was made at a luncheon meeting of the traffic committee of the Broadway Association at the Hotel Astor , and such criticism of the proposed new system of traffic control as arose was due , Mr. Whalen said later , to imperfect understanding of how the plan will work . Four Traffic Rule Objections . The four major objections were raised by E. S. Friendly , business manager of The New York Sun , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were : 1 . That guests of the twenty hotels in the area affected would experience difficulty in obtaining taxicabs to take them to railroad terminals for some thirty important trains leaving between 7 and 9:30 P. M. , the hours when the commissioner has said cruising taxicabs will be barred . 2 . That guests arriving from out of town would have difficulty in obtaining their baggage until late at night because of the ban upon commercial traffic in the restricted area during the theatre rush . 3 . That the no-turn rule would eliminate traffic from whole blocks of Broadway . 4 . That taxicabs dropping pasengers at Broadway and any of its intersecting streets within the zone would have to continue on in the direction in which they were headed , adding to the normal congestion and taking them out of their way . Mr. Whalen Makes Replies . Mr. Whalen replied to the first objection by saying that there would be enough taxicabs discharging passengers within the zone to accommodate any persons who wished to get out of it to catch trains or for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said most travelers carry hand baggage which would be sufficient to answer their needs for an hour or so , when the baggage wagons could get through . He pointed out that commercial traffic will be allowed between 9:30 and 10:30 P. M. and after 11:30 . As for the third criticism , he said the only spot where traffic would be totally eliminated would be the block from Forty-second to Forty-third Street on the east side of Seventh Avenue . It was true that taxicabs would have to go up or down Broadway , Seventh , Eighth and Sixth Avenues to Forty-second or Fiftieth Streets without turning , but he said he failed to see where that would be an innovation , " for that 's just what they do now . " In the matter of the no-turning rule , the Commissioner found it necessary to make two modifications . Two turns will be allowed , one at Seventh Avenue and Fortyseventh Street and one at Sixth Avenue and Forty-first Street , since the latter thoroughfare is cut off by the Public Library . Cars moving up Seventh Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street to get over to Broadway , but then must make a right turn and go uptown . They may not continue across Forty-seventh Street . Criticism was not the dominant note of the traffic committee meeting . On the contrary , J. E. Harring- ton , chairman of the committee . who presided , repeatedly reminded the members that Mr. Whalen 's plan was " the first definite action toward relief in many years , " and each speaker prefaced his remarks with a pledge of cooperation . The elimiI nation of street obstructions and parking were hailed as the most important features of the program . In the end a resolution was adopted pledging support of Mr. Whalen 's general idea and calling to his atItention the four " possible mistakes . " Another resolution was adopted later reiterating the committee 's confi-dence in the report on traffic subI mitted by Dr. John A. Harriss , chairman of a subcommittee of the Mayor 's Committee on Plan and Sur ; vey . Instructs Aides in New Plan . Meanwhile at headquarters Mr. Whalen was discussing the details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . direct the flow of vehicles and pedestrians on Monday night .

" I 've been so busy it seems more like a year , " he said . " ln that time we have reorganized the department ? put it in fighting trim  --  and several important reforms have been made .

Commissioner Whalen denied a report that warning notices were being sent to owners of buildings in which speakeasies have been found advising them that unless they eject objectionable tenants action will be taken against them under the Nuisance Law , although he said that would be " the next step . " The commissioner 's assurance that the gangsters were on the run was not shared by Magistrate David Hirshfield , who in a letter to John F. H : , , rla.n , whom he addressed as " My Dear Mayor , " declared that " from information I receive crime is just as rampant in New York as it was before Whalen became Police Commissioner . " Several speakeasies were raided by detectives of the staffs of the district inspectors last night . Among the places visited were 201 West Sixtyninth Street , 386 Columbus Avenue , 65 West Seventy-third Street , 401 West Fiftieth Street , 150 West Fortyninth Street , 359 West Forty-third Street , 350 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue , 2.056 Seevnth Avenue , 300 West 155th Street . ** Fifth Avenue , 4,320 Broadway . 218 East Twenty-seventb Street and 249 Avenue A.
