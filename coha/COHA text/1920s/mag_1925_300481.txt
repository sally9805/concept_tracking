Herewith are excerpts from letters come to the desks of the editors during the past week . They are selected primarily for the information they contain either supplementary to or corrective of news previously published in TIME . <P> 100,000 <P> Sirs : <P> Your publicity men have spread abroad the knowledge that TIME is " the fastest growing non-fiction magazine in the U.S. " What is the present circulation of TIME ? In a friendly argument I wagered $10 that it was over 100,000 . Kindly advise me whether I win or lose . <P> GEORGE GOULD Pittsburgh , Pa . <P> Original Subscriber Gould wins $10 . The circulation of TIME crossed the 100,000 mark three weeks ago . The Circulation Manager states that the circulation of TIME has increased nearly 50% during 1925 , thus retaining the titles of " fastest growing non-fiction magazine " and " the fastest growing $5 magazine of any sort in the U.S. " - ED . <P> In Persia <P> Sirs : <P> Your correspondent in Persia I believe is not very much interested to let your people and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great progress which our nation is making under the leadership of Reza Khan Pahlavi . I have made up my mind to write a few strokes about affairs in Persia and beg you , meanwhile not to refuse to have the gist of my statements printed in your paper . <P> Our king , Sultan Ahmad Shah , who left Persia for a joy trip to France two years ago , sent a telegram some days ago to the Persian Minister informing him the date of his departure for Persia . This wire , being printed in local papers , roused the anger of all Persians , especially inhabitants of Azerbaijan . Consequently from all parts of Persia telegrams were sent to Majlis ( parliament ) asking that our delegates to gather and take a final decision whether the Shah should return or not . Delegates paid no attention to their demands and eventually the situation began to grow worse and worse every day . In Teheran people took refuge in the telegraph office and some in the Military School . Parliament who paid no attention at the beginning was obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people 's demand . Therefore at the session of 9th Aban , Oct. 31 , it was proposed and sanctioned by 80 votes against 5 to depose Sultan Ahmad Shah from the throne of Persia and cancel forever the dynasty of Kajars . Meanwhile Reza Khan Pahlavi , the Prime Minister and Commander in Chief of all Persia 's force , will act as a regent till a senate be formed and decide the form of government , i. e. , whether a Republic or as before . I shall let you hear more details of affairs in future . <P> AMEER-SHAH Teheran , Persia <P> " Flagrant " <P> Sirs : <P> TIME 'S inaccuracies are chronic , flagrant and even self evident ! On p. 34 of your issue of Dec. 14 , you say that a rat , with a " pointed grey face " fell into a Miss Rachael Galpern 's " hot soap-bath " ; yet a moment later you speak of the animal as " an enormous black rat ! " Squirm out of that , if you can ! I suppose you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " grey face . " <P> Also , on p. 16 of the same issue you head an article about Henri de Jouvenel , Henry est Arrive . Could any mixture of French and English schoolboy jargon be more ridiculous ?
