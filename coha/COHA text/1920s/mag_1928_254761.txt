Gamblers , western bartenders , lottery sharpers of the Mississippi Valley , touts , awoke New Year 's Day to a surprise ; pondered the resolution of Publisher Fred G. Bonfils : Through his Denver Post he announced the establishment of the Frederick G. Bonfils Foundation for the " Betterment of Mankind . " Said he : <P> " I want the Foundation to be so administered that it will result in better homes , better schools , better and more intelligent people , healthier and happier conditions of life , greater morality and more widespread regard for the love of God and the Gospel of Christ . " <P> A sample promise : A quarter of a million will be set aside to reward the discoverer of a cure for cancer . <P> To the Foundation Publisher Bonfils reported the donation of his entire fortune . <P> Religious people read the resolution with the same surpise . Scanning the fervent promises they recalled the life and works of Publisher Bonfils who once boasted blood relationship to Napoleon . Some recalled that : <P> He had gone west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sharp eyed , olive skinned , he played the Mississippi steamboats for a dangerous living . <P> The business partner with whom he made the Denver Post a potent factor in Western life was H. H. Tammen , garrulous bartender . <P> The Post gained its powerful position through scorching , sensational journalism . Its pages were daubed with scarlet grease of fleshpots . <P> Shamelessly inscribed on the Post building was the legend : " O Justice ! When Expelled From All Other Habitations Make This Thy Dwelling Place . " <P> Bonfils purchased the Post on capital amassed from operation of the Little Louisiana Lottery , which netted him $800,000 . Descendants of these dollars now rear the Foundation for the " Betterment of Mankind . "
