Ben Bess is a Negro ; He used to be better off than most South Carolina Negroes . He owned a good farm in Florence County . Some Negroes considered him lucky because he rented part of his land to some white trash named Collins and had his way with the Collins woman . She was about 45 years old and pretty trashy . But , she was white . <P> Other Negroes considered Ben Bess a black fool . He ought to have some sensibility about the folks he took up with , they said . Besides , fooling with white women never got a Negro anywhere but into trouble , no Sir ! <P> After he had had the Collins woman some time , Ben Bess went to jail for 30 years hard labor . That was in 1915 . That trash , Frank Collins , had n't minded at all about Ben Bess and the woman , until Ben Bess decided not to rent his land any more . Then Frank Collins brought the charge that has lynched many a nigger . The Collins woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Bess had raped her . <P> Last month , Ben Bess got out of jail . Governor Richards pardoned him . The pardon was the result of Maude Collins ' confession-now that she is 60 and expecting Death soon-that she had sworn falsely about Ben Bess . <P> Ben Bess came out of jail but he had no farm to go to . The lawyers had eaten that up long ago . Thirteen years at hard labor had aged and broken him . He had a bad cough . People sent him money and the Legislature will probably provide for him . But Governor Richards agreed that South Carolina 's debt to Ben Bess is irreparable . <P> Perhaps it was to prove that he really felt badly about it that Governor Richards last week gave the Ben Bess case a new twist . He wrote a letter to the solicitor of the Florence district and suggested that he present to the Grand Jury the white trash woman , Maude Collins , now 60 years old and expecting Death soon .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
