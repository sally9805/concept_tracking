The Story is that of a woman for whom love is not enough. * She , Mary Hansyke , is 14 years old and very beautiful when Gerry Hardman meets her for the first time , When she has vainly waited a year for a second meeting , she marries Archie Roxby , bears him a son , becomes his widow . At home again , Mary Hansyke goes into her uncle 's shipyards , watches the tall clippers she has built swing through the harbor of Danesacre to the wide sea ; her worship of lovely ships is a more compelling idolatry than that which she offers her second husband , Hugh Hervey . She loves him deeply , but , since love and ship-building touch in her the same depths , ship-building more perfectly satisfies her sense of command . Just after her marriage : <P> " It was impossible that she should be aware as she lay there , so small , soft and yielding that she was indulging her most powerful instinct , the instinct of possession , the longing , the passionate need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasping Gartons , men who had torn possessions from the grudging hand of life . . . . Her adoration of Hugh was rooted in the knowledge that he was hers , as nothing had ever been , as her son could not be . " <P> The bitterest test comes to her when Gerry returns , years after her second marriage . Then she says : " You will ask-all men do-and whatever you ask I 'll do for you . " Yet he guesses that away from the ships , Mary Hansyke 's eager and concentrated mind could not for long be satisfied . They plan to go away together , but quietly , alone , he goes first . " Forever young , forever brave , forever proud , Mary Hansyke walked across the old shipyard , while the John Garton moved down the harbor , her keel parting a shoreless sea , her prow lifted to the air of eternity . A lovely ship . " <P> The Significance . Author Jameson contradicts the conceit which makes many women writers concentrate on the opposite sex . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true , often concern women doing men 's work , organizing their lives toward a new freedom . The Lovely Ship in manner bears some resemblance to the writings of Joseph Hergesheimer , but Miss Jameson is more interested in making her people live than in describing ten-course dinners . Her performance in this book is one of almost pure perfection . An intention beautifully realized excuses an occasional prolixity . An infrequent weakness is overbalanced by Miss Jameson 's subtlety in emotional perceptions , her shining artistry . <P> The Author will technically be come a member of the older generation when she reaches her 30th birthday next year . At that time she will be able to remember seven books written , of which four-The Pot Boils , The Pitiful Wife , Three Kingdoms and now , The Lovely Ship are inferior to little that the last decade has produced . She would be justified in feeling that her education in London University , her journalistic and advertising preliminaries , have molded talent to a secure success . <P> *THE LOVELY SHIP-Storm Jameson-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
