The background of this play is a mythical and anonymous kingdom , situated on an island in the North Sea , somewhere between Denmark and Scotland . The entire action of the play is concentrated in KING ERIC 'S private office , on the second floor of the royal palace . The room , in its decoration and its furnishings , suggests Buckingham Palace and the Victorian influence rather than Versailles . At the rise of the curtain , FREDERICK GRANTON is discovered . He is seated at the desk , working very earnestly over various papers and whistling snatches of the " Rhapsody in Blue , " which he knows only imperfectly . There are certain passages that worry him considerably and he pauses in his work to attempt to figure them out . After a moment , the heavy curtains over the entrance are parted and PHIPPS enters . PHIPPS The Duke of Langart to see His Majesty . FREDERICK GRANTON ( Without looking up . ) His Majesty is out . PHIPPS Any message for the Duke , sir ? FREDERICK GRANTON No message for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes out . ) ( GRANTON goes on with his work and his whistling , evidently becoming annoyed when stumped by an intricate passage in the " Rhapsody . " He runs over it several times , but ca n't get the minors right . PHIPPS re-enters. ) p. 3 FREDERICK GRANTON What is it now , Phipps ? PHIPPS Several tradespeople , sir , with a petition . FREDERICK GRANTON What do they propose to do with the petition ? PHIPPS They wish to present it to His Majesty . FREDERICK GRANTON His Majesty is out . PHIPPS Very good , sir . FREDERICK GRANTON Tell the tradespeople that , in His Majesty 's absence , they may present the petition to you . PHIPPS Oh , thank you , sir . ( He goes out . GRANTON resumes his whistling . The telephone rings . He picks it up . ) FREDERICK GRANTON Yes . What ? No  --  you have the wrong number . This is the Royal Palace . That 's quite all right . ( He hangs up the telephone . PHIPPS re-enters . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Birten , sir . FREDERICK GRANTON Send him in . PHIPPS ( Holding aside the curtain ) . His Excellency , the Foreign Minister .

FREDERICK GRANTON He went out , sir  --  for a walk , I imagine . LORD BIRTEN And Her Majesty ? FREDERICK GRANTON Finishing her preparations . The palace has been in quite an uproar today . LORD BIRTEN I can imagine that . No wonder the King went out for a walk . What time does the Queen leave ? FREDERICK GRANTON The procession leaves the palace at four sharp . The boat sails at six . ( BIRTEN looks at his watch . ) LORD BIRTEN I must see her before she goes . I have some news for her . ( He taps his breast-pocket significantly , and there is a glint of self-satisfaction in his eye . ) FREDERICK GRANTON Perhaps she could give you an audience now . LORD BIRTEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to interrupt a queen when she 's packing . FREDERICK GRANTON I shall tell Her Majesty that you called . ( BIRTEN goes to the right , then turns. ) p. 5 LORD BIRTEN I suppose the King is utterly inconsolable over the Queen 's departure ? FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir . He feels very badly about it . LORD BIRTEN Oh , he does , does he ! ( He goes out , laughing uproariously . ) FREDERICK GRANTON ( Muttering . ) What are you laughing at ? ( After a moment , PETLEY , another footman , enters . Without looking up . ) His Majesty is out . PETLEY Her Royal Highness , the Princess Anne . FREDERICK GRANTON ( Jumping to his feet . ) Oh . ( ANNE comes in . ) PRINCESS ANNE Hello , Freddie .

She 's furious now because father 's gone out . She wants to have him here so she can tear him to pieces , along with the rest of us . FREDERICK GRANTON Lord Birten has been in . PRINCESS ANNE Birten ! What did he want ? ( She slumps down easily in an armchair . ) FREDERICK GRANTON He wanted to see Her Majesty . PRINCESS ANNE He and mother are thick as thieves . I wonder what they 're up to . FREDERICK GRANTON Oh , nothing much . Her Majesty always likes to keep an eye on the Cabinet ministers . PRINCESS ANNE Mother wants to boss everything . But she 'll find out she ca n't boss me . I 'm not her husband . I 'm going to lead my own life . FREDERICK GRANTON May I ask , when do you intend to start ? ( He sits down on the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's safely away on her trip to America . One of these days mother will pick up a New York paper and discover that her daughter has eloped . You are going to elope with me , are n't you , Freddie ? p. 7 FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , Anne . ( He takes her in his arms . ) I wo n't let you elope alone . PRINCESS ANNE You 're sweet , Freddie . You 're giving up everything for me , are n't you ? FREDERICK GRANTON I giving up everything ? I like that ! You 're the one who 's giving up everything for me . PRINCESS ANNE Nonsense ! You 'll sacrifice your whole career when you marry me . You 'll never be forgiven . FREDERICK GRANTON Neither will you . PRINCESS ANNE I do n't want to be forgiven . I only want to get away from this stifling place . I want to be happy and free . There 's no one here who will really miss me for a minute when I 've gone . FREDERICK GRANTON There 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But father wo n't mind . He 'll understand . Father would like to be free himself . If he 'd only abdicate ! FREDERICK GRANTON But he wo n't . PRINCESS ANNE I know . Mother would n't let him . You know how mother is . FREDERICK GRANTON I do . PRINCESS ANNE She thinks it 's our duty to stay here and keep the throne occupied . Duty ! That 's all I 've ever been allowed to think about since the day I was born . Well , I 'm going to think about myself , my own happiness , for a change . I 'm going away with you . p. 8 FREDERICK GRANTON ( Rising . ) When can we start , Anne ? I 'm trying hard to be patient , but I ca n't wait much longer . It  --  it 's terrible having to wait . ( ANNE comes close to him . ) PRINCESS ANNE It 's terrible for me , too , Freddie , darling . But we must n't take any chances until mother is safely across the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses her . ) ( PETLEY enters . ) PETLEY Her Majesty  --  the Queen . ( ANNE breaks away from GRANTON with a murmured warning . QUEEN MARTHA comes in . She is followed by two LADIES-IN-WAITING . ) QUEEN MARTHA Has His Majesty taken the trouble to come home yet ? FREDERICK GRANTON No , ma'am , he has not . QUEEN MARTHA Why has n't he ? FREDERICK GRANTON I really could n't say , ma'am . QUEEN MARTHA Does n't he realize that we 're to leave in another hour ? Does n't he know that he 's to put on his hussar 's uniform for the procession to the harbor ? ( She paces up and down in a state of nervous irritation. ) p. 9 FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , ma'am . I 'm quite certain that His Majesty has been advised as to that . QUEEN MARTHA Then why does n't he come home ? Would n't you think he 'd know that I 'm terribly worried , terribly upset by all this ? Anne  --  your father is a very inconsiderate , very thoughtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother . Father probably thought he 'd just be in the way . QUEEN MARTHA Well  --  he would have been in the way . But just the same , he should have spoken to me before he went out . ( ANNE goes idly to the window and looks out . ) FREDERICK GRANTON Lord Birten called , ma'am . He asked to see you . QUEEN MARTHA And why did n't he see me ? FREDERICK GRANTON I told him that you were very busy ; he said he would come back later . QUEEN MARTHA Then I shall wait right here . ( She sits , then remembers the two LADIES-IN-WAITING . ) You two go and get ready for the procession . TWO LADIES ( Curtseying together . ) Yes , ma'am . ( They go out . ) QUEEN MARTHA So Birten was here , eh ? Did he tell you why he wanted to see me ? p. 10 FREDERICK GRANTON No , ma'am . But he did suggest that he had some good news for you . QUEEN MARTHA Has General Northrup been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been at the palace today . QUEEN MARTHA I hope he does n't come . I hope I never see his scowling face again . PRINCESS ANNE Come , come , mother . You know you 'd be perfectly furious if he did n't stop in to wish you bon voyage . QUEEN MARTHA I do n't want any kind wishes from General Northrup , thank you . I do n't like him . He has no business to be Premier of this country . PRINCESS ANNE Yes  --  and if it were n't for Northrup and his army , this country would be a republic , run by socialists . And where would you be then ? ( She smiles at GRANTON behind her mother 's back ; she even goes so far as to blow a kiss at him . ) I know where I 'd be . ( GRANTON , who is within the QUEEN 'S line of vison , is much embarrassed . ) QUEEN MARTHA I 'm happy to say that there is no danger of that . We have the confidence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . ( She rises suddenly . ) Oh , where is the King ? What on earth does he think he 's doing , wandering around aimlessly  --  when he 's needed here ? p. 11 PRINCESS ANNE Oh , forget it , mother . There 's plenty of time . QUEEN MARTHA There 's never plenty of time for your father , the way he dawdles . He 'll probably need a shave  --  and that always takes him hours . Anne ! Some day you 'll be a queen . Then you 'll know what struggles I 've had , what sacrifices I 've made  --  you 'll realize what I 've had to put up with . PRINCESS ANNE Cheer up , mother . You 're going on a nice , long vacation . QUEEN MARTHA Vacation ! Do you think for a moment that I 'm going to America for pleasure ? I 'm going to work for the good of my dear country . I never do anything that is n't for the good of my country . ( PHIPPS enters . ) PHIPPS General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . QUEEN MARTHA ( To ANNE . ) There you are ! Important business to be attended to and the King is not here  --  as usual . ( She turns to PHIPPS . ) I shall see them . ( She sits  --  very erect , very regal . ) PHIPPS Yes , ma'am . ( He bows low and opens the curtains . ) His Supreme Excellency , the Premier . His Excellency , the Foreign Minister . ( The two ministers come in. ) p. 12 GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Saluting and bowing stiffly . ) Your Majesty ! Your Royal Highness . ( The latter to ANNE , who nods . ) QUEEN MARTHA ( Coolly . ) Your Supreme Excellency . LORD BIRTEN ( Bowing low and gracefully . ) Your Majesty . Your Royal Highness . QUEEN MARTHA ( With more warmth . ) Your Excellency . GENERAL NORTHRUP I am given to understand , ma'am , that His Majesty is not here . QUEEN MARTHA You have not been misinformed . GENERAL NORTHRUP I have some matters of vital importance to discuss . QUEEN MARTHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a short time , and we can not wait for the King . LORD BIRTEN And may I say , ma'am , on behalf of my chief ( Indicating NORTHRUP ) , on behalf of the cabinet and parliament , on behalf of every man , woman , and child in this great kingdom , and finally on behalf of mine own humble self , may I say that we deplore Your Majesty 's departure , and that our hearts will go forth with you on your noble mission of friendship to our brothers across the seas ? ( ANNE , realizing that some dull , political matters are about to be discussed , saunters over to the bookcase at the left , picks out a book , and starts looking through it. ) p. 13 QUEEN MARTHA Thank you , Lord Birten . We shall remember that . Now , General , what have you to say ? GENERAL NORTHRUP I have had another conference with the Liberal leader , Dr. Fellman , ma'am . QUEEN MARTHA You ca n't ask me to become excited about that , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were n't , ma'am , we 'd find ourselves involved in a revolution . QUEEN MARTHA A revolution ! What nonsense ! Fellman would n't dare try anything like that . GENERAL NORTHRUP Fellman is n't the only radical in this country . There are others  --  hundreds of thousands of them  --  who are determined to overthrow the monarchy . LORD BIRTEN General Northrup does n't overestimate the danger of this menace , ma'am . GENERAL NORTHRUP Radicalism presents an increasingly difficult problem for all of us , ma'am . For that reason it is absolutely essential that your visit to America must produce results ! QUEEN MARTHA I think you can leave that to me , General . LORD BIRTEN Of course we can , ma'am . Of course we can . QUEEN MARTHA Are you arresting any of these Anarchists ? p. 14 GENERAL NORTHRUP We are arresting them by the hundreds . Our jails are filled to overflowing with men who are bent on destroying our homes , our institutions , the very structure of our state . There is but one punishment for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHA Then why not execute them ? GENERAL NORTHRUP There is a reason for that , ma'am . You may or may not know that our constitution provides that . QUEEN MARTHA You do n't have to tell me anything about our constitution , General Northrup . My great-grandfather wrote it . Go on . GENERAL NORTHRUP Then you are aware that no political prisoner can be put to death until his sentence has been countersigned by the King ! QUEEN MARTHA Well ? GENERAL NORTHRUP There are over fifty death sentences on His Majesty 's desk at this moment , waiting to be signed . They have been on His Majesty 's desk for over a week . QUEEN MARTHA Is this true , Granton ? FREDERICK GRANTON Why , yes , ma'am  --  that is to say . GENERAL NORTHRUP And while His Majesty is delaying the entire process of the law , we are arresting more men than our prisons can hold . I tell you , ma'am , the situation is intolerable . These executions must go through , at once ! p. 15 QUEEN MARTHA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PHIPPS enters . ) PHIPPS ( In a loud voice that he reserves only for this occasion . ) His Majesty the King ! ( KING ERIC VIII enters . He looks rather uncomfortable when he sees the gathering in his room . ) KING ERIC VIII ( Hesitantly . ) Good afternoon . NORTHRUP AND BIRTEN ( Bowing . ) Your Majesty . QUEEN MARTHA Where have you been ? KING ERIC VIII I 've been down at the Royal Zoo , dear . ( TO NORTHRUP . ) You know , I love to watch the penguins . It 's the strangest thing  --  they walk just exactly like human beings . QUEEN MARTHA How very interesting ! KING ERIC VIII There was a man there selling little china penguins . I bought one of them . Look ( He produces one from his pocket. ) has n't it a funny expression ? QUEEN MARTHA ( Rising and confronting the King . ) We have no time now to discuss pen guins ! p. 16 KING ERIC VIII ( Looking from the QUEEN to the ominous NORTHRUP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything wrong ? QUEEN MARTHA I 've just heard that you have neglected to sign hundreds of orders for the execution of Anarchists . KING ERIC VIII Who told you that ? GENERAL NORTHRUP I told her that , sir  --  and I shall be happy to repeat my words to you ! KING ERIC VIII No  --  you need n't bother . QUEEN MARTHA I ca n't understand how you could be so careless  --  how you could neglect your duty in such a slipshod , irresponsible manner . KING ERIC VIII Well  --  to tell the truth , I . QUEEN MARTHA Do n't you realize that these criminals will murder us all , if we give them the chance ? Ca n't you see that the monarchy is in dreadful danger ? KING ERIC VIII Well , of course , I know . GENERAL NORTHRUP Her Majesty is right . These radicals are like so much vermin  --  unseen , unsuspected , at first , perhaps ; but if we allow them to multiply , if we fail to crush them , they will overwhelm and exterminate us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just what am I to do ? QUEEN MARTHA You 're to sign those orders of execution . GENERAL NORTHRUP They 've been accumulating on your desk for weeks . KING ERIC VIII On my desk ? ( He goes to the desk , sits , and makes a great show of searching through the masses of papers . He discovers a document that causes him to chuckle audibly , but a glance from the QUEEN quenches his mirth ; he hastily restores the document to its folder , and goes on with his futile search . ) They must be here somewhere . ( He opens and shuts several drawers . ) What did I do with those papers , Granton ? FREDERICK GRANTON I 'm afraid it 's my fault , sir . I took them down to the Lord Counsellor 's office for verification . KING ERIC VIII ( Relieved . ) Then go and find them at once . FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir . ( He bows and goes out . ) KING ERIC VIII ( To the QUEEN . ) There ! You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The QUEEN sits. ) p. 18 GENERAL NORTHRUP If I may say so , sir , a flagrant breach of efficiency such as this should subject that secretary to instant dismissal . ( ANNE , in the background , hears this and silently expresses concern . ) QUEEN MARTHA I should hope so . He 's a pest , anyway . KING ERIC VIII Well  --  I 'll attend to him , later . GENERAL NORTHRUP And will the signed orders be in my hands today ? KING ERIC VIII Oh , you can be sure that I shall make every effort to . QUEEN MARTHA They will ! I 'll see to that . KING ERIC VIII Yes , Northrup  --  you can put the matter right out of your mind . QUEEN MARTHA I understand that Lord Birten has something to say to us . KING ERIC VIII Indeed ? We 're always glad to hear from Lord Birten . ( NORTHRUP steps aside and allows BIRTEN to take the floor . ) LORD BIRTEN I think you will be glad to hear this , sir . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just completed the little arrangement on which we have all set our hearts . KING ERIC VIII What one is that ? p. 19 LORD BIRTEN I received , not an hour ago , a telegraphic communication from the foreign office at Greck . QUEEN MARTHA ( Excitedly . ) Yes ? What did it say ? LORD BIRTEN I have reason to believe that a marriage may be arranged between Prince William of Greck and our own beloved Princess Anne . PRINCESS ANNE What ! QUEEN MARTHA Is it settled ? ( The book that ANNE has been holding drops with a dull thud . ) LORD BIRTEN Practically . And I may add , that this could never have been accomplished had it not been for the tireless efforts of Her Majesty . QUEEN MARTHA ( Rising . ) Thank heaven ! ( She embraces ANNE . ) My darling child  --  you 're engaged to be married ! ( BIRTEN and NORTHRUP cross to ANNE , both of them talking at once . ) LORD BIRTEN May I offer my heartfelt congratulations to your Royal Highness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little group , with the QUEEN , about the startled ANNE . Only the KING makes no move , says no word of congratulation . He stares down at the desk. ) p. 20 PRINCESS ANNE ( Breaking away from her mother . ) . Congratulations ! For what ? QUEEN MARTHA Anne , you have made a perfectly marvellous match . PRINCESS ANNE ( Almost hysterical . ) I have made a match ? What have I had to do with it ? Have I been asked ? ( She breaks away from them . ) Nobody has even bothered to consult me about this ! ( The KING rises and turns to the window . ) LORD BIRTEN ( Following ANNE . ) Perhaps I can explain . It was advisable to keep this matter profoundly secret for diplomatic reasons . Thus , we deemed it unwise to divulge the terms , even to Your Highness . PRINCESS ANNE The terms ! Oh  --  were there terms ? LORD BIRTEN Yes , the terms are the best that we could possibly have hoped for . ( He turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement provides that the Princess Anne will , of course , become Empress of Greck , in due time . Her eldest son will be the heir to the throne , and her second son will become the Crown Prince in our own dear land . Thus , in the future , two brothers will be reigning at the same . p. 21 PRINCESS ANNE ( Advancing toward BIRTEN . ) Two brothers  --  my sons ! So the contract provides that I shall produce two male children . Well  --  how do you know I can ? QUEEN MARTHA ( horrified . ) Anne ! How shamefully indelicate ! PRINCESS ANNE That 's just what it is  --  indelicate , horrible , revolting ! To be married off to some rotten degenerate ! Oh , God ! ( She bursts into hysterical sobs , sinking down into the chair and burying her face in her hands . ) QUEEN MARTHA Anne ! Come with me this instant . Come to your room . Do you hear me ? ( ANNE continues to sob . The KING , with a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the chair in which ANNE is crumpled . Hesitantly , he reaches out his hand and stokes her hair with great tenderness . When she feels his sympathetic touch , she addresses her frantic plea to him . ) PRINCESS ANNE Father ! You love me , you understand me . Are you going to let them do this to me ? KING ERIC VIII It 's all right , my darling . You 'd better go up to your room now . We 'll talk this all over later . QUEEN MARTHA Come with me. p. 22 KING ERIC VIII Go with your mother , Anne . And please do n't cry any more . PRINCESS ANNE Speak to these people , father . Tell them how cruel , how shameful it is . QUEEN MARTHA Anne ! ( With one , last appealing look at her father , ANNE stands up , then goes out . ) QUEEN MARTHA I 'll have a little talk with her . ( She sweeps out after ANNE . ) LORD BIRTEN Poor child ! Poor child ! But she 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING ERIC VIII Just what does it mean ? GENERAL NORTHRUP It is beyond question the greatest diplomatic victory in the history of our . KING ERIC VIII Please , Northrup  --  let 's not go through all that again . I know that it 's a glorious triumph and that you all deserve to be very proud of yourselves and that our social prestige in the courts of Europe is assured I also know that I do not care to intrust my daughter 's happiness to Prince William of Greck . LORD BIRTEN You will see this in a different light , sir , when you realize the many advantages . KING ERIC VIII Birten , I can imagine no light in which this would appear other than disagreeable and distasteful . I do n't intend to hear of it again . ( He starts to go out. ) p. 23 GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Belligerently . ) Look here , sir , you 're all wrong about this . ( The KING , paying no attention to him , goes out . ) Your Majesty ! ( BIRTEN cautions NORTHRUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's no point in antagonizing the King now . GENERAL NORTHRUP King or no King  --  he need n't think he can block our plans for this wedding . LORD BIRTEN Do n't worry  --  he ca n't block our plans . They 're all settled . ( He takes a document from his inside pocket . ) Here 's the contract signed and sealed . They 're as good as married now . ( He hands the contract to NORTHRUP who looks through it . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP Has Prince William agreed ? LORD BIRTEN No  --  he 's away in Paris , as usual . But that makes no difference . Neither he nor the Princess Anne has anything to say about this . GENERAL NORTHRUP How soon will you be ready to give this out to the newspapers ? LORD BIRTEN At once . The press will announce that this is the culmination of a romantic love-affair on the Riviera last spring  --  when the Prince and Princess were travelling incog. and happened to meet in a moonlit garden . p. 24 GENERAL NORTHRUP The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can make this one look like the real thing . GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Handing back the contract to BIRTEN . ) I am glad we are to be rid of the Queen for a while . We 'll be able to get things done . LORD BIRTEN Her Majesty wo n't interfere in this business . She 's as eager as we are for the marriage to go through . GENERAL NORTHRUP I know , but she 's too officious . She wants to meddle in everything . She ca n't rid herself of the idea that the throne is all powerful . The King , at least , knows enough to keep his place . ( He picks up the penguin , snorts scornfully , and tosses it down on the desk . ) LORD BIRTEN Her Majesty is very useful , sometimes . GENERAL NORTHRUP Yes  --  as a press-agent . She 'll make the rich Americans pay heavily for the privilege of shaking hands with royalty . But here at home we 're not dealing with Americans . Fellman and the rest of the reds are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get it ! Come on . Let 's get out of here . ( PETLEY comes in . ) LORD BIRTEN ( On the way out . ) I think it would be an excellent idea to go over to the Greckian Embassy to exchange felicitations on this happyevent. p. 25 GENERAL NORTHRUP Oh  --  we wo n't neglect any of the necessary ceremonies . ( He goes out followed by BIRTEN . PETLEY turns to the door behind him and speaks through the curtains . ) PETLEY It 's all right , Your Majesty . They 've gone . ( The KING comes in . ) KING ERIC VIII Thank you , Petley . ( PETLEY goes out . The KING stands silently for some time , gazing out of the window . He turns and walks slowly to the desk . Then he starts looking through the drawers of the desk , exclaiming with annoyance at his inability to find whatever it is he 's looking for . At length , he rings a bell-button on the desk , and PHIPPS appears instantly through the curtains . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Where the devil have they put that checker-board ? PHIPPS Begging Your Majesty 's pardon , I placed it in here for safe-keeping . ( He goes to the cabinet , opens it , and takes out a checker-board and box containing the checkermen . ) Here it is , Your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII ( As he lays out the men . ) I wish you 'd all get together and think up some permanent hiding-place for this board . It 's always , invariably , just where I ca n't find it . p. 26 PHIPPS Perhaps I should explain , sir , this is a new board . Her Majesty found the old one and had it thrown out . KING ERIC VIII Well , Phipps  --  there 's one consolation . There are always more checker-boards . Come on , now  --  sit down  --  ( PHIPPS draws up a chair . ) I 'm going to beat the hide off you . PHIPPS ( Sitting down . ) It 's Your Majesty 's first move this time . KING ERIC VIII Very well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Making his move . ) Thank you , sir . KING ERIC VIII ( As the game progresses . ) You know , Phipps , you have an unfair advantage over me . PHIPPS An unfair advantage , sir ? Does Your Majesty imagine that I 'd be guilty of any petty cheating in checkers ? KING ERIC VIII Do n't be a fool , Phipps . What I meant was  --  you get a chance to practise . I 'm certain that when you 're off duty you train with the finest checker players in the city . Now , I never get any practice . You 're the only one in the palace who will ever play checkers with me . I once had the idea that I might persuade the Queen to take up the game  --  but , somehow or other , she could n't seem to appreciate its charms . Her Majesty is a very remarkable woman , Phipps  --  a very remarkable woman . But she just wo n't play checkers . ( The KING makes a move , but PHIPPS extends a restraining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but you 've got to jump . KING ERIC VIII Oh , I have , have I ? I had n't noticed that . Well . ( He jumps . PHIPPS jumps him back twice . ) Phipps ! You do practice . PHIPPS Thank you , sir . KING ERIC VIII ( Going on with the game . ) Have you any children , Phipps ? PHIPPS Six , sir . KING ERIC VIII How very commendable . All sons , I suppose . PHIPPS No , sir . There is one daughter . KING ERIC VIII Is she married ? PHIPPS She is , sir . KING ERIC VIII To a young man of her own choice ? PHIPPS Yes , sir  --  unfortunately . She chose an agriculturist , and I may say that it has been a source of some regret to her mother and me . KING ERIC VIII Oh  --  you wanted her to marry some one else ? PHIPPS Yes , sir . We did not consider the agriculturist quite  --  ah  --  shall I say eligible ? We hoped that the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERIC VIII Is she happy , Phipps ? PHIPPS Yes , sir  --  I suppose she 's happy  --  in a rather rustic sort of way . ( He jumps up . ) Beg pardon , sir  --  the buzzer 's ringing . ( He goes out ; the KING hastily arranges his handkerchief over the checker-board and starts scattering papers above it to hide it . PHIPPS re-enters . ) PHIPPS ( In his formal manner . ) The Duke of Langart is here for the second time today to see His Majesty the King . KING ERIC VIII Kindly tell the Duke of Langart that His Majesty the King is at present confined to his bed with an acute attack of cholera . PHIPPS Very good , your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII Excellent , if you ask me . ( PHIPPS goes out . The KING removes the dbris from the checker-board . PHIPPS comes back , and the game is resumed . The KING starts to move . ) PHIPPS ( Again putting forth a restraining hand . ) Begging your pardon , sir , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's my move . You moved here last . p. 29 PHIPPS No , sir  --  you moved into the king position just before the buzzer rang . I distinctly remember that , your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII Oh , very well . Go ahead and move . ( PHIPPS moves . The KING is delighted . He moves again . ) Now jump me . ( PHIPPS moves and the KING jumps him twice . ) I had you that time , Phipps  --  practice or no practice . PHIPPS ( Nettled . ) I 'm afraid I lost the thread of the game when the Duke interrupted us . KING ERIC VIII Now , really , Phipps . That 's hardly sporting , is it ? I 'm beating you this time , and I want to hear no cringing excuses for your defeat . I 'm afraid you 're ruined , Phipps . PHIPPS ( Jumping up again . ) Watch out , sir . There goes the buzzer at the other door . ( He starts to move his chair away from the desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . ) You have the most uncanny ear for buzzers ! ( PETLEY enters . ) PETLEY Her Royal Highness , the Princess Anne . ( She is in that state of ominous calm that follows , or precedes , or both , an outburst of hysteria . PHIPPS moves the chair back to its position by the desk . He and the KING are both prepared to go on with the game. ) p. 30 PRINCESS ANNE I want to talk to you , father . KING ERIC VIII Yes , my dear . PRINCESS ANNE Alone . KING ERIC VIII ( With a rueful glance at the checker-board . ) You may go , Phipps . PHIPPS ( Moving the chair back ) . It will be my next move , sir . ( PHIPPS goes out . The KING turns to ANNE . ) PRINCESS ANNE Father ! I want to know something ! I want you to tell me the truth ! KING ERIC VIII What is it , Anne ? PRINCESS ANNE Did you know about this ghastly thing they 're trying to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rising . ) No , Anne  --  I did n't know about it . PRINCESS ANNE Oh  --  I 'm glad , father . I 'm glad that you were n't one of them . KING ERIC VIII I 'm afraid I 'm never one of them , my dear . I 'm not let in on many state secrets , you know . PRINCESS ANNE You should be thankful for that . At least , you keep your hands clean of the dirty messes they stir up . ( She sits. ) p. 31 KING ERIC VIII Who are " they " ? PRINCESS ANNE You know  --  that loud-mouthed Northrup , and that old cheat , Birten  --  and  --  and KING ERIC VIII ( Hastily . ) And all the others . Yes  --  I know . PRINCESS ANNE Well , they sha n't get me into it . They 're not going to turn me into a political bribe . KING ERIC VIII Do you know this man you 're scheduled to marry ?

( He sits down again behind the desk . ) PRINCESS ANNE Everyone knows what a rotter he is . If I marry him , they 'll all be laughing at me , or sympathizing with me . I tell you father , I wo n't do it ! I wo n't do it ! ( She rises and paces up and down . ) I 'll renounce my position . I 'll go into exile  --  but I wo n't marry that foul man . KING ERIC VIII But you 'll have to marry someone , my dear girl . You must do your share in perpetuating the dynasty . PRINCESS ANNE The dynasty can end here and now , for all I care . And if they have to have two male children , they can adopt them . Oh  --  what hypocrites they are  --  asking me to shame myself for the honor of our " dear " country . Well , I do n't give a rap for our dear country . I 'm sick of being royalty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIII Being a member of the royal family has its advantages , my dear . Think of all the orphan asylums you can inspect . ( She goes over and leans against the desk . ) PRINCESS ANNE It is n't any joke , father . It 's terribly serious to me . I do n't care whether I have any money  --  or whether I have nice clothes or even enough food to eat . Why , when we drive through the streets and I look at the poor beggars , I think to myself KING ERIC VIII You think to yourself  --  gladly , cheerfully , you would trade places with them . I know , my darling . I know that speech well . I used to say it myself , frequently , in the days of my youth . And did it do me any good ? Did I become a person ? Have I ever found the freedom that is enjoyed by that celebrated beggar in the gutter ? I 'm afraid not , Anne . I turned out to be a king . PRINCESS ANNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest of your life ? KING ERIC VIII Yes , Anne . I suppose I shall have to stick to the job  --  even if there is no future in it . PRINCESS ANNE ( Tenderly . ) Never mind  --  you 're a good king , father  --  a noble king . KING ERIC VIII I might just as well be a bad king , for all the difference it would make . Kings and queens and princes and princesses are absurd institutions  --  useless institutions , when you come to think about it . But some people need us  --  and as long as they need us , we must be on hand  --  to dress up , when they want us to , to patronize them , when they want us to , to marry , when they want us to . We 're hired entertainers , Anne . As long as we amuse the public , and do n't cost them too much money , they command us to perform . When our antics begin to bore them , they throw us out . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine right of kings . p. 33 PRINCESS ANNE If you ask me , they 're tired of us , now . Ca n't you see that the old order has changed  --  that we 're no longer wanted ? We 'd all of us better go before the revolution starts . Remember what happened in Russia . KING ERIC VIII It is n't so easy , Anne . The unfortunate fact is that we ca n't go of our own accord ; we have to be ejected . If I abdicated tomorrow , and spent the rest of my life peacefully and quietly in Switzerland , I should always be haunted by the knowledge that there are a lot of patriotic fools sacrificing their lives in the effort to restore me to my throne . There 's young Granton , for instance ; he 's a commoner by birth but a royalist at heart . Do you imagine for a moment that he 'd be content to stand by complacently while we were languishing in exile ? No  --  Granton would be perched up on a soap-box in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to his death shouting , " Long Live the King . " PRINCESS ANNE Oh , no , he would n't . Granton would go into exile with us , and be glad to do it . KING ERIC VIII How do you know that ? PRINCESS ANNE ( A trifle confused . ) Well , I talk to him now and then , naturally . ( She turns and walks away from the desk. ) p. 34 KING ERIC VIII Oh , of course . But you ca n't deny that Granton is one of those loyal hotheads who are determined to keep us at our posts . They mean well  --  but they 're nuisances , all of them . No , Anne  --  there 's only one instrument that can deliver us from our responsibilities ; that , I regret to say , is a firing squad . PRINCESS ANNE ( Sitting . ) What a lovely prospect it is for me . Prince William , or a firing squad . ( GRANTON comes in , carrying a large bundle of papers . ) KING ERIC VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREDERICK GRANTON ( Startled . ) Me , sir ? ( He looks questioningly at ANNE , but she shakes her head . The KING pretends not to notice this . He rises and goes over to face GRANTON . ) KING ERIC VIII What would you say , Granton , if I were to tell you that I had decided to abdicate ? FREDERICK GRANTON Your Majesty ! I  --  I do n't know what I should say  --  what I could say . KING ERIC VIII Would you shudder with horror in every fibre of your being ? Would you draw your sword , if you had one , and cry out , " No  --  a thousand times no ! Only over my dead body will you leave the throne ? " Or would you murmur devoutly to yourself , " Well  --  it 's about time the old man came to his senses and retired . " p. 35 FREDERICK GRANTON I can only say that I should follow Your Majesty in any venture you might choose to undertake . ( The KING goes back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Granton . That 's all I wanted to know . FREDERICK GRANTON ( Hesitantly . ) May I make so bold , sir , as to ask whether you have any such revolutionary idea in mind ? KING ERIC VIII You may make so bold , Granton  --  and my answer is no , I have n't the slightest intention of abdicating . FREDERICK GRANTON ( Disappointed . ) I have here the documents , sir , for which you asked . KING ERIC VIII Did I ask for any documents ? FREDERICK GRANTON The orders , sir , for the execution of the anarchists . KING ERIC VIII Oh , you found them . FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir  --  they are here , ready for your signature . KING ERIC VIII Then take them out and lose them again . FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir  --  ( He goes to the door . ) Will that be all , sir ? p. 36 KING ERIC VIII Yes , Granton . That will be all . ( GRANTON bows and goes out . After a slight pause the KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on ? PRINCESS ANNE ( Startled . ) What ? KING ERIC VIII This charming little romance . PRINCESS ANNE How did you know ? KING ERIC VIII A king knows everything , my dear . He is divinely endowed with omniscience  --  you would know that , if you paid strict attention to your schoolbooks . PRINCESS ANNE ( Rising and going to the desk . ) Father ! You 've got to help us  --  you 're the only one who can help us . KING ERIC VIII You have n't yet told me how long it has been going on ? PRINCESS ANNE For months  --  ever since he got the appointment to be your secretary . We talked together and understood each other and  --  and  --  well , we fell in love . KING ERIC VIII You fell in love . And then what ? PRINCESS ANNE We fell further in love . We could n't help it . KING ERIC VIII Of course not . It 's a perfectly natural impulse , they tell me . And may I ask whether you 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to be married . KING ERIC VIII Oh . Is it to be a church wedding ? PRINCESS ANNE We 're going to elope . As soon as mother has landed in America , we 'll escape to France . That 's a free country , is n't it ? KING ERIC VIII Reasonably so . PRINCESS ANNE And when we get there we 're going to be married , and Freddie will get work of some kind  --  he has always wanted to write or paint or something . And we 'll have babies , and be happy , and you 'll come to visit us . KING ERIC VIII And after the third day of my visit , Granton will say to you , " Is your father going to stay here forever ? " PRINCESS ANNE He wo n't say any such thing . He loves you  --  and besides , he 's much too sweet to be mean to any one . KING ERIC VIII I 'm sure of it . But  --  and you 'll forgive me for bringing up disagreeable subjects  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRINCESS ANNE Mother will just simply have to reconcile herself to it as best she can . KING ERIC VIII I have a faint suspicion that your mother may not be overenthusiastic. p. 38 PRINCESS ANNE Oh , I know . She wants me to marry a prince , and do my duty and all that . But when she sees that I 've found a good , kind husband , and that I 'm happy , she wo n't be angry . KING ERIC VIII I think I hear the buzzer . ( PETLEY enters . ) PETLEY Her Majesty , the Queen ! ( The QUEEN enters , followed by the two LADIES-IN-WAITING , who remain unobtrusively at the door . ) QUEEN MARTHA Do you happen to realize what time it is ? KING ERIC VIII ( Looking at the clock on his desk . ) Oh , so it is . QUEEN MARTHA Here you two sit  --  talking  --  talking  --  heaven only knows what about . And in half an hour , I 'm going away to America  --  across three thousand miles of ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not barbarous at all . QUEEN MARTHA It is barbarous . I 've read books about it . ( To the KING . ) Are you going to change your clothes for the procession ? KING ERIC VIII Yes , my dear  --  it 's the hussar 's uniform , I believe . ( He looks at the memo-pad on his desk . ) Yes  --  the hussar 's uniform . p. 39 QUEEN MARTHA Then why not do something about it ? The procession starts at four sharp  --  and I want you to look very neat . There are to be over thirty photographers between the palace and the dock . KING ERIC VIII Oh , I do hope they wo n't take any of those deadly close-ups . I look like a congenital idiot in the films . QUEEN MARTHA Where did that checker-board come from ? KING ERIC VIII ( Nervously . ) Oh  --  I meant to put that back in the drawer . QUEEN MARTHA Do n't let me hear of you playing checkers while I 'm away . And that absurd penguin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! KING ERIC VIII Yes , my dear . I just  --  put it down there . QUEEN MARTHA Well , take it away from there . You have this palace littered with penguins and I 'm sick of the sight of them . KING ERIC VIII I shall get rid of them , my dear . QUEEN MARTHA As to you , Anne . It 's most unfortunate that I have to go away at this time , just when your engagement to Prince William is to be announced . But I 'm going  --  to do my duty . I want you both to bear that in mind while I 'm away . p. 40 KING ERIC VIII We shall try to do our bit , in our small way , here at home . PRINCESS ANNE Do n't worry , mother . You can leave everthing to us . QUEEN MARTHA I am going to get money  --  to make us powerful , to increase our army and navy , to combat the red peril and subdue the terrible threat of revolution . I 'm sacrificing myself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you who weep and complain and disgrace yourself when called upon to make a supremely advantageous marriage . Have you heard me complain because I have to go to America ? No  --  you have not . I 'll never shirk my obligations . I shall go to America , without a word , and I shall come back with the money that we need  --  even if I have to go straight to the President of the United States himself . Come . ( She turns and sweeps out , followed by ANNE and the LADIES-IN-WAITING . For a moment the KING stands silently by the desk . He picks up the little penguin and looks at it , sadly. @x It is evening , two months later . The heavy curtains over the French windows have been drawn , but otherwise the room appears the same . The KING , in evening dress and wearing one decoration , is engaged in a gruelling checker game with PHIPPS . Both are concentrating on the board and saying little . After the curtain rises , there is a long wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length he moves . PHIPPS I 'm afraid it 's a draw , sir . KING ERIC VIII Draw nothing . We 'll fight this out if it takes all night . ( He moves . ) Furthermore , I shall win . ( PHIPPS moves . ) Trying to corner me , eh ? ( He moves . ) Well  --  how do you like that ? PHIPPS ( Starting up ) . There 's the buzzer , sir . KING ERIC VIII Let it ring . We 're not going to interrupt this game ! ( ANNE comes in ) . PRINCESS ANNE Father  --  what are you doing ? KING ERIC VIII ( Without turning ) . I 'm playing checkers . Sit down , Phipps . It 's your move . ( PHIPPS sits ) . p. 42 PRINCESS ANNE The palace is filled with soldiers . Why are they here ? KING ERIC VIII ( Preoccupied ) . Precautionary measures , I suppose . ( ANNE goes over to the window , parts the curtains , and looks out ) . PRINCESS ANNE Has the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have n't the faintest idea . PRINCESS ANNE Do you suppose anything has happened to stop the revolution ? KING ERIC VIII Now , really , Anne . I must ask you please to keep quiet . We have a terribly important game going on here . ( ANNE comes over and stands behind her father 's chair ) . PRINCESS ANNE Whose are the black men ? PHIPPS They 're mine , Your Highness . PRINCESS ANNE I see an awfully good move for you , Phipps . Why do n't you bring this king over here . KING ERIC VIII Now , look here  --  that is n't fair . Phipps will have to play his own game . PRINCESS ANNE All right then , father . I 'll help you . p. 43 KING ERIC VIII I do n't want any help . I only want to be left alone . PRINCESS ANNE Oh , very well . But I 'll bet that Phipps wins . ( She goes again to the window ) . If they 're going to have a revolution , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think you overlooked something that time , sir . KING ERIC VIII Where ? PHIPPS If you 'd moved here , sir , you could easily have . ( GRANTON bursts in . He is in a feverish state of excitement ) . FREDERICK GRANTON ( Breathlessly ) . Your Majesty ! I 've just come from the extra session of Parliament , sir . KING ERIC VIII I do n't care where you 've come from . Keep quiet and stop interrupting the game . FREDERICK GRANTON But it 's desperately important , sir ! PRINCESS ANNE Has the revolution broken out at last ? FREDERICK GRANTON It 's liable to break at any moment . Northrup made a violently belligerent speech in the House this evening and the Liberal leaders marched out . p. 44 KING ERIC VIII Will nobody have any respect for my commands ? I told you expressly please to keep quiet . FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir  --  forgive me , sir . But the action this evening in Parliament . KING ERIC VIII Oh , bother Parliament . We can all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to hear what happened . ( She goes over to GRANTON . ) Tell me about it , Freddie . We sha n't disturb father . FREDERICK GRANTON ( To ANNE ) Northrup deliberately antagonized the Liberals and there was nothing for them to do but declare an open revolt . I 'm afraid we 're in for some terrible trouble . KING ERIC VIII ( Groaning ) . Oh , for heaven 's sake ! PRINCESS ANNE What is it , father ? ( PHIPPS jumps three times , pounding the board on each jump with a loud , triumphant smack ) . KING ERIC VIII He 's got me again . PHIPPS It was a foregone conclusion , sir . PRINCESS ANNE Now we can hear what happened . Go on , Freddie . p. 45 KING ERIC VIII ( Rising ) . Here you are , Phipps . ( He hands PHIPPS a bank-note ) . PHIPPS Thank you sir  --  ( He puts away the checker-board , and goes out ) . PRINCESS ANNE You must listen , father . Freddie has some exciting news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granton ? I believe you made some mention of Parliament . FREDERICK GRANTON I did , sir . General Northrup made a long speech and demanded that , in view of the present emergency , Parliament should declare a state of martial law ! KING ERIC VIII Martial law ? FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir . Then Birten offered a resolution to that effect with the proviso that Northrup be proclaimed dictator , with absolute power . KING ERIC VIII ( Alarmed ) . You do n't mean it ! What did the Liberals have to say to that ? FREDERICK GRANTON Doctor Fellman spoke for them and said that such a measure , if passed , would constitute an open declaration of war between the right wing and the left . He said that his people would n't stand for it . p. 46 KING ERIC VIII Good for Fellman . FREDERICK GRANTON Then Northrup spoke again . KING ERIC VIII At length , I presume . FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir  --  at great length . He shouted that if the opposition was ready for war , then so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  prepared to sweep every street in the city with rifle and machine-gun fire  --  that the fleet is lying in the harbor , with its guns trained on the tenement districts where the radical sympathy is strongest . He pounded the table with his first when he said it ! KING ERIC VIII Had any one the presence of mind to pound him ? FREDERICK GRANTON It 's a crisis , sir . I 'm very much afraid that the mobs will break loose tonight . PRINCESS ANNE ( Fearfully excited ) . It 's the revolution ! I knew it would come ! ( She goes back to the window and draws the curtains ) . KING ERIC VIII And Northrup is dictator . With his army , and his big guns  --  he 'll butcher them , Granton . FREDERICK GRANTON Judging from what he said in Parliament , sir , he is going to show no mercy . He 's determined to wipe them out . p. 47 KING ERIC VIII Have these poor people any way of defending themselves ? FREDERICK GRANTON I imagine that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutionists will outnumber the regular army . KING ERIC VIII There 'll be a nice slaughter on both sides . Go over to the War-office , Granton . Find out what 's happening  --  what their plans are  --  and hurry back . FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir . ( He goes out . The KING sits wearily ) . PRINCESS ANNE ( Consolingly ) . Never mind , father . Mother will be home in a few days and then we 'll see who 's the dictator . KING ERIC VIII Thank God your mother is n't here now . She 'd be more ruthless than Northrup himself . PRINCESS ANNE Father ! KING ERIC VIII Yes . PRINCESS ANNE Do you realize that our chance has come ? KING ERIC VIII Whose chance ? PRINCESS ANNE Mine  --  and Freddie 's . This revolution will make it possible for us to get away . KING ERIC VIII No  --  no  --  you must n't think of that , now . There 's too much disturbance as it is. p. 48 PRINCESS ANNE ( Talking very rapidly ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . But they have watched me too closely . Ever since they announced that rotten engagement I 've had an escort wherever I 've gone . But tonight  --  tonight they have forgotten to worry about me  --  ( She sits down by the KING . ) KING ERIC VIII They have enough to worry about  --  and so have I. PRINCESS ANNE ( Pressing him ) . But this is our last chance . My wedding is supposed to be next week . If I do n't get away now , I never will . KING ERIC VIII ( Rising ) . Anne  --  there is the imminent danger of shooting in the streets . Out in the harbor an imposing array of every expensive naval artillery is bursting with impatience . The fate of our country trembles in the balance . This is no time to talk about love . PRINCESS ANNE ( Also rising and confronting him ) . I do n't care what 's happening . The army and navy can shoot their heads off , if they want to . I 'm going  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop me  --  ( Her eyes flash with defiance ) . You would n't dare . p. 49 KING ERIC VIII ( Turning away from her ) . Sometimes , my dear , you remind me of your mother . ( There is the sound , from the distance , of rifle and machine-gun fire  --  very faint , at first ) . KING ERIC VIII Listen ! It 's started ! ( Both of them rush to the windows and look out ) . PRINCESS ANNE I can see the flashes ! KING ERIC VIII It 's down beyond the cathedral . I suppose they 've taken up positions along the esplanade . PRINCESS ANNE The revolutionists must be heading straight for here . Oh  --  do you suppose they have a chance against the army ? KING ERIC VIII They may have a chance . PRINCESS ANNE How thrilling it would be if the mob should break through ! KING ERIC VIII It would be the last thrill we 'd ever experience . PRINCESS ANNE Now come , father . You 've got to admit that you secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps I do . Poor devils ! PRINCESS ANNE Father , look ! There are soldiers up on the roof of the War-office . They 've got a searchlight. p. 50 KING ERIC VIII That will be useful . PRINCESS ANNE Oh  --  I wish they 'd come closer so that we can really see what 's happening . KING ERIC VIII Perhaps if we spoke about it to General Northrup he 'd arrange it . PRINCESS ANNE And look down there  --  there 's a fire started ! KING ERIC VIII It 's the Continental Bank Building . They must be advancing . PRINCESS ANNE They are advancing ! KING ERIC VIII By Jove  --  they must be putting up a great fight . PRINCESS ANNE They are  --  they are ! I know it ! Hooray for the revolutionists . Hooray ! Hooray ! KING ERIC VIII Hooray ! Hooray ! Look here  --  we 're a fine pair of lunatics . Those people are bent on our destruction . ( He and ANNE look nervously about the room to make sure that they have n't been caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , father . But it is frightfully exciting , now is n't it ? ( They turn again to the window ) . KING ERIC VIII Well  --  yes . It is , rather . ( GRANTON bursts in ) . p. 51 FREDERICK GRANTON The fighting has started , Your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII Oh , I 'm so glad you warned us . PRINCESS ANNE We 've been listening to it , Freddie , and cheering our heads off . KING ERIC VIII I do hope no one heard us . FREDERICK GRANTON ( Joining them at the window ) . The revolutionists broke through the first line of barricades on the esplanade , and are trying to set fire to the city . Northrup has concentrated his machine-guns in front of the Ritz . KING ERIC VIII Is Northrup on the firing-line ? FREDERICK GRANTON No , sir . General Northrup is at the War-office . KING ERIC VIII ( Coming down to the desk ) . We 'd better all of us go right over to the War-office . That unquestionably is the safest place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over , making a ring about the government buildings . Northrup has just issued a warning to the revolutionist leaders , telling them that if they do n't withdraw at once , the naval guns will start shelling . KING ERIC VIII But he ca n't do that . Those guns could destroy half the city in a few minutes . p. 52 FREDERICK GRANTON General Northrup seems to consider it advisable to take drastic action , sir . ( MAJOR BLENT comes in ) . MAJOR BLENT ( Saluting ) . I 'm sorry to disturb Your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII What is it , Major ? MAJOR BLENT We 're taking measures to defend the palace , sir . There might be unexpected developments . KING ERIC VIII Go ahead with it . You wo n't disturb me . MAJOR BLENT Very good , sir . ( He goes back to the door and holds open the curtains . ) Come on , you men . Look lively ! ( TWO SOLDIERS come in , carrying sand-bags . They deposit these by the nearest window , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting nearer . Look at those soldiers . They 're putting machine-guns right in front of the palace . MAJOR BLENT ( Ominously ) . Your Highness must not stand in that window ! PRINCESS ANNE But I want to watch . FREDERICK GRANTON No , Anne , you must n't stay there . ( He drags her down into the room , then closes the windows and draws the curtains . The noise of the battle becomes much fainter . Throughout the ensuing scenes , there are spasmodic bursts of rifle and machine-gun fire , dimly audible . At intervals , bugle-calls and shrill whistle-blasts are heard . Batteries of artillery rumble past the palace . There is , occasionally , the drum beat of marching men. ) p. 53 KING ERIC VIII ( Surveying the sand-bags ) . What are these things ? ( PHIPPS and PETLEY come in with more sand-bags , then go out . ) MAJOR BLENT Sand-bags , sir . They make a rather good protection , sir , against stray bullets . ( The TWO SOLDIERS return with another load . ) KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this palace with sand-bags ? MAJOR BLENT General Northrup 's orders , sir . ( PETLEY and PHIPPS come in with more sand-bags . ) KING ERIC VIII I am most grateful to General Northrup for this display of concern for my safety . Phipps ! Petley ! Take these things out of here . I refuse to have my apartments messed up with sand-bags . ( PETLEY and PHIPPS look surprised , but obey . ) MAJOR BLENT ( Saluting . ) Yes , sir . ( He calls out through the door to the SOLDIERS . ) Out with these sand-bags , you men . On the double ! ( The SOLDIERS hasten to do so . ) KING ERIC VIII Thank you , Major Blent . MAJOR BLENT Not at all , sir . Everything shall be as you wish , sir . p. 54 KING ERIC VIII Oh , will it ? Who told you that ? MAJOR BLENT ( Embarrassed . ) It  --  it goes without saying , sir . KING ERIC VIII Major , do you realize that General Northrup is now the dictator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , I do . KING ERIC VIII You are commander of the palace-guard , are n't you ? MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir . KING ERIC VIII Supposing General Northrup were to give you an order , and I were to countermand it which of us would you obey ? MAJOR BLENT ( With no show of oratorical display . ) General Northrup may be the dictator , sir . But in this palace we know only one supreme authority , sir . It is Your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII Thank you , Major . ( He shakes hands with BLENT . ) I 'm very glad to have you around . MAJOR BLENT ( Still more embarrassed . ) Thank you , sir . And may I go now , sir ? KING ERIC VIII Yes , Major , you may go .

Are we going to run away ? KING ERIC VIII You are going to run away . FREDERICK GRANTON But that 's impossible , sir . Her Highness must n't go alone . KING ERIC VIII No , Granton  --  you 're going with her . FREDERICK GRANTON Oh , I could n't do that , sir . KING ERIC VIII You wanted your chance to escape . Well  --  here it is .

FREDERICK GRANTON But I do n't understand , sir . What do you want me to do ? KING ERIC VIII You 're to marry my daughter . Do you understand that ? Then you 're to write or paint or something , and you 're to have babies  --  and I forget what else . ( PHIPPS enters . ) PHIPPS General Northrup , to see Your Majesty .

FREDERICK GRANTON I can take it to him , sir . GENERAL NORTHRUP Never mind . It makes no difference , anyway . I suppose His Majesty does n't care to be annoyed with such matters just now .

Here , give this to the King . FREDERICK GRANTON Yes , sir . ( NORTHRUP selects a cigar from the silver box on the KING 'S desk . GRANTON , noting this , is highly indignant . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP Get me the Admiralty office . Lord Ennil there ? This is GENERAL NORTHRUP ! Yes ! Oh , Ennil  --  are the ships ready to go into action ? Good . About fifteen minutes from now , by the looks of things . That 'll be all . ( He hangs up . ) ( PHIPPS comes in .

You seem to be in full possession . GENERAL NORTHRUP The King has gone to his room . He 's hiding under the bed , I suppose . well , it 's the best place for him . LORD BIRTEN And how goes the battle ? GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Jerking his thumb toward the window . ) Do n't speak of that farce as a battle . LORD BIRTEN I gather that we 're winning . ( He goes back to the window and looks out . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP We 're taking the opportunity to perform some of those executions that His Majesty has been so reluctant to countenance . Birten  --  this is the best thing that could have happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But they seem to be gaining ground . GENERAL NORTHRUP Of course they are . We want ' em to . The plan is to let them get as far as the Cathedral square , and then we 'll open up on ' em with everything we 've got . LORD BIRTEN Who 's leading them  --  Fellman ? GENERAL NORTHRUP No ! Not that half-baked pink college professor . Him and his theories ! ( BIRTEN sits . ) Laker 's commanding the revolutionists . Laker 's a real man  --  even if he is a dirty Anarchist . ( He presses a bell-button on the desk . ) LORD BIRTEN I hope you get it over with soon . The noise down there is simply terrific . I do n't expect to get a wink of sleep tonight . GENERAL NORTHRUP We wo n't quit till we 've made a clean job of it . ( BLENT comes in . NORTHRUP hands him some papers . ) Here  --  rush these to the War-office . MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir . ( He salutes and goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's no recurrence of this . His Highness , Prince William of Greck , arrives next Thursday for the wedding , and I 'm told he 's a very nervous young man . p. 61 GENERAL NORTHRUP We 'll make the country entirely safe for Prince William of Greck . All he has to do here , anyway , is get married and then get out . ( PETLEY enters . ) PETLEY His Majesty , the King . ( Both rise as the KING comes in . NORTHRUP takes off his cap and lays it on the desk . ) KING ERIC VIII Good evening , gentlemen . BIRTEN AND NORTHRUP Your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII Northrup , I beg to congratulate you on your new eminence . GENERAL NORTHRUP Thank you , sir . KING ERIC VIII ( Seeing the cigar in NORTHRUP 'S hand ) . Wo n't you have a cigar ? ( NORTHRUP waves the cigar . ) Oh  --  you have one . Good ! GENERAL NORTHRUP Did you get my note , sir ? KING ERIC VIII I did . GENERAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ships are ready to start shelling . KING ERIC VIII Look here , Northrup . You ca n't do that , you know . GENERAL NORTHRUP Do what ? p. 62 KING ERIC VIII This shelling business . GENERAL NORTHRUP Why not ? KING ERIC VIII It would be disastrous . Those guns would do incalculable damage . GENERAL NORTHRUP We mean them to . KING ERIC VIII You mean to kill tens of thousands of women and children and destroy their homes ? GENERAL NORTHRUP We 've given them fair warning . I issued an ultimatum allowing them half an hour in which to lay down their arms and surrender . KING ERIC VIII And what was their answer to that ? GENERAL NORTHRUP They said they 'd never give in until we were ready to submit this whole labor question to impartial arbitration . KING ERIC VIII And why not ? GENERAL NORTHRUP Do you suppose I 'd arbitrate with that rabble ? ( He snorts . ) I 'd as soon arbitrate with a pack of mangy curs . KING ERIC VIII I can appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval guns are not to go into action . ( He sits down on the settee . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP I regret to say , sir , that I must be allowed to handle this crisis as I see fit . I took the trouble to advise you of my plans merely as a matter of courtesy . p. 63 KING ERIC VIII I am overcome with gratitude . LORD BIRTEN I do n't think you quite understand the gravity of this situation , sir ; whereas General Northrup is throughly conversant with all the intricate details of the present predicament . KING ERIC VIII So I gather . GENERAL NORTHRUP I do n't want to seem brusque with you , sir . But sometimes frankness pays . The fact of the matter is that I 'm running this show and I intend to run it in my own way . ( He thumps the table with his fist . ) KING ERIC VIII You 're quite right , Northrup . Frankness does pay , sometimes , and while we 're in this delightfully confessional mood , I should like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you planning to set up a republic ? GENERAL NORTHRUP Sir ! LORD BIRTEN Your Majesty ! I can state with absolute authority that . KING ERIC VIII You have bullied your way into the dictatorship , thereby making me more of a cipher than ever . Your next step , obviously , is the presidency . When do you expect to take that step ? GENERAL NORTHRUP Sir ! I resent that insinuation . I resent it bitterly . p. 64 KING ERIC VIII That was not an insinuation , Northrup . It was a fairly direct statement . GENERAL NORTHRUP Whatever it was , I resent it . Do you class me with these despicable Anarchists these enemies of law and order ? I tell you , sir , the monarchy will survive as long as I do . The crown will remain supreme , inviolate , as long as I am spared to fight in Your Majesty 's defense . KING ERIC VIII Very well put , Northrup . But what will you accomplish by keeping the crown supreme , inviolate ? What good is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol  --  an emblem  --  and the people of this country are so ignorant , so backward , that they must have symbols . KING ERIC VIII In other words , as long as I 'm on hand to wave the emblem , you and your party will remain in power . If I were thrown out , you 'd be thrown out , too . GENERAL NORTHRUP The mob could never be expected to display any intelligence . ( There is a whining sound , followed by a terrific explosion outside . The curtains on one of the windows are bellied out , and there is a clatter of broken glass . ) LORD BIRTEN What was that ? GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Rushing to the window ) . It 's the field-artillery . They 're shooting the wrong way . ( BLENT comes in , greatly perturbed. ) p. 65 MAJOR BLENT The revolutionists , sir . They 've captured the field-pieces in front of the Cathedral . GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Aghast . ) What infernal stupidity . KING ERIC VIII Has something gone wrong with your plans , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll break a few colonels for this ! ( There is another violent explosion outside . ) KING ERIC VIII You know  --  I have an idea that they 're aiming at us . GENERAL NORTHRUP We 'll soon stop this nonsense . ( He starts to go . ) KING ERIC VIII You wo n't forget what I said about the naval guns , will you , General ? GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Snappily . ) I 'll do whatever is necessary . ( He salutes and goes out . ) LORD BIRTEN ( Nervously . ) I  --  I think I 'd better be over at the Foreign office , sir . KING ERIC VIII By all means , Birten . I recommend the cellar . ( BIRTEN bows , and hurries out. ) p. 66 MAJOR BLENT You must n't stay here , sir . This is a very dangerous place for you to be , sir . KING ERIC VIII ( Rising . ) Listen to me , Blent . You 've assured me of your loyalty , and I think I can count on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the Princess Anne to get out of this . I 'm sending her to Stanage . Granton will escort her  --  and I want you to go along , to see that they get safely to the yacht . MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir . KING ERIC VIII Go down now and get a car . Have it at the Quint Street gate  --  with a good driver . MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir . KING ERIC VIII And you are to be absolutely silent about this  --  now and hereafter . Do you understand ? MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir , I do . KING ERIC VIII Then get on with it , quickly . MAJOR BLENT But you must n't stay here , sir . The shelling is apt to become more KING ERIC VIII Never mind the shelling . Get that car ready . MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir . ( He salutes and goes out . There is another shell-burst close at hand . ANNE and GRANTON come in . ANNE is dressed for travelling and is very pale. ) p. 67 KING ERIC VIII The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to start at once . PRINCESS ANNE What were those explosions ? KING ERIC VIII Shells , my dear . It seems that the revolutionists captured our artillery when General Northrup was n't looking . PRINCESS ANNE And they 're trying to shell the palace ? KING ERIC VIII So it would seem . ( ANNE crosses over , takes her hat off and carelessly tosses it on the settee . ) What are you doing , Anne ? PRINCESS ANNE I 'm taking my hat off . KING ERIC VIII But you 've got to go  --  at once ! PRINCESS ANNE ( She looks at the KING . ) Do you think I 'd go now ? KING ERIC VIII ( Coming close to her . ) My darling girl  --  you must go . It 's a wonderful chance . You must n't lose it . ( ANNE puts her arms about the KING 'S neck . ) PRINCESS ANNE It looks as though the revolution is going to win , father . They 're going to get us . We want to be here together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne . p. 68 PRINCESS ANNE I ca n't help you , father . I ca n't be of any use whatever . But I 'm going to stay  --  because I love you  --  because I want to be with you when  --  when ( The KING kisses her , tenderly , then walks away . ) KING ERIC VIII I suppose there 's nothing left for me to do but burst into tears . ( There is another shell-burst , louder than any of the previous ones . Some of the ceiling falls in , with a cloud of powered mortar . ) KING ERIC VIII ( Looking upward at the gaping hole in the ceiling . ) That one seems to have landed in the Queen 's room . PRINCESS ANNE Oh  --  this is better fun than eloping . KING ERIC VIII Granton , I should take that remark as a distinct reflection on your abilities as a fun-maker . FREDERICK GRANTON ( Smiling . ) You ought to be proud of her , sir . KING ERIC VIII I am proud of her ! Anne  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRINCESS ANNE Oh , bosh , father ! Do n't turn sentimental , or I will leave . ( BLENT comes in. ) p. 69 MAJOR BLENT We 're ready to start , sir . KING ERIC VIII There 's been a slight change of plans , Blent . We sha n't need the car . MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir . ( He starts to go . ) KING ERIC VIII Send Phipps in . MAJOR BLENT I 'm sorry , sir . We 're using all the servants down below building barricades . We needed every man we could find . ( A SOLDIER comes in and says something in an undertone to BLENT , who is obviously disturbed . BLENT and the SOLDIER go out . ) PRINCESS ANNE What did you want Phipps for ? Whatever it is , I 'll do it . KING ERIC VIII Go down to the pantry and get about a dozen bottles of champagne and bring them here . It seems to me that the time has come for us all to get gloriously drunk . PRINCESS ANNE Oh , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in again . He is evidently excited . ) MAJOR BLENT Your Majesty ! Doctor Fellman is here . KING ERIC VIII Doctor Fellman ? FREDERICK GRANTON Fellman ? p. 70 MAJOR BLENT He wants to speak to you . He insists that he must . PRINCESS ANNE Do n't see him , father . He  --  he might . KING ERIC VIII Bring him in , Blent . ( BLENT goes out . ) Anne , you and Granton get that champagne . FREDERICK GRANTON I 'd better stay here , sir . KING ERIC VIII Do as I tell you . Get the champagne  --  and plenty of it . Fellman might need a drink , too . ( ANNE and GRANTON go out . BLENT comes in and holds wide the curtains for FELLMAN to enter . He pauses on the threshold and looks about the room , observing the wreckage with particular interest . ) KING ERIC VIII Come in , Doctor Fellman . DR . FELLMAN ( Indicating BLENT . ) Is the body-guard to see me . KING ERIC VIII I must apologize for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now . DR . FELLMAN ( indicating BLENT . ) Is the body-guard absolutely essential , sir ? I am not armed . KING ERIC VIII You may go , Blent . ( BLENT goes out , rather reluctantly . The KING sits down at the desk . ) Now , Fellman , to what are we indebted and so forth ? p. 71 DR . FELLMAN This is a rather ugly situation , sir . KING ERIC VIII I am aware of that . DR . FELLMAN A great many lives are being lost tonight , sir  --  needlessly lost . Otherwise I should not have risked my own life to come here . ( There is another shell-burst . ) KING ERIC VIII I commend your courage , Fellman . But I do n't quite see why your people are so anxious to better down the palace . You know , you 'll want to use it , eventually  --  for a museum , or something . DR . FELLMAN There 's more than the palace in danger of destruction tonight , sir . There 's the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak quite frankly ? KING ERIC VIII Oh , Lord , no . I  --  I 'm accustomed to frankness by now . DR . FELLMAN Then I want to tell you , sir , that this revolution is insane , criminal folly ! KING ERIC VIII You realize that , do you ? Then what is the reason for it ? DR . FELLMAN Desperation , sir . Do you know what that means ? Do you know what it is that makes normal , sensible people go mad and start butchering each other ? I see you do n't . You , sir , have never come in contact with reality . You 've lived your quiet , detached life here in this palace ; no one has ever told you the truth . p. 72 KING ERIC VIII No one , Fellman , ever bothers to waste his time telling me anything . DR . FELLMAN Have you never realized , sir , that it might be well to find things out for yourself ? ( He waves his hand in the general direction of the revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class hatred , among your people . Have you ever done anything to relieve them ? KING ERIC VIII I 'm afraid you do n't understand the exact nature of my position , Fellman . ( He rises . ) DR . FELLMAN I understand , sir , that you are the ruler of this nation . KING ERIC VIII That 's just where you 're wrong , Fellman . I am not the ruler . I am only the King . DR . FELLMAN Are you satisfied , sir , that you have been a good king ? KING ERIC VIII I have always been prompted at all ceremonies and official functions . My public speeches have been brief and in perfect taste . I have appeared presentable on dress-parade . My home life has been above reproach . What else could I have done to fulfill my obligations to the people ? DR . FELLMAN ( Facing the KING . ) You could have prevented them from being driven to despair . p. 73 KING ERIC VIII I could have done that ? You have an exaggerated estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . In that time I have been taught to keep my place . DR . FELLMAN And while you have been keeping your place , your people , whom you are supposed to govern and protect , have been done to death by bureaucrats , demagogues , and politicians in general . KING ERIC VIII The people have the power to vote . Why do n't they use it ? Why do n't they throw Northrup out and put you in ? DR . FELLMAN There has n't been a general election in seven years . KING ERIC VIII Why not ? DR . FELLMAN There ca n't be a general election until Parliament authorizes it  --  and Northrup controls Parliament . Northrup knows he 'd be beaten if he ever put it to a vote . KING ERIC VIII ( With a trace of impatience . ) Then what 's to be done about it ? DR . FELLMAN The issue , sir , is up to you . KING ERIC VIII It 's not up to me . I 'm not supposed to meddle in the State 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamental one at that . ( There is a slight pause. ) p. 74 DR . FELLMAN ( Gravely . ) Then , sir , in behalf of the people  --  I demand your abdication . KING ERIC VIII ( Amazed at this request . ) My abdication ! What could be accomplished by that ? DR . FELLMAN It would mean a new deal for all of us , sir  --  a chance at a fair deal . KING ERIC VIII Do you imagine that Northrup would be more tractable if I were gone ? DR . FELLMAN The army and a large portion of the population are devoted to you , sir . KING ERIC VIII Devoted to me ? DR . FELLMAN To the monarchic tradition . KING ERIC VIII Ah ! DR . FELLMAN Northrup knows that  --  and he also knows what would happen to that devotion if you were n't here to command it  --  ( From the distance come the thunderous detonations of many big guns . The KING and FELLMAN turn to the window . ) The naval guns ! They 've opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Desperately . ) Now the murder will start . Now you will see what your quiet , peaceable reign has come to . ( During this speech , the KING has gone to the desk and picked up the telephone . FELLMAN paces up and down. ) p. 75 KING ERIC VIII Put me through to the Admiralty Yes . Hello I want to speak to Lord Ennil . This is the King speaking the King this is the King What ? It 's spelled K-I-N-G  --  King Yes , thank you so much Hello , Ennil . Those guns must be stopped I do n't care who ordered you to fire . Send out a wireless message at once Yes , to the entire fleet On my authority at once ! Yes ( He hangs up . ) That may be known in history as the final act of His Majesty , King Eric VIII , last of a long line of nonentities . ( The telephone rings . The KING picks it up . ) Yes Oh , yes , Ennil I was the one No  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs up  --  then turns to FELLMAN . Now  --  Fellman , it 's your turn ) . DR . FELLMAN To do what , sir ? KING ERIC VIII To cease firing  --  to declare an armistice . DR . FELLMAN An armistice will do no good . This country must have permanent peace . KING ERIC VIII We can find no way to permanent peace while those fools are shooting at each other . p. 76 DR . FELLMAN They 'll stop shooting soon enough  --  because they 'll be none of them left . Northrup will see to that . He brought this whole thing on , sir  --  deliberately  --  so that he could turn his machine-guns on the rabble . ( During the foregoing speech the sound of the naval guns has died out . ) KING ERIC VIII Then for heaven 's sake tell the rabble to go to their homes . DR . FELLMAN And be destroyed by your naval guns ! KING ERIC VIII The naval guns have been called off . DR . FELLMAN Yes  --  they 're silent for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the homes of the defenseless poor . How long will they remain silent ? How long will it be before this fearful hatred again explodes ? I warn you , sir ; if you want to save your country from anarchy and chaos , you must abdicate  --  and you must do it at once ! KING ERIC VIII Fellman  --  my abdication will have to be a subject for discussion at some other time  --  under less hysterical circumstances . At the moment , there is only one thing to be done . The revolutionists must be made to surrender . DR . FELLMAN On what grounds , sir ? p. 77 KING ERIC VIII On the grounds of common decency and humanity and good sense . DR . FELLMAN Can we expect any of those things from Northrup ? Can we expect anything from him but violent reprisals ? KING ERIC VIII There will be no attempt at reprisals . But you 'll have to take my word for it . DR . FELLMAN I accept your word , sir . KING ERIC VIII Thank you , Fellman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING extends his hand , and they shake . BLENT comes in . ) MAJOR BLENT I thought you would want to know , sir , that General Northrup is on the way up . KING ERIC VIII He is , eh ? Fellman , you 'll have to go at once . I do n't know how you got here  --  but you must go back the same way , as fast as possible . DR . FELLMAN I shall , sir . KING ERIC VIII Blent , you will escort Doctor Fellman as far as is necessary . MAJOR BLENT Yes , sir . DR . FELLMAN Good-bye , Your Majesty  --  and thank you . KING ERIC VIII Good-bye , Fellman . And I should prefer to have this conversation kept a secret  --  particularly from our mutual friend who is on the way up . ( The roar of NORTHRUP 'S voice is heard from the right , shouting , " I 'll see him myself . " ) You 'd better go out that way . ( He points to the left . FELLMAN and BLENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is the prefatory whine of an approaching shell . He jumps quickly away from the window and flattens himself against the wall as the shell bursts outside . NORTHRUP stamps in . ) Oh , hello , General . How 's the artillery ? ( This time , NORTHRUP neglects to remove his hat. ) p. 78 GENERAL NORTHRUP Did you give the order for the naval guns to cease firing ? KING ERIC VIII I did . GENERAL NORTHRUP I 've come here to tell you that that 's the last order you 'll give out . KING ERIC VIII ( Sitting at the desk . ) You do n't have to tell me that , Northrup . In fact , oddly enough , I commented on that very thing at the time . GENERAL NORTHRUP I do n't care what you commented on or did n't comment on . I want you to understand that I 'm in charge here , and I wo n't have any interference from you or any one else ! KING ERIC VIII I beg pardon , Northrup  --  but do you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NORTHRUP leans over the desk and shouts directly in the KING 'S face . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP We 're talking now as man to man  --  and we can omit the formalities . I do n't like to do this . I have as much reverence for the sanctity of the crown as any one . But you 've forced this issue by meddling in my affairs and I wo n't stand for it ! ( He picks up the telephone . ) Get me the Admiralty at once . The battle-ships will resume firing ! ( This last to the KING . ) ( The KING stands up and snatches the telephone away from NORTHRUP. ) p. 79 KING ERIC VIII The battle-ships will not resume firing . GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Ominously . ) I warned you not to interfere with me ! KING ERIC VIII I 've given my orders to the fleet . Those orders stand . GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Hotly . ) I 'm the one to give orders to the navy  --  not you . I 'm the dictator , by act of Parliament . KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . GENERAL NORTHRUP The grace of God ! Do n't use that catch-phrase on me ! It 's all very well to impress the public with it  --  but you know , and I know , that you 're the King by grace of me , and my army  --  and you 'll be King only as long as I and my army are on hand to keep you on the throne ! ( The KING puts the telephone down on the desk . ) KING ERIC VIII Northrup , I 'm fed up with you and your army . I 'm fed up with your oratory , and your bombast , and your flag-waving patriotism ; I 'm even becoming a little fed up with your personal appearance . GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Livid ) . Your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII You need n't mention my majesty . That 's another catch phrase , used only to fool the gulible public . We 're omitting all that buncombe now , Northrup . At your suggestion , we 're talking as man to man . Very well  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to God the revolutionists win ! p. 80 GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Aghast ) . You 're a contemptible traitor ! KING ERIC VIII ( Smiling ) . Perhaps that 's it , Northrup . Perhaps I 've been a traitor all my life . In that case I do n't deserve to be king . Furthermore , I do n't want to be king . If my throne has to be supported by you and your army , then I do n't want to sit on it any longer ! GENERAL NORTHRUP I suppose I am to interpret that as a demand for my resignation . KING ERIC VIII Yes , Northrup , that would be a fairly accurate interpretation . ( The telephone rings . The KING answers it . ) Hello yes yes It 's the War-office for you , General Northrup . GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Taking the telephone ) . Thank you . Yes what ! Fellman ? Yes yes the cowards yes I 'll be right over .

Doctor Fellman  --  the eminent college professor , who was going to reform our government . My army was too much for him . He is at the War-office now . p. 81 KING ERIC VIII Have they ceased firing ? GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Still scornful ) . He has issued the order , on condition that we arbitrate the matter . ( His tone changes . ) We 've whipped the dogs into a state of submission , and now they come cringing and whining for sympathy . KING ERIC VIII You will arbitrate with them , of course . GENERAL NORTHRUP Oh , we 'll arbitrate , right enough  --  with machine-guns . ( He turns to go out . ) KING ERIC VIII Your resignation , I take it , is withdrawn . GENERAL NORTHRUP ( With a sardonic flourish ) . I realize I can still be of service to my country . Under the circumstances , therefore , I can not possibly bring myself to resign . KING ERIC VIII Whether you resign or not , Northrup , this matter will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING ERIC VIII By me . GENERAL NORTHRUP Oh  --  by you ! KING ERIC VIII Yes  --  and I do n't need your army or your hand-picked parliament . I have another form of power on my side . p. 82 GENERAL NORTHRUP What power , may I ask ? KING ERIC VIII The people . GENERAL NORTHRUP Are you referring to the loyal subjects who have just been shelling your palace ? KING ERIC VIII I am referring to those backward , ignorant fools who are impressed by catch phrases and symbols . ( ANNE and GRANTON come in , carrying glasses and champagne bottles . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP ( Laughing ) . Go ahead , sir . Use the people for all they 're worth . But first be entirely sure they are on your side . ( He salutes and goes out . ) PRINCESS ANNE What was he bellowing about ? KING ERIC VIII He was just putting me in my place . PRINCESS ANNE Oh  --  do n't let him bother you , father . What you need is some champagne . ( They deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open a bottle . ) KING ERIC VIII The revolution is over . PRINCESS ANNE What ? KING ERIC VIII Yes  --  they 're given in  --  and Northrup has graciously decided not to resign . p. 83 PRINCESS ANNE Oh , shucks  --  now we have nothing to celebrate . FREDERICK GRANTON Northrup is becoming insufferably insolent , sir . Why , when he came in this evening he sat down at your desk as though he owned the place . KING ERIC VIII I know , Granton  --  but I talked back to him . Oh , yes  --  I was very brave . I told him I intended to appeal to the people . ( He looks up at the hole in the ceiling . ) The people ! PRINCESS ANNE They 'd be a lot of help . FREDERICK GRANTON And Doctor Fellman , sir  --  what did he say ? KING ERIC VIII I was instructed to abdicate . PRINCESS ANNE That 's it , father  --  abdicate . Get us all out of this mess . KING ERIC VIII And leave the country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that ? You know you 're helpless . Let Northrup and Fellman fight it out among themselves . They will anyway . ( The KING paces up and down followed by ANNE , who paces with him as she talks . ) Oh , what 's the sense of wasting our lives here any longer ? We 're of no use to them . They have nothing but contempt for us . All they care about is themselves  --  their grievances , their problems and their filthy politics . Let 's get out of here , father  --  let 's get out while we can . They do n't want us  --  and we certainly do n't want them . ( A shot is fired outside. ) p. 84 KING ERIC VIII ( Starting ) . Was that a cork ? FREDERICK GRANTON It sounded like a shot , sir . ( He goes to the window and looks out . ) PRINCESS ANNE Maybe it 's started again . KING ERIC VIII What was it , Granton ? FREDERICK GRANTON I ca n't see , sir  --  there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Entering ) . Your Majesty ! An assassin has just made an attempt on General Northrup 's life  --  KING ERIC VIII An assassin ! MAJOR BLENT As the General was going down the palace steps , this man rushed from the crowd and fired pointblank . The bullet grazed the General 's cheek . ( BIRTEN rushes in , terribly agitated . He is followed by PHIPPS . ) LORD BIRTEN It 's a terrible thing , sir . A shocking thing ! There may be attacks like that on any of us at any time . KING ERIC VIII ( Genuinely disturbed ) . It 's worse than shocking , Birten . It 's stupid , idiotic . These men are asking for fair play  --  and they try to achieve it by resorting to murder . p. 85 FREDERICK GRANTON ( At the window ) . The crowd down there is in a terrible state of excitement . KING ERIC VIII I 'd better appear on the balcony . It might reassure them . LORD BIRTEN I would n't , sir . The temper of the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looks of them , sir . ( The KING starts for the balcony . ) PRINCESS ANNE Do n't go out there , father . Do n't do it ! Some one might try to assassinate you . KING ERIC VIII Do n't worry , Anne , I 'll be perfectly safe . If the revolutionists could n't hit Northrup at close range , they wo n't harm me . ( The KING steps out to the balcony and is greeted with a tremendous burst of cheers from below . He turns and smiles , first at ANNE , then at BIRTEN . The cheering swells into a gigantic roar. ) @x The scene is the same  --  a week having passed since the events of Act II . The damage done by the shells has been repaired . It is the day of ANNE 'S wedding , and there are several vases of flowers about . At the desk sits the QUEEN . Her two months ' tour of America has had no perceptible effect on her character or characteristics ; she is as vivid , as emphatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her usual determination . The two LADIES-IN-WAITING are standing at the left , waiting for orders . They glance nervously at each other , but neither dares to speak . The QUEEN , paying no attention to them , pushes the bell-button vigorously , then goes on with her writing . PHIPPS comes in . PHIPPS Did Your Majesty ring ? QUEEN MARTHA Tell the King I want to see him here at once . PHIPPS Very good , ma'am . ( He goes out . After a pause , the QUEEN looks up at the LADIES . ) QUEEN MARTHA Do you two ninnies propose to stand there forever  --  gaping and gawking ? FIRST LADY-IN-WAITING Why no , ma'am , we  --  SECOND LADY-IN-WAITING We 'll be glad to do anything , ma'am . p. 87 QUEEN MARTHA Then why not go do it ? ( The LADIES exchange glances . ) FIRST LADY-IN-WAITING Yes , ma'am , but I 'm afraid we do n't  --  SECOND LADY-IN-WAITING We do n't really know just what we 're to do  --  now . QUEEN MARTHA Oh , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended to around this palace , and you , between you , ca n't find one of them . SECOND LADY-IN-WAITING If you 'd make a suggestion , ma'am  --  QUEEN MARTHA Of course . It 's up to me to outline your duties for you . Do I have to attend to everything ? Do I ? Answer me that ! ( The FIRST LADY is about to speak , but the QUEEN cuts her off . ) Will the King so much as lift his little finger to help me ? Not he ! Will my daughter take the slightest interest in her own wedding ? She will not . Oh , no  --  all the work , all the responsibility , is left to me . If I were n't here to toil and slave , there would n't be any wedding . FIRST LADY-IN-WAITING Yes , ma'am . QUEEN MARTHA Go on up to Her Royal Highness 's apartments and make yourselves useful . BOTH LADIES Yes , ma'am . ( They curtsey and go out , gratefully .

If you have listened to as many stupid speeches as I have , you will know that all the future hopes and aspirations of two great nations are entrusted to us . The thought is revolting to you ; it is none too palatable to me . But the fact remains , we are about to be married  --  and we must make the most of it . PRINCESS ANNE ( Rigidly ) .

GENERAL NORTHRUP With that snippy young secretary of yours , sir  --  Frederick Granton . QUEEN MARTHA I do n't believe it !

KING ERIC VIII But he has n't been proved guilty of conspiracy . QUEEN MARTHA No proof is needed . I never trusted that sneak , anyway . LORD BIRTEN I have a suggestion to offer , ma'am . There is a tramp steamer that sails in an hour  --  for the west coast of South America . Its first stop is at the Panama Canal . Why not place Granton aboard that boat ? GENERAL NORTHRUP It would be safer to shoot him . We can afford to take no chances with that young fellow . QUEEN MARTHA General Northrup is right . Oh , the scoundrel  --  I could kill him myself .

And do n't forget , Northrup , old Mr. Granton is one of the principal contributors to your campaign funds . GENERAL NORTHRUP Oh , well  --  we 'll put him on the ship then . KING ERIC VIII I 'll write out the order of exile . ( The KING sits down at the desk , presses a bell-button , and starts to write . ) QUEEN MARTHA This is the crowning outrage ! To think that this has been going on , in this very palace , and that neither the King nor I should have known about it .

PHIPPS Very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING goes on , writing rapidly . ) QUEEN MARTHA I wonder who started this miserable , sordid affair . p. 110 KING ERIC VIII ( Looking up ) . What affair ? QUEEN MARTHA Between Anne and Granton . KING ERIC VIII It was n't an affair . It was a romance . ( He resumes his writing . ) QUEEN MARTHA I 'm certain it was all Anne 's fault . She trapped that poor , weak young man into it . LORD BIRTEN I think you 're unjust to Her Royal Highness , ma'am . Propinquity is the real cause . GENERAL NORTHRUP I recommended that Granton be removed from the palace months ago . QUEEN MARTHA It was probably too late , even then . KING ERIC VIII It 's invariably too late in a case like this . Old Mother Nature is always too quick for us . ( He signs his name with a flourish . BLENT comes in . ) There , Northrup . Will you countersign this and make it entirely legal ?

Calao , Captain Wicklet commanding .

It will contain full instructions . ( He hands the order to BLENT . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP And see that the prisoner is not put aboard until the last minute before sailing . I suggest that you remain with him , Major , till the ship is well out of the harbor . KING ERIC VIII Yes  --  Granton might be a good swimmer . LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLENT Yes , sir . QUEEN MARTHA If this prisoner escapes , the man or men responsible will be put to death . Do you hear that ? MAJOR BLENT Yes , ma'am . Will that be all ? KING ERIC VIII That will be all , Major . ( BLENT salutes and goes out . ) LORD BIRTEN Thank heaven we caught that in time . If the Princess had eloped at this moment , our nation would have been disgraced . p. 112 GENERAL NORTHRUP We 'd be the laughing-stock of the world . QUEEN MARTHA The blow would have finished me .

It might be a matter of importance . KING ERIC VIII ( Desperately ) . It is important . The anarchists are planning to throw bombs . QUEEN MARTHA Bombs ! At whom ? KING ERIC VIII At you  --  at me  --  at all of us . GENERAL NORTHRUP When ? KING ERIC VIII This morning . LORD BIRTEN What ! GENERAL NORTHRUP It is n't possible . My secret service knows everything . KING ERIC VIII Not quite everything , General . For instance , they are evidently not aware that the anarchists are determined to blow up the Cathedral during the wedding ceremony . GENERAL NORTHRUP I 'd like to see them try .

Is that dirty anarchist here too ? QUEEN MARTHA I wo n't have him in the palace ! KING ERIC VIII But he is in the palace , already . QUEEN MARTHA Then have him put out , at once ! KING ERIC VIII No , dear  --  we must talk to him , in a nice , friendly way . If we do n't , he and the rest of the anarchists will probably spoil all our plans for the wedding . QUEEN MARTHA What could they do to prevent the wedding ? KING ERIC VIII Well  --  they could assassinate Prince William of Greck , for one thing  --  thereby removing the bridegroom . GENERAL NORTHRUP I 'll have Fellman and Laker arrested . QUEEN MARTHA That 's it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I advise against that . Laker had to have my personal guarantee of immunity before Fellman could persuade him to come here . If that guarantee is violated , the bombs will burst with a vengeance . p. 115 LORD BIRTEN ( To the QUEEN ) I think , your Majesty , all things considered , we will do well to see these fellows  --  and  --  ah  --  and reason with them . KING ERIC VIII ( Humbly grateful ) . Thank you , Birten . QUEEN MARTHA Very well . I consent to see them  --  under protest . GENERAL NORTHRUP You 'd better let me do the talking . QUEEN MARTHA Thank you , General Northrup  --  but I think you can safely leave the situation in my hands . Bring them in , Phipps .

We must none of us be late . ( The KING sits at the desk . ) LAKER ( In a surprisingly resonant voice ) . Your Majesty knows the situation insofar as I and my party are concerned .

My secret service is on the alert to suppress any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not start the fighting at this early stage . We know about Laker 's threats , and Laker knows about your secret service .

LAKER I did n't come here to indulge in any nambypamby moderation . p. 117 GENERAL NORTHRUP Nor did I. This is no subject for polite , drawing-room discussion . You radicals are raising an issue that can be settled only on the field of action ! KING ERIC VIII There , you see , Laker . You and Northrup have a bond in common . GENERAL NORTHRUP I  --  have I a bond with a lawless regicide ? LAKER Or I with a blustering bureaucrat ? QUEEN MARTHA Perhaps I have something to say about all this .

( BIRTEN leans over to speak to the QUEEN , in an undertone , his words being about as follows : " You must watch these men , ma'am . They 're playing on His Majesty 's sympathies , and it is essential that you take a firm hand in dealing with them .

DR . FELLMAN Your acceptance of our voluntary surrender constituted an acceptance of our terms . QUEEN MARTHA What were those terms ? LAKER That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relieved ! ( BIRTEN goes over and conducts a whispered conversation with NORTHRUP . ) DR . FELLMAN ( To the KING ) The unemployment problem has not been relieved . You , General Northrup , have refused even to consider a council of arbitration . QUEEN MARTHA And quite right , too . All this talk about terms and conditions is nonsense . LAKER It is n't nonsense to the jobless men and women whose babies are starving . LORD BIRTEN I am quite certain that the government has every intention of settling this distressing situation as soon as  --  as soon as conditions permit . LAKER And when will that be ? Today ? Tomorrow ? Our people are dying : we ca n't wait . GENERAL NORTHRUP We can do nothing about unemployment until we have the money available . p. 119 DR . FELLMAN ( To the KING ) May I inquire what is being done with the loan of a hundred millions that has been negotiated in America ? QUEEN MARTHA I knew it ! You 're trying to rob our country of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to the QUEEN . ) LAKER The people must pay the interest . Some day they must pay the principal . They have a right to their share . ( He turns suddenly to the KING . ) Is that unreasonable , Your Majesty ? KING ERIC VIII ( Embarrassed ) . What ? Oh  --  I 'm so sorry . I 'm afraid I was n't listening . GENERAL NORTHRUP Pay no attention to them , sir . These reds always have plenty of fine theories at the tips of their tongues . But now we 're dealing with facts ! DR . FELLMAN What facts ? GENERAL NORTHRUP That I am in power . I control Parliament  --  and the army and navy . You ca n't beat me down with theories . LAKER I told you so , Fellman . We wasted our time coming here to talk to these tyrants . ( BIRTEN goes over again to consult , in an undertone , with NORTHRUP. ) p. 120 DR . FELLMAN Your Majesty  --  I have tried to bring this business to a sensible conclusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERIC VIII Look here , Northrup . Why not agree to arbitrate ? LORD BIRTEN Ah , but we 'll be only too glad to arbitrate  --  wo n't we , Northrup ? GENERAL NORTHRUP Oh , of course . We 'll be delighted to arbitrate ! LAKER When ? GENERAL NORTHRUP In due time . LAKER ( With unqualified hostility ) . We 've heard your promises before  --  and we do n't want any more of them . We demand a written guarantee  --  signed by the King . GENERAL NORTHRUP I do n't care to be dictated to by you , Laker  --  not just yet . ( The QUEEN nods , ungraciously . ) I shall arbitrate when I 'm entirely ready to do so  --  and on my own terms , not yours . DR . FELLMAN Then compromise is out of the question . LAKER We 'll show you our strength today . We 'll blow your crumbling monarchy into a thousand pieces . QUEEN MARTHA You ca n't be so base , so cowardly , as to take advantage of this wedding-day , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . p. 121 DR . FELLMAN This occasion , ma'am , is made to order for an Anarchist uprising . QUEEN MARTHA But every royal family in Europe is represented here today . The Emperor and Empress of Greck are here . LAKER They 'll have to take their chances , along with the rest of you . If any of you reach the Cathedral alive , it will be due to an oversight on our part . ( NORTHRUP advances to the desk and faces the embattled LAKER across it . The KING , seated between them , appears to be very much out of it . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP You have the impudence to threaten your Queen , you vermin . I 'll see to it that you 're the first to die . LAKER I expect to die . So does every one of my followers . We 're not afraid of death  --  we 've been too close to it  --  too long . ( He shakes his fist in NORTHRUP 'S face . ) But when we do fall , we 'll drag you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that , Your Majesties ? This is the way these rats arbitrate . ( To LAKER . ) Today we 'll settle this matter  --  once and for all  --  as it should be settled , by force ! And when we 've beaten you , do n't come crawling on hands and knees to surrender . There will be no talk of terms today . It will be a fight to the death ! p. 122 LAKER To the death ! ( He turns and starts toward the door . FELLMAN stops him . ) DR . FELLMAN Very well . ( He turns to the KING . ) Your Majesty , a great many people will be murdered in the streets today . LAKER ( To NORTHRUP ) And the blood guilt will be yours  --  GENERAL NORTHRUP I accept it  --  with thanks ! LAKER Come on , Fellman  --  we 've talked enough ! KING ERIC VIII Just one more moment , please . Northrup  --  you may be willing to accept the blame for my death , but I ca n't allow you to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather-bound volume which he had previously deposited on the desk . ) I have here a copy of an extremely rare volume . It 's the constitution of our country . ( NORTHRUP glances at BIRTEN and smiles . ) I dug it out of the library last night , and read it from cover to cover . It 's surprisingly interesting reading . LAKER I must ask you to excuse me , sir . I have a lot to attend to . KING ERIC VIII You must attend to me , Laker . I wo n't take up too much of your time as I say , I read the constitution and was particularly impressed by those passages which describe the duties and functions and powers of the King . ( He turns to a page in the book , marks it with his finger and then stands up . ) Northrup it is my command that Parliament be dissolved . p. 123 GENERAL NORTHRUP What ? KING ERIC VIII Parliament is dissolved . QUEEN MARTHA Have you gone completely mad ? GENERAL NORTHRUP You ca n't do that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He points to the clause . ) QUEEN MARTHA What 's happened to you ? KING ERIC VIII My dear , I have decided to give the royal prerogative some much-needed exercise . LORD BIRTEN But this , sir  --  with no Parliament  --  there can be no law , no order . The state ceases to exist . KING ERIC VIII Oh , no , it does n't , Birten . ( He taps his chest . ) I am the state ! GENERAL NORTHRUP I will not be a party to such idiocy . KING ERIC VIII You mean you resign ? GENERAL NORTHRUP I do . ( The KING takes a sheet of paper from the desk , dips a pen in ink , and hands them to NORTHRUP . ) KING ERIC VIII I 've had your resignation typewritten , Northrup  --  just in case you sign down here . ( The KING holds out the constitution , on which rests the sheet of paper , while NORTHRUP scrawls his signature . ) Thank you . ( The KING blows on the signature to dry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the Premiership . You will form a cabinet at once , and hold a general election for a new Parliament . If you can obtain a sufficient number of votes you will remain in power . That applies to you , too , Northrup . You will have the opportunity to regain control of the government  --  if you can persuade the people to support you . And if you do , I can assure you that the royal prerogative will be returned to its stable . p. 124 LORD BIRTEN ( To QUEEN ) Your Majesty must see that this is an insane mistake . GENERAL NORTHRUP If the fate of our country is intrusted to these destructive radicals . QUEEN MARTHA Northrup , it is high time you were taken down . Since Parliament proclaimed you dictator , you 've been insufferably arrogant . You seem to forget that in this , as in every well-ordered monarchy , the throne is supreme ! KING ERIC VIII There , Northrup . That 's that ! ( NORTHRUP marches across to the door , then turns . ) GENERAL NORTHRUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote my life to my country . KING ERIC VIII Well said , Northrup . As a soldier , you can do much to help us enforce the laws  --  the new laws . Good-day , General . ( NORTHRUP salutes , bows , and goes out . ) Good-day , Lord Birten . You 're out of office , too . LORD BIRTEN My services are always at Your Majesty 's command . KING ERIC VIII Thank you , Lord Birten  --  we can always find employment for a good diplomat . ( BIRTEN bows and goes out . The KING turns to FELLMAN and LAKER . ) Well  --  it worked . ( LAKER advances to the KING and grasps his hand . ) You both handled it very well . p. 125 LAKER Your Majesty ! Your people will bless you for this . They will never cease to honor your name . KING ERIC VIII Yes  --  thank you so much  --  but . DR . FELLMAN You are a king , sir  --  a real one . We 're proud of you . KING ERIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the Cathedral now . DR . FELLMAN We 'll make ourselves scarce . Good-bye , sir . LAKER Good-bye , sir . DR . FELLMAN ( Bowing to the Queen ) . Good-day , Your Majesty . ( LAKER also bows . The QUEEN , who has been sitting in stony silence , barely nods to them ; as they are backing out , awkwardly , she turns and speaks . ) QUEEN MARTHA I hope you realize , Doctor Fellman , that you owe your new position to the King and the constitution . DR . FELLMAN I do , ma'am . QUEEN MARTHA And you , Mr. Laker  --  do you realize it , too ? LAKER I do , ma'am . QUEEN MARTHA Do n't forget what has just happened to General Northrup . The same thing will happen to anyone who oversteps his authority . p. 126 DR . FELLMAN We understand , ma'am . ( They bow and go out . ) KING ERIC VIII Now  --  my dear , had n't we better be starting for the Cathedral ? QUEEN MARTHA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? KING ERIC VIII I wanted to save the wedding , dear . It seemed the only way to . QUEEN MARTHA Nobody had nay intention of throwing bombs  --  and you know it . You made the whole thing up . KING ERIC VIII ( Sheepishly ) . How did you guess that ? QUEEN MARTHA I am not a fool . KING ERIC VIII Well , I had to get rid of Northrup . We could n't allow him to go on . QUEEN MARTHA Yes , I sha n't complain about that . Northrup is gone  --  the supremacy of the throne is established  --  and I shall now be able to conduct this state without interference of any kind . KING ERIC VIII Yes , dear  --  I knew you 'd be pleased . ( A bugle-call is heard . The KING goes to the window and looks out . ) Now , really , my dear  --  we 're late already . You must start at once . p. 127 QUEEN MARTHA Is the cavalry escort ready ? KING ERIC VIII ( At the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do please hurry . QUEEN MARTHA Now remember  --  when you and Anne are driving through the crowded streets , and especially when you are walking up the aisle , I want you to appear radiantly happy . KING ERIC VIII We 'll be smiling brightly , my dear . ( The QUEEN sweeps out . The KING goes over to the desk and rings the bell . PHIPPS enters . ) PHIPPS Yes , Your Majesty . ( The KING sits and starts to scrawl a note . ) KING ERIC VIII ( As he writes ) . By the way , Phipps  --  what is the name of your son-in-law ? PHIPPS My son-in-law , sir ? KING ERIC VIII You know  --  the agriculturist . PHIPPS Oh , him , sir . I did n't know you remembered . The name is Walmoth , sir  --  Claude Walmoth . KING ERIC VIII I 'm going to try to divorce him from agriculture , Phipps , and give him a job as footman here in the palace . p. 128 PHIPPS ( Alarmed ) . Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such an appointment would be too far above his station . KING ERIC VIII I had that thought in mind . I intend to elevate him so far that he 'll be on the same social plane as his father-in-law and I want to teach you not to be such a darned snob . Here ! Take this note to Major Blent  --  as quickly as you can . It 's extremely important . PHIPPS Very good , sir . KING ERIC VIII Oh , Phipps . PHIPPS Yes , sir . KING ERIC VIII Does this Mr.  --  ah  --  Walmoth play checkers ? PHIPPS I believe he does , sir . KING ERIC VIII Good ! ( PHIPPS goes out . The KING goes over to the corner cabinet , takes out a brush and starts to tidy up his hair before a mirror . ANNE comes in . She is in her bridal gown , with flowing veil . She carries with her the KING 'S hat  --  the one with the long white feathers . ) I 'm just brushing up a bit . PRINCESS ANNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start . KING ERIC VIII Thank you , dear . I hate this hat . It always leaves a red ring around my forehead . Has your mother started ? p. 129 PRINCESS ANNE Yes  --  she 's leaving now , surrounded with cavalry . KING ERIC VIII You 're being terribly brave , are n't you , Anne ? PRINCESS ANNE Brave ! What else could I be ? I 'd gladly be the worst coward on earth if I had the chance . ( The KING takes both her hands in his . ) KING ERIC VIII My darling girl  --  wherever you go  --  whatever you do  --  I want you to remember that your father loves you . PRINCESS ANNE ( Snatching her hands away ) . Never mind all that . We 've got to go . We must n't keep them waiting . It would n't look right . We must never do anything , as long as we live , that does n't look right . ( She walks away from him . ) KING ERIC VIII You do blame me for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You once gave me a chance to escape  --  I know that . But it was only because you thought the throne was going to fall , anyway . Have you ever given me a chance since then ? Have you ever given me anything except advice  --  to be patient , to be cheerful , to be brave ? All right ! I 'm going to the Cathedral to be married . I 'm going through with it  --  every bit of it  --  and I never want to see you again , or mother or anyone else in this hateful , cruel place ! ( She turns away . BLENT enters ) p. 130 MAJOR BLENT He is here , your Majesty . KING ERIC VIII Bring him in . MAJOR BLENT ( Through the door ) . Come in . ( GRANTON comes in . He is followed by a SOLDIER , who carries a rifle with bayonet fixed . ) KING ERIC VIII The soldier can go , and send Phipps in . ( BLENT motions the SOLDIER to go out . ) FREDERICK GRANTON Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They rush into each other 's arms , and ANNE sobs bitterly on his shoulder . ) Do n't let them take me , Freddie . Kill them . Do anything . But do n't let them take me . ( PHIPPS enters . From the courtyard below , the faint strains of a military band are heard . ) KING ERIC VIII May I interrupt ? Will you please look this way ? Frederick  --  do you take this woman for your lawful wife  --  you do ? Anne  --  do you take this man for your lawful husband  --  you do ? Do you promise to love , honor and cherish  --  you do ! Do you promise to love , honor and obey  --  you do ! ( He snatches a ring from his own finger , touches GRANTON 'S hand with it , then places it on ANNE 'S finger . ) You wed her with this ring : you endow her with all your worldly goods . Let no man put asunder . As King , by the grace of God  --  as Lord Vicar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hereby pronounce you man and wife . Blent ! Give me that deportation order . ( BLENT hands him the paper . The KING writes something on it. ) p. 131 PRINCESS ANNE ( Utterly bewildered ) . Father ! What are you doing ? KING ERIC VIII I am adding the words " and wife " to Frederick Granton 's name . PRINCESS ANNE Are we married ? KING ERIC VIII You are . You have been joined legally by the head of the state , and spiritually by the head of the church . Blent  --  you and Phipps are the witnesses . ( ANNE sinks down on her knees by the desk and buries her face in her hands . ) PRINCESS ANNE ( Murmuring ) . Oh God  --  Oh God  --  Oh God ! KING ERIC VIII You will sail in a few minutes on the S.S. Calao for the Panama Canal . FREDERICK GRANTON Does the Queen know about this , sir ? KING ERIC VIII Not yet . PRINCESS ANNE Father , I ca n't forget the things I said . KING ERIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The memory of them will give me many merry laughs during the long winter evenings . Now get out , both of you . Blent will take you to the boat . FREDERICK GRANTON I 'd like to say something , sir  --  I  --  p. 132 KING ERIC VIII Do n't say it , Granton . You 'd only stammer . ( ANNE seizes her father in a fervent embrace and sobs hysterically . ) Good-bye , my darling . I 'll send the marriage license to you in Panama . Good-bye . Take her away from me , Granton . She 's mussing up my medals . ( The KING starts to lead her  --  or rather to drag her  --  toward the door . ) PRINCESS ANNE ( Still tearful ) . You 'll have to go to the Cathedral alone . What will you say to mother and Prince William and all the rest ? KING ERIC VIII I 'll be very firm ! I 'll let them know that I 'm the KING ! ( He literally pushes them out . BLENT goes out after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm overcoat . ( This last is called to ANNE through the door . The KING turns and looks across at PHIPPS , who responds with a glance that seems to say , " Now you 're in for it . " Then the KING walks slowly to the desk and puts on his hat , making a face as of one in pain as he does so . ) PHIPPS Will you be going to the Cathedral now , sir ? KING ERIC VIII ( Starting toward the door ) . Yes  --  I will be going to the Cathedral now . But I will be coming back , shortly . ( The KING goes out , bravely , but with a pronounced consciousness of impending doom )
