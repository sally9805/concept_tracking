White men have confidence that they can bluff a Chinaman . Perhaps that fact explains why Premier Count Stephen Bethlen of Hungary proceeded , last week , to bluff the League of Nations . He knew that the Acting President of the League Council is now , by alphabetical rotation , His Excellency Tcheng Loh , the Chinese Minister at Paris . <P> With this tall , gangling Celestial at the ' helm of the League , Count Bethlen dared , last week , to order destroyed the evidence in a case upon which the Council was expected to sit in judgment when it convenes in March . The case was that involving five carloads of machine gun parts , smuggled last December from Italy across Austria and into Hungary , where they arrived on New Year 's Day . This smugglery ( a flagrant violation of the Treaty of Trianon under which Hungary is disarmed ) has caused Czechoslovakia , Jugoslavia and Rumania , to demand a League investigation . Therefore , last week , Continental statesmen were electrified when it was announced , at Budapest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would be sold as junk . Never did a suspected criminal more brazenly proceed to destroy " Exhibit A " before the very eyes of a judge not yet quite ready to hear his case . <P> Came the news from Budapest to Paris . Unhappy Acting League Council Chairman Tcheng Loh found himself a helpless victim of the alphabet . He was the wrong man in the wrong place . He speaks for a nation where wholesale smugglery of arms has produced incessant civil war . The very " Chinese Republic " from which he stands accredited at Paris has vanished in a welter of Chinese anarchy . Therefore his position in respect to a mere five carloads of smuggled machine gun parts was exquisitely awkward . No wonder then that Tcheng Loh betook his gangling , spidery self , last week , to the office of paunchy , sleepy-eyed French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand , his friend and frequent counselor . <P> Together they drafted a telegram as timid as the position of Tcheng Loh is delicate . Transmitted through the League Secretariat , this message reached Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . The Council of the League , having before it a request from the Czechoslovak , Jugoslav and Rumanian Governments and having learned from the press that the Hungarian Government is going to sell the objects to which the request refers , thinks it would be prudent to delay this project , the matter involved coming before the Council in a few days . " <P> Within a few hours came the curt , scornful reply of Premier Count Bethlen , a martinet , a virtual dictator : " The Hungarian Government tonight received with surprise your telegram . . . . The public auction sale of the demolished parts is scheduled for tomorrow . . . . It is impossible to postpone the auction . . . . <P> " I may remark that the regulations for investigation rights inherent in the League of Nations do not apply in the present case . However , the Hungarian Government as a courtesy to the Council 's President , will ask the purchaser of the goods to leave them untouched where they now lie . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
