Ismet Pasha Stiffens His Back <P> Ismet Pasha , General , statesman , politician and head of the Turkish delegation at Lausaune , gave evidence of Turkish intractibility by informing Joseph C. Grew , the United States Observer , that Turkey would cancel the Chester concession if America insisted upon special rights for her citizens in Turkey . Grew replied tersely to the effect that nothing would deter him from protecting United States citizens and their commercial interests . <P> In the matter of capitulations and the Chester concession , the United States has unravelled some of the tangles by insisting upon guarantees in place of the capitulations- as have the Allies-and by informing General Pelle that she would under no circumstances back the Chester project where it interfered with prior rights of other nationals granted by former Turkish governments . <P> The most significant feature of last week 's deliberation was the diplomatic duel over Syria . Ismet Pasha , a small shrewd-looking man , with a smile and courtly manners , and a reputation for diplomatic skill , lives right up to all his name means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Syrian border were sent there to " drive a hard bargain with the French " can only mean one of two things-bluff or business . The situation is extremely delicate and might lead to war between France and Turkey on the smallest inadvertent provocation by local troops . Neither Turkey nor France can afford to risk such an event , which would assuredly wreck the Lausanne conference . Nevertheless , the Turks met the French ultimatum to withdraw troops from the Syrian frontier by increasing their army from 20,000 to 30,000 men , and the French have sent two divisions into Syria . <P> As for the Chester concession , it looks as if it will shortly assume normal proportions , if , indeed , it sur'vives at all . Both France and Britain protested against the infringement of their rights . Canada came forward with a claim of a 45% interest in the project , and , last but not least , General Goethals , builder of the Panama Canal and possibly the most significant figure behind the Chester concession , is reported to have resigned . No reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
