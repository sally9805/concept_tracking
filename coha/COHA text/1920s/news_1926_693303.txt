txt Dean POUND of the Harvard Law School has remarked that the word " research " is much misused . It is often applied to that which is only search for what is already known . But , as M. Levr-Bnuln , of the University of Paris said at the Johns Hopkins University celebration a few weeks ago , there are many kinds of res. ' research . The first kind is that which ' aims at a most profitable and complete employment of : knows natal-fa ! resOnrces : : It - requires. only time , ' painstaking and professional , skin . It is suggested . by the German phrase die ? echnik . On the next level of research ; ' something More than mere Patience and ' skill Is requisite  --  something : which only an inventive mind can . supply . It is such research that has done so much to banish some of the scourges of man , beast and plant , anti that is still continuing its warfare against cancer , tuberculosis and malaria .

Yet what they aim at and often achieve is " the " extension rather of our power than " of our knowledge . " They do not open up new vistas for , science . On a still higher level  --  the highest ? proceeds that research whose only aim is the discovery of truth without reference to actual needs . Necessity is not Its mother .

" Especially is this sort of research needed in the realm of the social and morar sciences , where human interests a and passions are so directly-involved as to make a ? " serene objectivity " almost impossible . There is need to look at social facts as at the physical , at labor problems or international competition as dispassionately as at molecules . No empirical skill can fully servo the nations , however devoted and clever it be , even though our characteristic eagerness for results disposes us to turn to it and to trust it . Research on the highest plane , America with its immense wealth owes it , not only to itself but to mankind , to nourish and to endow with the millions which are being sought to Inquire further in the heavens , more disinterestedly abroad in the earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire . :
