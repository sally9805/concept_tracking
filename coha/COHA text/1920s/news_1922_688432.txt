Poincard 's heated reply to Mr.1 Lloyd George , as printed in today 's Nrw YORK . TIMA 'S , was read to M. ( linetscenu in his private car , which had been side-tracked at Cresson , Pa. , in order , to give the eighty-one-year-old French visitor a breakfast in the Alleghenies . The Tiger listened with eager interest to the reading . " A. man who has been in office about ( ' not bring up matters which he has known through being in office and with which the public has not been acquainted , " Mr. Clentenceau said of the Lloyd George charges . " Therefore , I am not going to interfere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier Polneare . " There are parts of- M. Peinew.A 's answer with which I agree heartily , particularly those in regard to annex  --  ttion . Other parts of the Premier 's statement . referring to what took place at Cannes and subsequently . I know nothing abort and can not answer because 1 was not in office . " Supports roineare 's As for incidents narrated by Mr. Lloyd George concerning events colsfleeted with negotiations during the Paris conference in 1e19 , - NI . Clemencoast stood squarely with PoinettrO , an ancient political enemy , in contradicting the former . British Premier 's statements . Ile reiterated M. Poineare 's denial that any group in France sought to annex German .. erritory. tie pointed out that while in his addresses in this country he had said that he demanded the left bank of the Rhine he desires this territory not for annexation but for military occupation ' as a prevention , against invasion . There was no thought I of annexation in this demand , M. Clemenceau insisted , for it was proposed that the local Government would remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no party in France wishing to annex German territory , " the Tiger exclaimed . " We never claimed German , territory and that shows we never meant to seize any . Of course the case of Alsace-Lorraine was different . That was taken from u ' in WM . ' It is French and for that teasels we 1 , demanded Its return . But lands occupied and governed by Germans  --  i never ' heard a man in France suggest annexation of German territory  --  neither man , woman , child , donkey , horse , deg , cat . or mouse . " " But . Mr. I. ; 1 1:eorge says that French antic , . prevniled upon you to demand left hank of the Rhine , W1101 ' 0111 ) 0 ! ) ilf offered you the British guarantees should you give lip this drAnand , " Cleineneeau was told . " No , no , " the Tiger Insisted . e There was not one word about annexation . It ' was only a question of military occupation . The territory was to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Tiger went on , he never had looked with favor on a French military occupation of the Rhine area If other means could he devised . Ile thought that it placed France in a notto-be-envied military position , that French troops would he compelled to occupy a te:ritorr preclominently German and that they would have difficulty in maintaining safely their lines of communication from the French frontier . " I proposed this military occupation , " he said , " because nothing better was offered , but when Mr. Lloyd George came to me and offered me the British guarantee should I give up my demand , I took it with very great pleasure , you may be sure . I was very happy that day . A new way , the right way , had been found . " M. Clemenceau was asked about President Wilson and his offer to submit an American guarantee for French protection to the Senate . " The case was not the same , " ho replied . " Mr. Wilson said he would have to get it from Congress . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suggested joining with Great Britain in insuring France 's protection from invasion ho would have been content with the guarantee of one natiOn , Britain . He showed an unwillingness to discuss this point , apparently regarding it as a hypothetical question . He declared , however , that the United States , although unwilling to enter into a thine agreement , had secured from France a guarantee of protection for her own territory in the Pacific . In my addresses since President Harding 's message to Congress , " he said , " I have quoted his reference to the Pacific act and his suggestion , as I interpreted , that this principle be applied to other parts of the world . His message on this point is very encouraging . I hope that something will come of it . I might have gone further in discussing this point . I might have shown that America , with the best frontiers in the world ; America , who has not given guarant : ! qs to k rance , has in the Four Power Pacific treaty received the guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us . And England , she , too , has been given her guarantees . There was the sinking of ? . he German fleet at Seapa , low , the fleet that was conquered in part by French soldiers . " One of the stipulations . Speaking of Mr. Lloyd George 's first Proposal of a British guarantee , M. Clemenceau said that the British Premier had not specified what form this guarantee would take , but one of the stipulations was that France should not be the aggressor . " Nevertheless , " he added , " we accepted it . " " Did you have any fear that France would not give back this occupied territory after fifteen years ? " M. Clemenceau was asked . " I ca n't speak for the French Government , " he replied , " but there were certain stipulations in the treaty that were to be put into effect . Such a matter would depend upon how these provisions were executed . " M. Clemenceau declined to be drawn into the debate between Mr. Lloyd George and M. Poincar ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference . It was suggested that the text of the British guarantees at Cannes had been made public . " I did not see it , " M. Clemenceau " but even if it was it does not mean that everything Lloyd George proposes should be accepted with shut eyes . " The Tiger expressed great confidence in Premier ** Law ; but he said 1e did not think he was in a position to comment upon the British Premier 's offer to cancel France 's debt to Great Britain . " Do you think that a guarantee from Mr. Boner Law would be the same as one from Mr. Lloyd George ? " he was asked . " Certainly not , " he replied , but he hastened to explain that foreign policies change with each party in power . " I have high regard for Mr. Boner Law , " . he went on , " and if ever he should get into difficulties and I can help him , I shall be pleased to do so . " " You have never intended to accuse England or America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to give guarantees ? " M. Clemenceau was asked . " Never , " he answered . " Certainly not . I would only call it negligence . That is all . I wo n't insinuate anything else in any way . I never said that there was anything wilful in this attitude . If the guarantee does not work , of course , we have no choice , but fortunately there is a little time yet , and I feel assured from the friendly point of view of the French people the matter will be settled . If everybody is sincere , it is easy to agree . "
