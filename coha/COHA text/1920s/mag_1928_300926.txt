<P> The new Nationalist Government has long since changed the name of Peking , meaning " Northern Capital , " to Peiping , " Northern Peace . " <P> Correspondents and foreigners have mostly ignored the change ; but last week the Christian Science Monitor , progressive , was observed to be carrying despatches dated from " Peiping ( Peking ) . " <P> To continue to call the city " Peking " or " Northern Capital " is ridiculous , for the capital of China is now at Nanking ( " Southern Capital " ) . <P> A Constitution was adopted , last week , by the new Nationalist Government . <P> The dictatorship of the Nationalist Party is proclaimed " during the present period of political tutelage " ; but eventually elections will be held and the State transformed into a Republic . <P> The new Chinese President , Chiang Kaishek , rode about Nanking last week in a shiny but ominous-looking new Packard sedan . <P> This vehicle , potent , has two seats at the rear in which soldiers squat , holding rifles with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car by means of hand grips , while their free hands grasp the hilts of ugly , blue steel repeating pistols . <P> Austere President Chiang , though modest and democratic , is above all prudent . <P> Minister of Railways Sun Fo announced last week that contracts have been signed , providing for the remodeling and enlargement of Nanking and the harbor of Canton by two New Yorkers , an architect and an engineer . <P> Architect Henry Killam Murphy is famed for his many notable successes in blending Occidental materials into Chinese style . He designed the building of Yenching College , Peiping , Yale-in-China , Changsha , and Gingling College , Nanking . He will now receive carte blanche to transform Nanking into a modern , imposing and yet Chinese capital , may spend $50,000,000 . <P> Seaport Engineer Ernest P. Goodrich will so enlarge the harbor of Canton and deepen its connection with the sea that eventually the transshipment of goods at the British seaport of Hongkong , nearby , will be eliminated . Thus a potent source of revenue will be wrested from Britons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Princeton , who has assisted in the fiscal rehabilitation of 10 governments , * was coyly reticent , last week , when confronted with despatches from Nanking positively asserting that he has been retained as fiscal adviser by the Nationalists . <P> Mayor Ho Chi-Kung of Peiping urged Chinese to multiply more rapidly , last week , after discovering to his surprise and chagrin that the population of China has remained stationary at about 400,000,000 for the past two centuries . <P> More enlightened persons know that it is recurrent famine and not shirking of duty by Chinese fathers which keeps the population stable at the largest number of mouths which China can feed . <P> Nationalist Foreign Minister C. T. Wang said : " We have sent identic notes to all the powers concerned asking them to move to abolish extraterritoriality as soon as possible . I am unable to divulge the text of the note , but wish it made clear that China is urgently desirous of early assumption of her sovereign rights in all parts of the country .
