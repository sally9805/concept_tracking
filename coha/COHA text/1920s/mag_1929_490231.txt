WITH amazing energy , the New Woman has taken to writing books . Busy as she is with life in general , she yet finds time for her sixty thousand words or so . The names of new lady novelists bloom on the jackets of books wherever we go  --  pop suddenly into view like moon-flowers . Out of nineteen volumes which we saw in a bookseller 's window yesterday , eleven were by females . Scratch a lady at a tea party and find a novelist . There 's no escaping them ; aggressive , restless , they can say a sharp thing tellingly and , worse luck , do . The day we dread is the day they decide to affect being faintly sick , like Keats , or go along the street kicking trees , like Doctor Johnson . Already we 've begun to withdraw into our alcove , which smells of leather and old cheese and Thomas Hardy . The Brontc sisters arc there , but that 's all right  --  we 're not going to give up women altogether , not us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl seems to have outdone the fuss over Lindbergh and Miss Morrow . The reason is , of course , that young Coolidge and his lady have a more important political connection than the Lindberghs , being immediate descendants of a president and a governor . The marriage brought out America 's old , sneaking , suppressed desire for a royal family . It burst forth fiercely two decades ago over Alice Roosevelt 's marriage . She was sometimes referred to then as Princess Alice . Lots of people have a touch of royalist yearning without knowing what is the matter with them . It causes bankers to collect expensive foreign paintings ; it makes Long Island wives go in for English butlers ; it leads nobodies to hunt up coats of arms , capitalists to have portraits of themselves painted ; it shows up in Latin mottoes on the doormats of hotels , the liveries of apartment-house doormen , and the desire of the common people for heavily encrusted Christmas cards . It might do no harm to have a royal family in this country to co5rdinate the restless enthusiasms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unbridled to-do over Valentinos , Vall6cs , and such , who clutter up lobbies and rotogravure sections would be done away with . The trouble would he to find a suitable family . At the moment we can think of none  --  except possibly Mr. and Mrs. Gann . Ar various times in the past there have been a hotel , a night club , a chewing-gum , a musical revue , a race horse , and a necktie named after us . Now the Knox Hat Company is courteously calling one of its fall models The New Yorker . There is also an airplane called The New Yorker . This might not have caused any confusion had not Eddie Cantor officiated at the plane 's transcontinental send-off . As matters stand now , the populace has the general feeling that Eddie Cantor is publishing the magazine and that the magazine is making hats . It does n't sound impossible . IT 'S time something was done about the way stores conceal their wares . Maybe you 've noticed . In some of the new hat stores try and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seclusion , the very sight of a hat being , presumably , offensive to a customer . In a cravat store , one experiences the delusion of grandeur on discovering that there are no cravats visible to the naked eye . Just between you and us , there 's a lot of boloney connected with such polite merchandising ; and we are particularly incensed to learn that there is to be a grocery store in Park Avenue so eminently elegant that not even a Brussels sprout will disturb the chaste loveliness of the reception-room . Because of the inherent vulgarity of vegetables , everything will be kept safely behind partitions . As a person who spent a good portion of last summer in a general store , moodily surveying a genial and almost wholly disorganized lot of green groceries , boxed fruits , hand-knit wool socks , bananas , olives , 30-30 cartridges , ginger ale , butter , tobacco , transmission nil , corset laces , salami , licorice sticks , Mazola , rubber dubbing , and other general supplies ( as displayed by Mr. M.

We warn this new Park Avenue establishment that we have very little time , or patience either , to expend on any store where a fellow ca n't get up from his seat on a grain sack , pick his way through the merchandise , and help himself to a bit of sausage . Or maybe try on a pair of pants . Poor Richard IT seems there is good reason for the fancy , horsey-sounding names , like Green Flash , Questioner , etc. , they give greyhound racers . A beginner at the game has learned this . He imported from England a secretly trained dog named Richard , a record-breaker , and entered him at one of the Long Island tracks . The dog , being unknown , was given long odds and the owner brought down a party of friends to get in on a sure thing . The hound took off perfectly , ran more fleetly than the other dogs , and at the home stretch was five lengths ahead of the field . Fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shouted feverishly , " Come on , Richard ! Come on , Richard ! " Richard skidded to a stop as the other hounds loped past him and went trotting toward his master , wagging his tail gleefully . The owner now enters him under the name Kenilworth Lad . Mimic THE success of Mr. Charles Bat-terworth , the conspicuous comedian of " Sweet Adeline , " is , to put it in one hyphenated word , mushroom-like . A link more than two years ago he was acting , in a depressed sort of way , as secretary to J. P. McEvoy , who then was writing the sketches for " Americana . " One day he told his employer that he would like to try out for a part in that revue . McEvoy humored him mildly . " I 'll do a thing I used to do around college , " Butterworth said . He thereupon went through the parody Rotary Club speech which was enthusiastically included by 11 , IcEvoy in his show . The comedian is but six years out of college and is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school there and then to Notre Dame , which is also there . He might now be practicing law there too , but that he was better at mimicking his professors than learning from them . He used to take them off for his roommates and , later , for groups of classmates at parties . To add to his repertoire he went to businessmen 's lunch clubs and then aped the speakers he heard . After college , Butterworth assailed Chicago with his talents . He gave his monologues before vaudeville managers . One , after listening to him , suggested that he take up tap-dancing . He then tried movie houses . He got a tryout in a suburban theatre . Before he went on for the first time , the stage manager asked him what lights he wanted . " All of them , " said Butterworth , meaning footlights and houselights . The manager , however , took him literally , and the comedian made his professional &but; while multicolored lights played on him practically all the colors of the spectrum . This broke his spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't until " Americana " that he got his break , all the vaudeville agents here being profoundly uninterested over a period of three or four years . Etiquette YOU do n't have to believe this , but a gentleman returned from abroad says that an American girl studying in Italy went into a moving-picture theatre and suddenly realized that she was sitting just behind none other than Il Duce , Mussolini himself . His visit was incognito , and successfully so , for no one recognized him in the half light of the cinema . He was enjoying everything hugely until , in the midst of a newsreel , a portrait of himself in heroic pose was thrown on the screen . The spectators , of course , all arose , cheering wildly , all save Mussolini himself , who sat through the demonstration , fidgeting . His had been , obviously , a rather nice point  --  whether to stand up and risk being recognized honoring himself , or to remain modestly seated .

" Cavern Fun BOTTOMLEY , WAGNER &; WHITE , the ar-chitects , have de-signed a tennis court under a pansy bed We re-port this not only as a novelty but as a trend . Relaxation and sport in this town ( private and semi-private ) are going underground . Many of the new cooperative apartment buildings and several of next year 's skyscrapers will have from one to three floors below the street level devoted to gymnasiums , swimming pools , and places for court games . We wonder it was n't thought of before . Up to now there have been only four swimming pools available in town , outside of private clubs , Y. M. C. A. 's , and the like ; these are in the Hotels Shelton , Park Central , Barbizon , and des Artistes . The Bottomley , etc. , building we mentioned will he a twenty-five-story cooperative affair covering an entire block-front facing the East River , between Fifty-second and Fifty-third Streets . There will be two full-sized tennis courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be played on the floor of the second sub-basement . The ceiling of the court nearest the river will form the support far a garden . Incidentally , guests will go down broad walks through this garden to a private dock for yachts at the river 's edge . But to get back below ground . There will also be a subterranean gymnasium , squash courts , showers , dressing-rooms , a swimming pool , and a garage with long ramps leading down to it . A ventilating system will produce balmy outdoors weather . Several other proposed cooperative buildings , two of them to be in Park Avenue , will have similar basements . So will the Battery Tower , forty-story skyscraper which is being built downtown for businessmen and women to live in . It will have a magnificent pool , way down deep , with galleries ranged around it , and club lounges off these . A pool will probably be included , too , in the eighty-story Empire State Building , which Al Smith and others are planning for the Waldorf site . Things are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary of the furtive cut-rate filling station , having found the gasoline diluted . Lately , however , investigators from the big refineries , finding that in some places the fuel was as good as their own , have uncovered a new racket : gasoline bootlegging . It is a complicated dodge , requiring corruption all along the line . The tank driver delivers seven hundred gallons of gas . The checker at the filling station receipts for a thousand . The driver goes off with the extra three hundred gallons and sells it to the bootleg station , usually for ten cents a gallon . This leaves an ample margin of profit , even when resold at cut rates . Everybody makes money and is happy ? driver , checker , bootleg dealer , even the motorist  --  everybody bdt the refiners , and they 're sore about it . Down to the Sea WHEN the big steamship companies set their sailings at midnight , it tripled the strain put on Pilots ' Association . Three times as many persons as formerly miss the " visitors ashore " bell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dropped , with the pilot , off Sandy Hook . The pilots regard the matter as a nuisance , but the passengers are apt to be exhilarated by the adventure  --  which has its perils . They are rowed in a bobbing dory from the liner to one of the two pilot boats of the Port , the New York or the Sandy Hook , which also bob a lot . They get a bunk for the night and a hearty breakfast next morning  --  if they feel like a hearty breakfast  --  and then are sent home by tug , all free of charge . Men are the more numerous offenders , drink the principal cause . Women sometimes make the trip , however . The Duchesse de Richelieu had to be taken off once . Through an error , her stateroom had been sold to someone else : she refused all others and insisted on departing the ship with the pilot . On the memorable night when the Tunneys sailed , seven persons stayed on board too long and had to make the trip to Sandy Hook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , are not , as is sometimes thought , retired sea captains . The fact is , most sea captains regard the business as a mild bother , for nearly all of them could take their own ships in and out of port without trouble . Back in 1860 , however , someone thought there ought to he specialists to do this for them . Pilots , under the form of indenture drawn up at that time , must pass through a long period of apprenticeship , never less than five years , sometimes as much as eight . They row the dory , study charts , sail a ketch to Staten Island for supplies  --  all for a few dollars ' pay a month  --  until finally they are allowed to take a liner of the smallest draft down the harbor . When a man can guide one drawing thirty-two feet through the channel , he has earned a full pilot 's license . Full-fledged pilots rarely get ashore for long . They have a month 's vacation every year , but the other eleven months they live aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of the harbor . Between them , the two boats provide quarters for about forty pilots and half that many apprentices . They play cards mostly , during the long watches . When an incoming boat looms up , one of the pilots takes it up the channel , transfers to an outgoing liner , brings it down the harbor , rows over to the pilot boat and , perhaps a day later , sits in the card game again . The card game is always going on . The great boast of the Pilots ' Association is that no pilot boat has ever gone inshore or left its post to seek shelter . No matter how nasty the weather , they are always at their station . Sometimes , in rough weather , though , it takes hours to maneuver the tiny dory so that the liner can take the pilot aboard . At such times it is even harder for an outgoing vessel to drop a pilot . Sometimes it is impossible and the pilot who has rescued so many passengers from being carried away to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . In the past twenty years only two pilots have lost their lives . A dory bearing one was driven by the wind into the pro , pellor of a steamer The other was lost in a gale in 1908 . ?

Blackstone Revised A GENTLEMAN of 1 who went to Mexico on sonal matter reports that the goings-on in the courts there are generally strange . He got a divorce decree the day after his arrival and would have been back on American soil that evening but for an unexpected and untoward event which held him up . On his first afternoon he had dropped into an antique shop where he looked over some admirable Spanish brasses . He would have bought some pieces but he found the price too high and walked out of the store without discussion . That evening a large crucifix , a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered C.O.D . at his hotel , accompanied by a bill for eight thousand dollars . He sent the things hack saying there had been a mistake . A few hours later he was served with papers in a suit for the value of the collection . He frantically sought out the native lawyer who had represented him in the divorce action . The latter was reassuring , voluble . The antique dealer was a rascal . That was well known . The attorney said leave everything to him . The case came up in court . The dealer took the stand . The American , he testified , had plainly ordered these things . The dealer went minutely into details . The American was horrified . He was further horrified when six other Mexicans took the stand and supported the dealer in his testimony , in every detail of it . Actually none of this half-dozen had been in the store when he had looked over the things . He was still more , much more horrified when his attorney arose to open the case for the defence and announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American had honored the shop by a visit , he had ordered the articles enumerated . Everything the complainant and his witnesses said was true , all true At this point the American concluded that he was the victim of a double frame-up and had been properly done in . But things took an unexpected turn . His attorney continued . It was all true , everything was true , except in one particular . The American had paid for the articles . The antique dealer and his witnesses had failed to go into this detail . The resourceful Mexican attorney thereupon called eight witnesses of his own They remembered the transaction well . Everything had happened as stated , but the defendant had paid for the articles They were very clear on that . They even remembered the denominations of the bills he bad passed over . The court decided in favor of the visitor . The latter 's attorney thereupon bundled up the antiques and , when he parted from his client before the hall of justice , walked off with them . The client left the country at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great do when relaxing is so rare that even a tardy bit like this is n't to be let go Last June , when Mr. J. P.

He did this for the better part of four afternoons , absorbed in " Loose Ladies , " by Vifia Delmar . Chinese Movies CHINESE movies are now shown at the New Chatham Theatre in the Bowery . They have been for some time , but we did n't know it until just now . Ordinarily they are shown only on two days a month , but they are being run on two days a week now ? Sundays and Mondays  --  because it 's the height of the Chinatown season , with lots of people around from out of town . Of a Monday we found the theatre crowded with Chinese , all looking prosperous and well dressed and seeming not to mind having to pay three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary Occidental pictures are exhibited . The high price is necessary because of the duty on imported films . The picture shown was produced by the Great Wall Film Company of Shanghai . This was the American premiere . Sub-titles were in Chinese and English , the introductory one being : " Man always desert the girl whose heart is burning aflame with love . And she always have to pay . " In demonstrating this truth the film proceeded through six reels of conspiracies , plotting , gang fights , and terrible Oriental knifings and goings-on . Wicked monks were revealed in machinations to accomplish the downfall of the tender heroine . Fights were breathless and bloody . Ladies of untempered ardor moved determinedly about , luring trusting young Chinese gentlemen to scented ruin . Only the hero succeeded in resisting them . One vampire , who at last forced her way into the privacy of his bachelor diggings , finally , in desperation , de-manded , " What keeps you so hurry ? " He retreated fearfully before her . " Pray he conventional , " he pleaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of things in the picture and ordered them out . Nearly all the love scenes were eliminated . Too hot . The Chinese are working on sound films but none has arrived here yet . Class ONE of those ladies who are aggres- sively meeting more and more of the right people had a pretty important group in for bridge the other afternoon , and was making a great show of it . In the midst of things her bootlegger arrived at the house . The butler came in and whispered the announcement over her shoulder . She nodded and called to her husband in a neatly modulated tone . " You had better go to the door , dear , " she said . " It 's the vintner. "
