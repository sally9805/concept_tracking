The most conspicuous abscess in the world resides in the lower corner of the right lung of His Majesty George V. People all over the world who have ever had to have their pleural cavities drained following pleural pneumonia are vividly conscious that a channel was cut into His Majesty 's chest to let the poison drain out . Fortnight ago six royal physicians descried and decided that the royal abscess was not draining properly . They announced that they would have to operate again . To calm a worried public , Court officials quickly declared that the operation would be comparatively minor . <P> Feeling that no operation is minor to one who has been as sick as King George a great crowd gathered last week before the wrought iron gates of Buckingham Palace on Operating Day . The worried crowd waited while automobiles drove up bearing physicians , surgeons , a radiologist , anaesthetists . Saluted by sentries were other automobiles containing the Prince of Wales , the Duke of Gloucester ( just back from Canada , his polo-broken collarbone mended ) and Prince George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary during the operation . <P> While shag-hatted guardsmen . Changed Guard as though nothing were happening - drums rolling , band blaring , officers piping in loud falsetto-the surgeons and doctors worked . Half an hour later the Prince of Wales left , smiling . The operation was successful . <P> It was also far more serious than the public had been led to believe . Parts of two ribs were cut away , to make a hole an inch and one-half in diameter ( nearly the size of a golf ball ) directly into the abscess , leaving the abscess completely exposed . <P> The morning after Operating Day , Edward of Wales made a speech at the opening of the International Aero Exhibition . " I know that you will be pleased , " said he , " when I tell you that I had some definite conversation with the King this morning . He has stood the operation extremely well . " <P> Serious to the Royal Family was the condition of Prince George 's stomach . Stomach trouble caused him to be transferred four months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week by doctor 's advice he gave up even this job , retired to the country to rest and diet until the autumn .
