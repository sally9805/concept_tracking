LET no one be deceived by the inspired reports that conditions are getting better in the Ruhr ; that the French are beginning to have their way ; that the troops are being reduced in the cities ; that the Paris magnates have now decided that they are going to be good , and , after having done their utmost to destroy German credit and financial ability , are now going to help Germany to get on her feet . The situation is not one whit less critical than it was . Fridtjof Nansen has just uttered a solemn warning that the next war approaches rapidly . It is not going to be averted by any halfway measures , or by any sudden French decision to change their policy after the mischief has been done . There is no cessation of the misery and the suffering in the Ruhr and in all Germany , no improvement in the situation of the neutrals against whom France struck most serious blows when she entered the Ruhr . In short , there can be no health in Europe until the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French and English were near an agreement just prior to the election in England , under which the French were to consent to a reduction of the Ruhr occupation to a " simple system of financial and economic control with British participation , " such control to be " extended progressively to other regions in Germany , " with permanent military occupation of the Rhine , but with France abandoning all support of the Separatist criminals . It will be a cause for rejoicing , indeed , if the defeat of Mr. Baldwin has blocked this scheme , which in its essence meant simply an agreement that England should share in the swag and keep silent in return for certain concessions , as in the Mediterranean . ONE index of the appalling difficulties of life in Germany is given by the price of a single newspaper . A copy of the Berliner Tageblatt cost 5,000 marks on July 29 ; it had risen to 500,000 September 9 ; in November it crossed the billion mark . With the issue of a supposed gold currency the Tageblatt began printing prices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On November 18 the price reads : 20 gold pfennigs , or 120 billion marks . One pre-war metal mark was equivalent to 600 billion marks of the kind men receive as wages . WE are glad to see that Mr. Coolidge is going to enter the Illinois and California primaries . That is the democratic way of testing out public sentiment and ascertaining whether the Republican masses favor his continuance in office or not . Indeed , we hope . he will go still further , openly announce his own candidacy , and have himself enrolled as a candidate in every State which is advanced enough to test the sentiment of the voters by means of a primary . That does not , of course , mean that we shall thereby escape the customary procedure of having a Republican nominee picked by bosses in a room in the most exclusive hotel of the city in which the convention is held . But at least , if most primaries should reject Mr. Coolidge , the leaders could not be in doubt as to his chances at the election . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront the acid test of the primaries . On the Democratic side , only Mr. McAdoo seems to be making any headway . He might . easily sweep the country if he would come out for government ownership of railroads and against the League of Nations , but he is hedging and , like all politicians , wondering whether it would be expedient or not . N OTHING spreads like a bad example . Judge Mayer de-cides that the administration of justice has been imperiled by criticism from Comptroller Craig , and imme-diately Justice Hagerty of the New York Supreme Court conceives that the majesty of the law is undermined by the remarks of an assistant corporation counsel . The jus-tice declares that a slur has been cast upon the entire Supreme Court of the State , and demands an apology . The criticism was in a newspaper interview to the effect that makers of gambling slot machines could , with political influ-ence and high-priced counsel , obtain injunctions preventing police interference . The remarks were made without ade-quate evidence , and the assistant corporation counsel subse-quently wrote to Justice Hagerty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the .. clifinitv of the bench must be upheld by an apology . Wlia ; t. foiarrbrrot Mf*taae9ple.hpd never heard of this slur op the courts umlii " 2 , iitiap-Stakvrty. brought it to their attenliollA Votrtls and the President have been subjected to pifildseitild1Qmitaikii critWiliNsinq this republic was founded ; yet our legislative alid:enekzaRe. branches are functioning with ever-increasing power and authority . Is it not possible that our courts , too , can carry on without suppressing free speech on the part of persons who dispute , however rightly or wrongly , the unblemished record of the bench for justice ? W HILE meditating on Judge Mayer and Justice Hagerty , who seem to think that the way to uphold the majesty of the law is to make it ridiculous , our eye caught an item in the Seattle Union Record , which told how a farmer was faced with hanging or deportation ( minus his ears ) because he had taken one of his cows out of the public pound and led her home against the protest of the custodian of the inclosure . A charge of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found guilty . But when the judge searched for a law under which to sentence the farmer , it was found that the criminal code of the State of Washington failed to provide for the offense . Resort was then had to the English common law , and an ancient act was discovered which provided that a person guilty of " pound breach " might be either executed or exiled to a penal colony in Australia after having his ears cut off . The edition of the Union Record which we were reading went to press before the judge had decided which penalty to apply , but the story should be an inspiration to Judge Mayer and Justice Hagerty . Were they to crop the ears or hang a ring in the nose of anybody who criticized the courts , the waning prestige of our judicial system might be restored . W E owe the New York Times an apology . In com- menting on Judge Parker 's defense of the " capitalist press " we stated that the Times had omitted Senator Wheeler 's reply to Judge Parker while printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken . The fact that the Times 's own index department informed us that it had not printed Senator Wheeler 's reply does not obviate the error . It had printed a fair extract from Senator Wheeler 's letter , which , while under a less conspicuous head , was longer than its extract from the attack upon him . We make the correction herewith , and we are glad to give the correction the same position we gave the original charge . I N spite of the ease with which our last tariff bill went through Congress , there are signs that the business community is no longer as solid for this particular kind of boneheadedness as it was once . Take the bankers , for instance . The Chase National Bank of New York City has issued a bulletin by its economist , Benjamin M. Anderson , Jr. , who calls attention to changed economic conditions which are leading bankers to view our tariff wall with a doubt that they did not feel previous to the World War . They have seen , for a period of nine years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports , unmatched even by the so-called " invisible " items of immigrants ' remittances , shipping services , and the like . They have seen , consequently , the piling up of an ever-growing debt of foreign countries to the United States , not primarily to banks , but rather to investors , exporters , foreign-eichange speculators , etc . . .. They have studied anxiously the problem of how Europe could ever pay her debt , and it has . become Ih'efeingly clear to them that she ctap.alay ... itt ? Zue*.if atolkeer to send goods here , sell the gabdr.i-a:olnia-tailcdt , and turn.oveo the proceeds in dollars to her ' cieditors heyq : clear that the present excessive:ia ? : iff iltes.thng-hkut'e.d ' Hurdle so high that Europe viptirdllipz , b- the *giavest difficulty in making large payments ' here , even if she were otherwise in a position to undertake it . /MEANWHILE two billion dollars in gold has flowed into the country in the past nine years , draining Europe 's liquid assets . And this great gilded heap , which some of us regard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers equally enthusiastic ' about it ? The answer , according to Mr. Anderson , is in the negative . This gilded heap is a vast " dead asset , " both wasteful and dangerous . Gold is a tool of trade . It is an expensive tool . Gold bears no interest . When it is accumulated in excess of the need , it involves a waste of capital . The United States would be very . much better off today , for example , if we had a billion and a half dollars less of gold in the country and instead had a billion and a half dollars more of housing facilities in our congested cities . The United States would also be better off if the countries of Europe had a billion and a half dollars of our gold as a basis for the restoration of sound currency and liquid credit position . These words are as significant as true . If the bankers ever decide to present a united front against a protective tariff , then the historic tenet of the G.O.P. is doomed . P OLITICS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own . Lucien Midol , leader of the railway strike of 1920 , was recently elected by the Communists to the municipal council of Paris . After the strike he had taken refuge in Switzerland , and the French courts , as is their wont , condemned him in absentia for a great variety of crimes . Upon his election Midol crossed the FrancoSiviss frontier on foot , took local trains to a suburb of Paris , and walked into the capital with the morning flood of wage-earners . On the appointed day the police set up a barrage about the Town Hall , but Midol slipped through unrecognized , took his seat , and made a speech . After the session all the deputies entered the chairman 's office . The police demanded entry . Ferdinand Brunet , far from a Communist but evidently with a touch of humor , stood at the locked door with the key in his pocket and informed the police that they had no right to enter his office . The police sent for a locksmith . The lock was picked and the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the councilors . So the police rushed out , while Midol , sitting at Brunet 's desk , laughed with the rest . He then joined , unrecognized , the reporters and listened to a police officer describe how he had escaped from the window . The next day , while the police searched every automobile and pedestrian crossing the French frontier , Midol had himself photographed in Paris . A second time Midol passed the police barrage and entered the City Hall , but this time a police officer discovered him in the cloakroom . A HUNDRED years ago a small leaflet circulated in Manchester , England , which aimed to relieve the economic burden of excessively large families by giving the parents contraceptive information , was labeled by the good people " The Diabolical Handbill . " Seven years ago , fifty-five years after the first birth-control clinic in the world was opened in Amsterdam , the police arrested Margaret Sanger and two others for opening such a clinic in Brooklyn . The - tide has scarcely turned yet . But the advocates of birth control have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight that is more fundamental that all the maternity and child-welfare legislation in the world . For eleven months the New York Clinical Research Bureau has conducted a scientific study of 900 cases  --  the first socio-medical research in birth control that has ever been done . For every case studied , two were rejected because they did not fall within the legal classification of those who may be so aided . All who received information at the clinic had to show that it was needed as a measure of ' health ; 73 per cent sought it as well for economic reasons ; 49 per cent showed bad family inheritance . The United States stands sixth on the child mortality list ; in the five countries ahead of us there is no legal restriction on the dissemination of birth-control information . The United States is twentieth ? on the list in maternal mortality . We must get rid of cant in dealing with a subject of this kind or else forever class ourselves with those who used to condemn lightning-rods as an interference with divine providence . YEAR and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that glamorous phrase . Likewise , too often , the modern fairy tale of justice and political freedom . " A year and a day , " said His Honor , Judge Henry W. Goddard , leaning down from his bench in the United States District Court in New York City , as he sentenced Carlo Tresca to the federal penitentiary at Atlanta for carrying in his paper , 11 Martello , the two-line advertisement of a book on birth control . As The Nation pointed out last week , the authorities are not concerned about the book . It was not in the hope of catching an insignificant advertisement that a special agent of the Department of Justice hired himself out to 11 Martello for a year . But that he was unable in that time to find better cause for arresting Mr. Tresca makes the present charge and conviction all the more disgusting . District Attorney Mattucks 's admission that the whole investigation was made at the instigation of the Italian ambassador , and his suggestion that if Mr. Tresca would leave the country at once sentence should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have vigorously resented the dictation of a foreign Power in American courts . K INDNESS is a real impulse of the human heart , we believe , and not a mere outcropping of the idea of duty or a seasonal , Santa Claus sort of benevolence . But how tragically easy it is to choke the springs of kindness with a clod of prejudice or a hard , indecent lie . We have recently received a communication from Paxton Hibben of the American Nansen Committee , which quite persuades us that the press associations , with various superheated patriots and officials as accomplices , are unwitting murderers of Russian children . He sends us a letter from a man who last year collected $1,200 worth of clothing for the orphans of Russia . This year he will do nothing to help these children  --  he has been told that the Russians are selling grain and with the proceeds importing paper on which to spread the doctrines of communism , that a huge and unnecessary standing army is being maintained , that " unlimited funds " are being sent from Russia into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate view of the overthrow of our democratic form of government . " He admits that the children are not to blame but fears that Americans must be rather indifferent to their sufferings until the " majority in Russia .. . some day come to their own , assert their rights and powers , and oust this bunch of robbers and murderers . . . . " Such has been the food fed to the American public . The Russian Government may list its chief imports , and repeat its offers for the recognition and the settlement of the Czar 's debts , and show how its army compares with the other armies of Europe . And the scandalous misrepresentations bought and published by the United Mine Workers may be shown up in every decent journal . None the less official lies and unofficial slander carry farther than these denials  --  to the end that Russian children are left by kind and honest Americans to die . J OHN MORLEY was a stalwart old stoic , and one respects the stern dictates of his will . But has any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it is possible that some person may desire to write a memoir of my life , which I regard as wholly superfluous , I enjoin upon my executors and each of them to refuse to aid or encourage any such design , and not allow any such person to have access to any of my papers , whether personal or acquired in the course of official duty , either for perusal or otherwise . And I also desire that the same refusal of access to my papers shall be extended to persons writing memoirs or biographies of friends of mine or others . There has , perhaps , been an exaggerated mania for memoirs in these latter years , but the least valuable of them have been published by their living writers . If John Morley had desired that a decade should elapse and personal impressions fade before his story were written , that would be , possibly , a justifiable request ; but to bar the future from attempting to understand the past through the papers of such a man as Morley  --  that seems to us a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic side of Morley 's character is revealed in his bequest of " a substantial contribution from my library , not to be less than 5,000 volumes , to be chosen by the chairman of the Manchester University Council in priority to any other beneficiary , such volumes to be placed in Ashburne Hall for the benefit of the women students . " T HE fruits of last year 's convention on church publicity are being gathered . At that convention the chairman of the church-advertising department of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World described the need for broadcasting Christianity in the following terms : This is the greatest field yet unentered by the advertising fraternity . . . . The advertising men with their genius and ability to spread truth must take an interest in the church and put it into the minds and hearts of men .

The Editor and Publisher proudly reports that the Brooklyn Eagle ran , " the largest single piece of church advertising copy ever printed in a daily newspaper " ? a double-spread on the occasion of thpfall meeting of the Methodist Board of Bishops .
