COMMONWEALTH ( British Commonwealth of Nations ) <P> The Director of Military Operations of the Imperial British General Staff was , from 1915 to 1918 , Major General Sir Frederick Barton Maurice , who may certainly be assumed to know as much about the War as any man alive . Recently this great soldier and tactician picked up and read two fat volumes+ about the War from the sale of which Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill is drawing considerable pelf . As he read . Sir Frederick apparently began to experience a sense of scorn . Here were errors of fact , sloppiness , perversions of truth and everywhere the pink and soapy touch of superficiality . What to do ? <P> Sir Frederick Maurice sat down and penned a long , calm , deadly review which was released last week in the July issue of that distinguished U. S. quarterly Foreign Affairs . Excerpts : <P> " Mr. Churchill 's misstatements of fact are so many and so grave that no historian will in future be able to accept any of his assertions about the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> " Almost the whole of an important paragraph in Mr. Churchill 's description of the battle of the Marne ... is pure fable . . . . " <P> " He supports his statements with a mass of figures and tables admirably calculated to deceive the lay reader . " <P> " He supports his thesis by exaggerating . . . and minimizing . . . . " <P> " Some of his tables are incomplete , his methods of handling his statistics are incorrect , and ... in almost every case in which exact information is available Mr. Churchill 's figures are proved to be erroneous . . . . " <P> So keen and sweeping seemed General Maurice 's analysis , so backed by evidence his charges , that observers expected Mr. Churchill to reply by maintaining the silence of outraged dignity . <P> +The World Crisis 1916-1918 - Winston Spencer Churchill - Scribner 's ( $10 ) .
