SCENE : A lower room in Florio 's house . It is wide and simply furnished . In the center , at back , is a large doorway , hung with great black arras . In the right-hand extreme corner is a small altar to the Virgin . In wall , at back , high up on left , a small window . A smaller doorway , hung with arras of black , is on the left , well toward the front . This doorway gives on the study of the poet . At rise of curtain the stage is lit with the uncertain light of tapers . Lizzia , the old servant , is discovered kneeling at the altar . Soon she rises , crossing herself devoutly . Demurringly and with deprecating shakes of the head , she begins hanging wreaths about the walls of the room . After the hanging of each wreath she crosses herself , and , with agitated piety verging on superstition , she bends the knee briefly before altar . Now the wreaths are all in place . Through the small window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One by one Lizzia snuffs out the tapers . For a moment everything is left in the gray half-darkness . But now Lizzia draws aside the large black arras in the back . There is revealed a magnificent panoramic view of medieval Florence , flushing gradually from pearl-gray to soft , delicate rose , then to the full gold of accomplished sunrise . Again the old woman kneels at the altar . Enter , through the open doorway at back , Violante  --  rather tall , good-looking , quite dark . Violante stands silent for a moment . One can see that it is in her thought to wait till Lizzia finishes her devotions then she becomes impatient and breaks in on them . VIOLANTE Lizzia , where bides your master , Florio ? I sped a servant hither yesterday , To bid him come to me , and now , this morning , I come myself . p. 3 LIZZIA For three days he has looked upon no one.Even I , who wait upon him , have not seen him . VIOLANTE Where keeps he , then ? LIZZIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summon him forth ! Say the Lady Violante waits his presence . LIZZIA He will grow wroth with me  --  nor will he greet you . VIOLANTE Fears he , then , the Plague so ? Is he too suchAs dare not walk abroad nor breathe the airLest he should drink infection ? LIZZIA Not so , Lady , but he  --  VIOLANTE Tell him , then , Our friend Boccaccio , the story-teller , Has shaped a brave device against the Plague . Before the sun climbs higher into dayAnd the night 's Dead are heaped up in the streetsFor buriers and priests to draw away , A group of goodly ladies and gentlemenGo forth to a sequestered country place Remote from Florence and invisible Death.There , in green gardens full of birds and leaves , The blue , cloud-wandering heaven spread above , We shall beguile the time with merriment , Music and song and telling of many tales , Trusting that Death , glutted with multitudes , Will pass us by . We need but FlorioTo bring our perfect pleasure to the brim . p. 4 LIZZIA obstinatelyBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you.He is  --  he is  --  VIOLANTE Not smitten by the Plague ? LIZZIA hesitatingNay , he has taken a vow of close seclusion VIOLANTE confidentlyBut he knows not I am here  --  the Lady Violante ! A pause . ImpetuouslyGo , tell him it is I ,  --  Nor take upon yourself such high command ! LIZZIA somewhat resentfullyI am a servant , I only do as he commanded me . Barring way . VIOLANTE distractedlyStrange that he should so change in ten days ' space . With passionate abandonmentOld woman , go this instant  --  summon him ! I will abide your crabbed ways no longer . LIZZIA stung to retaliationLady , he would not look upon your face If you made him ruler of the world for it . VIOLANTE flamingWhat new freak of his is this ? He is as full of moods as any woman . But I had never thought  --  DeterminedI will go to him ! p. 5 LIZZIA again barring way I could tell you many things , But I would spare you . VIOLANTE Spare me ! you insolent , presumptuous old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugolini , To do with your good master , Florio , Beyond a fostering friendship for his song ! Else he were nothing to me . You are presuming on your age and service  --  He shall rebuke you for this . LIZZIA Very well , Lady , if you must know  --  He has sworn that he will look upon no oneTill he behold  --  Olivia ! VIOLANTE startledOlivia ! who is Olivia ? LIZZIA She is a girl who came from PaduaHither , to flee the Plague and fled in vain.He has loved her just ten days since first she came . She came to him , a stranger , singing songs  --  His songs ! VIOLANTE And flattering him so  --  he loved her ! LIZZIA Nay , she was beautiful , my noble lady ,  --  Surpassing wonderful . " His shining dreamOf ivory and gold , " he called her . VIOLANTE coldlyWhat has all this to do with me ? Relapsing into forgetful eagerness . Tell me , where , then , is his Olivia now ? p. 6 LIZZIA The Plague ! He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one who loves ! VIOLANTE And now he shuts himself away for griefBecause she died ! But , if she be dead , Wherefore these garlands ?  --  Or does he think she will come back , alive ? LIZZIA The learned doctor swears if she survives Three days , she shall not die . VIOLANTE Not die , in sooth ! Who is this man who resurrects the Dead ? Why , folk whose nerves and sinews sing with lifeSicken , fall down , and seethe with death and wormsWithin an hour , and they , the few who live , Living , curse God because they did not die . He would best think of the Living , and forgetThe Dead . LIZZIA Half-crazed with love , he dreams she will return . This is the morning after the third day  --  This is the very hour she would return . Suppose the learned doctor keep his word ?  --  Hence have I hung these garlands . The sounds of a funeral procession heard approaching . The procession passes the large doorway , going by , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They pass slowly by the open door bodies being carried in shrouds . ONE VOICE We bore the son and now we bear the father . p. 7 ANOTHER VOICE And I or you , mayhap , will be the next . LIZZIA continuingThese wreaths , they seem a mockery of Heaven.I pray that God will smite me not  --  I do What I am bid ! VIOLANTE half to herselfShe will not come ! To LizziaIs there nothing will cure his madness ? LIZZIA Even if she die they are to bring her hither . VIOLANTE Hither ? And all corrupt ? Then Death will strike you both ! LIZZIA Lady , I am so old I 'd rather sleepThan walk this sinful , weary world ; and be  --  He will unshroud her , kiss her lips , and die ! VIOLANTE with great bitternessFie , this our Florio  --  he has loved before , And he will love again , and yet again. Women 's beauty he loves , not any woman ! LIZZIA What you have said were true ten days ago  --  Do I not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I marvel at  --  So great a change in such a little while . Ah , looked you on them when they were together , Saw you how he is caught up in her face And all the beauty of her , you would say " Here is a love , at last , that climbs from earth to heaven ! " p. 8 VIOLANTE laughing harshlyIt is her beauty he loved ; not she The thing he loved ! A poet , he ! A pause . It were as well you tore these garlands down:If , by a miracle , she should return , The Plague will have marked her with such ugliness That even you will shine like Helen of Troy beside her ! Much will he care , then , if she sing his songs ! Had she a voice like a garden of night-ingalesHe could not listen to her without loathing . Sounds of approach of another funeral procession . VIOLANTE continuingPray draw the arras , Lizzia , and close outThe things that they bring by . They have begunTo move the night 's innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , till the very last , just before climax , sound and murmur of processions are continually heard . VIOLANTE persistentlyI think she will not come  --  But , if she does , she should be spared the crueltyOf his heart 's change , And he , her marred , plague-broken face ! Stand aside  --  let me pass LIZZIA barring way againHe took his oath Before that altar , to the most high God ! You shall not break his vow . p. 9 VIOLANTE Let me go to him  --  here are my jewels ! FLORIO calling from withinWho is it speaks without ? Whose voice is thisWrangling and breaking in upon my peace ? LIZZIA The Lady Violante Ugolini ! FLORIO To-day , of all days , must I be alone . Florio pushes out arras from small doorway and stands before it , so that he remains unseen to Violante and Lizzia . FLORIO to LizziaGo , Lizzia , I will speak with the Lady.Have you the wreaths hung , Lizzia ? LIZZIA Aye , master Florio ! FLORIO Have you the table heaped with delicaciesIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to set the viands now , my master . Lizzia goes out . FLORIO Violante , if you would speak with me , Stay where you are  --  I can not look upon you . VIOLANTE Not look upon me ? FLORIO Nor must you look on me . I have vowed a vow ! VIOLANTE How strange you are ! I had thought to rush into your arms ! . Have you forgotten so soon the oaths you took ? She starts toward him. p. 10 FLORIO hearing the rustle of her garment . Move one step further and I draw the arras ! VIOLANTE halting and hesitatingHave you forgotten the first time you saw my faceAnd sent a sonnet to me ? It seems but a daySince you were awed by my nobility And when I let you press your burning lipsAgainst my hand , you swore it made you God ! SadlyFrom that time it was not far to my mouth.And , after that , what with the shining moon , And nightingales beginning in the dusk , And songs and music that you made for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLORIO Remember that young nobleman who diedFor love of you ? I was your pastime , merely that ! And so I sipped what honey came my way.But why do you come now ? Did you not leave me without a word ? VIOLANTE My father SombrelyMy father whom the Pestilence has smitten  --  FLORIO quicklyYou sent me no message . VIOLANTE Every door was watched he might have had you slain He bore me off to Rome . p. 11 FLORIO You loved me , then ? VIOLANTE And did not you love me ? FLORIO I could have sworn I did . VIOLANTE O Florio ! Where is my pride of rank , my woman 's shame.That I should come like this to you ! FLORIO Speak not so , Violante  --  I pray you go ! VIOLANTE You love another , then ? FLORIO ecstaticallyI have loved beauty , beauty all my life ! VIOLANTE We are not metaphors and pale abstractions , We women nor would we be prized aloneFor smooth perfections Low and intenseSay that you loved a womanSmitten with the Plague , say , further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she came back to you , The one thing sure hideous and marred  --  FLORIO You try me sorely ! Violante , I pray you , go ! VIOLANTE persistentlyI have come hither To bid you come away with me . FLORIO It may not be . VIOLANTE slowlyThe other one  --  there is another one !  --  I pity her ! p. 12 FLORIO You need not . VIOLANTE Ah , then , there is another ? FLORIO Have you no pride , my Lady Violante ? VIOLANTE That I have not , For shameless is the heart that loves . FLORIO Then shamelessly I loveAnother face , another heart and body , Another soul , unto eternity  --  She is all beauty to me , and all life  --  So shall she be forever ! VIOLANTE Forever ? That is what you swore to me . FLORIO I have not sworn a single oath to her , And yet she made earth heaven in a day , And earth continues heaven . Go , noble Lady ! VIOLANTE You have no pity on me ? You seeHow humbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be cruel to her ! In a month you will be glad . VIOLANTE You have slain me , Florio ! FLORIO Farewell , Violante ! Violante affects to go . But she stops quickly at large door in back and renters on tiptoe . Florio withdraws to his study again , after listening for a moment. p. 13 LIZZIA renteringYou have not gone , my Lady Violante ? VIOLANTE I will not go Till I have looked upon this woman 's face ! As she finishes these words , the great black arras in the back is listed and a hooded and veiled woman enters . She stands regarding the two other women in silence . VIOLANTE Ah ! LIZZIA The miracle has come to pass ! Crosses herself . VIOLANTE Do they call you Olivia ? Speak , woman ! OLIVIA Yea , I am she  --  but where is Florio ? Violante straightens , proud and erect , as if she had been struck an invisible blow . LIZZIA He waits for you within . OLIVIA So he had faith I would not die ? LIZZIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath a holy vow , the daysYou were not here : shut in his room , Yours must be the first faceHe sees , on his return to light and life . He must have fallen asleep from wearinessOr he had heard your voice . To Violante . Now , Lady Violante , you must go ! p. 14 VIOLANTE indignantHow ? I must go ? LIZZIA You would not stay ? VIOLANTE Yea , I would stay to see this love grow darkAnd shrink to hate . OLIVIA astonishedAnd shrink to hate ? VIOLANTE When you remove your veil Behind which ugliness that beggars hell Lies hidden  --  OLIVIA dazedUgliness ? VIOLANTE Cast by your veil ! Well may you shrink from your own hideousnessSince the foul plague has withered up your faceAnd seared it till you die.There shines your mirror , wrought of polished brass  --  How many hours you have dallied at it Only the beauty that you once possessed Can tell.You will no longer find a use for it . OLIVIA recovering herself I trust I shall ! LIZZIA to OliviaAlas , dear God ! And is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me still if it were true ? LIZZIA to OliviaI am old and wretched and full of woe . I have known life too long . p. 15 VIOLANTE to OliviaHe whose on cry is beauty ! How could that be ? OLIVIA almost singing in speechThen , God be praised , I need not try him thus ! For God has wrought two miracles with me:I live , and I am beautiful ! VIOLANTE Unveil your face , then  --  give yourself to sight . OLIVIA His must be the first eyes that look on me . VIOLANTE Ah , so you trust that you , with fond deceit , May find some magic way to cozen him ? LIZZIA with great emotionGo , Lady  --  I see darkness in the air , I thrill to some strange horror , yet unguessed.Go , Lady Violante , I pray you , go ! Lizzia lifts arras in back for Violante 's exit . Violante does not move from where she stands . VIOLANTE persistently , to OliviaWoman it is your beauty that he loved , And that alone just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love is gone ! OLIVIA Strange woman , there is evil in your voice ! And yet I know he loves me for myself , Taking my beauty , none the less , in gladnessLike any transitory gift from God . p. 16 VIOLANTE And yet you dare not put him to the test ? OLIVIA What test ? VIOLANTE To make him first believeThat you are ugly ! OLIVIA I would not toy with such a splendid gift As a man 's love . VIOLANTE mockingAh in sooth ? OLIVIA How strange you look yet stranger is your speech . VIOLANTE Before you came  --  whom loved he then ? OLIVIA I do not think he was like other men . VIOLANTE Like other men he took and tossed aside , Deceived and lied and went from heart to heartReaping the richness of each woman 's soul . OLIVIA Go , lest I strike you ! VIOLANTE Poor , fond , believing child  --  Now I would not have you test his love ! OLIVIA stirredBy all the saints , I 'll put him to the test ! As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look upon my face He must , as I have vowed , look on it first , Nor will I break that vow  --  Her vanity conqueringBut lift you mirrorAnd you shall look in it and see me thereReflected ! Violante lifts mirror so she and Lizzia can see reflection. p. 17 OLIVIA with simplicityKeep your backs so ! Unveiling briefly , then drawing veil again . There ! Have I lied ? VIOLANTE He always worshiped beauty . You are fair ! OLIVIA Soon will you know our love has mighty wingsOutsoaring time into eternity ! VIOLANTE I 'll have him forth  --  are you ready for the trial ? OLIVIA Do you persuade him of my ugliness.If he loves me not I shall go forth and die  --  Then life will be far too like death to live ! LIZZIA agonizedMy little children , you must not do this thing ! Love is too high a gift to play with so . God only has the right to put the heart Of man to trial ! VIOLANTE to LizziaWill you be quiet , old woman ! OLIVIA to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not me . The test is just . VIOLANTE to LizziaGo you , inform him of her return . But tell him that that flower which was her faceIs shriveled up and lean as any hag's. p. 18 LIZZIA Now God forbid I should deceive him so ! VIOLANTE Not even for gold ? LIZZIA Have you no fear of God ? A stir is heard within . VIOLANTE Hush ! I will do it , then . Going up to small arras over study door , she calls . Florio ! Florio ! FLORIO from within , after a brief spaceWho is it calls me ? VIOLANTE It is I , Violante ! FLORIO Why have you come again ? VIOLANTE I have returned , Florio , In strange times , bearing strange news . FLORIO My soul is full of death  --  I pray you go ! VIOLANTE It could not be  --  aye , it is passing strange !  --  She said her name was " Olivia . " FLORIO Olivia , ah , she lives ! VIOLANTE Then , it is true ? You love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent and gray  --  a woman Who says in as few words she is your mistress . p. 19 FLORIO Has she come ? Is she here ? Go , Violante  --  Go , leave us two alone ! VIOLANTE She walked as one bewitched in a dream . She seemed to fear . I bade her wait withoutFlorio , could it be true you loved this woman ? FLORIO Has all the brightness fallen from her eyes , The glory and the wonder form her face ? VIOLANTE She lives ! How few have had the plague and lived ! FLORIO Alas , woe , woe , is me ! VIOLANTE triumphantly , to OliviaYou heard ? To Florio . Come forth  --  she 's at the threshold . FLORIO Bid her wait . Give me space for thought a little spaceThis is almost as horrible as her death Long silence . The women wait Groaning within . Olivia starts forward to go to Florio . VIOLANTE to OliviaDo you flinch now ? I knew you would not dare ! Olivia stops . Proudly she remains still . VIOLANTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 20 OLIVIA in a frightened voice I know he loves me . Yet a little while And I will draw my veil ! Another groan . Olivia starts forward again . Oh , I can not ! VIOLANTE mockingI knew you would not dare ! Again Olivia stops still.Now , after a long pause , during which death processions are heard to pass , the arras over the smaller doorway is slowly put aside . Florio enters , swaying . He holds his cloak about his brow . FLORIO Where is Olivia ? OLIVIA feigning with an effortFlorio , God pity you and me  --  I had rather died ! FLORIO Oh , speak not so ! OLIVIA My " beauty clean and golden as the sun , " As once you sang it , has become so gross And fearful , that I veil it , broken with shame , From eyes of men . A pause . ' T is well you cloak your eyes , For should I drop my veil through whichI glance  --  Another pause . Shall I go ? FLORIO breathing heavilyNo for I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul , Olivia ! As he still stands muffled , Olivia grows more and more frightened at what she is doing , and now , in complete surrender to terror , gives over the deceit and speaks the truth. p. 21 OLIVIA Florio , my Florio  --  draw down your arm.No longer need you fear to look on me  --  It was a test , my love , a cruel test ! She draws aside her veil , the other women in back of her , Florio obliquely in front . Her face is seen to be one of surpassing loveliness.Florio , groaning , keeps his face cloaked and does not speak . OLIVIA Look , my beloved , or I shall go mad ! Olivia tugs at his arm . He lowers it . He exposes a sightless face . LIZZIA breaking in on the awful pause.Self-blinded , my poor master ! VIOLANTE Oh , Florio , what is this that I have done ! Olivia has dropped slowly back , stricken dumb with voiceless terror.Her throat works convulsively with a scream which now rushes forth.Florio falls to his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivia comes and kneels , griefstricken , beside him , putting one arm about him in support . OLIVIA sobbingThere is no one that 's uglier than I ! FLORIO convulsivelyYou were the glory of the world , Olivia ! And now your beauty that is dead will always be to me The glory of the world ! forever and forever ! p. 22 OLIVIA Oh , if you could but see my ugliness  --  I think there 's nothing like it in the world ! O God , why did I not die an hour ago ! VIOLANTE crazed anew with jealousyFlorio , Florio  --  Olivia lies ! Her beauty floods the very room with light  --  You are deceived most horribly ! OLIVIA Command that woman hence ; She is the source and cause of all our ill . FLORIO What does this mean ? My soul is sick to death ! VIOLANTE I tell you , Florio , that she lies to you . To Lizzia . Tell him the truth , old woman , and beware , As you have fear of Hell , belief in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ! LIZZIA at first frightened and irresolute , then quietly determined . God help me  --  she is surpassingly  --  ugly ! Returning Violante glare for glare . Her ugliness  --  ! Breaking down , she goes to altar and drops on knees before it . FLORIO Go , Violante ! VIOLANTE I could curse God for this ! Violante staggers toward the great black curtain in doorway , where she supports herself by clinging to it. p. 23 FLORIO Olivia , come back to me from the great Dark  --  All life is but a ghost . Where are you , Olivia ? OLIVIA I am here  --  close to you , Florio ! FLORIO What have you women done to me ! To Olivia . You face ! An evil dream is in my heart ! He gropes , catches her quickly on each side of the head with both hands . He draws her down to him . He runs his fingers flickeringly over the smooth , rosy beauty of her face Then , with an eyeless , uplifted countenance which reveals complete understanding and an abyss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lifts his fingers up grotesquely in the air , each distinct and widespread  --  painfully , as if fire spurted out of the ends of them . Olivia weeps . Lizzia intones prayers . Violante holds herself erect and triumphant , clinging to the great arras in back , struggling for strength to go out . At this moment another death-procession passes . A Miserere is chanted . A dawn of horror breaks over Violante 's face she shrinks in ward from the passing procession , feeling the huge horror of the Pestilence . Olivia gathers Florio 's unresisting head to her bosom . The sound of the Miserere dies off . Into this tableau breaks Dioneo . Slowly he parts the arras. p. 24 DIONEO grimacing , and seeing , at first , only Lizzia at the altar . Bestir yourself , old woman  --  Where is your master , Florio , And Lady Violante Ugolini ? This is no time for lovers ' dallying . Tell them that Seignior BoccaccioSends word through me that we must wait no longer.And , furthermore , he bids me say  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees all . Shrinking back.
