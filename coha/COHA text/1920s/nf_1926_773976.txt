txt 6o CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK kilowatt hours are required to fix a ton of nitrogen . This limited the plants to such countries as Norway , where electric energy is available in large blocks at attractive figures . Obviously this was not the final solution to the fixed nitrogen problem , for , from the point of view of some nations , while it was better to have two sources of nitrogen than but one away off in Chile it is still better to have a little fixed nitrogen plant in your home . The next process to reach commercial perfection is known as the cyanamide , introduced in 1906 , and depending upon the fact that when calcium carbide in pulverized and brought in contact with nitrogen such as may be distilled from liquid air a certain quantity of the nitrogen will be fixed . This process requires some 14,500 kilowatt hours per ton of nitrogen fixed , could be operated profitably in many places , and prior to 1912 was used more extensively than any other method for the fixation of nitrogen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power becomes expensive as our coal resources are used and new demands arise for it ; so research continued in its effort to find a still more efficient method . Ammonia contains one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen in each molecule . Why not cause these gases to combine to produce ammonia , which can be oxidized to nitric acid and a whole list of things made from these two raw materials ? Neither of these gases is inclined to be active . They prefer to lead individual lives , and so difficult was it believed to be to cause them to combine that at one time great chemists of the world regarded the synthesis of ammonia as impossible . However , that was before Haber , Le Rossignol and Bosch with their co-workers demonstrated that at certain high temperatures and pressures a catalyst would cause these gases to unite so readily as to be the basis of a successful commercial process . The nitrogen was obtained by burning the oxygen out of the air and purifying the residual gas . The hydrogen could be obtained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through incandescent coke . The result is a mixture of hydrogen , carbon monoxide and dioxide . The carbon monoxide reacting furFOOD AND FAMINE CI ther with water forms carbon dioxide and hydrogen . However , the catalyst is sensitive to oxides of carbon and to water , and these must be removed . The carbon dioxide is removed by scrubbing at 50 atmospheres pressure with cold water , while one method of removing the carbon monoxide is to use an iron chromium catalyst and cause the carbon monoxide to form ammonium formate . This process for hydrogen , the first used , is so expensive to operate that 70% of the cost of the finished ammonia is represented by the operation ; 20% in the making of the gases , and 50% in their purification . Claude of France found that he could make hydrogen from coal gas by liquefying it , recovering the benzol and toluol which helped to pay for the operation , and finally separating the hydrogen from the carbon monoxide by a process of gas liquefaction . The carbon monoxide secured is burned or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , say , $ro.00 per horsepower per year , current may be used to decompose water , giving an extremely pure gas ; but this is not cheap and to date this process has been employed only where synthetic ammonia could be sold , as such , for refrigeration or other purposes at prices which returned a good profit on investment and operation . The temperatures used in the synthesis of ammonia are on the order of 500 degrees C. and the pressures from roo to 900 atmospheres , depending on the process . At the high pressures small reaction chambers can be used , good yields obtained , and the catalysts do not appear to be so readily poisoned by impurities in the gases . The synthetic ammonia process requires at present four thousand kilowatt hours per ton of nitrogen fixed , and with improvements in catalysts , by which is meant increased yield , resistance to poisoning , ruggedness , and long life , the tendency is constantly toward processes essentially chemical with lower power requirements . There is ample evidence that , whereas power was a deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheap and pure , is the controlling factor to-day . The power used need not be electrical . // In the neighborhood of blast furnaces , from which great quantities of carbon dioxide are thrown into the air , experiments have been conducted with that gas which indicate that it does have a very decided influence upon plant growth . As yet , this has only been tried on small plots and there seems no immediate prospect of its commercial application ; but we can not tell when this established fact may come to be important economically . Methods are being sought for causing plants to store more calcium in a form which animals can assimilate . It seems to have been proven that sulfur is an important soil ingredient , that iron and manganese have their uses , so that agronomists of the future may need to be acquainted with the significance of a much wider range of elements than is represented by the old formula of three numerals which signifies the percentage available of nitrogen , phosphoric acid , and potash in a commercial fertilizer . The chemist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to stock feeding . It has been shown that the calcium so important in our diet and largely derived from milk is taken from the skeleton of the cow ; hence our interest in learning how to make available through the diet other calcium to keep the animal in healthy condition . The race horses of Kentucky are noted the world over and the blue grass of Kentucky contains a larger quantity of available calcium to strengthen the skeleton of the horse than is commonly found elsewhere . Chemistry has also helped to establish some important economic facts in animal feeding , for it has been shown that there comes a time when a steer literally eats his head off , for without change in feed he proceeds to replace with water a part of the fat previously accumulated at no little expense to its owner . Just as traces of elements are important in the soil , so also they are important in animal metabolism , though the full story is not yet known . The chemist has helped to make a promising start on the chemistry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have already been synthesized . Enthusiasts // predict that with a more complete knowledge of the chemistry of these glands will come the ability not only to control growth , but in the case of the human being to influence mental development as well and perhaps control sex . Indeed , if the prediction of these workers should come true , the power conferred through this work might be greater than the race could properly administer . No discussion of food and famine could fail at least to mention the much advertised vitamin . While vitamins seem to have been isolated , we are not yet certain of their composition , and no doubt even yet some workers are undecided as to whether they are chemical compounds , enzymes , a form of energy or what not . Some even doubt their importance in nutrition which others ascribe to them ; but feeding experiments , not only with animals but with large groups of children , would seem to confirm the view that the vitamins , of which we now list several , are an essential accessory to the diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cod liver oil can now be assured that it is the fat soluble vitamin A , while in many quarters the dairyman stands in awe of this same unidentified body contained in the cream , but not in the skimmed milk . It is an essential to body growth . Many a sailor has suffered from scurvy , not knowing that it was the scarcity of the anti-scorbutic vitamin that led to his undoing . Beginning with vitamin A , the list already extends to E , and we have been on speaking terms with vitamins only a short time . Recent work has shown that an oil , such as cottonseed , which has no vitamin A , can acquire the properties of a vitamin A bearing oil if exposed to ultra violet light . Rickets in infants is now cured by sunlight direct or through quartz windows or by vitamin A bearing foods . The isolation and possible synthesis of fat soluble A is economically important , for we shall soon be confronted with new problems of milk supply involving shipping from distant sources for which even pasteurization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried as to leave its // physiological properties unimpaired finds its way to the market by the ton , and when it is learned how to add to skimmed milk , which contains vitamin R , the requisite amounts of vitamin A the problem will be simplified . Then , with the aid of a vegetable fat , milk can be made each day to order . Fats oxidize , causing rancidity , and while dried whole milk may be kept for months , dried skimmed milk may be kept indefinitely . There is , therefore , steady employment awaiting an inexpensive concentrate of the vitamin A or its synthetic duplicate . The chemist is also helping in the matter of soil selection . Soil analysis , the physical condition of the soil and its acidity will be important factors when increase in population makes it necessary to allocate soils for particular crops . It has already been learned within what limits of acidity smooth scab-free potatoes may be raised . Organic indicators show by the color change how acid the soil is and this shows what quantity of lime to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfur that can be used to advantage to correct that condition , depending upon the needs of a special crop . Strange to say , so violent a reagent as sulfuric acid has been used experimentally on the alkali soils , where it not only corrected excess alkalinity , but happily produced an improved physical condition . Just as three groups of chemical compounds have dominated the consideration of soil fertility , so also three groups have , until recently , held the center of the stage in human nutrition . Fat , protein , and carbohydrates have received most of the attention . Then came a discussion of calories , which still contend with vitamins for first place in the food discussions , having become so popular that some restaurants are accustomed to indicate on the bill of fare how many calories each item carries per single portion . Methods for adding weight and means for losing weight have all been based on calories ; but now the physiological chemist wants to know not only fat , protein , carbohydrates , calories , and vitamins , but how the foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products will be , the chemistry of their utilization by the body , // and their general influence on body growth and repair . For example , amino acids , of which cystine is one , are known to play a vital part in nutrition . In the study of the influence of foods upon health , it was found that the carbohydrates ? the sugars and starches ? which have an even number of carbon atoms in their molecules are the ones which form acetone , leading to acidosis , fatal to the diabetic . Therefore , if a food having the calories to give strength to the patient could be devised with molecules with odd numbers of carbon atoms , this disastrous result might be avoided . Fortunately , this has been accomplished in the chemical laboratory and developed to commercial production . Of late , extensive studies have been initiated on the place of certain foods in the diet . Just what part does milk play in the diet of an adult , for example ? What is the place of meat , of bread , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk which an infant can digest and that which causes distress has been determined . Every characteristic of human milk was established and upon these facts infant foods were built up from a mixture of fats and other ingredients selected on the basis of what the work on human milk had shown to be essential . The resulting food is correct in scientific principle and approved by the medical profession . It has been instrumental in seeing many an individual through the difficult days of babyhood . Such studies as are in progress on milk , meat , and bread should be extended to other staples , especially those of comparatively high cost . Many consider sugar the most concentrated form of food and at the normal price the least expensive . A chemical study of the diet of various tribes and peoples serves to explain conditions otherwise mysterious , and if the prejudices and- fastidiousness of some peoples can be overcome , this information should be helpful in planning a rational , economical diet . Many have pitied the oriental with his monotonous diet of fish , soya or mong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orient performs a prodigious amount of // work on a diet which seems starvation rations to the occidental . One difference has been found to lie in the soya or mong bean as compared with the American Navy bean . The former in the digestive tract produces the types of amino acids of the greatest help to the body , while the Navy bean does not . Problems of production , of balanced rations , of the most nutritious foods , and of diets chosen with relation to health , important as they are , do not touch upon another vital point . It has frequently been argued that the population of the world will be limited by the quantity of food that can be produced and this in turn will be determined by the amount of rainfall . We are therefore urged to preserve our forests , which are known to have a direct bearing upon rainfall . There is another fact , namely , whether man will be astute enough to win in his fight with insects and fungi for the possession of the fruits of his labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By treating seed wheat with solutions of formalin or formalde hyde , for example , certain smuts can be overcome . Seed po tatoes are also given the formalin bath and it is prescribed for other seeds as well . Similarly , copper compounds have been employed to destroy the spores of fungi or of bacteria or the eggs of insects to be found among the seed waiting to destroy the plant long before harvest time . Lurking in the soil may be the hibernating boll weevil , or some of his distant kin , ready to spring into activity with the coming of warm days and spring rains . The more common insects like the potato beetle are known to all , and their ravages have been stopped by compounds of copper such as Paris green or of lead , like lead arsenate , by calcium arsenate , oil emulsions which cover the invader and prevent his breathing , and compounds designed to poison him when he eats or those which poison the dew and get him when he drinks . There are other insects more difficult , as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is very resistant , being helped by nature , which oddly enough causes far more females than males to hatch from a given lot of eggs and so // helps the tribe increase . Modern transportation , which has brought us so many blessings in other ways , has harmed us in the fight on insects . Insects brought from afar find in the absence of natural enemies an ideal home and frequently spread with great rapidity before a destructive parasite can be introduced against . them or methods of spraying and dusting devised to halt them . The Japanese beetle is an example of this experience , and having gained a foothold in New Jersey , progresses on an average of six miles per year in an ever widening circle apparently oblivious of the millions of dollars that have been spent to seek its downfall . In Japan this beetle is not found in important numbers . The spread of the corn borer has been facilitated by the automobile , and our almost losing battle against the brown tail and gypsy moths , the chestnut blight , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions are all serious from many points of view , and the chemist is cooperating with the entomologist and the botanist in an effort to devise effective methods of warfare . Researches are in progress on sulfur known to be efficient as an insecticide and fungicide ; but just why it should be is not yet known . When this point has been made clear , perhaps our weapons may be made more effective against the tiny invader . Then there is the question of the adherence of these reagents upon the plants they are intended to protect . A limiting factor in dusting cotton against the boll weevil has been the expense due to the necessity of repeating the operations after a rainfall . If a method could be devised to have a sufficient quantity adhere to the plant , one or at the most two dustings might suffice for the season . At present dusting is at frequent intervals depending in a measure on the weather . Physical chemistry may play an important part here . The physical chemist would tell you that the green leaves of plants have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electrical world , a dust or liquid to adhere ought to have the opposite charge . He experimented with lead arsenate and found that when made // with a positive charge the material adhered wonderfully well . It has been noted that dusts discharged under certain conditions from airplanes seem to acquire a certain tiny electrical force on their particles which has promoted adherence . If we could combine persistent adherence with dust delivered from airplanes over large areas , a great victory would be gained . Some years ago , a catalpa grove near Toledo was dusted from an airplane and this effectively disposed of the caterpillars . The airplane is on trial as a dusting machine for southern cotton fields and given an economical dust or spray may one day be used with great effect over great forest areas now threatened by certain enemies of our trees . It has already been approved for large area dusting . Dips have also been devised by the chemist as an aid to overcome the cattle tick , the bane of stock raising in the South , and various insects which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been most effective against hog cholera , frequently saving great numbers of animals in a single season , and are comparable in value with the results from the use of insecticides and fungicides . And when we have raised our crop and fattened our hogs , we have not finished . Some years 75% of the sweet potato crop is destroyed by little understood diseases before it reaches the table . Not only must such losses in storage be prevented ; but we are in constant need of methods of preserving food and still leave it desirable for human food . The differences between bacteria and man are so slight that those things which are sure to kill the bacteria may be very harmful to those consuming the food . Formaldehyde is a perfect preservative for milk , but can not be used on account of its poisonous character . The controversy over sodium benzoate is based on the same consideration . Refrigeration , universally employed in the preserving of food since it retards bacterial and mold growth , may be said to depend upon chemistry , since most of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liquid ammonia , and we already use numbers of individual refrigerating systems installed // in household refrigerators and depending upon some such chemical compounds as ethyl chloride , carbon dioxide , ammonia , sulfur dioxide , and similar gases capable of easy liquefaction . Employing chemical principles a refrigerator has been devised in which ammonia is driven by heat from a solid absorbing medium , cools by expansion and is absorbed again . This is in reality a gas or electrically fired refrigerator ! Sterilization by heat , as in the process of canning food , and pasteurization at lower temperatures are at the basis of a great deal of our food preservation . Evaporation , as in sun drying of fruits or dehydration , which involves the removal of moisture by a method which leaves the cells of the fruit substantially unchanged , play their important parts . Dehydration seems to have a promising future . In many parts of the world we still insist on first quality only , leaving a great waste in the form of undersized , discolored , or misshapen fruit and vegetables which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old fashioned prune and the evaporated apple pie ; but dehydrated materials are of another generation . In ordinary drying , the outer layer of the material readily gives up its moisture , thereby forming a sort of leathery covering through which the remaining moisture is extracted with such difficulty that the outer cells are destroyed in the drying process . When water is added , this material never assumes anything like its original form . Now dehydration may be done with air , the moisture of which is so regulated that it is nearly that of the material being dried , the difference being adjusted so that the moisture will be gradually drawn from a fruit or vegetable . This gives a product which , when water is added , very closely resembles the fresh material in size , color , and flavor . The drying of milk , to which reference has been made , is another instance of the importance of removing water as one step in preservation which also has an economic bearing in the matter of storage and freight . Milk , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some vegetables 95% . In preservation , containers of glass and of tin have been de70 CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK vised to meet most of the requirements . Extensive studies have been conducted on the relation of the coating of sheet tin on cans to the serviceability of the can , its pitting due to acids characteristic of fruits , and to discoloration which sometimes occurs , as , for example , with corn . The importance of vacuum has been studied , the heat penetration in such cans has been made the basis of research , while the chemical composition of the contents in its relation to the container is always under consideration . Waxed paper liners have been devised for some packages , such as those containing sea foods , and both varnishes and enamels have been devised for other types of cans . The relation of kinds of glass and the light rays permitted to reach food in glass containers is another research problem , as is the production of glass to withstand high temperature processing and mechanical handling . Sugar , not ordinarily considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oxygen , is a well known preservative , as is also salt ( sodium chloride ) and vinegar , known chemically as acetic acid . Oil , whether olive or cottonseed , is extensively used ; note sardines . Eggs also receive special consideration , for the nature of the shell makes it possible to utilize a chemical reaction for their preservation . If air is prevented from entering the egg , it may be kept suitable for use for a very much longer time than if air has ready access to the egg . The pores of the egg shell may be effectively coated with a silicate which seals , and this is the basis for the well known plan of " putting the eggs down " in sodium silicate or water glass as it is popularly known . Eggs have also been kept in oil , such as prime cottonseed , and before these methods were known and the reasons for them , it was customary to pack them in salt or sawdust . Great quantities of eggs are also dried , particularly duck eggs in China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health through the inspection of foodstuffs and the drawing of regulations based on scientific work which govern methods and materials which can be used in preparing , preserving , or FOOD AND FAMINE 7I otherwise treating food for human consumption . A great deal of research has been done on this subject , for exact methods must be worked out to enable the inspector , for example , to tell the difference between a really fresh egg and one which has been held in such good storage that it does not show the evidence of its advanced age in the way even a layman can detect . The effect of certain coloring matters on the health have been determined and the chemists have devised harmless food colors which have been approved , thereby enabling you to have a green cake on St. Patrick 's day or a red , white , and blue one on February 22nd , if that is your pleasure . Where milk preservatives can be approved , limits have been set on the quantity permissible , and by a system of inspection , analysis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater extent than that of any other country . Those responsible for this work frequently meet with amusing experience . A Chinese importer in Boston , for example , could not understand why the food inspectors would not permit a shipment of eggs from China to pass . These duck eggs preserved in a heavy coating of clay when opened disclosed black contents and showed a tendency to explode . This seemed evidence to the importer of prime condition , of a great delicacy ; but he could not convince the chemist . The question often arises to what extent will the chemist , who claims so large a share in the work of the world , be able to supplement our food resources when supplies become short . To this the chemist replies by pointing with pride to hydrogenation , a catalytic process which enables an atom or two of hydrogen to be added to the molecule of a liquid fat such as peanut or cottonseed oil to form a lard-like hard fat suitable for culinary purposes . He points to vanillin , the active principle of vanilla made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day vanilla extract . So popular is this flavor that if the old source were to be relied upon , vanilla beans having come principally from Mexico , it would require the resources of fifty Mexicos to meet the present day demand . Special food such as the // odd carbon atom fat described above is of the same class , and while most chemists do not look forward to a time when the laboratory will replace the farm and garden , it is quite possible that in future the agriculturists will produce types of raw material like certain starches , sugars , and proteins , which , under chemical supervision , will be converted into concentrated types of inexpensive foods of which to-day we can no more than dream . Saccharin , the sweet coal tar product widely used as a sugar substitute or supplement , has no food value ; but in future the laboratories may find a way to produce a substance of concentrated sweetness that shall have food value . But for a long time to come the principal contributions of the chemist to increasing food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better understanding of plant needs , and improved processes for preservation and transportation . There is always the possibility of developing new sources of food . One tribe or nation may include in its diet an item quite unknown to other peoples , and modern transportation is gradually introducing such new items into the diets of all people . Occasionally an entirely new source may be uncovered . An example is the recent work which seems to demonstrate the possibility of making levulose on a commercial scale from a descendant of the Jerusalem artichoke . Levulose is one of the numerous family of sugars , is sweeter than sucrose ( cane sugar ) , and is so readily soluble that it may dissolve in moisture absorbed from the atmosphere . This introduces a problem in storage and handling levulose , but it is not an insuperable one . The Jerusalem artichoke is a well-known weed , but it is the ancestor of the mammoth white French Jerusalem artichoke already recognized as a valuable stock food and offering such advantages in cultivation , storage , and general utility as to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a food crop as well as for the raw material of levulose manufacture . Another consideration is the part played in cost reduction . The value of stockyard by-products is a story giving basis for // the old saw that nothing was lost save the squeal , to which the paper man replied in speaking of his raw material , the tree , that nothing was wasted , not even the bark . In the citrus fruit industry , losses have been avoided by the application of chemistry to by-products including citric acid , lemon oil , and pectin made from culls and surplus fruit . In beet sugar , the pulp goes into stock food and the molasses may be a source of alcohol , cyanides and potash . The waste molasses of the cane industry constitute our greatest source of raw material for industrial alcohol . Potatoes are also used for the production of alcohol ; but in this case a special variety containing too much starch to adapt it for human food has been evolved for the particular purpose . Agriculture , being the oldest industry , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to establish so many facts during its thousands of years of existence that it accepts the proffered aid of science with some hesitancy . We may be sure that whatever has been accomplished so far is but the beginning and in agricultural research there remain great opportunities for patient , persistent workers . These problems are in entomology , phytopathology , plant breeding , soil science , animal husbandry , ? in all of which the chemist will find room for his work . The world is to be searched for special kinds of plants for peculiar locations where moisture conditions , soil conditions , times of frost and winds are major considerations . We can go back profitably and inquire whether the early breeding of certain wild strains of swine has given us the best that might be had by a careful selection of parents for a new race of hogs . There are tremendous wastes in the agricultural industry which , if they are to be conserved , will have to find employment in industries essentially chemical . Already some success has met the efforts of those endeavoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish natural manure from chemical fertilizers for special uses . The protein content of wheat is not increased by present fertilizers and ways must be found for emphasizing the particular content of a plant // just as has been shown possible with corn where oil , starch , or protein can be varied with fertilization and methods of cultivation or as starch has been emphasized in a certain strain of German potatoes . Surely in agriculture , in the work to constantly render the world more immune to the attacks of famine , chemistry , having already demonstrated its potentialities in this service , is destined to find an unusual opportunity for the employment of its talents . CHAPTER V CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHEMISTRY TO CLOTH AND CLOTHING IT IS only in rare instances that the products of nature are considered satisfactory for the needs of men . They must be changed in some particular to facilitate manufacture , or perhaps it is a question of refining or otherwise changing dimensions , color , and other characteristics . In no general field is this more true than in the production of textiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions of chemistry in this work have been with the preparation of natural fibers and supplying finishes for the completed cloth to give some particular feel or finish . During the last few years , the chemist has proceeded to produce the fiber itself in quantities so large that the market for certain natural fibers is being threatened . Of course , chemistry , although unrecognized as such , has always played a part in the manufacture of textiles , just as other industries from time immemorial have been founded on chemical processes , though not so called . Primitive soaps , for example , were made with lye leached from hardwood ashes and animal fat . The modern method of producing soaps used in the manufacture and later in the cleansing of textiles is based upon the same chemical principles ; but the work now proceeds under definite chemical control with more specialized objects in view , such as the provision of a soap with selected characteristics for special purposes . Primitive bleaching came down practically unchanged to within less than one hundred years of our day , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bleaching occurred with the release of small quantities of hydrogen peroxide produced under the natural conditions of light and moisture . How impossible it would be to spread the miles of 75 // cloth now made upon the grass to bleach , waiting patiently until nature could turn the trick and having at hand many people who could quickly roll up the cloth and put it under cover in case of stormy weather . There was little danger of overbleaching with its resultant tender fiber in the days when sunshine and dew did the work ; but overbleaching only occurs where operatives have been careless or where the chemist 's control is either absent or imperfect . To-day with ozone , hydrogen peroxide , or chlorine a satisfactory bleach may be secured without injury to the cloth in a very few minutes and production is not impeded . At one time , it was thought that even bleaching with chlorine required some forty-eight hours ; then a chemist showed that a smaller number of minutes would suffice and that probably the reaction proper took place in a few seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in process , and similar factors contribute to lower prices of white goods . The primitive dyes were vegetable , animal , and mineral substances . Logwood still furnishes a favorite dye for black silk . Indigo continues to be produced on the fields of India , and alizarine was for hundreds of years derived solely from the madder root . To-day we find these dyes made as chemical products , the result of chemical research , and they are the molecular equivalents of the natural product . Tyrian purple and cochineal are examples of pigments from animal sources . Tyrian purple was secured with the aid of a viscous fluid , a drop or two of which was obtained from the dorsal vein of a shell fish , Murex , found along the Mediterranean . The financial power of Tyre and Carthage depended to a large extent upon the monopoly in 71'yrian purple , and near the sites of those ancient cities piles of Murex shells have been found by archaeologists . Those must have been the days when slaves were required to take great risks in bringing in huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-day we know this Tyrian purple to have been dibromindigo and dibromindigo of superior quality has been produced in American chemical factories . The resulting purple is more fast to light and washing , more homogeneous // in quality , and more pleasing in the range of its shades than anything which a Roman Emperor could command . An obvious modern contribution of chemistry to textiles is the chemical rainbow . With an improvement in the quality of man-made dyes and the increase in the number of colors and shades , there has been a decided tendency toward employing color with a lavish hand . The manufacturers of the better textiles maintain their position by employing skilled designers , trained in the art schools at home and abroad , who constantly devise new patterns , new combinations of color , and unusual figures which become the mode of the moment . The enthusiasm of these designers is sometimes embarrassing to the chemist , for fashion may decree a certain shade on a given fabric without taking into consideration the commercial possibility of doing a satisfactory piece of dyeing . The dyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business naturally uses whatever reagents may be at hand , sometimes with results which bring discredit to the manufacturer of dyes . However , he least of all deserves it . For example , a lady purchased a beautiful blouse , the material being a heavy silk attractive in an all over pattern both new and novel . The first time it was worn she found that even a handkerchief lightly brushed on the surface of the blouse came away colored pink . The goods had simply been padded , by which is meant lightly dyed on the surface probably with a top color which in combination with underlying shades helped to produce the unique effect . There had been no attempt to secure permanence . The story of synthetic dyes has become known to nearly every one because the coal tar colors have sprung into international importance , and beginning with the time when the Central Powers endeavored to harass America by denying to her the colors needed , the technical and daily press have been filled with arguments on all phases of the dye question from their fastness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be sufficient , therefore , to say that the coal tar colors were discovered by Perkin , an Englishman , who , // while engaged upon an effort to synthesize quinine , found he could make mauve . Seizing upon the idea and bringing into their country some of those who had assisted in the work , the Germans began to specialize in coal tar colors , devoting to their development a colossal amount of high grade research consistently backed by liberal financing . One after another new colors were prepared , their method of application standardized , and research turned in other directions . Since perhaps 8o% of the world 's goods is dyed black or blue and as indigo , formerly obtained principally from India , is the largest single item , the synthesis of this material in the laboratory made a strong appeal to the German scientists . It has been said that over a period of five years research was concentrated upon this problem and 29,000,000 of gold marks expended before indigo had been produced . The contact process for the manufacture of sulfuric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for large quantities of cheap acid are necessary . Failure threatened until a clumsy assistant left to watch one step in the experimental work broke a thermometer and it was found that the presence of mercury was required to obtain the end sought . Coal tar colors have not only been developed to the point where more than a thousand and one are listed , but research continues for the simple reason that certain qualities not now possessed by some of the groups would be highly desirable . As knowledge is increased in new directions , whole families of new colors may be brought into existence . We already have nearly thirty classes of synthetic organic dyestuffs , some with names as long as a line on this page . One of the most important is a group of indanthrenes distinguished by their great permanence and fastness even to boiling in bleaching solutions . As new fibers have been provided , some have called for new classes of dyestuffs , and the combination of fibers used in textile novelties presents complex problems to the dyer . Sometimes a number of fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for a particular pattern with the express purpose of dyeing the gray goods with colors so selective in their action that a large variety // of color combinations to meet the fancy of fashion may be made on short notice . Of course , color may be applied to the fiber before it is spun into yarn . The yarn itself may be dyed or the piece of goods may be dyed after weaving , this method being known as piece dyeing . Frequently color is printed on cloth from engraved copper or other rolls , each of which applies a particular color as in any other printing operation . The dyes are made into inks with some readily soluble vehicle like glucose , without which sharp demarcations at the borderline of colors would be impossible . Sizes may also be used to prevent the spread of color through capillary absorption . Novel effects are also obtained by the use of chemical compounds , which discharge color from the spots where they are applied . A piece of goods may be dyed , therefore , and delicate patterns worked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes a pile fabric like plush may be either topped with some color which just touches the tips of the pile fibers or , conversely , the color may be discharged from these tips , producing a pleasing effect . This method , for example , enables an elegant silk pile fabric to be dyed to closely imitate all the colors of natural sealskin , so that when the fibers are parted , they show the peculiar yellowish brown tint characteristic of dyed sealskins . Starches and gums are important to the textile manufacturer , for they enable him to produce a wide variety of finishes without which it might be difficult to dispose of his wares , even though the pattern and the workmanship commend themselves . Textile finishing is an art in itself , highly developed , and the basis of prosperity of a number of large mills . In the treatment of each fiber , we find several chemical processes . Wool is scoured and the animal fat removed by washing in hot soap water from which the grease is later recovered for sale . The refined grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve out or extract this oil or fat with some such volatile solvent as naphtha , which can later be boiled off under 8o CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK heat and pressure , leaving the fat behind . When natural silk comes to the mill , it contains about 25 % by weight of the wax called sericin used by the silkworm to cement the fibers as they are spun from his spinneret . This sericin is " boiled off , " using a soda soap solution . So far no satisfactory use has been found for this sericin . Where wool contains foreign matter such as burrs , it may be treated with sulfuric acid which carbonizes the extraneous material , that is , cleanses the wool without material effect upon it . During manufacture , chemical methods are employed sometimes to change the character of the fiber . A notable instance is the mercerization of cotton . John Mercer , an Englishman , found that , if cotton is treated with a 20 % solution of sodium caustic and then held under tension to dry , it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % in tensile strength . The latter is due to the fact that cotton fibers are much twisted and bent . All these various kinks are weak points , which become still weaker when the fiber is dry . If the fiber be straightened , therefore , the ease with which it may be broken is greatly lessened . The mercerization of cotton is an interesting illustration of how chemistry at work may change the class in which a material falls . Mercerized cotton helped to lift cotton out of the class of more common fabrics and make it prized for its new properties . More recently it has been found that if the cotton fiber be treated with an acid such as nitric acid in place of an alkali such as sodium hydroxide quite a different effect is produced , the cotton becoming more like wool . While cotton , flax , silk , and wool make up the great bulk of textile fibers , many others are employed on a varying scale . Ramie is a long silk-like fiber obtained from grasses in China . The fiber of seaweeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in textiles , and among less civilized peoples native grasses without much treatment of any kind may be employed . The cocoanut tree , famous because it provides man // with food , drink , clothes , and shelter , contributes cocoanut fiber to local domestic textile industries . But next to dyes , and some day we may have to say " and comparable with dyes in importance , " is chemistry 's contribution of man-made silk . For years this has been known as artificial silk ; but now ( 1926 ) the world is in fairly unanimous agreement that hereafter this product shall have a name of its own , since it is a distinct product , and rayon is the term selected . Artificial silk , as it was then called , was first displayed in 1889 by its inventor . Scientists had noted how the silkworm is really a converter of cellulose , in the form of mulberry leaves , into silk fiber and concluded that , using the cellulose of wood , they should be able to do in the laboratory what nature did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made as early as 1742 ; but it remained for the French nobleman , Hilaire de Chardonnet , to conceive the idea of forcing a solution of cellulose through very fine openings into setting baths composed of solutions in which the cellulose would be insoluble . Little did he dream that within forty years fibers based upon his invention would revolutionize the textile industry . One of the difficulties to be overcome was the preparation of an orifice sufficiently fine to imitate the opening of the spinneret in the silkworm . Among the clever devices employed was to seal very fine wires into glass and then dissolve them out in acid , leaving the glass opening . To-day a platinum spinneret is universally employed . This spinneret has a large number of holes as fine as could be wanted , and when the spinneret becomes worn the platinum may , of course , be reworked . To-day sulfite paper pulp is the most extensively used raw material for rayon . It is made from coniferous trees , principally spruce , by a chemical process , and comes to the rayon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the short fiber carefully cut from the seed separated by the cotton gin , is also finding employment in this industry , particularly for one of the distinct kinds of rayon . // Chardonnet formed more than one company which failed before his last was signally successful . In 1891 rayon began to be made on a commercial scale in France ; but it was thirty years before the new fiber was standardized both as to chemical process and mechanical handling , giving a thread sufficiently uniform and strong enough to compete with natural fibers . The greatest advances have been made since 1920 when the users began to be genuinely interested in this man-made silk . There are four processes used in this industry . As has been said , the raw material is practically identical for all of them and they differ principally in the solvents employed . There is a natural cellulose process , which is the original Chardonnet silk . In it purified cotton is treated with sulfuric and nitric acids , forming nitrocellulose , which is then dissolved in alcohol and ether . The resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filaments are coagulated , the alcohol and ether are recovered , and the nitro groups removed , that there may be no danger in the use of the material . The thread is then bleached and is ready for sale . In another method an ammoniacal copper solution is used to dissolve the purified cotton or wood pulp . A spinning solution is made and the thread is coagulated by caustic soda or sulfuric acid . Bleaching prepares this thread for the market . When the raw material is dissolved in acetic anhydride , treated with acetic acid and sulfuric acid , and the resulting material dissolved in acetone , the spun thread is a cellulose acetate . This type of rayon is unique since it is slow burning , if not inflammable , and requires a special class of dye for its successful coloring . Further , it is stronger when wet than other types of rayon . It is not only sought for special uses , but is frequently spun or woven with other fibers . In the piece it may be left undyed , giving on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its color determined by treatment of the yarn before weaving . By far the greatest quantity of rayon is made by the viscose process . It accounts for fully 8o% of the total present world // production . Bleached spruce pulp , cotton linters , or a mixture of the two , is the raw material . Pulp generally is used . It is treated with caustic soda solution , forming a compound called soda cellulose . The excess caustic soda is removed under pressure . The soda cellulose is shredded , then permitted to age , after which it is converted into cellulose xanthate by treatment in suitable equipment with carbon bisulfide . This solution is called viscose and , after a ripening process , is pumped through mechanical regulators to the spinning machine where the platinum spinnerets or nozzles cause the thread to form . Sulfuric acid is one of the components of the setting bath which coagulates the material , producing regenerated cellulose . After purification and bleaching , the skeins of silk are washed . They are wrung in a centrifuge and dried and then graded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of purified sulfite pulp makes about forty-five million yards of standard size yarn . The price of the raw material wood pulp is about five cents a pound , while rayon sells for two dollars a pound or upward . This added value by a manufacturing process must be credited to chemistry . Rayon is soft and pliable . The size of the threads is determined by the opening of the spinneret and the pressure under which the viscose is forced through it . The production has grown phenomenally , doubling in some years and passing the 100,000,000 pound mark in 1924. $100,000,000 are invested in the industry in America alone where 40% of the world 's output is produced . In 1913 , 1,500,000 pounds of rayon were made in America ; in 1925 , about 55,000,000 pounds . According to some authorities , the production and consumption of rayon to-day is in excess of that of natural silk . Chemistry may serve the purchaser of textiles just as it has served the manufacturer and chemical tests combined with physical tests can be interpreted to classify a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the history of the fabric , by which is meant the kinds of fibers put into the yarn and just how they were placed there , but this information is not readily available and therefore other tests must be devised . // As regards fibers , the careful buyer wants to know most of all whether the goods is as represented . This involves knowledge as to what trade terms mean and the significance of the presence of various kinds of fibers in mixtures . In some cases the weave is very important and some one of these days research will have provided us with information regarding the relation of fibers and weave to service . Knots are to be avoided , for they lead to early damage and failure of fabric . Often , the resistance of the goods to mud spots is important and whether or not it is resistant to perspiration should be known for some classes of materials , such as linings . The fastness of the dyes to fading and to washing nearly always is a factor . Then one would like to know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who put service on a par with or a little above style . The merchants claim this number to be small , although in this the ladies say they are slandered and that a large number are always ready to purchase high grade merchandise in conservative models . That all these points and others can not be predetermined in a scientific manner is in part due to the small use of science which the textile industry has made . The industry is one of the world 's oldest . Improvement in mechanical appliances has been of the highest order , and yet a host of fundamental investigations remain to be made . This means that , among other things , we still have to perfect rational accelerated tests for some qualities that will tell us directly and in advance of purchase what we wish to know about a piece of cloth . A start can be made on the problem by learning the behavior of pure fibers under various conditons . This will give characteristic and constant properties by which they can be identified and perhaps separated . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom and those derived from animals . The vegetable fibers give the world more than 95% of the fabrics used for all purposes , and in many parts of the world , where population is densest , little cloth but cotton is worn . Cotton and linen are so similar in properties that they // can be distinguished with certainty only when the microscope is used . Indeed , if testing facilities were to be limited to a single instrument the microscope would be chosen , for in the hands of a moderately experienced observer it can be made to tell almost the whole story of fabric composition . To have even considered the microscope in this work a few years ago might have been absurd ; but to-day nearly every high school has such an instrument , and the number familiar with its use and power is greater than those who had even seen one a short time ago . Under the microscope cotton looks like a twisted , narrow ribbon . If examined throughout its length it will be found pointed at one end and with a broad torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed . The twists have to do with the cohesion of the fibers in the thread , and so , for extra strength , only the long fibers with many twists are employed . The threads for cords in cord tires are an example . In other threads short fibers can be used with the longer ones . Abroad , cloth has been produced from cotton fibers which are shorter than those considered spinnable in America . Linen , the descendant of the fibers separated from rushes and reeds by our prehistoric ancestors , has a faintly jointed or bamboo-like structure . The individual fibers are much longer than those of cotton , and this is one reason why well spun linen thread is much stronger than a cotton one of equal size . Both cotton and linen resist a weak boiling solution of alkali such as caustic soda ; but they can be dissolved in acid . Some have thought the degree of solubility in strong sulfuric acid could be used to tell cotton from linen ; but the method is unreliable . While our principal vegetable fibers are alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers silk and wool . We need no microscope ; but through it raw silk is seen as a structureless material made up of the two transparent fibers cemented together as they come from the two spinnerets on the head of the silkworm . These fibers are literally many yards in length . Wool fibers are covered with scales which are more // prominent on new wool than on reworked wool . It is to these scales that wool owes its felting properties . Silk and wool dissolve quickly in solutions of caustic soda ; but they resist acids . With these few facts in mind one can at least learn whether the goods is really all wool or all silk and , as we shall see , one can gain some idea of how the various fibers are used together . A small sample from the piece or from the inner seam of a made up garment is enough . A small enameled pan is filled with a solution of household lye made by putting a tablespoonful into a pint of water . This is brought to a boil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water is added to keep the volume constant . Whatever remains of the sample is neither wool nor silk . This residue should be washed and dried for examination . Should there be any doubt in one 's mind as to wool being the fiber that has dissolved , just add a little sugar of lead ( lead acetate ) solution . This compound , sometimes used to fix the color in cloth before washing , will react with the sulfur naturally present in the wool and give a gray or black color or perhaps a dark precipitate or sediment . In a " union " cloth it used to be customary to use cotton warp ? the threads running lengthwise of the goods ? with a wool filling or woof , as the crosswise threads are called . Nowadays any combination may be expected . Look at the residue from the lye boiling test . If the recovered cotton threads are in a tangled mass , it is probable the cotton ran in but one direction of the goods or was spun with the wool . Sometimes a cheesecloth-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been spun wool either to acid warmth , or to improve appearance , or to deceive . Incidentally , such a fabric fills a valuable need . It is warmer for the wool and stronger for the cotton than would have been the case had either fiber been used alone . But one wants to know what one purchases . In instances where a nap is desired , as on a blanket , this may be secured by spinning wool with the cotton and then using // mechanical means for combing up this nap . This process tends to weaken the fabric , leading to an early break . The laboratory applies the lye boiling test and calls it " boiling out " the sample . If the quantity of each fiber is to be found a delicate scale is used . The sample is weighed and the residue dried to constant weight . From these figures the percentage can be determined . Dyes may be used to distinguish these fibers , for acid dyes on cotton are not fast even to mild washing . If the cotton or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than wool or silk , the sample is saturated with a very weak solution of sulfuric acid , dried at the temperature of boiling water for an hour , and then gently rubbed between the palms of the hands . The cotton and linen will be charred ( " carbonized " ) and will rub away from the animal fibers . But what of artificial silk ? While simple tests have been developed for telling artificial silk from real silk , a chemical test is more reliable . If the fiber under examination is heated in a dry test tube , moist neutral litmus paper over the mouth of the tube will tell the story . Litmus is an organic , natural product which has the property of changing color according to whether acid or alkali is present . Chemists call it an indicator because it does indicate which is present . Blue means alkali , and red , acid . Neutral litmus paper can be used for either test and is more sensitive when moistened , preferably with distilled water . Real silk gives off ammonia which turns the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test paper becomes red . There are other tests to distinguish between these silks ; but they are either complex or not so good as that outlined above . What of other fibers ? These may be many , and in general the merchant should be on the watch for them and either prevent his guarantee from becoming a liability by keeping them in their proper places or give the customer full information . Not so long ago , a towel supply company bought seven hundred hand towels which were washed to remove sizing and improve their absorption properties before going into service . Every single towel failed in the first washing because bleached hemp // had been used for the filler or woof . This fiber has no strength when wet and so fell apart during laundering . There have been several samples of jute and cotton cloth on the market , and then there is the case of the rag rug which fooled an experienced buyer . This lot of rugs had the usual assortment of colors ; but there was a large percentage of brown which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show up the inherent defects which were traceable to the jute . This fiber formed the largest part of what had been sold as an all cotton rag wash rug , being the core of every filling strand and having the colored cotton strips wound around it . Some of the other fibers include ramie and two more recently developed commercial fibers called " solidonia " and " posidonia . " Solidonia is made from China grass and is somewhat similar to ramie . In Germany a long , fine , soft and curly fiber has been secured by a secret process . The fiber looks very much like wool , until placed under the microscope , and it mixes very readily with wool . It has been used in woolens and in underwear , some experts claiming that it prevents shrinkage and is therefore a valuable addition in the manufacture of underwear . Solidonia has also been used in producing linen substitutes , in knitting hosiery , etc . Posidonia is another vegetable fiber being made from a seaweed dredged near Australia . After washing in fresh water this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one which is elastic and springy . While at present this fiber is considered more for carpet manufacture than for clothing , still it can be spun with wool and has been used with it and with shoddy . The cloth made from such yarn resists creasing remarkably well , has good strength and appearance . Those responsible for these developments have directed their science toward jute and even old jute rags which are considered nearly worthless in most places . From this exceedingly cheap raw material chemical processes bid fair to win a fiber which can be spun by the methods applied to worsteds or woolens . Serges from old jute rags and cloth half jute and half wool have // puzzled many an experienced textile man . The wool in this material is from sweaters , certain qualities of wool rags , woolen hosiery , etc . It seems evident that these new developments are of real importance and it would be better to acquaint ourselves with the merits of these economically valuable fibers rather than to spurn them untried . The only sound objection comes when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But does it not seem reasonable to expect our merchants to know what they buy and sell ? To impress this upon them the ultimate consumer must be sufficiently familiar with fabrics to ask intelligent questions and in turn listen to sound explanation . But these are not all the pitfalls . Faults in construction , those factors which cause most of the " seconds " to be made , are just as troublesome . The average shopper can not be expected to discover them all ; but she can know that a difference of a few threads per inch may account for a bargain price and also for a weakness of the cloth responsible for early failure in service . Some of the more reliable houses refuse to merchandise percales , sheeting , and other standard materials with less than a given number of threads per inch , that number having been found from both laboratory and wearing tests to be the least that will have reasonable strength for the service of cloth in a given class . These tests are now based on tensile strength and resistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special machine the energy , in pounds , required to break a standard size strip . Moisture and temperature have a direct influence on the strength of cloth , as will be obvious when one remembers the many kinks in a single cotton fiber . When very dry , the fiber breaks much more easily at these points . Strength tests are therefore made under standard conditions of temperature and humidity . In some methods a strip is prepared by removing a thread at a time until just one inch in width remains to be held between the jaws of the machine . This is the strip method . The " grab " method is considered less accurate . // The bursting test is applied with the apparatus used to determine paper strengths . The sample is held firmly between two metal circular rims while a rubber disk is forced against the center by air pressure . A dial records this pressure and the hand remains stationary when the break occurs . These are obviously methods to be used by the manufacturer and the merchant ; but one can obtain some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how easily the cloth may be torn in each direction . Then hold it firmly and see to what extent it gives when the thumbs are pressed against it . Tender threads , cloth in which an excess of short fiber has been incorporated , and poor weaving , often show up in these simple tests . Weave is not a difficult thing with which to become acquainted . A plain weave is one in which the woof , or filling thread , goes over one and then under one of the warp threads . No two adjacent filling threads cross on the same side of a warp thread . This makes the strongest cloth . Beauty is added , but strength is sacrificed when the satin weave is used . It gives a smooth surface which reflects more light and makes fancy patterns easily possible . In the satin weave the filling thread passes under one and then over four or more warp threads . In other fabrics long " float " threads are used , and these may cross as many as eighteen or more warp threads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads . This loose weaving leaves unsecured threads which slip and rub and soon break . If they are cotton the break comes sooner because of the shorter fiber making up the thread . It would seem wise , therefore , to refrain from buying cotton fabrics in which patterns requiring long floats are woven . One would also seem to have a right to expect only long fiber cotton to be used in tightly spun threads if cotton float threads are used and these floats should be kept comparatively short . The importance of weave is illustrated by bath toweling , commonly known as terry cloth . This is a loop-pile material made up of two systems of warp threads . One of these goes to make the ground fabric while the other furnishes the pile in the // form of loops on the surface . The excellence of the cloth depends upon the number of filling threads that are inserted for each cross row of loops and these may be one , three , four , five or six . This determines the firmness with which the pile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pulling " may be prevented . But we must realize that all fabrics can not be of the highest quality in every respect . There are certain to be practically unavoidable faults if human hands are involved in manufacture , and it is well known that all worsted can not be made solely of new long fiber wool . There simply is not enough of it . If it were not for reworked wool and cotton much of the world would go cold or naked . One should recognize these facts and accept intelligently the correct information which your merchant should be able to give . It may be that when we overcome long standing prejudices with knowledge the merchant will be more willing to tell the whole truth about his wares . There are many other things which we should like to know in advance about the quality of the fabrics which cost such a large percentage of our income . Science is striving to find a way to supply such information . Particularly , we want to know the relationship between the way a fabric is woven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give . Manufacturers frequently test their product by having operatives and others wear it ; but that is too time-consuming . By dividing a problem into its factors and solving these one by one , research is sure to find the answer . CHAPTER VI DECORATION ? ESCAPE FROM MONOTONY THERE can be monotony in the scenery , in one 's work , indeed such a sameness of impressions in whatever field we find ourselves that no arguments need be advanced on behalf of decoration or any other plan that will introduce pleasing variety . There is an advantage in a great multiplicity of sizes , textures , shapes and colors , in the things all about us . The mountains are never so monotonous as the plains , for the plains present a greater regularity . A forest becomes more attractive when the trees are of different species , thereby introducing varying shades of green and foliage , or where the trees are of different heights . When things become too standardized we lose our interest in them , and we know it is not the average man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather the unusual , out of the ordinary individual . If it can be shown that chemistry in the world 's work has contributed something toward relieving the world of monotony , it is something of which we can be justly proud . The variety of building materials available to-day makes it possible to go to the other extreme , and many cities show the need of a supervising architect . The proper use of this variety of building blocks , however , is responsible for the very attractive appearance of the modern structure . Chemistry has made a greater contribution than may at first be realized . Stone is doubtless among the oldest of the building materials , and in its carving and finishing to size and shape the artificial abrasives of the electrochemist find a wide application . When a young man , Acheson heard the remark that the world badly needed a good abrasive . He decided to attempt to supply it . He had a theory that clay could be so worked in an electric furnace as to give the desired product . He began his experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to one lead from a dynamo and , after filling it with a mixture of clay and coke , inserted one end of an ordinary arc light carbon in the mass . The coke acted as an electrical conductor and current was passed until the clay in the center had been melted or sintered . The experiment was disappointing ; but by chance the investigator saw a few bright specks on the end of the carbon electrode that had been thrust in the coke-clay mixture . These proved to be what was wanted , and from this beginning there has been developed a race of artificial abrasives of more uniform quality than the natural emery or corundum , capable of being made of the desired hardness , and for a great majority of purposes superior to natural abrasives . These crystals are incorporated with various clays which act as binders and after baking form the cutting wheels and grinding or polishing surfaces so largely used in working our granite , limestone , and marble for structural purposes . The tooling , which consists of numerous parallel lines on the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by power driven gangue wheels . The production of modern building bricks depends to such an extent upon science that associations of manufacturers maintain research fellowships in some of our leading educational institutions . The texture and color of this ceramic ware , together with the art of properly combining the various bricks to make a wall , give a range of surfaces which are anything but monotonous . Mineral pigments are the ones employed to color brick , terra cotta , and tile , and these chemical compounds may either be found in the clay mixtures employed or may be added at will . Account must be taken of a change in color which will be due to both the mixture with which it is to be placed and the temperature at which it is to be heated . In fine pottery , the employment of a glaze adds another factor to consider in obtaining the exact shade wanted in the final product . These glazes range from common salt ( sodium chloride ) to complex silicates , for glazes ranging from great luster to a dull mat finish are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which includes fine China and porcelain , a special kind of color must be prepared calculated to withstand the treatment characteristic of the ceramic art and still capable of giving very fine gradations in tints and colors . The metallic elements themselves play a large part and may be introduced in a finely divided state as a pigment in a vehicle of some oil or may be applied in a solution so designed that after firing in the reducing atmosphere of a furnace the metal will remain on the ware . Gold is , of course , the chemical element in greatest demand for such decoration . The employment of metals in building operations adds further variety to the scene . Much of the metal is used from a purely utilitarian standpoint and becomes gutters , downspouting , window casements , and roofs . Where desirable , these may be so designed as to add beauty ; but too often no attention is paid to the possibility of improving the appearance of a useful object and the beautiful things are left with no real work to do . We see to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very favorably in design and execution with the work of the ancient craftsmen . In some localities where an artist lived of old there may be found many relics of his handicraft still in a good state of preservation , and as there seems to be no present source for this material , especially in the locality , the lecturers on sight-seeing cars refer to the grills or other work as a lost art . As a matter of fact , the cost of producing articles that must be hand made has advanced to the point where such art is not encouraged ; yet modern examples prove that the skill has not been lost and it is largely a question of what the customer is willing to pay . A great many objects must depend for their decoration upon surface coatings applied after they have been fashioned . Even the metals that are turned or cast are frequently given a coat of nitrocellulose or similar colorless transparent lacquer which protects the surface from attack by the hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds in the air . This is especially true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bituminous // coal usually high in sulfur . Many a housewife has wondered how the jewelers manage to keep their large stock so bright and free from tarnish , not realizing that the chemist has prepared a special lacquer for such flat ware which when applied may sufficiently protect the article for the entire time it is in the possession of the retailer . While nitrocellulose lacquers are the principal ones used in this field because they are air drying and easy to apply , there are a number of other lacquers also made both to decorate and protect . Until recently it was customary to prepare a lacquer , with which to finish scientific instruments , from the best shellac and absolute alcohol . By absolute alcohol is meant that which is free from moisture and is really all ethyl alcohol . After the shellac was dissolved in this alcohol , the solution was allowed to stand for many months with frequent shakings , during which time physical and chemical changes took place , giving a product considered far better than a freshly made shellac solution . A few drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic . It was applied with a hand brush in very thin coats between each of which the lacquered part was passed quickly through the flame of a Bunsen burner to facilitate driving off the alcohol solvent . Colors were obtained by adding certain dyes or by changing the composition of the brass . Hard red brass is made so by the addition of copper and tends toward the red , while one with less copper but more zinc will be found of a lighter shade . Sometimes this brass has to be used in combination because of physical properties , and then the problem was one of coloring the shellac solution with some alcohol soluble dye so that the instrument might have a uniform appearance . But having been made with alcohol , such lacquers were easily marred , spotted , or sometimes removed by the small amount of alcohol in other solutions that might remain on the hands of the investigator . It is difficult to have workmen change from a type of lacquer they have used for years to the lacquers made by chemists according to new methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to be used , for after // baking they are practically insoluble in such reagents as one ordinarily finds in the laboratory and certainly many of those which may be on the hands of the operator . This same type of lacquer has found general application in the metal industries and to-day we find it on brass beds and lighting fixtures , as well as scientific apparatus . A finish is more resistant if it has been baked in place . The baked japans and enamels are noted for their satisfactory service . The gums employed in them will not dry down to a hard surface , but must have the solvent driven out by heat and the residue thoroughly dried or baked in the enameling oven . The use of this baked enamel has extended to such large pieces of work as entire automobiles for which specially constructed electrical ovens are provided . The solvents employed may be benzol , naphtha , or other volatile organic solvents , which readily take fire under proper conditions of heat and mixture with air in the ovens . This was especially true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the heating units . One of the great electrical companies primarily interested in disposing of electrical equipment undertook to devise a lacquer which would be an emulsion in water and not a volatile solvent prone to ignite at the slightest provocation . Such an emulsion in water was made , was found to spread satisfactorily over the metal work dipped into it and to bake into a satisfactory , attractive , protective and decorative film . This eliminated the hazard always present where volatile organic solvents are employed . Our greatest spot of color on the landscape beside the green of the vegetation is due to the use of paints and varnishes in giving a protective coating to the structures . The pigments are natural ores ground very fine or perhaps chemically produced . These colors are ground in linseed oil , the mixture is later thinned with turpentine or mineral spirits , and a dryer to accelerate the drying tendency of the oil is added . This dryer is made with the chemical elements cobalt , lead , or manganese . The interesting thing about pigments is the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , chrome green , the amount required can be greatly reduced if the material is so ground that it is much finer than a cheap white base particle , and if the relative sizes of the two products are kept uniform , the smaller ones will become dusted over the large white ones . This gives a bulk of green which appears green but which by weight may contain a larger proportion of the white base material than of the green dusted upon it . The principal white pigments are white lead or lead carbonate , zinc in the form of oxide or a chemical product , lithopone , which contains approximately 28% zinc sulfide , and 72% barium sulfate . This is made by chemical precipitation and lithopone finds a wide application not only in interior wall paints , but particularly where hydrogen sulfide is present . This would discolor lead paint , but makes little impression upon lithopone . Antimony oxide and titanium oxide are other white pigments . White lead has been known since before the Christian Era , for Theophrastus has described a method in use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Metal powders have a specific use in paints . Zinc dust is used as a pigment in anti-corrosive paints and aluminum powder or bronze is well known indeed . These metal pigment preparations are particularly useful in protecting iron and steel . It has just been shown that oil storage tanks painted with aluminum suffer far less loss by evaporation than do those painted in some of the somber colors which absorb all the heat . This tends to raise the temperature and the more volatile portions of the contents escape . The standard type varnishes are prodnced from fossil resins found principally in the Orient and the tropics . The melted resin is thinned with heat treated drying oils . Here again turpentine or mineral spirits or alcohol may be used as a thinner . Materials which behave as catalyzers in causing the varnish film to take oxygen from the air more rapidly are also used in varnishes . The production of varnishes has sent the chemist to all parts of the world for raw materials . As a result China wood oil is // being used in increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change color when wet . This oil , therefore , enters into many of the varnishes advertized to withstand water . The resins preferred are the hard fossil resins , all of which are highly acid . These are limited in supply and are not so resistant to water and alkali as the so-called ester gums made by combining the highly acid resins with a substance like glycerine to form a neutral product . The chemist has supplied an entirely new solvent in furfural , which may be made from corncobs , but is actually being produced commercially from oat hulls . Furfural is a good solvent for dry paint and varnish , and finds employment as a paint remover . Furfural is also said to be a good solvent for the new types of nitrocellulose lacquer widely employed for the finishing of automobiles . Such solvents as amyl acetate , butyl acetate , ethyl acetate , anhydrous alcohol , diethyl carbonate , ethyl lactate , and butyl propionate have helped to revolutionize the lacquer industry . The new types of low plasticity lacquers combine the advantages of high solid content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plasticisers , of which there are many , are employed and the mixture incorporated with solutions of resins , after which it is pigmented to produce the colors wanted . In this achievement it is interesting to note that the body of the lacquer is nitrocellulose , made from American grown cotton and that the solvents are prepared either by the fermentation of corn or molasses , so that this sensational development in lacquering involves only self-contained , American sources of supply . Recent work has shown that the colors of radiators not only have a psychological effect , but influence the economy of operation . Tests show that bare radiators or those coated with dark paints or even with aluminum or bronze paints give the least radiation . It is the white or light tinted paints and those with a flat surface that give the greatest radiation and should therefore be used where economy is practiced. // Enamels are made by grinding pigments in varnish . Their smooth , glossy , hard surface indicates them for a number of special applications . Some types of wall coverings involve paints or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not applied in liquid form . The production of types of wall coverings such as cloths and papers , which may be embossed , have special surface treatments and otherwise made unique , involve not only chemical control but the use of particular colors for intricate patterns and a fine blending of numerous reagents . The printing of wall paper is similar in many respects to the printing of any other material where engraved rolls are used , though for special purposes hand block printing may be employed . This consists in applying the color in the form of ink to an engraved block , usually of wood , with which the pattern is carefully transferred to the pap r surface . Where surfaces like oatmeal finish are to be obtained on wall paper this material can be added in the beaters or put upon the surface as the paper pulp comes upon the paper making machine . The days when the paper hanger made his own paste from flour and water are well nigh by , for now the chemical laboratory supervises the manufacture of starch and dextrin pastes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more uniformity than the old style mixtures . The floor coverings , which both serve and decorate , may be rugs dyed with synthetic organic dyes or one of the newer materials offered to replace the carpet or rug capable of accumulating much dust and absorbing much that is detrimental . Linoleum has held the center of the stage for a long while but of late is threatened by rubber tile . The latter is made in as great a variety of patterns and colors as could be wanted . However , linoleum and materials of a similar sort have long performed a valuable service . As - the name indicates , it is made from linseed oil . Wood flour , cork and other fillers form with the oil a mass which is pulverized and treated to produce a mixture that is then placed upon a heavy cotton fabric usually of jute . After being pressed under hydraulic pressure , the treated cloth , in I00 CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK great festoons , is taken into heated passages called stoves , to dry and is then ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added color or it may be inlaid , in which process the pieces composing the pattern are moulded and then assembled before pressing to form the commercial product . Rubber tile may represent a new outlet for used rubber . A market is needed for this otherwise waste material , and with the increase in the cost of crude rubber , rubber flooring may have to compete with tires for a part of this raw material in future . Just as the walls of stone , brick , or terra cotta are laid up with , cement rather than a lime mortar , if a permanent work is desired , so also the terrazzo floor is laid in cement , the other constituent being various sizes of aggregate usually of some hard marble . There have been instances where soft stone was used to form the terrazzo type of floor only to have this stone wear away before the Portland cement began to show signs of service . Such a floor not only wears unevenly but is dusty and of poor appearance . Glass is effectively used in decoration and to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valued for its decorative qualities . There was a time when all mirrors were made with mercury or quicksilver ; but this is not the modern practice . To-day the best mirrors are made by chemically cleaning the surface of the glass and then precipitating upon it metallic silver from a solution to which a reducing agent is added just before the solution is applied to the glass . Most of the silver does not deposit on the glass but may be recovered in the form of a metal so finely divided as more nearly to resemble gray mud than the shiny metal we know so well . Several coats may be required to produce a film satisfactory in continuity and thickness . Sometimes particles of silver precipitate upon a surface before a film is formed and this gives rise to a pinhole rather difficult to cover when once it has been formed . The concentration of the solution and the temperature at which the work is done are important factors in the production of a good mirDECORATION - ESCAPE FROM MONOTONY IOI ror . If dilute solutions are employed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specified thickness ; but the chance of avoiding pinholes and other blemishes is greatly increased . By choosing certain temperatures and solution concentrations , silver can be deposited in so hard a film that it can not be removed by cutting without actually scratching the glass . Not content with silvering the mirror , the chemist may go further and deposit electrolytically a film of hard copper over the silver and this in turn may be given a coat of lacquer . It is obvious that if weak solutions are used the film is built up very gradually , and this is the basis of one-way glass . It is possible so to silver a mirror that on one side it appears as such ; but , if the observer is in a darkened room facing the mirror which is against the light , he will get not a reflection but will be able to see through the silver film . In other words , the silver particles are close enough to give a moderately satisfactory reflection on one side and yet far enough apart to enable one to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , involves chemistry in the coloring and in the method of fastening it in place . Of course , tanning the leather in the first instance is a chemical process ; but on that basis it would not be difficult for an enthusiast to show that nothing that is worth while is other than chemical . Rubber is also used for decoration and is sometimes vulcanized in place for this purpose . A case in point is covering the modern binocular . By using a photograph of some particular type of leather taken as a pattern , a metal plate can be made and hardened so that under pressure it will impart to the rubber the pattern of the original leather . By following a special procedure these sheets of rubber can be made to adhere to the metal body of the binocular and then vulcanized in place . The result is a covering far more efficient in protecting the binocular and of greater wearing quality , having the appearance of whichever type of leather is thought most suitable for the article in question . Whether rubber latex , the sap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WORLD 'S WORK ammonia , will be used for a covering remains to be seen . It has many advantages from the standpoint of protection afforded but may not be decorative . When we consider the range of colors offered by the various metals , the difference in appearance obtained by surface treatment such as polishing and sandblasting before plating , and the further colors obtained by oxidation and other chemical reactions carried on upon their surface , it will be seen that the electroplater 's art is indeed an art . In electroplating the purpose is to give a base metal an adherent coating of another metal which may be for protection , for decoration , or for deception . Many of the metals are capable of being deposited electrolytically , and as has been noted in another chapter this method is used for refining . The general principles of electroplating seem indeed simple , for in order to deposit copper it is only necessary to have a suitably formed plate of pure copper to serve as the anode , a place for attaching to the other electrode the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which the electric current may guide the electrons from the dissolving anode to the cathode which is to be plated . Copper plating usually employs a cyanide copper solution for plating on steel followed by an acid copper bath if very thick deposits are to be obtained . The acid copper bath can not be used directly for iron or steel , as the iron tends to dissolve and produces a non-adherent film on the copper by simple displacement . Nickel is more often used for plating than any other metal . Fortunately , nickel does not tarnish readily and the film is hard enough to resist a surprising amount of abrasion . The tarnishing that is sometimes observed is not due to any inherent weakness in the nickel , but to the fact that the coating is not continuous just as the coating of silver on glass in the production of mirrors is likely to fail in the same respect . The average thickness of nickel plating is only one or two ten-thousandths of an inch . When cobalt was produced in Canada , much useful research // was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for plating . Cobalt and chromium are both important because their films are very hard , and of the two , chromium is the hardest . It produces the hardest film of any known metal . Since cobalt steels have come into vogue , the efforts to use it as a plating material have largely subsided and the research workers are turning their attention to chromium . A commercial method for chromium plating has rewarded their efforts . Zinc and cadmium , lead and tin , silver , gold , and platinum all are used in plating . The principles are the same ; but the solutions vary greatly in composition and the current density , by which is meant the amount of electromotive force for some convenient unit of surface to be plated , must also be regulated according to conditions . Brass is extensively used particularly for lighting fixtures and for building hardware . If there is no misrepresentation in sales , this practice might be encouraged . At one time close-plating was practiced . This was a mechanical operation in which a thin sheet of the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal to be plated and soldered into position . The time and labor required to close-plate a complicated bit of base metal is one of the disadvantages . If metals can be taken from the anode and placed upon the cathode , it is obvious that the process should be reversible , and such is the case . This process is employed in certain types of deep etching where that part of the cathode to be left untouched is covered with a resist material having some organic compound as a base . In this way not only may a design be placed upon a sheet , but by continuing the plating process , the sheet may be perforated or dissolved away where left unprotected by the resist material . Obviously , electroplating can be done successfully only when the material to be plated is an electric conductor , thus attracting and guiding the metal to be plated . Sometimes a nonconducting material is offered , as , for example , the baby 's shoe , many of which have been metallized as keepsakes . Such an object can be coated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S WORK sufficiently good conductor to enable a thin copper coating to be applied , after which other metals may be superimposed as desired . A gentleman with a peculiar streak of humor once took the trouble to have his appendix gold plated as a watch charm . The appendix was first dehydrated according to the ways of the biological laboratory in successive baths of increasing strengths of alcohol , after which it was impregnated with celloidin . This in turn was coated with graphite and the rest was easy . One of the secrets in the deposition of metals is the art of metallizing flowers . Roses and other beautiful flowers are sometimes offered in a metallized condition , a product truly admirable secured by a secret process . While the best results are obtained when the entire object is electroplated , it sometimes happens that small blemishes on plated work or a scratch in service is all that requires restoration . For such purposes plating powders may be made , consisting of chemical salts of the metal wanted in combination with reducing materials , which , when the mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby covering the blemish . It is obvious that the deposition of metal films by electroplating adds something to the size of the base metal piece ; but it was not until recently that it occurred to platers to use this process in building up castings or machined parts that failed to show specified dimensions . Where the errors are not too large and the service is one that can be performed by a member thus increased in size the plating process finds utility . There is a continual effort to avoid monotony as the changing styles testify . These are styles not alone in clothing but in art , architecture , decoration , design and every other human expression . All involve changes and variations in materials and that means chemistry at work . CHAPTER VII METALS THE MASTER IT Is quite probable that the metals were the first chemical elements utilized as such by the race . It seems certain that they have played a vital part in helping man out of the jungle , and it is not difficult to imagine the elation that one of our primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude bit of metal he possessed an inestimable advantage over his adversary . Perhaps the introduction of metal shod weapons into warfare was considered just as unsportsman-like at the time as was gunpowder at a later date by the knights in armor . There was probably as much resentment against the use of such weapons as the navy feels toward the airplane or as the military man of the old line voices against chemical warfare . It is quite unlikely that the gold of Tutankhamen 's tomb or of King Solomon 's temple could ever have been produced by the ancients , if they had been compelled to work the deposits now available to us . It is believed that these treasures of metal must have resulted from finding bonanzas of native metal which could be worked by hammering and similar mechanical methods of refining . While the earth may still hold native or free metals in considerable quantities to be revealed to some succeeding generation , our experience thus far has been that , as we draw upon these natural resources , we find it necessary to devise new chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaner ores which must be used . This is not to be taken as meaning that , we no longer have rich ores at our disposal , for many mines still produce ores rich in metals both precious and base . However , the rate at which we use metals has compelled us to consider the commercial use of the leaner ores , and fortunately science has been able to keep pace with // new requirements . The race has used within the last generation more metal than in the entire previous history of the world , and it is not likely this could have been done but for the contributions of science . " Just as our increasing ingenuity enables us to secure natural products in ever increasing quantities from sources that would have yielded nothing to our forefathers , so those who follow us must ultimately rely on science to produce substitutes for our natural products . " It has been stated that in the days of Hiram , King of Tyre , the Rio Tinto mine in Spain was a source of much of the silver he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to produce three tons of the metal , and undoubtedly the craftsmen of King Solomon produced the metals for the temple at a cost impossibly high for modern industry . There has been little change in the methods of mining in the last several hundred years , as will be observed by comparing the writings of George Agricola , so ably translated by the Hon. Herbert and Mrs. Hoover , with accounts of modern mining methods . It is true that many mechanical improvements have been made and that more recently machinery has been provided actually to do work heretofore accomplished solely by hand , but the principles underlying it all have changed but little . Modern explosives have been added to lower the costs ; but the principal gains have been in the application of chemistry to the problems of metallurgy . In the chapter discussing modern communication reference has been made to the electrolytic method of refining copper . Attention may be called to the cyanide process for the extraction of gold , this process being in almost universal use to-day . Because of the higher price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this process , research was undertaken some years ago and it was discovered too late to save vast quantities of precious potash that sodium cyanide is equally efficient and much less costly . The methods by which nickel , and indeed all the ores , are refined to-day are either frankly chemical methods or depend upon chemical control . // Zinc offers interesting problems . It is still treated in small retorts arranged in great banks , each retort holding a few pounds of the ore and yielding a few tablespoonfuls of spelter per charge . Much money has been spent to increase the size of the unit and at least use larger retorts ; others have worked upon continuous processes , but the small earthenware retorts continue to give the greatest efficiency . Much hand labor is involved , retorts break , and a novice looking on feels sure that something could be done to make matters better , but thus far the old reliable method has held its own . The blast furnace familiar in nearly every industrial community , whether ore is treated or the furnace used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of flux such as limestone , and coal or coke which is mixed with the iron ore , as well as the proper air supply , all being based on the chemical requirements . Some scientists believe that in blast furnace operations and in steel making it would be a wonderful advantage if the air could be enriched with oxygen . It is thought that the slightly higher temperatures that could be obtained if more oxygen were available would help to obtain superior metals probably freed from occluded gases and stripped of traces of impurities objectionable for some uses . The plan would involve the production of oxygen through liquefaction of air , necessitating a good market for the hydrogen and necessitating efficiencies in the use of mechanical power required for compressing that so far have not been realized on a commercial scale . Within the year such rapid developments have been made in processes requiring hydrogen that interest may be revived in this metallurgical problem . These hydrogen-using processes are the syntheses of ammonia , of methanol , and of petroleum-like bodies using carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steel , if of high quality , has been made by a chemical process or , more strictly speaking , under chemical control , for the percentage of carbon , silicon , phosphorus , and sulfur must be accurately known and adjusted . Io8 CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK The great tonnage of steel continues to be made in the open hearth furnaces and in Bessemer converters ; but the electric furnace offers advantages enabling it not only to compete , but gain upon the other methods . Year by year the percentage of steel made electrolytically increases . One factor is that , whereas imported magnesite is required for linings in other equipment ? and thus magnesite was all-important until the war ? the electric furnace can use without difficulty linings made from domestic raw materials . In peace-time this is not so important and the governing consideration becomes the ability , with the control of heat which electricity gives and the entire absence of the interfering products of combustion , to produce steel on a qualitative as well as a quantitative basis . By this is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known quality can be placed in the furnace , which in a sense becomes the laboratory beaker or crucible under control so that certain amounts of heat can be applied for a definite time to remove carbon . New materials may then be added as one would pour reagents into the beaker confident that the final resulting alloy will be a homogeneous mixture of desired composition and consequently of predetermined physical characteristics . The electric steel furnace would seem , therefore , to possess all the advantages of the crucible used for the highest grade steels such as tool steels as contrasted with the great openhearth furnaces and Bessemer converters . The crucible and now the electric furnace have made possible the development of a great range of modern metals known as the alloys . One group of alloys is built upon ferrous or iron metallurgy ; the others are non-ferrous . The latter , while originally based upon copper , zinc , and tin may now include none of these in their composition . Metals that a short time ago were museum curiosities are now called by their first names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1924 ? 25 Prize Essay Contest of the American Chemical Society , J. C. Hendricks , of Franklin College , Franklin , Indiana , succeeded in winning one of the national prizes , his // discussion being on " The Contribution of the Alloys to Civilization . " A part of Mr. Hendricks ' discussion is quoted below . " The alloys have been of sufficient importance to man in his progress from cave to cloud to furnish the name for one of the great eras of civilization , The Bronze Age . Introduced , no doubt , by accident and developed by the trial and error method , the alloys were , nevertheless , of great use to the ancients and they have written themselves into history in such terms as the sounding brass and tinkling cymbals ' and Damascus steel . ' But the scientific investigation of the alloys did not begin until the latter part of the nineteenth century . Metallography was introduced in 1868 as incidental to the microscopic examination of meteorites and by 1890 the British scientists , headed by Ewing , were determining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Mineral Industry commended the British and French on opening up the scientific study of the alloys and urged the United States to join in the research . " The properties of the metals which have been modified in alloys may be classified as follows : ( I ) hardness and tensile strength ; ( 2 ) elasticity and toughness ; ( 3 ) malleability and forgeability ; ( 4 ) fusibility and resistance to heat ; ( 5 ) coefficient of expansion ; ( 6 ) specific gravity ; ( 7 ) resistance to corrosion ; ( 8 ) electrical resistance ; and ( 9 ) color and beauty . " The change in hardness and tensile strength from iron to carbon steel and then to the steel alloys brought to a close The Iron Age . The introduction of manganese , chromium and tungsten into steel made modern machinery possible . Manganese has been the leavening agent ' of steel and has given low-carbon steel strength and forgeability . Nickel , vanadium and molybdenum have given steel the necessary wide elastic limit and great toughness to withstand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iridium ) and monel metal ( copper and nickel ) have given the required hardness for pen points and chemical and surgical instruments where non-corrosion is also a necessary property . Babbitt II0 CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK ( copper , antimony and tin ) and bronze ( copper , tin and often zinc ) furnish soft metals of low coefficient of friction for use in bearings . " A low melting point was demanded for such uses as safety plugs , automatic sprinkling devices and the joining of such metals as lead and tin . Electrical fuse wire also became necessary . Rose metal ( containing bismuth and tin ) and Woods ' metal ( bismuth , tin and cadmium ) supplied the need . High speed tools were impossible until a tungsten steel was developed which would hold its temper under the provocation of great heat . " Some of the most gratifying work has been done in correcting the coefficient of expansion of metals for particular uses . Three special degrees of expansion have become important : ( I ) the zero coefficient ; ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( 3 ) the coefficient of the enamel of the teeth . The zero coefficient , necessary in pendulums , tapes and other standard linear measures , was first obtained with platinumiridium but invar ( iron and nickel ) is cheaper and just as good . For a long time platinum was the only metal which could be fused in glass on account of differences in expansion . For several years after its invention our scanty and costly supply of platinum threatened to hold up the development of the incandescent electric lamp , but platinite ( nickel and iron ) solved the problem . Copper , silver and cadmium amalgams are used in dentistry . " The aeroplane and automobile industries have sought a very light , strong metal . Magnalium ( magnesium and aluminum ) is very strong and only one-fourth the weight of steel . Duralumin ( copper and aluminum ) furnishes a beautiful , light metal for utensils . The present great industrial use of chemicals makes the use of non-corrosive metals imperative . Monel metal , high nickel steel , stellite ( cobalt , chromium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many electrical devices and appliances require high or constant resistance . The use of rhotanium ( rhodium , palladium and gold ) in the METALS THE MASTER III pyrometer made the first high temperature measurements possible . German silver ( copper , nickel and zinc ) and manganin ( manganese and nickel ) furnish high resistances , and nichrome ( chromium and nickel ) is used in heating appliances . " Many alloys have won favor for ornamental use because of their color and luster . Brass ( copper and zinc ) and bronze are extensively used as metal trimming , gun metal ( bronze low in tin ) is used in jewelry and watchcases , aluminum bronze ( copper and aluminum ) furnishes an inexpensive gilt for radiators , sterling silver ( 7.5% copper ) makes a very good grade of table silver , and white gold ( about four-fifths silver ) is a substitute for platinum in jewelry . " Over a hundred alloys are now in use and they are indispensable to modern civilization . Someone has suggested that this modern age growing out of the Age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more fitting to designate it The Age of Alloys . " The wide adoption of a metal frequently waits until science shows the way to large production . Within the memory of man now living , aluminum , originally called aluminium and still so designated in Europe , has come off the museum shelves , where it was placed at something like $50.00 a pound , to take a ranking place among the utilitarian metals and is now produced by the millions of pounds . It has been through research that new uses for aluminum have been developed , and where a market was found with some special requirement it has been the chemist and metallurgist who have found means of so changing the properties of the metal by alloying it with other substances that it would meet the particular demand . This aluminum , because of its lightness , is desirable for aircraft ; but alone it does not have requisite strength . Alloyed with magnesium and a trace of copper it acquires necessary strength without material sacrifice in lightness . It is interesting to note that occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a job for some metallic element , developments from quite another quarter produce a demand for just such a I I 2 CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK material . Tantalum , discarded as an incandescent lamp filament in favor of the higher melting point tungsten , is now employed in the radio industry . Selenium , for years recovered as a by-product in the refining of copper not for its value but for the sake of copper purity , is now used in glass manufacture and may become of value to replace sulfur for special purposes . The comparatively rare metals have their own special fields of usefulness . At one time counterfeit coins were made in Russia by gold plating platinum . Most of the platinum comes from the Ural mountains and this counterfeiting was done before the unique properties of platinum were appreciated . It was then a base metal as compared with gold ; it is now much more valuable . Platinum is indispensable in scientific work . In a chemical laboratory it is used in the form of crucibles , dishes , foil , wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reagents , and reactions carried on in platinum vessels suffer no change due to the solubility of the container . Many fusions and ignitions are carried on in platinum vessels , while in analytical work platinum gauze may be used to plate out a metal from solution or used in countless ways . In the chemical industry platinum is the catalyst in the contact process for the manufacture of sulfuric acid . This acid is so basic to the chemical industry that statesmen have pointed out the possibility of measuring the civilization of a country by its consumption of sulfuric acid . It is platinum gauze which acts as catalyst in the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid . Platinum is used for electrical contacts and alloyed with iridium is used for thermocouples and for pyrometers with which high temperatures are accurately measured . Platinum alloyed with the rare metal iridium is largely used for pen points and in dentistry . These really necessary uses have been made more difficult because fashion has fastened on platinum as a medium for jewelry . It does offer properties attractive to the manufacturing jeweler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mark of quality to the indiscriminate though well-to-do buyer , and since // profits are usually on a percentage basis , this fad in jewelry has been encouraged by the trade . The leaden color and the softness of the metal would seem to be disadvantages for the art of decoration ; but these are lost in the determination to have platinum continue popular . Indeed even the war emergency had little effect upon this situation . In the chapter on communication mention was made of a new alloy designed after careful chemical research to have a greater capacity for carrying messages than those heretofore employed . It furnishes an illustration of how with sufficient scientific data on the behavior of elements and their compounds it is possible to meet exacting specifications . Metals are often protected by other metals , as well as having their own character changed to give them peculiar qualities . Heat treating and case hardening are examples of the latter . Both depend on the fact that the size and arrangement of crystals in the metal have much to do with its physical condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made extremely hard . Intricate parts are sometimes fashioned in soft metal and then hardened by heating and suddenly plunging the material in a bath which automatically controls the temperature to which it cools down and this in turn has a bearing on the crystal structure . Heat treatment is carried on more scientifically with the employment of muffles , pyrometers , and chemical control . Photomicrography has been of great assistance in this work . Sections of metals are ground and polished and the polished surface etched with chemical reagents selective in their action , so that a photograph will reveal the character and distribution of the masses of crystals which determine the properties of the metal . Soft base metals are sometimes protected by plating upon them a skin of a harder metal . This same method is used to protect against acids , gases , and fumes . Asbestos pressed upon sheet metal with a bituminous binder is also used as a protective coating , particularly where acid fumes are to be met . One of the most familiar coatings is that of zinc , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron . Thin sheets of iron are cleansed by chemical dips such as a sulfuric bath and then passed through a flux , of which zinc chloride is an important part , and then through the molten zinc which crystallizes out in a thin film , giving the characteristic brilliant zinc crystals on the surface of the metal . Zinc is also used to galvanize wire , rods , and pipe . Tin plate is based on the same principle and consists in coating iron sheets with thin films of tin . Much research has been devoted to recovering metallic tin from old cans . One successful process disposes of its product in the form of tin tetrachloride for which there is a demand as a weighting material for silk . As is well known , most metal shapes are made by casting the molten metal in a suitable mould . The finest ones may require months in the preparation of the sand surface which is to impart the design to the finished casting . Moulding becomes a real art in such cases . Other times the moulds may be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the mould to be made for one impression only . This gave rise to a demand for a metal such that it could be cast in a metal mould to be used over and over again . To-day vast quantities of small parts are cast in metal dies , the product being known as die castings . Good metals for this purpose must first of all have the requisite strength when completed , must have such a melting point that they can be made to flow from the reservoir of molten metal to the die casting without difficulty , and the composition must be so constant that any allowances made for expansion or contraction in cooling may be depended upon continually to yield first class work . In one sense the linotype and monotype machines produce die castings . Here antimony-tin mixtures are used , the antimony imparting the unique property of expanding slightly upon cooling , rather than contracting as do most metals . The extrusion of small size pipe and of rods is a labor-saving , cost-reducing method impossible except for metals designed with the help of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct melting point are contrived to serve as safety plugs in boilers , these plugs melting when the heat becomes excessive , thereby forestalling an explosion . Alloys that will melt much below the boiling point of water are sometimes used in sprinkler systems where , with any abnormal rise of temperature , they melt , permitting the water to shower down . There are instances of such sprinkler systems , installed under the cornice of buildings to protect them in case of fire across the street , letting go on a hot day , much to the astonishment of pedestrians below . These low melting point metals are also used to fill in engravings on dark backgrounds , while solder may be of either low or high melting point . The low melting point variety may contain lead , tin , bismuth , and cadmium , while for the higher melting points pure metals , even silver , may be employed . Occasionally some one has the fortune to find in natural ores the right combination of metals to yield a useful alloy . One of the nickel-cobalt combinations named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to separate these constituents by a refining process but to remove the gangue without disturbing the proportions of nickel , cobalt , and the trace of iron which yield a metal particularly resistant to many forms of corrosion . Any one of the big metal companies has a weekly , if not a daily , opportunity to purchase from some inventor the rediscovered lost secret of hardening copper or it may be some other mystery he is prepared to disclose , such as the formula for the Damascus steel or the Toledo blade . Modern metallurgists believe they have independently discovered methods such as the ancients used , that tempered copper was nothing more nor less than a bronze involving tin , and that none of the alloys of old are beyond the realm of possibility if the market is developed . Ancient bronzes in contact with earth and subject to weather conditions for centuries are found so badly corroded as to give little clue to the original design . Electrochemists have found I16 CHEMISTRY IN THE WORLD 'S WORK by making these oxidized objects the cathode where hydrogen will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which brings out even the fine engravings placed there by the artisan thousands of years ago . Circlets of greenish masses of oxide have been reduced to clean metal bands formed of a coiled serpent delicately carved . Coins have been made to show the bust of the Emperor whom they were fashioned to honor , and statuettes , formerly mere masses of oxide , have been restored in all their graceful lines . It is difficult to imagine our world without the abundance and variety of metals which we enjoy . Many metals can be used over and over again , how often is already the subject of research . Some metals seem to be deposited in limitless quantities ; others are severely localized , as , for example , tin and nickel . In all cases conservation is in order and by conservation the chemist always means efficient utilization . This is another way of saying applied chemistry . CHAPTER VIII MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION So long as man used only such things as he found in nature , his building program remained definitely limited . Sun-dried brick and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical characteristics limit the height and size of structures , as well as the loads they can carry . Some notable structures of old , temples and shrines , have long since been reduced to ruins , and some of the more elaborate which were of decorated wood were long ago reduced to ashes . The structures of massive stone like the pyramids , which have come down through the centuries , and the masonry castles of the Middle Ages , are wonderful examples of what can be done with stone and mortar ; but such buildings are of no significance in modern civilization and would be of no value in such industrial centers as those of our present day . It was a Chicago contractor who refused to enthuse over the pyramids , remarking that they looked all right but that there was no market for them . Imagine erecting a building to house the thousands which crowd into a modern office structure without the modern materials of construction . Ceramic materials , those made from clays and fired , were among the first used by the race . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizing modern science , the clay worker of to-day is able to produce both a superior quality and a much greater variety of sizes , shapes , textures , and colors , of building units . The phenomenon of clay ripening still remains without an adequate explanation ; but much is known regarding the control of this process . Some contend that the changes which take place are brought about by bacterial action ; others prefer the theories of colloidal chemistry , and certainly the contributions of physical chemistry have enabled the ceramic chemist // to determine with much accuracy the physical and chemical properties of a long list of clays used even yet in empirical mixtures in the ceramic arts . Clay-working machines have been developed ; but in many places the craftsmen still believe it to be necessary to mix the clay by treading upon it with bare feet . It is now known why the ancients required straw in the making of brick , and while those old craftsmen learned by experience that the straw provided an essential ingredient , they probably did not know what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colloidal material that served as a binder and deflocculated the clay . Chemists by extensive analysis , firing experiments , and physical tests have shown what impurities in clay can not be tolerated and have devised ways to remove them . Impetus was given this work during the late war when domestic deposits , as for example in Georgia , were drawn upon to replace raw material previously imported , but for which there was no room in ships engaged upon war missions . It was found that by suitably washing and purifying these deposits qualities could be secured which formerly had been believed obtainable only in imported clays . Optimum temperatures have been determined for the firing of the various wares and a range of cones provided which melt at definite temperatures and are therefore of great value in controlling kiln operations . By placing a series of cones , representing lower and upper limits of temperature , in the oven , the degree to which the points bend over , collapse entirely , or remain erect indicate what temperatures have been reached in the interior of the furnace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them of the recording type , the greater accuracy and permanent record which they afford make them preferable for much of the fine work . Studies on plasticity and its cause , upon texture and strength have led to the wide use of moulding and extruding machinery ; so in the manufacture of roofing tile , for example , the tedious process of forming the clay over a tree trunk , as was practiced // in California in Spanish days , is a matter of history . Add to this the chemical knowledge of inorganic pigments , of color changes to be expected in new chemical combinations taking place in the fire and those obtained with the aid of colored glazes , and there becomes available a selection of ceramic products well calculated to satisfy the requirements of modern builders . The natural sources of colors in ceramic ware are due to impurities in the raw materials or , as indicated above , to added pigments . Many of the raw materials when pure are white and when burned to the finished ware produce a white mass . China clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give white products but for the presence of minute quantities of impurities , especially iron . Iron may be present as one or more of the many oxides of the element or of iron in combination with silica and alumina . There may also be carbonate , iron sulfide , and complex mixtures . Some ceramic raw materials like bauxite and magnesite may be yellowish in color due to limonite . An indication of the variables which may influence the color of iron compounds in finished materials may be of interest . Of course , the quantity of the oxide and its nature will have a bearing . The amount of other constituents is important , as is the temperature at which the material is burned and the composition of the gases coming in contact with the ware during burning . The extent to which the piece is vitrified is another variable . The red one sees on terra cotta is often a surface coat produced by spraying a solution of ferric chloride on the dry ware before firing . After firing , the terra cotta has the well known red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as fused or vitrified material is formed to any extent . Buff colors , as in buff brick , are composed of different colored materials occurring as tiny areas or dots varying from white or yellow to brown , red , and black . The size and distribution of these different patches of color , as well as their proportion , give us a range of shades . Black ware is obtained with ferrous and magnetic oxides ,
