" Another preacher prayed this morning and had to read his prayer . There has n't been a one that could make an impromptu prayer . " <P> These were the words with which Buffoon Will Rogers described the invocation of the deity at the sessions of the Republican Convention ( see p. 9 ) . Will Rogers spoke without reverence but he spoke the truth . Four divines - an Episcopalian , a Catholic , a Hebrew and a Methodist-had. prayed on four successive days with a great air of spontaneity but without lifting their eyes from the written page to God . Though extemporaneous outpourings could only reasonably have been expected from the Methodist , it was a pity , devout observers felt , that the appearance , at least , of immediate inspiration had not been affected . <P> On further thought , it seemed to observers that if it were necessary to truckle in this fashion to ignorant laymen , prayer might better be omitted at Republican Conventions . It would be Utopian to imagine that the hordes of greedy politicians gathered there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven . Why then should reverend gentlemen of several sects hold up their faiths for a mockery by delegates who thought denomination was two words ? Such a question was implicit in the further writings of that impious buffoon who criticized the preachers : <P> " This one was a Methodist , and he wanted us ' to look to the hills for wisdom , ' and here we went and nominated Charley Curtis from the plains of Kansas , where a five-foot ashheap would constitute a precipice . <P> " This preacher prayed for Plymouth Rock . Lord , it 's Boulder Darn we are after , now ! There is no appropriation goes with Plymouth Rock . "
