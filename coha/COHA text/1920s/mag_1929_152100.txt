Where the Vice President lives is of small concern to the U. S. Government , which gives him $15,000 per annum and leaves him to find his own quarters . When Vice President Charles Curtis established himself , his official-hostess sister , Mrs. Edward Everett Gann , and Mr. Gann , at the fashionable Mayflower Hotel , Washington busybodies eyed the apartment ( foyer , double-sized drawing room , dining room for 26 guests , smoking room , library , four bedrooms , two servants ' rooms , kitchen , furnished at a cost of $75,000 ) , ascertained its normal rental ( $22,500 per year ) , and hastily concluded that Mr. Curtis was a free guest at the hotel for advertising purposes . A story to that effect went the rounds . <P> His nerves already raw from the public interest taken in his social battle in behalf of Mrs. Gann ( TIME , April 15 ) , the Vice President last week exploded on the matter of his Mayflower rent . Said he with hot feeling : <P> " I know the story ! ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could see the scoundrel who started it . . I wish people would mind their own affairs and leave mine alone . ... Of course I do not pay the regular rates for a great big hotel apartment . What I do pay is nobody 's damned business ! I can afford to pay what they charge me . " <P> The Vice President angrily explained that the Willard Hotel , where lived Thomas R. Marshall and Calvin Coolidge as Vice Presidents , had " made a proposition " to him of free rent , which he rejected . Continuing , he said : <P> " Then the Mayflower people came to see me . After looking over their rooms I accepted their proposition . ... I did n't haggle . ... I pay my bills regularly and expect to pay them every month I live here . Nobody 's giving me anything . " <P> Manager R. L. Pollio of the Mayflower tactfully announced that the Curtis rent was " something around $10,000 a year " and added : " We went after the Vice President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . We are glad to have him here . ... It is an honor and , to be perfectly frank , it is worth a lot of money in advertising . ... " <P> Of far greater social import than the problem of the Vice President 's official hostess , is the problem of night-club hostesses in free- &-easy; Manhattan , where Assistant Attorney Mabel Walker Willebrandt lately lost her Prohibition cases against the two outstanding personages of nocturnal fame , Mary Louise ( " Texas " ) Guinan and Helen Morgan . Manhattanites were interested last week in the following statement by Miss Guinan : <P> " I 've been congratulated on my acquittal by thousands of people . Why , only a few nights ago , Harry Curtis , son of the Vice President of the U. S. , came to my club and congratulated me from the centre of the floor . He is of the type of people who know that I am an entertainer for good wholesome fun . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
