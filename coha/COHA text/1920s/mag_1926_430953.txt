 | IS THE so-called " crime wave among our youth " a reality ? Or only a figment of the imagination ? Is it true that youth is supplanting age in our criminal courts and jails ? If so , how has this condition come about ? What are the causes behind it ? The possible remedies ? What say the judges of our criminal courts ? The educators of the land ? The parents ? These are the sober questions beating at the hearts of all alert citizens in the country today . And especially of the fathers and mothers ! They are heard on every one 's lips ? in streets and trains , in business offices , at the theater , in social gatherings . What is the truth about this thing ? Can it be got at ? It was in an effort to see if it could be " got at " ? first from sources close hand , and next from those at a distance ? that the writer of this article , one day early last spring , hurried down Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its Bridge of Sighs , to the Criminal Courts Building beyond . Here , involuntarily , she paused and looked up at the somber edifice , recalling some figures recently obtained from the District Attorney 's office . In 1925 , 9989 men and women , 8o percent of them under twenty , all of them so young that they averaged twenty years of age , had been tried here : 5241 in Special Sessions for the lesser crimes , 4748 in General Sessions for felonies . Between 6o and 70 percent of them had been convicted . And nearly 50 percent of the entire number had been sent to jail . Startling figures ! Yet figures can be , and often are , used to prove both sides of a question . Humanly , they mean little . So , with an open mind , the writer entered the building , made her way across the white marble rotunda crowded with hurrying men , to the judges ' elevator , and was carried up to the chambers of Judge John F. McIntyre of the Court of General Sessions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . He , if any one , would be able to analyze the problem in a broad , national , fundamental way , from the angle of the criminal courts of our large cities , and offer a solution . Not only was he a man of seventyone years , who had sat in General Sessions for a decade ? the writer reminded herself ? but behind his experience on the Bench was a term of fourteen years as Assistant District Attorney of New York County , and before that many years at the Bar , when he was identified with some of the most famous criminal cases in the history of New York . As a clerk ushered her into the Judge 's private office , and into his presence , he " Of the reasons for the restlessness and the criminal tendencies of youth the lack of religious training so far outdistances all others that it stands alone " @#  | rose slowly from behind a great , flat-top desk ? a quiet , rather stern-looking man , with white hair and mustache , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caller was seated , he remained standing . Then he dropped back into his chair and waited . Through the three windows on his right a jutting wing of the grim Tombs building was visible . Over there , in prison cells , men and women awaited this quiet man 's pronouncements . " I have come to ask you , Judge McIntyre , " challenged the writer , to what you attribute the present crime wave among our youth ? Or do you hold that no such condition exists ? There are many today who declare that criminal tendencies are not alarmingly apparent in the youth of the country ; that our young people today are not noticeably different from those of twenty years ago . Are you of that opinion ? " Judge McIntyre looked up quickly , sternly . " I am not ! How could I , in honesty , hold such a view ? However , I object to the term crime wave . ' It suggests a temporary outburst . In my opinion , the criminal tendencies acutely apparent among our young today are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical climax of the slow , steady increase in crime among young people which commenced twelve or fifteen years ago and is still mounting rapidly . " You are referring , Judge McIntyre , to the committing of minor offenses ? " " I am referring , " he replied curtly , " to felonies ! Only felons come into the Court of General Sessions . " Involuntarily his quick glance ? keen , compassionate ? sought the prison building just beyond his windows , and lingered there a moment , as though to penetrate the granite to the bitter , warped , rebellious youth within . Then slowly he wheeled about . " My experience in this court leads me to believe that most of the serious crime in our country today is being carried on by young people . Certainly it is true of New York county ! Our vicious criminals here ? our forgers , burglars , hold-up men , murderers ? are young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three . " Among these all classes of society are represented . Some of our shoplifters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-educated girls , with cultivated speech , from good residential districts . Some of our young men criminals are college graduates . " He paused . And the writer , leaning forward , explained to him the earnest desire of the Editor of GoodHOUSEKEEPING to get at the fundamental causes behind the restlessness and lawlessness of so many modern young people : and , if possible , to discover a solution  | of the problem that will be really practical . " What , in your opinion , is back of it all , Judge McIntyre ? Why are young felons pouring into your court , instead of middleaged felons as in the past ? And what remedies , what preventives , would you suggest ? " He was silent for a long moment . " It is a psychological condition difficult to analyze . On the surface one would say , the rotten moral standards and general jazz ' spirit of the times . Girls are finery-mad , demanding of life shoes at twenty dollars a pair and sheer hose at two-fifty ; and young men are excitement-mad and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that is only a superficial view . The real causes lie deep down underneath . There are too many of them for me to enumerate them all . But the outstanding ones are these . " Why Youth Goes Wrong Drawing a pad of paper toward him , he thoughtfully , carefully , made his list , numbering the causes to simplify discussion of them later . Then he tore the sheet off and handed it over . It read as follows : 1 . Lack of religious training in childhood 2 . Absence of parental authority and dis-cipline 3 . Failure to instill ideals of modesty and chastity in female children 4 . The age-old problem of liquor 5 . The production , by dissipated parents , of paranoiac children 6 . Unsupervised amusements : including especially " joy riding , " cheap movies , and indecent modern dances 7 . Lack of proper recreational facilities in most neighborhoods 8 . Unwillingness of young people today to work hard , and indulgence of this laziness by foolish parents " And which of these causes do you consider of gravest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have listed them in the order of their importance , " he replied tersely . " And the antidote for each should be apparent from the way in which I have described the causes . " The writer could not conceal her astonishment as she looked down at the list . " You regard the lack of religious training in childhood as the chief cause of delinquency among our youth today ? That is a strong statement . Judge McIntyre . " ' He leaned forward , intensely earnest . In the grip of his hands on the arms of his chair his deep emotion was apparent . " I wish , " he said gravely , " I could find words with which to stress fully its immense importance ! As a cause , it so far outdistances all others I have named that it stands alone ! " If I could give only one piece of advice to anxious parents all over the country , I would urge : ' It makes no difference what your faith may be ? Buddhist , Catholic , Jewish , Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral principles of that religion . Encourage obedience to them during childhood . And send your boy or girl out into the world equipped with a definite set of religious standards . Such a boy or girl almost never finds his or her way into the criminal courts . ' " All court officials with whom I have ever discussed this subject . " concluded Judge McIntyre , " have agreed that that is the one great safeguard which can ? and must ? be thrown around our young people ! " After a moment he added : " As for the second cause on my list lack of home discipline ? I 'm sure I need say little about that . Modern parents are spineless ! They have cast authority to the winds . Thousands of boys and girls are being allowed to grow up uncontrolled ? a menace to society . If a child is not taught to obey the law of the home , he is almost certain to become a lawbreaker out in the world . " Boys and girls nowadays seem to have no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social friends , society at large . In the young criminals brought before my bench I observe a callousness which almost passes belief . " Here the writer interrupted to hand him a newspaper she had bought half an hour before . The headlines read : " BOYS , THE OLDEST FIFTEEN , ADMIT TEN ROBBERIES . MAY CLEAR UP THREE HUNDRED THEFTS . YOUNG PRISONERS TAKEN AT 5 A. M. ONE CARRIED PISTOL . " And the account went on to say that the boys had maintained a bold front when questioned by detectives , seeming to take great pleasure in relating their exploits . " This is the callousness you refer to , Judge McIntyre ? " He nodded . Then with a shrug he handed the newspaper back . " If parents could only realize , " he exclaimed , " that whereas the home discipline is loving , the world 's discipline is cruel ! If a parent shirks his job , the State will have to substitute for it the bitter rod of court and prison . " He sat silent for a few moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he plunged into an earnest discussion of the third subject on his list : the instilling of modesty and chastity in female children . " That cause may seem to apply only to girls , " he said . " But , since many girls today are not only proving to be criminals themselves ? as prostitutes and shoplifters , for example ? but are also aiding the men in their crimes , the girl is , perhaps , the gravest problem of all . Especially as she could , if she would , be such an influence on men and boys as to check crime ! " Let me urge on parents , therefore ? teach your girls that they are the regulating force of the world . Woman is the architect of decency . The world depends upon her to inculcate high ideals of living , a reverence for the Almighty , a spirit of brotherhood . A good girl is capable of leading a young man into right . " Judge McIntyre paused , then added a bit sternly : " In my opinion , if our young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womanhood ? nothing superhuman or superfine , but just modesty and morality ? they would correct the so-called crime wave ' more quickly than all other efforts put together . " He leaned back in his chair . Are the Mothers Good Examples ? " And it is your belief , Judge McIntyre , that modern mothers are not thus raising their daughters ? " ' He made a quiet , half-angry gesture . " Go out into the streets of this city ? any city or town ? and look about you ! A young girl should be the embodiment of purity . Modesty is becoming in her : immodesty disgusting . Yet what do we see on all our city streets ? girls from respectable homes , walking about painted and bedizened , half-clad , loud-voiced , with skirts reaching only to their knees . Worse still , they are often accompanied by mothers similarly tricked out . " What are we to say of this type of mother ? She is appearing in ever-increasing numbers in all our large cities today . She sponsors the present fashions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter does . She boasts of her hip-flask and private bootlegger . " And that , by the way , brings me to the fourth cause of criminal tendencies among our youth ? the old , old question of liquor ! " He threw out his hands in an expressive gesture . Then , rising with a quiet apology , he slowly crossed the big room and flung up a window . For an instant he stood there , lost in thought , looking out into the sunshine .  | Over his shoulder I could just catch a glimpse of the gray Tombs . Presently he turned about with great dignity , yet under the pressure of such earnestness that it spoke in every line . " Drink has always been a problem of the criminal courts . Do n't make any mistake about that . Today it seems especially acute only because of the kind of liquor drnk , its availability at many of our hearthstones , and the general flippant , cynical attitude toward it . I will admit that until all this is changed , until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our youth are not likely to decrease . " If parents flout the law , if they regard hipflasks as the most interesting topic of social conversation , and spend time and money in a pursuit of liquor , as though it were a kind of ultimate aim in life ? why should they revolt at the sight of a little son or daughter on trial in a criminal court ? The one follows the other as surely as night follows day . " But . . He hesitated , then added : " What I am about to say is a bit startling . It may awaken incredulity . But I give it as my earnest conviction . It is this ? if parents would tell their young people that the Prohibition Law , being a law , must be obeyed ; and if they would deny to their boys and girls the taste of liquor , the appetite would pass away in this generation . The next generation would not be desirous of liquor . " Of course , this would have to include vigorous efforts by parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz dance halls with booze on the table , the bawdy houses posing as resorts ' or chop-suey places ' ; and all the other temptations being thrust on the attention of our young people in a day when the old moral conventions seem to be broken down . A large order ? No doubt ! But I believe it could be done ! " Returning to his chair , he sank down into it and began to discuss the fourth cause on his list ? the production , by dissipated parents , of children who are morons : on the shadow line , that is , between genius and imbecility . " The formation of the skulls of certain imbeciles , " he explained , " is now known to be due to the indiscreet habits of the parents . Either the excessive use of liquor , or sexual sins , may have that effect . This is called paranoia . In the state of New York today , walking around in our cities and towns , it is estimated that there are at least 62,000 of these paranoiacs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dissuaded from crime under right influences . " Temperance and chastity in the home , the banishment of drunken sprees and the latest " thrill " or affinity , concluded Judge McIntyre , would prevent the further production of these . unfortunate children . The Danger of Dance Halls " And as for the modern dance ! " he exclaimed a moment later , turning to the question of unsupervised amusements . " The nation appears to be jazz-mad ! Our big cities , especially ! And no class of society is exempt . Girls with college degrees may be seen , almost any day , in New York City , writhing and wobbling their way around a dance floor in some restaurant . But it is in the poorer districts of New York , that jazz is getting in its deadliest work . For there the young girls , having no better amusement , are pouring into the cheap dance halls . " In these places they meet men of the most dangerous type . Although hardly more than boys , these men are diseased , are in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime ring . The fate of the girls can be imagined . " " Is this condition confined to New York ? " the writer asked . " No . It is country-wide . Every large American city has a few such places . " He pointed out that parents and publicspirited citizens could hardly undertake a more vital work than the careful investigation of dubious places of amusement , dance halls especially , and the closing down of eighttenths of them . " Then there is the type of movie that incites to sexual crimes ! " he added . " Need I remark that no child should be permitted to see such pictures ? And there is the cheap automobile ! So much has been said regarding the part played by the car in the crimes of our youth today that I shall not add to it . The cheap auto not only makes sexual offenses possible , but also transports young robbers to and from the scenes of their depreliations . " The Community Must Provide Recreation And as regards the next cause on the list ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their young this , too , he declared , had been brought to the attention of the public so persistently for years that further words were useless . Action was needed , instead . " Many strides have been made along this line , " he admitted . " But our facilities are still pitifully inadequate . In the big cities many of our children are forced to the streets for play . Others gather on apartment house roofs , in alleys , or on the wharves : wherever they can find room . Our young girls receive their beaux on street corners or in dance halls . " So often , " he finished sadly , " I find that a young man or woman brought before me for larceny or burglary or forgery or assault was as inevitably shoved into criminality by neglectful parents and community as the wellreared , well-provided-for child is steered into good citizenship . " Some young people are innately strong enough to grow up without religious training , pass through the dangers of adolescence without guidance or proper recreation , and yet ? rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noble living . But my conviction is that such a boy or a girl is rare ! " Correct discipline , Judge McIntyre emphasized , consists of providing fun and work in such proportions as to keep the child absorbed every moment . The busy boy or girl is the virtuous one " And that brings me to the eighth , and last , cause on my list ? the unwillingness of young people to work , today . This tendency is startling , being apparent to every one brought into contact with erring youth . The younger generation ? or , at least , that percentage of it that collides with the law ? simply will not work if it can help it . These young men would rather steal than work . The girls would rather shoplift than settle down to office routine . " " To what do you attribute this ? " the writer asked . " Again ? to faulty upbringing ! Every child should be made to understand that he , or she , will have to be a wage-earner . Are most young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents often fail to instill this in their boys and girls , strange as that may seem . And as for the well-to-do class , it dumps on the world every year thousands of lazy , excitement-loving , spoiled young men and women with no concept of their duty to organized society , no real work habits , no high ambitions of any sort . Such youthful loafers and drifters help to keep our courts and prisons full . " After a quick glance at his watch he arose . And the writer , closing her notebook , sprang up , too , with a sober word of thanks for all that he had given . " Parents often ask me , " he commented in parting , " why they seem to have so little influence over their children , and how they can obtain a greater influence . Such an effort should have begun at the cradle . But even half-grown children can be won over . " I advise these parents : gain the children 's love by attempting to understand them . Make pals and chums of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting a silent example by living in conformity with law and decency . That , roughly , from the angle of the criminal courts , is the solution of the crime problem among the young . " Another of his grave bows ? and the writer was dismissed . Down through the Criminal Courts Building she retraced her steps , and crossed the city to her home . Here she sent out to criminal court . judges in every section of the United States , and to a few juvenile court judges here and in Canada , questionnaires inviting a country-wide expression of opinion as to the existence of a crime wave among our youth , the causes behind it , and the possible solution of the problem . Very shortly the responses began to pour in : earnest , whole-hearted letters , gladly cooperating . As the weeks passed , they continued to arrive . Today , as this article is being written , they have not wholly ceased to come . It is interesting to note that despite superficial differences there is complete agreement ? but for one dissenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among our young people today , whether this is termed a " crime wave " or only a slow increase in crime covering a period of years . We Must Teach Responsibility But the judges shall take the stand , and speak for themselves ! Hon. Florence E. Allen , Judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio ? writing from Columbus , Ohio ? has the following to say : " In my opinion the disrespect for law which exists in America is caused mainly by our failure to teach the meaning of responsibility . This failure is shared equally by the home , the school , and the church . When we teach the meaning of responsibility to the children , we shall not have so much crime among young people . " And now , Minneapolis , Minnesota , to the stand ! It is Hon. Edward F. Waite , Judge of the District Court , speaking : " I do not think there is a crime wave ' among the young men and women of the United States . What has been for some years and still exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extreme recklessness and violence , and ? a comparatively new phenomenon ? participation in these crimes by young women . As to the causes of this I have thought not a little . I should mention two outstanding causes : first , and most fundamental , the breakdown of religious training in the home . Character can have no firm and lasting basis , for the great majority of people , other than religious faith ; and religious faith comes rarely into any life save through early religious training . " Second , the extreme complexity of modern life , and the demand for excitement to which children and young people are habituated by new forms of amusement ? of which the movies , the automobiles , extreme types of dancing , the sensational stage and up-to-date fiction are examples ? have created an inordinate desire for thrills ' and kicks . ' The lawless youth who used to satisfy his craving for adventure in a disorderly escapade , now finds anything short of a wild joy-ride in a stolen motor car , or a hold-up , quite too tame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame ? I think my query would be , Who is not to blame ? " The remedy ? I think there is nothing fundamental that does not begin at the cradle . The damage has been done to the present generation of young criminals , and I can suggest nothing for them except improved police methods and thorough reform of our criminal procedure , so that apprehension and reformatory confinement may be more swift and sure . " For the future , you can do no greater service than to make your readers see that unless they are better men and women in every relation of life ? and especially unless they are better parents ? twentieth-century society is riding  | to a fall . The church , the school , social enterprises , honest administration of wise laws , can do something ; but the key is the home . Respect for rightful authority and the self-control that is its natural fruit , consideration for others which has its root in love of God and man ? these must be learned in the home . And if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the nation . " A far call , next ? an expression of opinion from Los Angeles , California , from a Juvenile Court Judge ? Hon. Harry R. Archbald of the Superior Court . I can see the beginning of adult offenders in a good many of the boys and girls who come before me , and I am of the opinion that the adults of this generation are responsible for a great deal of the present trouble . " We can not expect the youth of impressionable age to build , into their habits of thought and living , the principles that will keep them out of trouble in later years , when so many of the adults with whom they associate are lacking in those ideals themselves . Too many grown people today are living examples of a laxity of thought and conduct which has a demoralizing effect ' on the young people watching them . We must begin today to train the boys and girls of today to be the citizens and parents of the future , equipped for their job . " A United Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two judges , both sitting in the Cook County Criminal Court ! Let us hear first the statement of Hon. Marcus Kavanagh , of the Superior Court of Cook County : " Statistics from all over the country show that adolescent offenders come from broken homes . By that I mean not only homes where one or both of the parents are dead or in some way missing , but also homes where the parents have lost control over their children . " The first , but not most important , lesson in teaching children obedience to their country 's laws , is for the parents to teach them to obey the law of the mother and the law of the father . I have never yet seen a disobedient boy who grew into a successful man . I have never yet seen a disobedient girl who grew into a happy mother and the successful ruler of her own house . " But the greatest and most vital lesson of all is to make the children know and feel the reign of God and their nearness to Him . The fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giving of this most important lesson to their wives . Fathers forget that their children deem their father the wisest of all men . His example , more than anything else , is their rule of after-life . " How many fathers stop to show their children the necessity for reliance on God and His power over them ? " We would have few criminals in the country if the fathers of families would , every week or so , have a little heart-to-heart talk with their children about God and His infinite care for them . " And here is the counsel of our other Chicago judge , Hon. William V. Brothers of the Circuit Court of Illinois : " I am interested in the task you have undertaken . To one in daily contact with the general subject of crime it is most interesting to observe what reaction others have as to causes and possible preventives . " I am of the opinion that the three important contributing causes of crime in the present day are the automobile , the movie , and liquor . " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quick and comfortable means of transportation to and from scenes of crime , proves an important factor . One of its worst purposes seems to be to provide the means for young people to indulge in necking and petting parties away from the influence of their homes and chaperones . " Movies , leaving little to the imagination . seem to stir the youth to experiments in matters of crime . And of course it goes without  | saying that many pictures inspire persons to excesses of passion . " Liquor has always played a serious part in crime and criminology . Perhaps no more so lately than heretofore ; but surely a certain disrespect for law has grown up in the past few years . The great evil in disregarding the liquor laws is that among the ignorant , illiterate , and criminally inclined it breeds a disinclination to pay attention to any law calculated to curb their passions and prevent their indulgence in crime . " In the last analysis ? only in rare instances do we find that where the home influences are what they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The greatest preventive for crime is the wholesome atmosphere of a home where God is revered , parents command and receive love and respect , and the children are taught to assume their fair share of responsibility . " And now , a wide sweep to the north , to Regina , in the Province of Saskatchewan , Canada ! It is Hon. EthelMacLachlan , Judge of the Juvenile Court , bearing witness : " The chief reasons for children being delinquent are bad home training ( delinquent parents ) , bad upbringing and environment , bad heredity , bad example of parents and adults , and failure on the part of parents to teach children honesty , self-denial , self-control and to do without instead of wanting everything in sight . Street running at night eventually brings many children into court . Idleness supplies its quota ; so does unemployment . " Misspent or idle Sundays also contribute greatly to delinquency . Dozens of children , when asked to which church they go , make the reply that they never were in a church or Sunday-school in their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , to fill in the day with mischief , damage , and theft , and never return until late at night . " The child who is allowed to grow up with an absolute disregard of the Sabbath is being deprived of something essential to both his childhood and his manhood . I am stressing this point because of the large number of offenses which take place on Sunday . " Being out late at night , unsupervised public dances , unchaperoned late auto rides , unscrupulous men who trap girls of fifteen ? all these help to bring the children into court . About two-thirds of the children come in through causes over which they have no control . " The other one-third come there through mischief , love of pleasure , gang influence , curiosity , bad temper , revenge , immoral nature , ignorance , family feuds , cruelty , wanderlust . And a few are just naturally bad . " Life is Too Complex for Us A drop , to the extreme southern boundary of the United States , to Alabama , for our next message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Birmingham , Senior Judge of the Domestic Relations Court of Jefferson County , has taken the stand . " There seems to be a question as to whether there is more delinquency among young people today than in the past . I have frequently seen statements in the daily papers by prominent educators of the country to the effect that there is not more delinquency now than formerly . These statements are usually made by the heads of co-educational universities and prominent schools for young women . Of course ? these educators are dealing with the very finest type of the country 's youth , and we may well agree that they are correct ! " But it is undoubtedly true that there are , now , more young people whose character is positively and actively good , and a larger number whose character is positively and actively bad , than ever before . This would be true on account of our increased population . But I think it is true , also , on account of  | present-day forces which make for such a development . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that in the last few years , since the automobile has come into general use , life has become , very rapidly , more complex . Good roads , the automobile , and the drift from the country to the city have almost revolutionized the mode of living of a large part of our population . I am inclined to think that this revolution developed faster than society has been able to devise , and put into execution , plans to meet these new conditions . It is also true that society has never been so actively interested or so alert , as now . " In order to overtake and overcome the forces which are causing delinquency on the part of our young people , we need better parents , and better hones , better schools , more active churches , and a more virile and enlightened public conscience . The tremendous present-day interest on the part of society at large is , I am sure , an earnest of final success . " Back to the Middle West , once more . for a word from Omaha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juvenile and District Court , offers us his opinions : " The reason why there is so much crime among our young people today is that the home is failing to function in the manner in which it was intended to do . . . " A great percentage of the present crimes could be eliminated by the proper development of home life by the parents . Lack of respect for parental authority , caused in a great many instances by the failure of the parents themselves to respect the authority of the state , leads to the lawless attitude of the day . " The responsibility is a personal one . The young people can not escape by placing it on their parents or on the schools or on that vague term , society . ' And the remedy lies in an acceptance of the personal responsibility for these conditions by the young people themselves . " Every Child Needs Religious Training Another word of testimony , from the state of Ohio , and this case will be closed ! From Hon. Harry G. Gram , Judge of the Juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blundering youth of the land : " I want to say in the beginning that I am not one of those who believe that the youth of today are generally headed for destruction . But the situation is certainly one to challenge parents , and the public generally , with its seriousness . " Among the children who are brought into court for various offenses , I find one outstanding and almost invariable lack . These children have had practically no religious and moral training . And often , I discover , their parents are indifferent to such influences in their own lives and environment . " Then , too , there is great laxity on the part of parents in controlling the spare time of their children . Hence this leisure time includes too much jazz , too many automobile rides and salacious movies , and , often , opportunities and temptations to drink . " After children have got into minor difficulties and been brought into court , and it has been found that there is a breakdown in the home . the average juvenile court is handicapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound-foolish ideas of economy of county officials who make appropriations . These officials seldom provide sufficient funds to enable the court to employ trained probation officers able to correct family difficulties and , by close supervision , supply the child with the discipline needed to make him into a useful member of society . " The state , and society , are to blame for not demanding , and providing for , a more forceful and a more thoroughly equipped probation force in all the juvenile courts . " If this step were taken , it would do more check crime among the young than any other community effort . "
