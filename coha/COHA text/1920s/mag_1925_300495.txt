Rath declared in cross examination that anti-aircraft fire was effective ; that Colonel Mitchell ( then General ) had during the War ordered flights under extremely adverse conditions ; once had sent five flyers not experienced in night flying out on a mission which brought them home after dark , so that all five crashed in landing and one was killed ; on another occasion had sent out twelve bombers in such bad weather that neither French nor British sent up bombers , and only four of the twelve ever returned . Congressman Reid kept asking , " So you say you were afraid to do that ? " until the audience began to hiss . General Patrick , Chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government contentions .
