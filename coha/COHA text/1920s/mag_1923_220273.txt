The present trade expansion is of a fundamentally different order . Our dwindling exports reveal the fact that rising prices are due almost entirely to domestic demand , and not to foreign purchasing . It comes on a money market of vast unused resources and thoroughly deflated condition . Furthermore , all our Babbitts have learned the value of conservatism by bitter experience in recent years , and it is doubtful whether the unreasoning Moody and Sankey attitude toward increased production which swept the country the year after the Armistice will soon be repeated . A safe and sane rather than a delirious prosperity should be the result . The financial editor of The New York Times very soundly compares prospective conditions in 1923 to the orderly periods of business expansion experienced in 1895 and 1909 . <P> Three main considerations should , however , serve to temper Mr. Babbitt 's complacency . In the first place financial conditions in Western Europe , and especially in Germany , are in many respects becoming more rather than less chaotic , and until the credit and currency of this important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer in some degree . Secondly , certain fundamental lines of business in this country are not yet on a satisfactory basis , chief among these being our vast agricultural , coal and railroad industries , and the current housing and rent situation . Thirdly , the cycle of business , now evidently rising toward prosperity , will in the long run inevitably decline again . <P> In the opinion of competent critics , the building program for the current year is endangered by rising costs of materials . Despite present high prices , still higher ones for lumber , plaster and cement are being predicted . Brick , however , the usually reliable barometer of building material costs , remains stable at present rates , despite interruption to deliveries owing to the frozen Hudson . <P> Analysis of securities floated in London during 1922 shows that of a total of 573 million pounds British Government loans composed 369 million , colonial loans 58 million , oil shares 17 million , and shipping and harbor securities 15 million .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
