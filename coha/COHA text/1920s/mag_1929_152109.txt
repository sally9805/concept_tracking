When you put a black cloth over almost any tall non-symmetrical object it is apt to look mysterious . Yet the people who peered at just such a covered object last week in the lobby of Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden did not seem mystified . Perhaps they knew what was underneath the cloth . Florenz Ziegfeld , who was there , looked as though he knew . So did Charles H. Sabin , Walter P. Chrysler , George Palmer Putnam , Kermit Roosevelt , Cosmopolitan 's Ray Long , Vanity Fair 's Conde Nast and Frank Crownin-shield , Charles Dillingham , Bernarr ( " Body-Love " ) Macfadden , John Ringling , Arthur Hopkins . New York City 's Mayor James John Walker was also there and he finally pulled the cloth off . There stood a 500-lb bronze boxer , poised to slug , on a marble pedestal . The glistening figure looked more like Black Jack Johnson , onetime ( 1908-15 ) world 's heavyweight champion , who stood grinning nearby , than like scowling White Jack Dempsey , who was there also , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was idling in the far away Brioni Island . <P> Retired Champion Tunney is a co-donor of the trophy designed to encourage young men to try to be his successor . The other donor is William Muldoon , 83 , old-time sporting figure , now a N. Y. State boxing official and affluent health farmer . Elimination fights will be held and then some one 's name will be added to the following list on the Tunney-Muldoon Trophy 's marble pedestal : JOHN L. SULLIVAN ( 1882-1892 ) JAMES J. CORBETT ( 1892-1897 ) ROBERT L. FITZSIMMONS ( 1897-1899 ) JAMES J. JEFFRIES ( 1899-1906 ) TOMMY BURNS ( 1906-1908 ) JACK JOHNSON ( 1908-1915 ) JESS WILLARD ( 1915-1919 ) JACK DEMPSEY ( 1919-1926 ) GENE TUNNEY ( 1926-1928 ) The sculptor who executed the figure was Mahonri Young , grandson of the late potent Brigham Young of Salt Lake City . Looming largest to have his name engraved is Max Schmeling , " Dempsey of Germany . "                    @
