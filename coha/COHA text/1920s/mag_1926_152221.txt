" Corporations . " Premier Mussolini created last week , and announced that he would probably bestow upon himself , a new Cabinet title : Minister of Corporations . <P> The term " corporation " denotes at present in Italy not a business organization but the Fascist social mechanism through which a given class achieves representation before the Government and deals with other classes similarly organized . Thus groups of capitalists and laborers are legally restricted to dealing with one another through their " corporations , " which are to be firmly interlocked with the mechanism of the state through the Premier 's newly created office . <P> Centralization . By a Cabinet decree the power to issue banknotes was centralized in the Bank of Italy , and several new series of paper currency were authorized-at least one of which will bear the portrait of Premier Mussolini instead of that of the King . <P> 300,000,000 . The sum of 300 million lire was appropriated by a Cabinet order last week to be employed upon public works in the picturesque but badly run down Sicilian city of Palermo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
