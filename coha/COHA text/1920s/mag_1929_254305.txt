All Kentucky is divided into two Episcopalian dioceses . Over Louisville 's presides Bishop Charles Edward Woodcock . The bishop of the hill-country diocese of Lexington , who recently resigned , is gentle soft-spoken Lewis William Burton . <P> Lexington stands 950 feet above sea level in the Blue Grass country , famed for Bourbon whiskey , tobacco , horses , stock farms ( Elmendorf Ashland ) . Near Lexington was born Abraham Lincoln . And once in Lexington a statue of Native Henry Clay was decapitated by a prankish thunderbolt . <P> Episcopal duties in Lexington do not consist merely of preaching in the great Cathedral on Church Street . The Bishop must visit the poor up in the hills . He must ride on senescent irresponsible trains . Sometimes he rides on a mule . <P> This year Bishop Burton will be 77 . For more than 30 years he has toiled with his scant and scattered 5,000 parishioners . But this year he will rest . His successor , who will be consecrated bishop of the diocese on May 15 , is Dr. Henry Pryor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> St. Chrysostom 's stands at No. 1424 North Dearborn Parkway , on the edge of Chicago 's " Gold Coast . " Originally it was a small vine-covered church . Now it looms , magnificently Gothic , splendid rival of St. James , Chicago 's other great Episcopalian church . <P> For nearly 20 years Dr. Norman Hutton was St. Chrysostom 's rector . He was famed for his scholarly , dignified manner . His tact quelled brewing intramural quarrels . His persuasiveness brought much money to the church which he remodeled and enlarged . Last September , however , he resigned and Dr. Abbott succeeded him . <P> Rector Abbott 's manner is dynamic . Like his brother , Headmaster Mather Almon Abbott of Lawrenceville , he inclines towards brusque action . Where Dr. Hutton had been mild and diffident , Rector Abbott seemed vigorously urgent , especially when his church needed money . <P> Dr. Abbott 's salary as St. Chrysostom 's rector was $20,000 . His salary as Lexington 's bishop will be $5,000 . But he did not hesitate when he was offered the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week , ' Chicago 's Bishop Charles Palmerston Anderson and Lexington 's Rector Charles Stewart Hale joined in praising him for a renunciatory act . But Dr. Abbott was content to say merely , " It will bring me into contact with all sorts of people ; the rich and fashionable , the poor and mountaineers . " He intends traveling through his diocese by automobile . <P> Pressed by a newsman to declare his pet aversion , he said , " Fools , perhaps . Scripture tells us ' Suffer fools gladly , ' but Chesterton goes Scripture one better with ' Enjoy fools uproariously .
