txt Thanks to Radio Announcers . How would it be possible to express one 's thanks to the men at the microphones in Washington on the day of Colonel Lindbergh 's arrival ? Looking out over San Diego Bay to the Pacific and recalling the aviators and ships of our navy that had so recently sailed out of that harbor down to Panama and west to China , it was wonderful to hear of one aviator and one of our ships returning from so great a quest . We did not travel to Washington . We were there with the first words that told us that the Memphis had not yet docked . The thrill of the event came undeviatingly and through the whole ceremony we saw as well as heard . As the story was passed from one to another it was told in so genuine , so friendly , so earnest and so artistic a way that It drew tears and involuntary applause from listeners-in more than 3.000 miles away . I have seen no mention of recognition of this part of the greeting to Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an equally genuine and artistic manner , will express to those who rendered this service our indebtedness and our gratitude ? It should be very well done . AMY HOPP . ROVILLE . San Diego . Cal. , June 23. 1927.
