( See front cover . ) <P> Probably the most spectacular feature of a successful theatre season in Manhattan has been the gigantic and prolonged good fortune of that wise and prolific producer of plays , Florenz Ziegfeld . Three ( Rosalie , The Three Musketeers , Show Boat ) of the five shows which he has sponsored since the autumn were playing last week to capacity houses . With the possible exception of The Theatre Guild , no other producer has scored so heavily this winter . Without exception , no other producer has ever enjoyed such consistently large revenues from his theatrical ventures . <P> With regard to Mr. Ziegfeld , much has been said by himself and others . This can be briefly summarized as follows : <P> He is the son of the late Dr. Florenz Ziegfeld , who was the founder and president of the Chicago Musical College . <P> He received a complete musical education , to prepare him for his father 's office ; in his early 20 's he decided to turn his talents to commercial ends as a producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first move was to import the Hans Von Bulow Orchestra from Hamburg to the Chicago World 's Fair . Next he captured Sandow , the strong man . <P> Before long , his keen and roving eye for the aesthetic beauty of the female figure caused him to enlarge the focus of his attention . He produced a dignified operetta called The Red Feather and another more sprightly beauty show called Mile , Fifi . His first wife was Anna Held , who starred in this show , became famous for singing " I Ca n't Make My Eyes Behave , " and who had the narrowest waistline in the U.

" Glorifying the American Girl " was the legend . <P> Since that time Ziggy has produced a new edition of The Follies every year as well as an enormous number of variegated musical shows , each devised , with unerring accuracy , to suit the taste of the season . <P> He built last year a theatre as imposing as a village bank and far more handsome . Departing from the old desk above the New Amsterdam Theatre , at which every important theatrical person , with the exception of Lee Shubert , has stood at one time or another during the last two decades , Mr. Ziegfeld moved his scenery into an airy office four floors above the entrance of the new theatre . <P> His homes ( at Hastings-on-Hudson , Palm Beach ; Patricia Island , Quebec ; Manhattan ) are full of flowers , sofas and pictures of two people .
