AT THE funeral games of Anchises the Trojan Dares was about to claim the heavyweight championship of the world by default when the aged Entellus , throwing into the ring the brains-and-gore-stained boxing-gloves of Eryx , challenged him . Lovers of the YEneid will recall how Entellus fell , to rise again and buffet the Trojan with such murderous rights and lefts that pious Xneas , as referee , stopped the bout . Dares , spitting out teeth and unable to stand , was dragged away by his friends . Both contestants presumably wore regulation bull-hide gloves well knobbed and studded with metal . They must have weighed considerably more than five pounds ; and , indeed , the cauliflower ear , I understand , was even more common in classical times than now . There was , moreover , no adrenalin at hand . An impression is made of many memories . Perhaps it was Dares and Entellus , perhaps the vast half-lit reaches of the Stadium , curbed to the familiar classic shape , perhaps the concentration of a hundred and forty thousand souls on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible cestus , of the " pancratist 's ear , " of matrons barred from the Olympic games on pain of death , of the Circus Maximus , of " Reds " and " Greens " and " habet " and turned-down imperial thumbs : perhaps it was all these and more that pulled me so authentically back through time . Those white faces , massed tier above tier , beyond all counting , until the topmost parapet of the arena cut them sharply off from the lowering starless sky ? surely , they dumbly affirmed , the spirit of this scene was a very ancient one . In spite of electric lights , and American slang , and hot-dogs , and fieldglasses , and monotonous dark male clothing , I had but to turn my eyes away from the brilliant ring itself , half close them on that ordered multitude , to imagine that we were all the guests of Julius Caesar . No , I have never felt , potentially , so much a part of the Imperial world . Except that this was far quieter ? so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) not the gladiators , but a new play of Sophocles that we were waiting for . A jumble , yes ; but all a classic jumble . There are a great many people who have a prejudice against prize fighting . I number them largely among my friends and kin . Such folk might overlook a man 's going to a fight , because ? as women all seem to know , especially the older women ? there is , in the normal man , a residuum of brutality that no amount of association with perfect ladies ( male or female ) can quite reduce out of existence . A woman 's going to a fight is another matter . They would quite agree with the old ruling about the Olympic games ? no ladies except priestesses of Demeter ( of whom , fortunately , there arc none left upon earth ) should be admitted . Accordingly , I took care not to tell most of my friends beforehand that I was going to the Dempsey-Tenney fight . Some of them would have felt like accessories before the fact in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entellus or the pancratium , they would have thought I was pretending . It was better they should be presented with a fait accompli . Perhaps I could come home and placate them by announcing that I had been quite sick . I knew better , of course . Though I had never seen a prize fight , I knew better . If I had seen no fights , myself , I had talked with those who had . I suspected that this would be a great , grave spectacle , intensely interesting to the amateur , and presenting aspects of serious beauty to the tyro . The very tickets were grave ? with their size , their stamped enormous price , their pictures of Dempsey and Tenney , their printed grandiloquence about " the heavyweight championship of the world " ( " the world " settles it : you ca n't be bigger than that ) , the faint blue signatures of Tex Rickard all over them , as though to guarantee that every inch of this pasteboard was sacred . A cloud of governors , a bevy of millionaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would all see to it that there was no " rough stuff " or foul play . You do not offer rough stuff or foul play to a two-million dollar gate ? to private trains , and proud specials from Pittsburgh , Chicago , South Dakota , and points west , puffing staidly on the West Philadelphia tracks . Through what brutal hells of blood-lust , what sordid treacheries of dope and fouls and " framing , " in furtive sporting clubs and obscure bouts in the desert , a pugilist may have to lift himself ( and lucky to survive ) before he gets out into the Sesquicentennial Stadium and up to the big promoters , I am probably not aware . But one felt sure that the air would blow clean on this fight . The tensity of a championship bout , as of any occasion that draws to itself , for its own sake , a vast crowd converging from great distances on the one event , begins long before the bout itself begins . Those human beings bring their own excitement with them , from east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clot together and the streams grow thick in the main avenues of approach , their own excitement is reinforced and multiplied . The nearer the fight , the more you feel it . At North Philadelphia the industry of America seemed to have stopped . The windows and doors of factories were crowded with faces ; the station platforms uneasy and staring . I never made out just what it was , though I did hear porters saying " Tunney . " Perhaps , we thought , his train had passed through from Stroudsburg . Later , we wondered if the challenger 's airplane had flown over ; perhaps he was even then being historically sick above the North Philadelphia station . Perhaps it was only a rumor of champion or challenger . Perhaps it was nothing ? only a vague expectancy raying out from the ring itself and hypnotizing everyone on the direct route to it . The nearer you are the more you feel it , is true of any spot that is focussing the passion of scores of thousands . Things happen , even to you ? even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory window ) watching the world channel itself in one direction . Preconceived ideas are a general infection of middle age . Though by six o'clock the station and City Hall Square were crowded , the crowds ? except that they were male , in very large proportion ? failed to bear out any of my expectations . There was a total dearth of conspicuous clothing and fancy waistcoats ; an almost total dearth of fat black cigars . Instead , there were binoculars , binoculars enough to supply every officer in the A. E. F. The hawkers in front of the station who urged you to buy seven-dollar glasses for fifty cents , as well as those who offered ringside tickets under the shadow of William Penn , may have done some business ; but it looked as if everyone had brought his own field glass and his own ticket , and had left his flask , his Havanss , and his emotions at home . It was a perfectly unremarkable crowd . You were shouldered and shoved by quietly active thousands . You were one of a multitude so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except sheer physical weight . Almost any crowd shows higher lights than this one . It lacked color , it lacked noise , it lacked even emphasis , and your nerves had to feel for its secret purpose . Except that it was moving relentlessly , unwaveringly southward , no purpose was visible or audible . Its very force was latent , tacit ; you realized only that nothing short of an act of God would deflect that stream from its objective . In the Sesquicentennial grounds it flowed thickly on through the appointed gates ( there was a spaced series of them ) and you walked in the midst , compassed closely round with softly treading shadows that never turned to right or left to stare or shout or daily . The poor little lights of the Exhibition buildings were inadequate to illumine this mass , to pick out individuals here or there . Almost every crowd has " humors , " diversities , to catch the eye . This crowd had none . Pouring through the darkness , it had no time for byplay . It was only going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has experienced " sport " chiefly in the form of Big Three football games , those hours from six p.m. to three a.m. were an amazing demonstration . I had come to believe that rowdiness , drunkenness , bad manners , maudlin emotionalism were inseparable from great crowds at a sporting event in the open air . Adverse critics , whether of college football or of professional baseball , usually attribute the vulgarity of the spectacle to the commercializing of the game . I had always helplessly supposed that commercialization was partly responsible , as well as the animalism latent even in respectable people when they have once turned into a mob . Yet there were three times as many human beings in the Stadium that night as I have ever seen at a football game ? three times as much excuse for the loosing of herd-excitement . Norwas Mr. Rickard exactly giving tickets away , nor were champion and challenger ? to put it delicately ? fighting for nothing . Something like one hundred and forty thousand people present ; two hundred thousand dollars for Mr. Tunney and something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either that the crowd was safely small or that no money was involved . The argument that in " ringside " seats we were separated from the proletariat amounts to nothing ; for we spent only two hours and a half out of some nine or ten in that privileged position . Taxis seemed to have disappeared from Philadelphia . We went from the station to the Stadium in a bus , and after the fight we milled in the rain with thousands , for an hour and a half , before we could even achieve a bus to return on . The station doors at one a.m. were shut against the crowd and the storm . We dribbled in , a few at a time ; after half an hour , inside , of pressing against other gates , the compact mass of which we were a part catapulted us through into the train shed , the police protesting vainly . Sodden , we stood for another half hour before we could get on a train and , sodden , we fell into our seats . Sodden , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour and a half . We were , for many hours , soaking , unsegregated , massed with the lesser and poorer fight fans , those cheap and brutal addicts to the sport over whom other people shake their heads . Just once ( in the station ) between six o'clock and quarter to four ? nearly ten hours ? I saw a man take a drink ; never did I see anyone who had obviously had a drink ; not once did I hear a bet so much as mentioned ; not once did I hear an oath or any questionable language . Yet I have never experienced , or watched other people experiencing , a tenser excitement than during the big bout ; nor have I ever been in a crowd that was suffering greater physical discomfort than the crowd was suffering during the hours after it . In the Stadium itself the quality of the excitement might explain it ; but what about the let-down afterwards ? My husband and I confessed to each other that it would be a long time before we could again endure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had clear proof that they were unnecessary . " The quality of the excitement " . . . Even now , a week later ? a week during which the memory of the whole occasion has hardly once left me ? I am unable quite to define that quality . During the preliminary bouts , only one or two of which were keenly interesting , I turned my eyes frequently from the ring to the vast stretches of the arena , serried and stippled with faces . I have said that it stirred all sorts of incoherent memories and imaginings of classic scenes . As a spectacle , the high-piled , densely peopled Stadium , with its gamuts of light and darkness ? shadowy where vagueness was needed , brilliant where strength and skill , terribly compressed into human form , were emphatically contending ? was impressive and beautiful beyond foreknowledge . Yet by being other than they were , differently possessed , those thousands could have turned the place into a spiritual shambles , a great mortar in which you were brayed with unspeakable ingredients . Crowds are not beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable emotion , unified by an intellectual as well as a physical interest . Hysteria , even in a noble cause , is a horrid thing . Perhaps the elaborate ritual of announcement and preparation helped ? dignity , after all , is dignity wherever it be met . Perhaps people were awed by a superlative ? the heavyweight championship of the world does imply a superlative . Certainly the absence of sentimental partisanships helped : it was a cooler , more reasoned interest . Professional sport has the advantage over amateur sport that people are more apt to be looking for excellence , unswayed by prejudice . ( At least , it should have this advantage ? I believe professional baseball does not bear me out , in practice . ) There need be no Red Mist of Anger hovering over the benches . It is hard to determine the nature of other people 's excitement except through its physical manifestations . I know only that they were immensely and quietly concentrated : that ushers had no trouble in getting people to keep their seats and take their hats off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and apologetically as possible ; that everyone ( it seemed ) would rather die than shove ; that ushers and vendors passed down the aisles crouched double , so as not to interfere ; and that , while the big bout was on , the murmur of multitude did not prevent your hearing the occasional low speech of a man some rows away . People who have attended crowded athletic events will know what I mean when I say that no one made noises in his throat ? there were not even those familiar guttural beginnings of emotional lapse . As no one , I fancy , has ever seen a hundred and forty thousand Lord Chesterfields assembled together ? and certainly not at a prize fight ? I could account for the manners , the quietness , the considerateness , the general decorum not by the quality of the people , but only by the quality of the interest that dominated them . Though there were plenty of thugs present , as the crowds afterwards bore witness , they were not illustrating thuggishness just then . Keen concentration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a ring twenty-four feet square , and there was no possible dispersal of - effects " ; there were only two men to watch ; it was personal combat in its intensest form . For the initiate ? presumably the majority ? it was an entrancing display of " science " and speed which claimed all their vision , all their mental faculties ; they could not afford to be distracted for a second from those lightninglike sequences . " RINGSIDE SEATS " 9,5 Beauty also was part of it ; to the tyro , a very great part . A year or two ago , I saw Dempsey do some exhibition boxing in a Broadway theater , and I remember being amazed then to realize that I bad seen no such grace of motion since Nijinsky was dancing here with the Russian ballet . Shadow-boxing and the mere illustration of hooks and jabs and swings are of course not to be compared with the real contest with a real antagonist , when there is force behind the speed , and constant counterplay of gestures . There is no plastic beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lacrosse and in hurdling and pole-vaulting . But in none of these is there plastic beauty comparable with that of good boxing : two perfect bodies matched against each other , melting from attitude to attitude , grouping to grouping , a hundred poses succeeding one another with incredible speed ? and the ultimate purpose of it , triumph and the lifted arm . They dance , they spar , they clinch .. . and every instant reveals to the eye some new aspect of art or strength . I have ever preferred statues to pictures ; there is something in the validity of three dimensions that comforts my soul . And infinitely better is the statue released to motion , its poses incalculably varied and multiplied . Impossible to explain that to people preconvinced that boxing is all physical brutality and. ? therefore ? physical ugliness . " But how could you stand it ? " wailed one friend of mine ; " did n't you have to see blood ? " I knew then that I could never explain . " Do you know how long a round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shuddered . " Well , it only lasts three minutes , and they wash ' em off in between . " To such evasive crudity I was reduced . 1711 The Battle of the Century appears to be the mystery of the ages . It is not for me , in my ignorance , to sustain or to challenge anything said by any sporting editor in the land . I do not know what " happened " ; or why Gene Tunney was able to beat Jack Dempsey . I keep , unperturbed , my own deep sense of the spectacle ; and no hashing over of the fight , in talk or in print , can alter one jot of the impression which was , that night , forced upon me . Of necessity , my own reactions to the bout were only aesthetic and psychological . If it was , for me , a great experience , that was simply because I had never before been a tiny assisting unit in so impressive a spectacle . Someone once told me , concerning the Dempsey-Carpentier fight , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me in the arena , where I was duplicating his internal comment . So subtly are we wrought upon by the rest of any audience of which we are a part that , unless we are in open and deliberate revolt against our fellow-witnesses , we partake in the common spirit of the occasion . I do not know if anyone else was saying to himself that it was like watching a Greek tragedy ; but there was nothing in the surrounding atmosphere to contradict my own mood . In feeling the event to be like that , I seemed to be agreeing with a hundred thousand people around me . I do not for an instant mean that to those spectators the defeat of Dempsey was a personal distress . The newspapers , I believe , said it was a Tunney crowd . Around us sympathy was evenly divided . If it was like a Greek tragedy , that was precisely because messy partisanships seemed to be absent . As round succeeded round , and Dempsey came no nearer landing a knockout blow , incredulity seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one 's muscles made no attempt to stir in sympathy with either athlete ( which of us has not impotently tried to help a half-back down the field ? ) ; one 's throat was dumb . The event was beyond all petty worrying , beyond all impulse to change or forestall it . There were no tears in it except the universal " tears of things . " Whatever was happening had to happen : you were only watching . You might as well protest an lEschylean catastrophe . It was like seeing a doom fall from the very hands of the Parcre . That , in part , is why I confirm again the Greek tragedy comparison . The protagonist , too , was a symbol , or the event would not have been tragic in the impersonal , classic sense . No matter what they say of Dempsey now , the majority of sporting writers and boxing fans said earlier that he was the greatest heavyweight fighter of our times . I have no means of knowing whether this is a true estimate or not , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , the crowd believed it . The Dempsey legend hung heavy over the whole arena . Whatever they hoped , they believed him invincible . The moments just before the champion entered the ring were almost intolerable in their weight of expectancy . They were the only moments in the Stadium I would not willingly live through again . Tunny climbed through the ropes , debonair in his gaudy bathrobe , and there were cheers a-plenty , but the general tension did not slacken . I heard a young man , some distance away from us , murmur to his companion ? low and painfully , as if breath came hard , " You just watch when Dempsey comes ? he 'll come into the ring looking just like a gorilla . " If you had to wait much longer for Dempsey , blood vessels would crack , everything would go dark . . . Not quite for eagerness to see the fight ; rather , because Dempsey himself was , to most of them , a superlative , something that had nothing to do with human averages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long years : he was a legend and had taken on legendary proportions and gifts ; the exaggeration of myth was about him . They might call him in words the " Manassa Mauler , " but the tone said " Achilles . " It is ill waiting for lightning or earthquake , a portent or a revelation . He came , at last , ? at the proper moment , no doubt ; and if Shakespeare had been writing it , he would have made the rain begin -- as it did ? when Dempsey entered the ring . For a person with no technical knowledge to describe a fight , even a single round of a fight , would be more than folly . It would resemble the insolence of the local vet 's wife who analyzes Shakespeare 's Sonnets for her woman 's club . Experts pronounced themselves on both subjects , too copiously , too long ago . What , then , was the spectacle that transcended one 's ignorance and fed one 's intuitions for forty fleeting minutes ? For one had no sense of not knowing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so were all the gentlemen who had no time to smoke . I have read , I think , square miles of " dope " about the fight , yet I am precisely where I was , that night , in the dripping Stadium . What one saw , with one 's unenlightened eyes , was Tunney , infinitely tall , his half-inch advantage expanded to a cubit ; Tunney and his long arms swinging right and left to Dempsey 's ducked head ; Tunney wide-mouthed and panting , but perpetually dancing round the champion , forcing the pace , and only once ( or so it looked ) clearly frightened . Tunney 's tall ugliness ( as Henry James would have put it ) and his flailing arms . And Dempsey ? Dempsey , whose face , lowered at Tunney 's breast , you seldom saw ; Dempsey with his bull-necked crouch , weaving , bobbing , closing in ? but always the shade too slow , his half-inch longer reach not counting ; Dempsey " flat-footed " and dancing not at all , robbed somehow of the speed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portentous , to the last gongstroke , so that , for thirty counted minutes , you were expecting him , the next instant , to explode from that crouch , and kill . If ever human figure looked invincible , that figure was Jack Dempsey 's ; and in the later rounds ( prolonging themselves incredibly beyond the fifth , which most people had taken for the ultimate ) one felt that invisible burdens must be laid upon him , great weights that no scales could register , no officials detect . I have been accused of being a Dempsey fan ; though just why it is an accusation , I do not know . Certainly , if I felt any pallid partisan desires , they were all for Dempsey 's victory ; but I have never had the opportunity to become a fight fan , and my pugilistic sympathies are , veritably , neither keen nor profound . I felt during the fight , no more than , and no differently from , the Tunney supporters at my right hand . The same bewilderment paralyzed us all . Every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What has slowed Dempsey down ? " I believe anyone who had never heard of Dempsey would have asked , that night , the same question . Dempsey , in the ring , spoke for himself , defined himself , illustrated , to any eye that watched him , the quintessential gladiator . Numen inst . You might know nothing about it , be less than the least reporter , but you felt , with every internal muscle , a classic strength deprived of speed , a perfect engine somehow ill-fired . " A great ox stood upon my tongue , " says the Herald in the " Agamemnon . " A great ox seemed to be checking Dempsey with unseen hoofs and breath . For he looked , each moment , as if he would co-ordinate that strength with one tremendous impulse and knock out the challenger . If , after the fifth round , you no longer quite expected it , that was from a dim , a fortiori , logic ? if Tunney had stuck it as long as that , he might go on sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far oftener than Dempsey . Even to the last round , one looked for the natural fulfilment of the strength and science that were Dempsey . But the speed never came back . If I shut my eyes , regarding the bout once more with the simplifying , foreshortening gaze of memory , I see three things ? Tunney , standing clear of Dempsey from the chest up , swinging rights and lefts to Dempsey 's head ; Dempsey , crouched and ferine , weaving , weaving , searching Tunney 's body vainly for the appointed , vulnerable spot ; and Dempsey , coming from his corner , those last times , dripping with rain and looking as blind as the Cyclops . I am no expert ; but that is what I seemed ? eternally , yet so briefly ? to see . That is how , to the untrained eye , it looked . And no one believed any of it ? any more than I did . Vachel Lindsay has long since refused to read in public his poem called " Boston . " You may remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan The strong boy of Boston **38;674;TOOLONG ( Was that the fight that went forty-five rounds ? I do not remember . ) I used to think that poem was quite as near as I cared to get to a prize fight . Though the rhythm carries you , in spite of yourself , they are reeking lines . And no doubt their suggestion is right . Boxing , very likely , is a brutal business . Referees stopped two of the preliminary bouts , on this occasion , because one of the fighters was so dearly outclassed that to continue it would have been like letting John . L. Sullivan break every single rib of Jake Kilrain . Perhaps , among other things , it was the more perfect matching of champion and challenger , the greater science displayed , that permitted one to forget Vachel Lindsay and hark back to Atropos . Certainly , as I have reiterated , the setting helped . But I believe that the classic quality , the awe , the tension , the helplessness derived from a deeper , more personal source . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tediously repeated , a Greek tragedy , it was neither because Dempsey was passionately beloved nor because all fights are like that . None of the preliminary bouts was in the least like a Greek tragedy . That the quality of inescapable doom , the suggestion that the Fates themselves were mixing in this matter , the curious enlarging of the fight from " sport " into a more poetic issue , the injection of symbolism into the effect produced were directly due to Dempsey , I think none could deny . If , for example , Gene Tunney , later , should fight Jack Sharkey , these graver and nobler elements , I feel sure , would be lacking . I watched Dempsey , round after round , a crouching , ducking , terribly weaving figure , battered about the head , forced to the ropes , recovering , following , pursuing , swollen-faced , bleeding ; and in the teeth of defeat I could see why he had been a legend . Someone behind us was whispering at intervals , as if in a private agony of prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? it 's all you need , Jack ? only one . " Some Tunney fans directly in front of us checked up each round with stammering amazement . When the announcement of the decision finally belled over the Stadium , they clasped one another in delight ? with just a touch of boyish consternation . No man is invincible , the Manassa Mauler or another , and seven years is , I suppose , a fair length of time to hold the heavyweight title , which is , in these days , a property of youth . Even Dempsey had to be defeated sometime , and all these people had sense enough to know it . Many of them , no doubt , hoped to see him lose his title that very night ? by a knockout . All champions go through the Arician cycle : The priest who slew the slayer , And shall himself be slain . If this was different , there was a reason ; and that reason lay , I believe , in Dempsey himself , as I have said . For the world likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dempsey was , to the eye of contemplation , the Platonic idea of a heavyweight fighter , the perfection of a type , one thing supremely and nothing else . Apart from being a beautiful boxer , Tunney was , to the common vision , a thug like another . Several times , psychology prevailing , in my interest , over sport , I focussed the present champion 's " fighting face " through my good German glass . No man 's fighting face is pretty , I need hardly say , and I was not looking for beauty . I was looking for some quality , some emphasis , that always evaded me : it was not there . Tunney was what the French call guelconque . " He might be a gasoline salesman , " I sighed to my husband as I gave over the search . But not Dempsey , whose ferocious face and beautiful body alike suggested nothing but the great gladiator . He was , you would say , engined , created , fashioned to be that , in its perfection ; it was the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one element of him betrayed it . There was nothing quelconque ? vague , indeterminate , drably indefinable ? about him . The prize fighter may not be one 's pet type ? it certainly is not mine ? but , as I say , the world likes its types , whatever they are , perfect . Dempsey might have been the primal matrix from which all great fighters are struck . He was complete enough to be a symbol ; and when a symbol ceases to symbolize , it is like a death . The man who told me that the Carpentier fight was like a Greek tragedy ? youth , grace , beauty , gallantry going down before brute strength ? added , " And it was rigid . If Carpentier had won , it would have been logically wrong ; you would have been happier , but your intellect would have been outraged . " This time the case was other . I have noticed that , even now , when everyone knows that Tunney did beat Dempsey , there seem to be comparatively few people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision according to fact , but contrary to nature . One must square facts with nature somehow , or the brain reels ; and this fact could be thus squared only by the law of the Arician doom . Whether Tunncy or someone else , it did not matter ; sometime or other , that symbol of strength , because he was only a man , had to be proved mortal and subject to the processes of decay . Therefore , one had the sense that , as I say , the Fates themselves were mixing in the matter . Perhaps the boxing fans are right , and Tenney can not beat Dempsey ? only did beat him , for the high cosmic reason that legends are weaker than laws , and the Immortals concern themselves periodically with proving it to us . IV It may be that I poetize it too much . As we surged slowly , thousands of us , out of the Stadium , we saw a single fan seated among acres of empty benches , watching the last bout going on in the downpour . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on every side in shining arcs . " Want your money 's worth , do n't you ? " someone sang out to him across the wet expanse of bleachers . " Sure , " he chuckled ; " I 've been here all night and have n't seen a knockout yet . " He obviously did not consider that he had witnessed a Greek tragedy . Yet something , for hours to come , laid a finger on foolish lips . Something kept the crowd in general from swearing , during that night of discomfort , when the rain was searching their very bones . Something kept the packed , motionless herd in the station , the weary restless crowd in the train , from any discussion of the fight ; kept them from protest or vaunting or comparing of notes or exchange of " dope . " I incline to think that it was what kept us , until at five in the morning we achieved dryness , warmth , and comfortable beds , exalted , tense , and silent . I think that they had seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a fight .
