txt Nellie Is Being Cared For . To the Editor of The New York Times : Readers of S -- -s TIMES sympathetic comment regarding the case of Joseph Abdu , the blind newsdealer , . and his dog Nellie , will perhaps be glad to know . that Abdu 's wishes regarding her , expressed in : his will . are to be carried out in a way which , we hope , her master would cordially approve . One of our special agents , sent to investigate immediately when the case came to our attention , found Nellie suffering from a bad case of mange . We had her brought to our hospital , where she now is undergoing treatment , and is as comfortable as could be expected . We plan to make every possible effort to restore Nellie to health , and then , precisely as Taw TIMES suggested , arrange to have her adopted by another blind man of whom she can take care as she took care ' of her first master .
