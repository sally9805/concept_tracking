THE scene is the small yard immediately before a Negro cabin . At the right front is a thick lilac bush with a bench beside it , and to the left from this a clumpy china tree with a rocking-chair under it . At the left rear is a well , roughly boarded up , a chain and battered tin bucket hanging from a cross-piece above . In the back is the cabin . Rickety steps lead up to the door in the center . It is an afternoon late in summer . PHEELIE , a neat Negro girl of seventeen , is sitting on the bench by the lilac tree looking through a book . She is dressed in cheap clothes  --  a white dress , white shoes and stockings . Presently there is the sound of an approaching buggy in the lane off at the left and a voice calls , " Whoa ! " PHEELIE listens a moment , and then , without turning her head , gives it a toss and goes on fingering the leaves of her book . ENOS comes in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short stocky Negro of twenty or more , dressed in a faded gray suit and black felt hat . His celluloid collar and scarlet tie shine out brilliantly against the black of his face . ENOS In a drawling voice that now and then drops into a stammer . Well , Pheelie , heah I is . PHEELIE Looking up casually . I see you is , and you 's ' bout a hour early . p. 3 ENOS But ai n't you all dressed up to go ? PHEELIE I 's dressed up , but I ai n't ready to go . ENOS Dubiously . Well , suh , now  --  I  --  I  --  PHEELIE I des ' put on dese heah clothes ' caze it was so hot in de house wid my work duds on . He takes off his hat and discloses his naturally kinky hair combed back in a straight pompadour . He waits for her to notice it , but she keeps looking straight before her . Set down and rest yo'se'f . Somewhat ill at ease he sits down in the rocking-chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping  --  a  --  mebbe you 'd lak to take a small drive befo ' church begun . PHEELIE In the same cold voice . Thanky , I do n't believe I wants to take no drive . She becomes absorbed in her book . ENOS Picking at the lining of his hat . And I though we mought stop by Buie 's Creek and git some ice cream . He watches her narrowly . PHEELIE After a moment . Dat 'd be nice , I reckon , but I do n't want no ice cream nuther . She is silent again . He pulls nervously at his fingers , making the joints pop . And I 'd be much obliged if you 'd quit popping yo ' finger j'ints. p. 4 ENOS Jerking his hands apart and running his fingers over his greased hair . ' Scuse me , Pheelie . Somewhat timidly , but with a hidden touch of spirit . You  --  you do n't seem glad to see me much . PHEELIE You did n't have no date to come over heah a hour befo ' time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's de matter wid you ? You ai n't mad at me , is you ? PHEELIE No , I ai n't mad .

ENOS Dat ai n't nothing  --  mostly talk , I bet a dollar . PHEELIE Closing the book with a bang . Dat 's whut you allus says . You do n't care a straw ' bout gwine off and seeing things .

Setting dere looking through dat book I gut plumb sick and tar 'd of you and all dis farming and sweating and gitting nowhah  --  sick of everything .

No , suh , it ai n't no cow-shed you could th'ow a dog through de cracks  --  nunh  --  unh . It 's gwine be a nice frame house wid a wide po'ch , and it 'll be ceiled . And listen heah , it 's gwine have wallpaper . And , honey , Mr. Pearson said he wanted you to come up a-Monday and help choose de pattern . He looks at her delightedly . PHEELIE Her face brightening somewhat . Oh , dat 's so nice of you and him ! She bows her head . ENOS Whut 's de matter now ? PHEELIE Looking up with tears in her eyes . You 's too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to always be so onsatisfied . ENOS Sho ' , never mind now . He puts his arm around her. p. 9 PHEELIE Letting her hand rest on his hair . Grannys alive ! you done spent money to git yo ' hair straightened . ENOS With a kind of shamed joy . Yeh , yeh , I has . But it was to celebrate a little . PHEELIE Dat 's th'owing away a dollar and a half . In a little bit it 'll be kinky ag'in . ENOS Course it will , but I thought you 'd lak it while it lasts . PHEELIE Laughing . You sho ' is a proud nigger . She kisses him quickly and stands away from him . Nunh  --  unh , I ai n't gwine do it no mo ' . He drops reluctantly back into his seat , and she sits again on the bench . ENOS After a moment . You want to take dat little drive now ? PHEELIE I mought , I guess . ENOS Slapping himself . Hot dog , den le 's go , honey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be ready . Muh and Pap and all de kids is over to de ice cream supper at Uncle Haywood 's befo ' preaching .

I tells you , sugar lump , if we stays wid him and do right , some dese days we gwine have money to take dem dere trips you wants to . They have hardly disappeared when a slender Negro youth of sixteen or seventeen , barefooted and raggedly dressed in an old pair of overalls , shirt and torn straw hat , comes in at the right front and stands staring after them . He is whittling a green walking-stick . In a moment he pulls out a small mouth organ and begins playing a whirling jig . ENOS Coming back around the corner . Who 's dat playing to beat de band ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares at the boy in delighted astonishment . Suddenly he winds upon a high note . As he beats the saliva out of the harp against his thigh , he bursts into a loud joyous laugh . PHEELIE Lawd , you kin play . Who is you ? ENOS With a touch of authority in his voice . Whut you want heah ? I ai n't never seed you befo ' . BOY In a clear childish voice , as he looks at PHEELIE . You ai n't ? p. 12 ENOS Naw , I ai n't .

ENOS I bet you on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiping his mouth with his sleeve . I thought I mought git a bite to eat heah mebbe . He looks from one to the other , a lurking smile in his eyes . PHEELIE Uncertainly . You mought . ENOS Lak as not de lady wants to know whah you come from and whut yo ' business is befo ' she ' gins to feed you . BOY Looking at PHEELIE . Would you ? PHEELIE Yeh . Whut 's yo ' name ? BOY Laughing and blowing out a whiff of music . Mostly I ai n't gut no name . Beating the harp in his hand and scratching his leg with his toe . ' Way ' way back down dere  --  Pointing indefinitely behind him.  --  whah I come from some of ' em calls me Pete , but mostly dey calls me de No ' Count Boy . p. 13 ENOS Why dey call you dat fo ' ?

PHEELIE You been all dat distance by yo'se'f ? BOY Sho ' has . And whut 's mo ' I walked it every jump . Again he draws the harp across his lips in a breath of music , all the while watching them with bright eyes. p. 14 ENOS Whah you gwine ?

He stops and looks at PHEELIE with big eyes . You 's purty as a pink , ai n't you ? PHEELIE Turning away her head . Why you ax dat ? ENOS Sharply . You need n't be thinking you gwine git yo ' supper on soft talk , hoss-cake . BOY Still looking at PHEELIE . Whut 's yo ' name ? PHEELIE My name 's Ophelia , but dey calls me Pheelie . BOY Staring at her admiringly and cracking his palm against his thigh . Dawg-gone ! des ' lak me foh de world .

BOY Naw , suh , I gut something better ' n new money . Heah she is . Holding up his harp . I plays you a piece or two pieces or three , and you gives me a bite and whut you pleases .

Ladies and ge'men , de fust piece I renders is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bout a ' oman whut had three little boys , and dey tuk sick and died one June night whilst de mockingbirds was singing . And allus adder dat dey said she had a dark shadow in her dark eyes . He clears his throat , spits once or twice and lays the harp gently to his lips . Closing his eyes , he begins to play . ENOS stirs about him as the notes flood from the boy 's mouth , and now and then he looks questioningly at PHEELIE 's averted face . The boy 's nostrils quiver , and he makes a sobbing sound in his throat . Tears begin to pour down his cheeks . After a moment he winds up with a flourish. p. 16 ENOS Gruffly . Lawd Jesus , dat rascal kin blow ! BOY Looking at PHEELIE as he wipes his eyes . I hope you do n't mind . Every time I blows dat piece I cries . PHEELIE glances up with moist eyes . PHEELIE I sho ' do n't mind . Whah you learn dat ? BOY It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me . ENOS Ironically . Hunh , you mought ! BOY His face troubled .

BOY Nothing but some branch water and a little bitsy bird I killed wid a rock and fried . His face takes on a sober look , and tears again glisten in his eyes. p. 17 ENOS Looking at him in astonishment . You sho ' is a quare fellow . BOY Staring up at the sky . Dat little bird was singing so sweet and ruffling his breast in de wind , and I picked up a rock an des th'owed devilish lak , never thought I 'd hit him . But dat 's de way it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I kilt him . PHEELIE And den you et him ? BOY Wiping his eyes on his sleeves . I was so hongry den , and I built a speck of fire and baked him .

I cai n't git his chune out'n my haid . He sot on dat limb and would give a long call and den a short one  --  Imitating on his harmonica  --  des lak dat . ENOS You 's a mighty big fellow to be crying over a bird , seems lak to me . PHEELIE Enos , you quit dat making fun . BOY When I come through de creek back dere , a good-god was pecking in a high daid tree , and he turnt his haid sideways and hickered at me .

It 's ' titled " De Coffin Song , " and tells ' bout a nice gal whut went away from home all dressed out in white and died , and dey sont her body back to her Muh and Pap . Dis heah 's de Coast-Line coming down de track on a dark and rainy night wid her coffin on boa 'd . He closes his eyes and begins blowing the choo-kerr-choo of a starting train . He intersperses his blowing with short speeches . De rain is beating on de window panes and everybody is mo'nful . The choo-kerr-chooing takes on a sobbing note , and the speed of the train increase . De old man and de ' oman is at de station waiting foh deir daughter 's body , her dey loved so well , oh , her dey loved so well . " Do n't cry , honey , she gone to heaven , " de old man say , Lawd , Lawd , de old man say . Den he heah dat coffin-blow . A long mournful wail of the engine 's whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive . He opens his eyes and begins to chant forth his bits of dialogue . Now she 's balling de jack ' cross de river trustle . He quivers and sings with the straining timbers of the bridge . Heah she is passing by de gravel-pit . How she goes by , how she goes by ! Lak a great black hoss , a great black hoss ! And now she 's blowing foh de crossing . The whistle moans again . Her Muh and Pap 's on de flatform at de station and dey feel deir hearts in deir moufs at de crying of dat train , Lawd , Lawd , de crying of dat train ! Again he gives the coffin-blow , long and heart-breaking . De train she slow up . The choo-kerr-chooing slowly stops . Dey takes out de coffin and flowers and puts her in a huss , and dey all drives off slow , slow , lak dis . He plays a sort of dead march and stalks back and forth across the yard . Den de next day dey takes her to de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  shout hallelujah  --  de preacher preach and de people sing , shouting glory to de lamb . And den dey ' gin th'ow dirt in on her . He imitates the thump , thump of clods falling on the coffin . Den de favver and muvver and sisters and bruvvers all cry out loud . Her Pap cries lak dis . He gives forth a long deep groan . And de sisters and bruvvers lak dis . A medley of weeping sounds . And de muvver cry lak dis . A high piercing shriek . And den dey roach up de grave and de preacher make prayer  --  " Lawd , Lawd Jesus , have mercy upon us ! " Den dey all go off and dey ai n't nothing left ' cepting a crow in a high scraggly pine a-saying : He mingles his music with a raucous h-a-r-r-c-k , h-a-r-r-c-k . Den adder dat when night come , dark and rainy night , de last thing is a small wind in de bushes lak dis : A trembling flute-like note rises , bubbles and disappears . He beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and PHEELIE , the tears wetting his cheeks. p. 19 ENOS Presently .

Turn me a-loose . He 's gwine stay right heah if he wants to and eat and sleep to boot . ENOS Hesitating a moment and then flaring out , his timidity and slowness gone . De hell you say ! He turns suddenly towards the boy and points off to the left . You see ' way , ' way yonder in de west whah de sun is setting in de tops of dem long-straw pines ?

With a quick movement ENOS snatches his stick from him . Now see'f you do n't strak a trot up dat road . He puts out his arm and pushes PHEELIE back .
