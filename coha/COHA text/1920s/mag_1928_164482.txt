Through the mist and murk of a London night two bobbies assigned to patrol Hyde Park tiptoed up to within four yards of a gentleman and a young woman who were together upon two park chairs . The hour , as the bobbies later testified , was precisely 9:45 . The persons on the chairs were , in the opinion of the constables , " behaving in a manner reasonably likely to offend against public decency . " Therefore strong hands were laid upon the young woman , who remained passive , and upon the gentleman , who roared : " Hands off ! I 'm not the usual riffraff ! I 'm a man of substance ! " <P> So violent did the gentleman become that a third bobby had to be called to subdue him , whereupon he implored : " For God 's sake , let me go ! " <P> Next morning smart folk of London 's West End were scandalized to learn that the " man of substance " was indeed " no riff-raff , " but instead their acquaintance or friend Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Lloyd George , author of the British convoy system during the World War . <P> Worse still , Sir Leo 's arrest seemed significant of a distressing trend , for it came as the fourth of a series of similar arrests of British Knights with young women in Hyde Park . The other Knights are Sir Basil Home Thomson , onetime Chief of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of Scotland Yard ( TIME , Dec. 28 , 1925 ) , secondly Sir Arthur Evans , famed archeologist , discoverer of buried civilizations in Crete , and most reprehensively of all Sir Almeric Fitzroy , onetime Clerk of His Majesty 's Privy Council and intimate of that late &; lusty monarch Edward VII . <P> Therefore , when Sir Leo Chiozza Money came up for trial , last week , in Marlborough Street Police Court , patriotic Britons hoped against hope that he would be able to vindicate his honor and unsmirch in some degree the deplorable record of the Knightage and Hyde Park . <P> Sir Leo began by testifying that the young woman with whom he was arrested , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been for the past four and a half years steadily employed as a tester of radio bulbs , and is engaged to marry , said Sir Leo : " That young man over there ! " <P> The Court inspected the young man . He seemed alert , intelligent . Sir Leo stated that his own actions on the night in question were merely to take Miss Savage , 22 , whom he had known about six months , to dinner , and later to stroll &; sit with her in the park . The Court looked again upon the young man , pondered , proceeded to acquit Sir Leo &; Miss Savage , and lastly assessed costs of 10 ( $49 ) against the two too officious bobbies . As Miss Savage left the court the young man swept her into his arms and hugged .
