To no small extent , the current confusion in business and the difficulty of predicting how affairs will shape themselves later this year , are attributable to the uncertainty regarding tax measures to be enacted by the present Congress . <P> A few weeks ago the Mellon plan seemed almost certain of speedy passage . Now it has been badly mangled in the House ( see Page 3 ) , with the Senate yet to be heard from , and a possible Presidential veto to finish off with . Many a citizen will pay his income tax in quarterly installments this year , figuring that he would rather retain the money himself in case a cut is made than wait for the Government to make a refund . <P> But Congress , while settling nothing , has stirred up other taxes . The attempt to revive the excess profits tax proved short-lived , yet caused gooseflesh among many corporations and investors . However , a movement is underway to increase federal inheritance taxes regardless of those already laid by the various states . <P> It seems obvious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , taxation will be a political issue of first magnitude next Fall . Most business men are now wishing that the election were over , the political back-biting over ; that the opportunity were presented to readjust our taxes calmly and scientifically , without political interference .
