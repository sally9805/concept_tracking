In an unusually perspicuous article , excepting the vagaries of style considered essential to The Saturday Evening Post , Isaac F. Marcosson , famed cosmic journalist , discussed Britain 's Labor regime . <P> " What has the Labor Government done . . . ? ' he asked . <P> " ' Nothing ; but they have done it nicely , ' was the reply . " <P> Unemployment Discussing the gentle inactivity of Labor , * the Post journalist says that unemployment is likely to be " the Nemesis of the new order . " Mr. MacDonald won many seats in the last election and was allowed to reside at No. 10 Downing Street because oi his promised panacea for the vexatious unemployment riddle . He said : " I object to the unemployed being fooled any longer . . . . The Labor Party alone has a positive remedy for unemployment . . . . We.will take office because in dealing with unemployment we believe we have a program and a power that no other party possesses . " <P> But two months ago he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In regard to pledges and their fulfilment , why should not I confess that we are a little innocent in this matter ? If we are without experience , things which seemed very simple to carry out become very complicated and difficult when we become members of a Cabinet responsible for them . " <P> This seems solid foundation for Mr. Marcosson 's contention that the Government has pursued a policy of " masterly inactivity , " expressed , for one thing , in conspicuous failure to solve the unemployment problem-there are still 1,000,000 men out of work . ... A unique situation summed up in the phrase , Labor without labor . " <P> Housing Scheme . Another of Labor 's proteges was the Housing Scheme* a plan to build 2,500,000 houses during 15 years , to be paid for ( according to the Labor Government ) in 40 years at a total cost of more than $6,000,000,000 ' . ** The bill which contains the Housing Scheme is expected to come up during the Autumn session of the House of Commons and not a few political critics have forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature ; the Opposition may think it wiser to let the Government remain " in office , " rather than risk a referendum to the people on the Housing Scheme , which is popular , and which might result in the Labor being returned " to power . " <P> " Society . " What is to be the ultimate effect of office and society-splashing on the Laborites ? Said the cosmic sage , <P> " It will constitute a permanent hangover for various of the horny-handed who have mounted to ministerial and other eminence . It is summed up in the sentence-Life will never be the same again . I must except a man of the type of Ramsay MacDonald , who brought a real cultural background to the post of Premier . <P> The truth of the matter is that not only do some of the Socialists like the trimmings and social by-products of power but they will miss them once they retire from public life . Incidentally , they have cultivated expensive tastes-that is , expensive as compared with the former mode of life . A story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have exclaimed during one of the many crises that the Government has faced : ' If I go out , who will pay my tailor ? ' "
