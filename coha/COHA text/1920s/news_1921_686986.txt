txt The Senate committee 's eighty-fourLage Tax bill fills nearly four pages of olid newspaper print A goodly portion a devoted to amending particulars in which the long series of war tax laws Lave been found oppressive . The act is - worth noting as a -- sign of the astability of our tax system and of he errors due to defects in the method f enactment. ? The pending bill , for example , was delayed for . weeks , rhich were wasted while the time and ttention of Congress were ? devoted o a Tariff bill so offensive to national entiment that ? it was laid aside . Now he Tax bill displaces the Tariff bill , nd it will become a law after business as been conducted for thelarger part of a year in ignorance of its . burdens . . It is . hard to express parliamentarily the views of business men regarding the methods of lawmakers who habitually indulge themselves at ' their ease in retroactive , . taxation . and ' refuse retroactive repeal of taxes so ? obnoxious that the Treasury objects to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead of the Administration in this matter . A bill- which is drawn on principles of general application would ' require fewer thousands of words . So many are necessary because the measure is a mosaic of details , not a statement of rules . A tax on all sales could be expressed in a few hundred words . - But the principle of a general sales tax is rejected , and instead there is a catalogue of specific sales taxes . A sales tax made up of arbitrary discriminations and incomplete catalogues is the worst sort of sales tax , obnoxious alike for its inclusions Wand exclusions . A general sales tax would be so much more productive that it could be much less oppressive in rates and free from , the objection that the tax amounts to price regulation . The hotel tax , for ' example , is open to the objections to all sumptuary legislation . It will be a new thing in taxation if travelers find they get the same accommodations for less money because of the tax . One last-minute change of general application taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of them to the normal tax . The exemption of 60 per cent . from this tax may unlock frozen investments withheld from sale because of the severity of the tax . It is a pity that - the idea of increasing revenue by lessening taxation is not more generally followed . On the contrary , the reduction of some individual taxes is accompanied by an increase of corporation taxes . Thus votes are caught coming and going . This is a bardship on the railways , whose traffic is dowered . by the collection of the transportation tax for ih .. Government , although travelers and shippers regard it as part of the rate . The= transportation taxes , like the punitive taxes and the corporation capital stock tax , are to be reeuced next year . If at all , why not this year , since it is sure that the Treasury could get more revenue in better ways ? The Senate committee is credited With the hope that the country will accept the bill as a good bill . It might be worse . There are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a better bill than the one which it follows . Beyond that indulgence can not go regarding a bill dictated by expediency rather ti ) an principle .
