A nervous , thin little man from Sullivan , Ind. , who steadied his chin on his tall , starched collar and rabbited at his lower lip until it bled , was star witness of the week before the Senate Public Lands Committee , continuing its dredging of the Oil Scandals . He was Will H. Hays , who managed the Harding Campaign as G. O. P. chairman , then landed in the Cabinet as Postmaster General , then became " tsar " of the cinema industry , which lofty office he still fills . <P> The Committee wanted to ask Mr. Hays more about Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair 's contributions to the G. O. P. made in 1923 a few months after Mr. Hays ' fellow Cabinet member , Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall , had bestowed on Sinclair the crooked Teapot Dome oil lease . <P> Mr. Hays had gone over the same ground with the Committee four years ago , when the Oil Scandals first gushed . At that time , Senator Walsh had said : " Do you know how much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hays had answered : " Yes , sir : as a total . . . I think that was the maximum amount , $75,000 . . . . His contribution for any amount that he would be obligated for or would pay in any event was a maximum of $75,000 . " <P> Last week , Mr. Hays anticipated his cross-examiners with a statement which raised the " maximum " of Sinclair 's contributions to $260,000 and the actual net of his gifts to $160,000 . Mr. Hays tried hard to explain what looked like , yet may not have been , flat perjury . The explanation was this : <P> Though out of politics and in cinema in 1923 , Mr. Hays felt that he should help " clear the deck " for the impending Coolidge campaign by assisting the G. O. P. to pay off a $520,000 deficit remaining from the Hays-managed Harding campaign . He asked Sinclair to contribute . They agreed that $75,000 was all Sinclair should give . At the same time , until other contributions could be solicited , Sinclair volunteered $185,000 more , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The money was delivered in one bundle of Government bonds and the total , $260,000 , was exactly one-half of the $520,000 G. O. P. deficit . " It was just like a Red Cross drive , " said Mr. Hays . <P> When other contributions turned up , Sinclair received back $50,000 from the G. O. P. then $50,000 more . Then Mr. Hays personally borrowed $85,000 and gave it to Sinclair , thus reimbursing him for all but his initial gift of $75,000 , the amount they had agreed was fitting for him to give outright . <P> " But , " said Mr. Hays , " he Sinclair did not feel that I should bear this burden personally and he voluntarily returned the $85,000 . . . . This last transaction had not taken place when I testified before this committee in 1924 . " <P> Nervousness on the one hand , suspicion on the other , made of this story a very long and confused matter indeed when Inquisitor Walsh made Tsar Hays repeat it over &; over . Less stigma would have attached but for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report in 1924 that Sinclair had at one time advanced as much as $260,000 toward the G. O. P. deficit , Mr. Hays said , " I was not asked about that . "
