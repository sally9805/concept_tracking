Linbergh Honored <P> Col. Lindbergh acquired the first string of honorary letters after his name ; M. A. S. , Master of Aeronautical Science . The honor was accorded by St. Joseph College , Philadelphia ; a Jesuit institution . At the ceremonial dinner , the flyer wore a gold-lined gown , a silver tassel on his flat academic hat . <P> Leaving Philadelphia to keep a promise , he darted toward Long Island where he had pledged his presence at a charity air circus . As he slid neatly to earth , the frantic crowd broke police lines , swooped toward his plane . With the mob spirit hurling those in front straight to death in the still whirling propeller blades , Col. Lindbergh threw wide the throttle ; wheeled the roaring plane just in time ; flew away a lifesaver ; lighted on an adjoining field .
