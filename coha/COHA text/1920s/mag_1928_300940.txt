When the settlers of California dreamed mundane dreams of shiny streets of gold , they turned to an old Spanish custom and called California an El Dorado . <P> But there were milder settlers in California who dreamed of golden grain and ripe fruits . When a small group of these beheld . 30 miles east of busy , sprawling Los Angeles , a hill profuse with oranges , lemons , apricots , peaches , it was also quite natural that they should invoke an Italian legend and call the spot Pomona. * Pomona it became when it was settled in 1875 . <P> Thirteen years passed ; the lush fruit had done well , the colony prospered . In 1888 , then , the two great things happened : Pomona was chartered as a city , Pomona College was founded by a group of settlers who felt the need of a small " Christian college of the New England type . " <P> Scattered here and there in the simple sun parlor of a private house the first students began to learn their Christian duties of citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three miles north of Pomona , was given to the college and the students were assembled . In 1894 , 47 students were graduated . It soon became difficult to cling to the ideal of a small college . Nevertheless Pomona firmly shut its doors yearly in the face of all but 750 students . But if there were two colleges ? Later , perhaps , three ? On the coast of the Pacific another Oxford , a group of autonomous colleges united by a common central organization ? <P> Today next to Pomona stands Scripps College for Women. + Together Pomona and Scripps are referred to as The Claremont Colleges , which is the name of the central mediating organization acting between the two individual colleges . Dr. James A. Blaisdell , onetime president of Pomona , is now president of this organization . Dr. Charles Keyser Edmunds , onetime president of Lingnan University , Canton , was inaugurated president of Pomona last fortnight . <P> <P> A year before Andrew Jackson yielded the presidency to Martin Van Buren. and before California became a state , Ellen Scripps was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper which was the first of today 's Scripps newspaper syndicate .

Many and sincere were her well wishers but none more sincere than the students and professors of Scripps College , which her money founded when she turned 89 . <P> <P> * Pomona was an Italian Goddess of fruit and gardens . In Ovid she is wooed by Vertumnus , God of the Changing Seasons . <P> + Pomona is coeducational . <P> ** Among these are Balboa Park , San Diego , the world 's largest aviary ; the San Diego Community Welfare Building ; the Scripps Memorial Hospital ; the Scripps Biological Institute at Miramar ; the La Jolla playground .
