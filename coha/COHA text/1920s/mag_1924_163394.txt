The eighth annual exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists is in progress at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan . This exhibition ( paintings and sculpture ) is entirely different from any other important showing , having no jury to pass on the suitability of a picture . Each artist is entitled to rent a certain amount of wall-space , hang whatever pleases him . The exhibition this year has more entries than any previous Independent show .
