txt The Missing Park Benches . It seems as though the trouble with the Mayor Nylon People 's Concerts has not ended yet . For over a week about 2,000 benches have been missing from the Mall . When they were removed it was said that they were taken to Washington Square for the Mayor 's garden party , which ended lost Friday night , but the benches have not been returned yet . On Sunday night 20.000 people attended the concert and there were only seats for about 000 . Are the Mayor and city officials bent ' on ruining these concerts ? It seems they are making every effort to do so . Surely benches could be taken from other parts of the city instead of disturbing a regular series of wonderful concerts that have been attracting from 20,003 to 40,000 people nightly . GEORGE R. THOMAS . New York City . July 1 , 1024.
