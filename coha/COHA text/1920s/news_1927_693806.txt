txt WILLINGNESS TO SERVE In considering the propriety and the possibility of Mr. Coolidge 's candidacy in the next Presidential election , it might be well to reflect upon his attitude of willingness to serve his country in the relatively inconspicuous position of Vice President as compared with that of some of the prospective candidates in 1928 , whose policy of " President or nothing " in former conventions may easily be recalled . To refuse . to renominate Mr. Coolidge merely because an infelicitous event permitted him to act as the Chief Executive during one year and seven months of his predecessor 's term would be tantamount to perslizing a faithful servant . With this in mind , it is inconceivable that the American people will view with anything but satisfaction the candidacy of a man whose entire political career has had for its keynote service to his fellow-citizens . FREDERICK 3 . HURLEY . Brooklyn , April 26 , 1927.
