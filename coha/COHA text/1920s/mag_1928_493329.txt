BIT BY BIT , the evidence is being pieced together which should at last convince even men like Gov ? governor Fuller and President Lowell that Sacco and Vanzetti did not have a fair trial and were in all human probability innocent of the crime with which they were charged . Only a few weeks ago the New York Outlook presented a confession from one of the participants in the Bridgewater case , for which Vanzetti was tried and found guilty while waiting for his joint trial with Sacco for the more serious South Braintree affair . This participant exonerated Vanzetti in a statement which , accom ? panied as it was by corroborative material , should be convincing to any intelligent and open-minded person . Now comes another important item of evidence , in the columns of the New York World . It will be remembered that the police , the prose ? cution , Governor Fuller and his advisors all laid stress on the supposed participation of one " Boda " in the South Braintree crime . Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( another of whom was " Boda " ) who called at a garage for " Boda 's " automobile . " Boda " was alleged to have hidden the " murder car " in his shed , to have dug holes in the ground under that shed , presumably in which to hide the money , and to have hung burlap bags over the windows of the shed , supposedly for some sinister purpose which was never made very clear . Yet despite his importance in their theory of the case , the police would seem never to have made any very serious effort to apprehend him , or to recover the money taken in the hold-up , which they sup ? posed him to have . As soon as they caught Sacco and Vanzetti , they lost interest in " Boda " and in the money , not one cent of which was ever found . BUT NOW , " Boda " has been found , by Edward Holton James , a nephew of WilliaM James , the philosopher , and Henry James , the novelist . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views ( he is an anarchist ) , to the island of Lipari , where Mr. James visited him and subjected him to a cross-examination which occu ? pied , in all , fifteen hours ' time . " Boda " turns out to be Mario Buda . He tells a straightforward , plausible-sounding story , denying that Sacco , Van ? zetti or himself had anything to do with the South Braintree crime . Buda says the holes in the earth beneath his shed were made when he dug out stones . The burlap bags were hung over the windows to keep out the cold of a bitter winter . He points out that there could hardly have been any tire tracks from the " murder car " in the earth , because the shed 's lintel was so far off the ground that hoards were slanted across it and Buda 's car stood on these . Buda says , moreover , that the Massa ? chusetts authorities could have found him readily at any time in the past eight years , if they had cared to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were advanced to the jury , and which helped send Sacco and Vanzetti to their death . But the authorities , from the first to the last , never really wanted to find out the truth . Whatever may have been the conscious processes of their minds , unconsciously they wanted only such evidence , no matter how flimsy , as would support them in putting to death the shoemaker and the fish peddler who were of such humble social rank and harbored such unpleasant ideas . Naval Parity or Naval Poolin ? ? NOTHING has happened to change the physical background of the naval question for the United States or Great Britain since the break ? down of the Geneva conference on cruiser limita ? tion over a year ago . But much has happened to change the mental background , and of late this ominous situation has been stirring minds and tongues at a bewildering pace . We have the big-navy Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives writing to the Prime Minister of Great Britain to suggest a con ? ference between committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Depart ? ment of State for his treseass on the sacred pre ? serves of diplomacy , and giving Mr. Baldwin the awkward task of finding a way to welcome a friendly gesture without offending the executive department of our government . We have Repre ? sentative La Guardia , who doubtless has a more genuine interest in disarmament than Mr. Britten , following suit with a resolution directing the Secre ? tary of State to negotiate such a conference . We have Senator Borah , chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate , offering a rider to the cruiser-construction bill which provides for a conference on maritime law . But even more significant developments have taken place on the other side of the Atlantic . Lord Lee of Fareham , recognizing the senseless drift to ? ward naval competition , proposed a negotiation between two outstanding leaders , one on each side . The more intelligent of the British journals have recognized that there must be an understanding on sea law before the cruiser difficulty can be cleared away ; some have even gone so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surrender to the American position on freedom of the seas as urged by the Wilson administration before our entrance into the War . Finally , we have the conservative and influential London Economist pointing out that domination of the seas has throughout history been seized by one great power after another , that there has always been a newcomer among nations to challenge it , that sea power has never been re ? linquished by its possessor without a struggle , and that unless plans are wisely laid to prevent history from repeating itself in this particular , Great Britain as the possessor and the United States as the challenger of sea power are headed straight for a similar collision . All this interest and this plain speaking mark a tremendous advance toward the solution of the problem . The Geneva conference amply demon ? strated , as the New Republic was almost alone in pointing out at the time , that the dispute is incap ? able of resolution in purely physical terms of parity in fighting weapons , or by consideration of the so-called " needs " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts . We must get back to policy in order to know the uses of the fleets . And this requires an agreement on policy , plus , of course , a real demand for disarmament surging up from the public which will put irresistible pressure upon the governments . It will be remembered that at the Geneva con ? ference both nations proceeded on the assumption that they were seeking parity . The United States wanted a limitation of the total tonnage of cruisers , large and small ; Great Britain wanted a bigger limit than the United States , and also insisted that the tonnage and armament of large cruisers be limited . If it were not , the British Admiralty would be faced with two alternatives , equally un ? acceptable : one , to build as many and as powerful large cruisers as the United States and thus to have room within the total tonnage quota for an insuf ? ficient number of small cruisers for patrol of the seas in war ; and the other , to build as many small cruisers as she believed necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The United States replied that she could not assent to such limitation of large cruisers as Britain de ? sired , since with our fewer naval bases we needed more ships of long cruising radius to give us real parity in sea patrol , even though we had as many small cruisers as Britain . Even a superficial con ? consideration of this deadlock reveals that universal parity is a mirage , because of the differing needs of the nations under different circumstances . Parity in fighting strength is one thing , parity in protection of commerce another , parity in establishing a block ? ade is a third . Parity in home waters demands one type of limitation , parity in distant seas another . There is no way out of the maze except to reconcile the naval policies of the two nations . And there is no way to do that except to agree upon the pur ? poses for which , and the circumstances in which , the fleets are to be used . Members of Congress and of Parliament , or single leaders of light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex ? perts to achieve parity with limitation , unless the functions of the respective navies were first clearly defined and agreed upon . Any limitation conference must start with the as ? sumption.that the two nations will not arm to fight each other ; if it did not , the conference would be absurd , since if there were to be a war between them the only sensible thing for each to do would be to arm to the teeth . The next assumption , necessary in consequence of Great Britain 's membership in the League of Nations and the probable adhesionof both nations to the Kellogg treaty , is that neither will resort to aggressive warfare , or to war " as the instrument of national policy " ? a phrase which in its outcome amounts to the same thing , since if any nation did resort to war as an instru ? ment of policy it would necessarily be an ag ? gressor , would violate the Kellogg treaty , and hence would release other nations from their obligations under it . Assume , for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat ? isfactory way of deciding when a nation had become an aggressor , or had resorted to war as an instru ? ment of policy . The function of the fleets of both nations would then be that of an international marine police . They might have to fight the navy of the aggressor . But each alone is so far superior in naval force to any other country except the other that this would offer no barrier to drastic limitation of ships for fighting purposes . There remains , then , the policing of sea-borne commerce . This has two aspects : the protection of friendly ships from hostile submarines or raiders , and the control of ships trad ? ing with the enemy , whether by blockade , search or seizure . The latter is the issue concerning which the two nations have an unresolved conflict of long standing , which became acute between 1914 and 1917 . This is the issue which needs to be settled before the limitation of cruisers can be effected . If neither nation is to fight the other , there are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerents against a possible aggressor , the other in which one is a belligerent while the other is a neutral . In the first case , there can be no conflict of policy . Both can easily agree on the law of blockade , of search and seizure , and of contraband , to be applied . The sizes and nature of the fleets necessary for these purposes can readily be deter ? mined . But if one were a belligerent while the other remained neutral , the belligerent would prob ? ably wish to use naval power to its fullest extent in order to interrupt trading with the enemy , while the other would wish to curb such interference as much as possible . But under what circumstances could such a situation arise ? Only in one of two cases : when the belligerent of the two powers was undertaking , without the aid of the other , disciplin ? ary measures against an internationally declared ag ? gressor , or when it was engaging in a so-called " private war " permitted by the League of Nations or under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the neutral could hardy deny the right of the belligerent to use its sea power to the utmost . In the second case , however , the traditional " free ? dom of the seas " as interpreted by the United States in the first part of the World War ought clearly to prevail . For this case would be the vestigial sur ? vival of the old world order when wars were allowed to individual nations as instruments of policy , and therefore the path of the belligerent ought not to be smoothed . This is , in substance , the suggestion of Mr. Charles P , Howland , in his " Survey of American Foreign Relations , 1928 . " " With such an agreement on naval policy , the o ' - the- wisp of parity would disappear from the pic ? ture . Limitation of both small and large cruisers would be easy . The questions before the British Ad ? miralty would be : What armament would be neces ? sary to resist naval attacks by any other nation than the United States , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nation than the United States , if the United States did not interfere ? The questions before the American Board of Strategy would be the converse of these . A striving for physical parity in a world of an ? archy on the seas can only result in competition , and , eventually , conflict . A pooling of the naval forces of Great Britain and the United States in a world of anarchy might be possible , but would constitute for the other nations an insupportable imperialistic menace . But pooling of the navies under a world order is not only possible but entirely desirable , if only the maritime laws of war can be brought in consonance with the beginnings of world order which have already been achieved . To do so , whether by the Howland formula or some other , is indeed a difficult task . It will require the modi ? fication of firm traditions of both nations ? British naval supremacy and American isolation . But if the League of Nations means anything , and if the Kellogg treaty means anything , the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Great Britain thus becomes , in a very concrete sense , the acid test of the efforts of both nations to organize peace on earth . Mr. Coolidge 's Paradise THERE are no surprises in the President 's message to Congress . The recommendations in it he has either made before , or they are thor ? oughly in accord with his general attitude of mind and policies . Most of them will be disregarded by Congress as so many of his previous pieces of ad ? vice have been . Washington is marking time until the fourth of next March ; the Coolidge adminis ? tration is approaching sunset , and already the President 's words are interesting more for what they reveal of the color of his mind than for any practical results they will produce . From this viewpoint his introduction and his peroration are the most significant passages ; they are in complete accord with the general tone of the Armistice Day speech which produced such an un ? pleasant impression in Europe . Mr. Coolidge is enormously pleased with America and Americans as they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says flatly that " no Congress of the United States ever assembled , on surveying the state of the Union , has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present dine . " He finds " tranquillity , " " contentment , " " harmonious rela ? tions between management and wage earner , " " the highest record of years of prosperity . " The coun ? try can " regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism . " We have en ? tered " the charmed circle of diminishing expendi ? tures , diminishing tax rates and increasing profits . " To what is all this due ? " The main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity and char ? acter of the American people . " When Mr. Coolidge paints this picture he speaks , of course , more as a lawyer making a case than as a scientist intent on showing the shadows as well as the bright spots . From his own message , in its sub ? sequent passages , we learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of peace more permanent than this country has ever before experienced " is subject to grave qualifications . Despite the " era of peace " he urges the building of cruisers , to cost a quarter of a billion dollars . This is in addition to other expenditures for defense which are now run ? ning at the rate of nearly seven hundred million a year and to a bill for relief of veterans of previous wars which is in excess of three quarters of a bil ? lion and is still growing . He also devotes much consideration to the grave depression in agriculture , and might have put more stress on coal and textiles as two other major industries which are seriously ill . Only a few months ago our industry was suffi ? sufficiently depressed so that , according to the most reliable figures available , more than four million men were out of work . A responsible economist , Mr. Virgil Jordan , declared last week that our prosperity is largely mythical , being centered upon various new devices to be classed as luxuries , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolidge is correct when he says we are pros ? perous compared to European'countries ; but when our present condition is measured against our own past , or against any reasonable scale of security , comfort and happiness for the common man , it be ? comes much less glorious than his bit of delayed campaign oratory would suggest . For the moment , however , it is less interesting to ponder whether Mr. Coolidge is right or wrong , than to consider his mental processes and their ap ? propriateness to present and future conditions . The President was born in 1872 ; his formative years came before the passing of the frontier . He grew up in an America where natural resources seemed limitless and were being squandered even more recklessly than they are today . The rest of the world hardly existed ; foreign trade was of little economic importance , and the imperialistic urge which came with the Spanish War of 1898 still lay in the future . Probably a majority of all Ameri ? cans still believed that we are the personal wards of a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp it , from individual or cor ? porate effort unaided by government and a laissez-faire philosophy was accepted without question . We shall not pretend that this sort of world has entirely passed away . There are millions of Amer
