IN THE days when woman suffrage was still an unsettled question a walking fossil in my town , local Republican boss and J. P. , said to me , " Women ai n't fit to vote because they ai n't logical . " Being younger than I am now and a belligerent believer in the right of all adult citizens , not criminal or insane , to vote , I began to argue with him . " What do you mean by logical ? " " Well , I ca n't exactly define it , but it means reasonable , able to think straight . " " Do men vote according to logic or reason ? " ( Method of the Socratic question . ) " I dunno 's they do , most of ' em . " " Why are you a Republican ? " " Always have been , and my father before me . He voted for Lincoln . " " - Is that logical ? " " There 's one blame sure thing ( with some heat ) , I do n't want those scalawags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge , do n't you know that we do n't vote or do anything else according to logic and reason , but according to how we feel and how we were brought up ? " " Daresay you 're right . But anyhow , men think straighter'n women . Made up my mind to that long ago . " There is no use arguing with a mind that is made up ? just as there is no use arguing with a woman . The hopelessly fixed attitude of the Judge , a stupid stand-pat immobility , drives one by an emotional rebound , quite unreasonable and illogical , to a passionate advocacy of everything that woman desires , hopesfor , pretends to he , and to a recantation of every written or spoken word that sounds in the least unfavorable toward her . Our best friend is a blundering enemy . Nevertheless , the Judge with his eburnean brain had gropingly hit upon a difference between the sexes which , however slight , is real and worth considering . It is difficult to know just what ladies are , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings . It is still more difficult to find out , with the help of all the epistemologists , psychologists , and ordinary commonsense observation of the way people think , just what logic is . Some philosophers drive logic into a corner and knock it cold , so that you do not recognize it as having much to do with any natural action of your mind . Chesterton says that it is logic , not vagaries of thought , that makes us mad . Like many of Chester-ton 's paradoxes , this is not true and not very clever , but it does pry the subject off the schoolroom wall , blackboard and all . A better humorist , Dr. Holmes , reduces logic to its logical absurdity in the rollicking fable of Calvinism , " The OneHoss Shay . " In our age which began about a century ago , when every idea pretending to be true must be " scientific , " Logic has become a highly specialized subject with an elaborate technic , and is called the Science of Reasoning and the Science of the Laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a product of recent times , but goes back to Leibnitz and far behind him to the Scholastic phiLOGIC AND THE LADIES 723 losophers , especially Dims Scotus of the Thirteenth Century , a great thinker , from whose name by a queer freak of derivation we get our word " dunce . " He called Logic the Science of Sciences . Logic has about the same relation to actual thinking that mathematics has to the building of a bridge . The difference is that if we have a good brain we can think logically without ever having looked into Mill or Jevons or Whately , whereas an engineer who designs a bridge must be a trained mathematician , though he may be quite indifferent to the speculations of an Einstein . In practice logic means sound sense , clear thinking , sequential , orderly , progressive . The first requisite of that kind of thinking is information , knowledge of the subject , grasp of material . The second is detachment , freedom from the corruptions and disturbances of the many other activities of the mind . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely to compose our most perspicuous discourse on the Economic and Ethical Status of Woman when we are in love . Straight thinking must be impersonal , objective ; and it never can be that perfectly because rationality is only one part ? not a preponderant part ? of our make-up . Perversely , the very strength of our character , our personality , gets in our own way , stands in our own light , plays ducks and drakes with logic . So that if we find ( many will deny it flatly ) a lack of logic in the processes of the feminine mind , as compared with the processes of the noble masculine intellect , we are not bringing a very damning charge against the ladies . That defect , if it exists , may be part of their charm . And in general ? some fiery ladies seem unable to understand this ? the masculist 's discussion of the nature of woman is or should be , not accusatory , but analytical , speculative , dispassionate , yet not so dispassionate as to be dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judge , Mrs. Margaret Deland , who was opposed to woman suffrage , told in one of her articles in the Atlantic Monthly a story which in part atones for the fundamental error of her position . I repeat from memory . A man and a woman were debating this old question of woman 's ability to reason . The man said , " The trouble with you women is that you can not think an idea out for its own sake . You make everything personal . " The lady replied , " / do n't . " Before some other lady begins to argue about it , I hasten to say that the story proves nothing except that Mrs. Deland , a woman whose intelligence is far above that of the common run of men and women , has a lower opinion of her sisters than have many of us sweetly reasonable masculine critics , and that she offers an instance in confirmation of my belief that the severest critics of women are women . We are all incurably personal , wrapped up , tangled up in ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a nobody , a nonentity , dead from the neck up . The most abstract objective matter , once it gets into a single separate cranium , becomes individualized ; and the stronger the individual , the better the matter is cerebrated . Huxley , treating facts , pleading for the disinterested study of facts , would be forgotten but for his dominant self , expressed in his magnificently effective prose . The egocentrism of the male is just the same as that of the female , as an observant man is aware every day whether he is watching another fellow or dwelling alone in honest self-scrutiny . We are well past the time when it was necessary for Mary Wollstonecraft to argue that the minds of men and women are fundamentally the same in quality , that the knowledge acquired by the sexes is , or should be , essentially the same , and that the treatment which that knowledge undergoes , the mental process to which it is subjected , differs not according to sex but according to the capacity and power of the individual . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman solve a problem in geometry . But there is immense difference in speed , understanding , richness of implication , between what happens to that problem in the mind of Bertrand Russell and what happens in the mind of a struggling schoolboy . If a man is found dead with a discharged pistol in his hand , men and women alike reason that he has killed himself , and men and women alike go farther and ask whether a murderer has " planted " the pistol there . Both men and women argue validly that Socrates was a man , man is immortal ; therefore Socrates is immortal . And both run amuck in fallacious syllogisms : Napoleon was a man , Socrates was a man ; therefore , Socrates was Napoleon . The question is whether on the whole , in handling more difficult intellectual problems , more abstract and complicated ideas , women fail more often than men , fail not in kind but in degree , fall short of the best thinking to which men , a very few , have attained , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the allied question is whether this liability to error from which everybody suffers is not accentuated by an inherent inferiority in the feminine intellect ; whether the ladies are not more subject than nous autres to the habit of fetching home every sort of idea to themselves , referring it to their private purposes , experiences , and emotions . I believe that this is a weakness of intellect in which the weaker sex is weaker . Even in a devoutly to he wished society where everybody shall have opportunity for the fullest cultivation of the faculties , the masculist revenant may expect to find the ladies great as poets , artists , musicians , but only secondary as philosophers and " men " of science . I can not prove it ( logic ) even with respect to what is or has been , much less for a putative future . But I can report my beliefs and some corroborative instances , with the understanding that instances are only indications ; they point toward a conclusion but do not clinch any general proposition or carry us securely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duer Miller used effectively during the Great Campaign , " Are Women People ? " was an ironic reference to the " We , the People , " of our democratic forefathers . Another more amusing question is , " Are Women Persons ? " All the better , I say , if they are . Their intense personal sense of themselves is part of their power and charm , even if it does become a limiting liability in the upper reaches of thought . The maseulist contention is that some women are striving to be not themselves , pretending and aspiring to be what they are not and never can be . We are trying to find out what they are and , if possible , how they think . And we are quite ready to be met with the fierce retort that we are trying to keep them down and suppress them . Nothing could be farther from the masculist attitude . Are women persons ? The more vigorously , aggressively they are persons , female persons , the better and happier for us and our children . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in danger of being lost in the indistinguishable homogeneity . People are interesting only as persons . The present assertiveness of women as a sex is mostly a loud cheer , a mob hubbub . The fine solo voices arc all too few . Women are exhibiting two apparently contradictory failings , their new intellectual short skirts uncovering much that is not shapely . One failing is the herd instinct , the tendency with which we are all cursed to merge in a mass , an aggregate without purpose or direction . Partial emancipation is turning the sex into a grex . At the same time there is the other failing , the old inborn disposition of women to be pettily egotistic , to refer , convert , and so belittle ideas to their intimate conceits and desires . The two failings are really not contradictory ; they are complementary , two manifestations of the same lack of courage and ability to tackle ideas as ideas . Thinking is an individual act LOGIC AND which takes place in the skull of a person , however much it may be influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paradox which is quite appropriate to their perverseness , are at once too personal and not personal enough , individual in a small way and not individual in a large way when confronted with a difficult and complex idea . ( I note all your exceptions , Madam Attorney . ) I tried an experiment , a trivial thing , a straw in the wind . I enjoyed immensely Dr. Logan Clendening 's book , The Human Body , which is packed with information that a layman can understand and is written in a clear , vivacious , humorous manner . I recommended the book right and left to intelligent adults of both sexes . The responses were all enthusiastic or at least approving . But invariably the men discussed the merits of the hook , its substance , style . And invariably the women made a dive into it to sec if it said anything about their symptoms , usually those treated in one special section . I once watched for a few minutes each day through many sad weeks at the bedside of a dying woman . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers who had to attend to some final affairs were tactful and sympathetic . One or two male friends and relatives who came and went were cheerful and helpful . The patient 's mother , who was in charge , spent most of her many hours in the sick room ( the patient told inc this with acid humor ) talking about her own ailments , which curiously resembled those of the dying girl . If a man had acted like that I should have invited him into the corridor and given him the devil . Another experiment was made for me . Two previous articles of mine elicited many letters mostly from women and mostly in disagreement with my ideas , though some women thought that we understood their sisters . Almost every letter began with " I , " not the conventional opening : " I have read your article , " but an upstanding , self-conscious " I " which introduced myself and my exTHE periences and why I joined the cause of Woman Suffrage and how much work I did for it . The letters also contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how unfortunate your experience as a lover and husband must have been , bow women who gave you opinions unfavorable to their sex have deceived you about themselves . And there was also a good deal about what " my husband " thinks , an unwittingly feminine appeal to the authority of masculine opinion and a reminder of the undeniable fact that men disagree with men about women . It is from women that I try to learn about women . They seem to be the valid sources of information , conscious or unconscious , willing or reluctant . I confess that their testimony about themselves is confusing , sometimes self-destructive , illogically contradictory . When women betray or affirm ( according to my correspondents ) their general dislike of their sisters , they are deceiving us men who have taught them to flatter and cajole us ; especially do they feed our literary vanity when we happen to be writing about them . But when they disagree with us they are telling the truth , which we must accept at its face value , for we do not understand them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of undermining the testimony of their sisters and asserting their own honesty they accuse one another of mendacity with an emphasis beyond the courage of a mere timid ( and , I trust , courteous ) man . Lest I be suspected of making this up , let me , without betraying confidences , quote some phrases from women : " Do not be too sure that the clever ladies who confess female goodfornothingness a word I never used nor even distantly suggested are not flattering you . I hate to peach on my own kind , but that is an old , old trick . Perhaps if I were talking to you , I should say that your article was wonderful and so true . " From another correspondent who writes a complete rebuttal in third personal form : " If he quotes a woman , it is a biased one . His assumption that he is not being fiattered by his female chorus is so naive that it makes one laugh . The flattery is so evident and the procedure so usual . I have yet to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however obnoxious he may make himself . I have seen severall The fact may be regrettable , but society is assumed to be a place of peace , not war , and its courtesies are religiously kept by most women . What they think has no place in what they know they must say . He should learn that a masculist , such as he proclaims himself by word and deed , never receives a straight answer from his feminine associates . If he did he would cease to associate with such a one ? unless he fell in love with her from pure opposition . But he would most likely find her unattractive , and relegate her to solitude and the company of children . " I can not make out the logic of running down your sex on one side in order to support it on another . I only know that some of the severest critics of women are women . Since a man may indeed be deceived by his own experience , I appeal to some great women in the sunshine of whose flattery I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer , Wladimir Karenine , a woman , says : " George Sand could not endure talking for the sake of talking . She freely admitted that she preferred the conversation of men to that of women . Women wearied her by their silly gossip and chit-chat . " It may be that women in George Sand 's environment were sillier than the ladies we know , and it is certain that the demands of her fine intellect were more exacting than those of most women and men . It was her intelligence that rebelled against her sex . Her overflowing maternity embraced men , women , children , animals , and God . Her lovers and friends were men of brains . Modern feminists will surely be the last to reply that she was a masculine woman . She was thoroughly feminine and a paragon of honesty among men and women . Another less admirable but very influential woman , Hannah More , whose excellent style is worthy of better ideas , wrote : " To be unstable and enpricious , I really think , is but too characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal sic ! so much indebted to subordination for its good behavior as woman , " This judgment was delivered apropos of Mary Wollstonecraft 's Vindiccdim of the Rights of Woman , which Aunt Hannah confesses she has not read and does not intend to read ! Her opinion is simply the conventional view of the time . Mary Wollstonecraft herself is a sharp critic of women and found her most subtle and stubborn enemy in the weaknesses of the sex whose rights , not virtues , she was defending . She charges her sisters with cunning , superstition , want of generosity , Iow sense of justice , sloth , mismanagement of children , neglect of household duties , domestic selfishness worse than neglect . Her general accusation against society is free from the perversion of misandry , which distorts the more querulous of modern feminist arguments . ( " Misandry " is not in the New English Dictionary , but if it did not exist before , it does now . It is analogous in formation to " polyandry " and in meaning to " misogyny . " Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) In women 's defense of themselves there frequently appears the overt charge , or the implication , that men arc responsible for the mendacity of women , as for some other lapses from virtue . As my correspondents aver , we encourage them to lie to us . Other failings and misfortunes of women are repeatedly attributed to the erroneously alleged fact that this is a " man-made " world . Mrs. Poyser 's " God made them so to match the men " becomes Man made them so to please himself . Woman 's virtues are her own , but her faults are not her fault . Her weaknesses are due to Nature , the Creator , and especially to Male Man . God and Nature can bear their share of the responsibility , but it is not good sense or good sportsmanship to shift all the remaining burden of one 's failings to the shoulders of a human fellow . The classic example of that kind of cowardice is Adam 's ascription of his fall to the temptation of Eve . The modern woman will not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other sex . We are proud of our good qualities and you are to blame for our shortcomings ? that is the worst kind of illogical ethics , and an example of the intellectual fallacy of trying to have it both ways at once . It is not good sportsmanship to use the other fellow as a scapegoat . Good sportsmanship is an aspect of fairmindedness , and fairness of mind is very close to clearness of mind , to logical , reasonable thinking . Are women good sports ? Last year I took part in a so-called debate over the radio on the subject of the " Two-Job Wife . " Like most debates , it was not a debate at all but two loosely related talks . Knowing from experience that this was likely to be the case and also knowingthattbe debate was only a vaudeville stunt for the amusement of radiauditors , I suggested to my opponent that we collude and make our little pieces fit . She was a brilliant lawyer , member of a profession which , though often morally despicable , is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent her a carbon copy of my remarks . But I never saw a copy of hers , had no idea what she was going to say , and the announcer cut off a possible rebuttal , since my piece as printed later in a feminist journal occupied a column and a half and the lady lawyer 's piece occupied two columns and a half . She effectively answered most of what I said and placed some hot shots clear outside the nominal subject . One of my adoring harem of unemancipated ladies said to me , " Why did you let that woman put it over you like that ? " I explained the circumstances . She sniffed , " Well , what else could you expect of a female ? Women do n't play the game . They are rotten bad sports . " I protested ? for I always defend women against themselves ? that in the real sports , tennis , golf , women do play fair . " Yes , " said my backward cave-lady , " because they are being watched and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently complained that women who gamble on margin are poor losers , try to lie out of orders they have given , which may injure an innocent clerk , and let loose lachrymal Niagaras in the office . Many years ago HI L ? fe published a picture of a half-lighted hallway . A man evidently the worse for wear had knocked over the stand , broken the newel-lamp , and messed things up generally . At the head of the stairway was the shadowy figure of a woman in her nightie . The text under the picture read , " Her fine feminine intuition told her that something was wrong . " This will go with a story the hero of which is masculine , a German locomotive driver who saw on the track ahead of his speeding train a little child tied " handless and footless " to the rails . " He knew , " runs the story in stage dialect of the unspellable Weber and Fields , " he knew by a kind of untuvishion dot someting most be done . " Of all the superstitions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belief that they have a sort of sixth sense , a short-cut leap of mind by which they jump to conclusions unerringly without the exercise of the ordinary processes of thought which men are obliged to follow . Whether this imaginary faculty was wished on woman by man as flattering compensation ( man also is a flatterer ) for qualities which he denied in her , or whether it was his ignorant blundering way of recognizing the plain every day fact that her mind often acts quickly and that she sees with disconcerting shrewdness through his bluff and nonsense ? in short has keen common sense ? history does not say . In the ages of faith in witchcraft and other mythical things , divination , usually of a malignant kind , was ascribed to women partly in fear and respect , partly in hatred . There was some wicked twist of woman 's mind which the brute could not understand , especially when he was an illiterate oaf , hunting and fighting while she was knitting , spinning , thinking , listening to song and story , and sharpening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that from that condition with its momentous , passionate , even tragic superstitions has descended the silly little myth of woman 's intuition . Mary Wollstoneeraft , like all reasonable feminists , asked only that woman be treated as a rational being in the same sense , if not to the same degree , as man . She did not ask for any extra lugs or special endowments . But some women , though seeking to be relieved of burdensome and unjust superstitions , still cling to this pleasant complimentary libel of their intelligence . They wish to be credited with all the intellectual power that men have and then add a little more for luck . Intuition simply means seeing ( Latin , intueri , to look at ) . A lady may know by intuition the shape of a pig ( porcine or marital ) but she can not so know the Declaration of Independence or God or the character of the man who is trying to get her husband in on a Big Deal . Old Jeremy Taylor uses the word in its original sense when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Callcubinage but from " the impurer intuition of a wife of another man . " By a loose extension the word came to mean instinctive immediate knowledge of any kind , a quick-as-a-flash good guess , apprehension independent of ratiocinative process of thought . And it is in this sense that we commonly use it . When Dr. Alexander Graham Bell secured his claim to the telephone by the preposterous patent of the passage of a variable current of electricity through a wire , he may be said to have had a fortunate intuition , for he had no reasonable or empirical knowledge of what enormous complexities the words could be made to cover . When Democritus hit upon a theory of atoms twenty-three centuriesbefore Theodore Richards weighed them , he had a happy intuition . Whether or not man 's intellect in some of its activities is more powerful than woman 's , one thing is certain : there is no difference in kind or degree between feminine and masculine intuition . In the face-to-face cognition of present objective facts the sexes are equally alert , swift , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king looks at a cat exactly the same act of intuition takes place . But when the king says , " You are a beautiful cat ; I wish you would not scratch the gilt off the throne , " and when the cat says , " He is a good king but not so kind as the queen ; I 'd like to chew the ermine off his robe , " then intuition has finished its work and another kind of thinking has begun . So we shall have to deprive the ladies once for all of this little spurious claim to superiority . IV Much of the foregoing is speculative , matter of opinion , and not subject to final demonstration . Oue fact about woman is known and demonstrable , if not precisely understood in all its aspects . I am aware that my brief and inexpert discussion of this subject will expose me to the charge of blaming woman for a weakness over which she has no more control than she has over her stature or the color of her eyes . Nobody is blaming anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out how we are made . The ancient Greeks had but a rudimentary knowledge of physiology and pathology . For them the nervous system had no more existence than the circulation of the blood ; vtilipor , from which our " nerve " is ultimately derived , meant sinew , tendon , string . But they were wise and careful observers of human nature both in its physical and in its psychic aspects . They noted a disorder to which women are especially liable and so they named it from the uterus ( kr ripa ) , hysteria . The belief LOGIC AND THE LADIES 7e9 that this baffling and varied derangement of mind , nerves , senses , and muscles was referable to a disturbance of the female genital organs persisted for centuries until the Epistolary Dissertation of Thomas Sydenham in 1092 . This independent and sensible man , the Father of English Medicine , saw what might have been seen before , that men are also subject to hysteria , though not so often as women , and that we must , therefore , look for the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With an " intuitive " etiology , Sydenham correctly pronounced hysteria to be a disease of the mind , some failure of the mental functions . Janet calls it a forgetfulness , an amnesia . In one form of hysteria the patient 's foot or arm does " go to sleep , " because part of the mind forgets it . And all physical manifestations of hysteria are due to wrong ideas ; something in the mind has gone askew and produces morbid results in the body . So that over-exciting or frightening ideas may cause hysteria ; and suggestion , calm surroundings , and psychoanalysis may cure the trouble . The reason that women are more subject to hysteria than men , in the proportion of twenty to one , is in plain terms that their brains are weaker , more easily unbalanced . On one side hysteria , which is usually a passing fit , may run over into the permanent or more long-continued disturbances which are loosely called insanity . On the other side hysteria fades into weaker forms of " hysterics , " excessive emotionalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinder and confuse thought . " War hysteria , " " hysterical with laughter , " " positively hysterical with joy " arc common expressions ; we know about what we mean by such phrases , and we certainly do not mean to imply anything specifically pathological . These hysteroidal upsets of reason , temporarily disturbing to serenity and good sense , have the same ratio of frequency in women and men as true hysteria . You never , or very seldom , see in a French book arise de nerfs applied to a man . ( The French , by the way , are more subject to actual hysterical fits than the English ; this is a matter of medical statistics and should not be confounded with the belief dear to so-called Anglo Saxons that the French are " excitable " ; the French keep their nerve and maintain their poise quite as well as their northern neighbors . ) The proved tendency of women to unsettlements of mind approaching remotely or closely true hysteria , added to their undeniable periodical incapacities , is a severe handicap . It accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unflagging application a difficult idea . Woman may learn mathematics ; she has never contributed anything to the subject . These conclusions may be open to argument . The pathological and biological facts are undeniable . If Madam resents being told by a layman that she is twenty to one more liable than her brother to hysteria and hysteroidal manifestations she may ask her physician , provided she is fortunate enough to have one who will tell her the truth , and she had better consult him some day when she is feeling fine . Woman is more susceptible than man to the influences internal and external which throw reason off the hinges . But the difference here , which can not be measured by the case-statistics of hysteria or by any other exact and trustworthy evidence , does not in itself constitute a very wide chasm between the sexes . Men and women are only to a limited degree rational and logical beings . In practical life normal people go about their business and pleasure , guided and controlled to some extent by reason but to a greater extent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilfulness , and other motives . Every woman can afford to smile when she recalls the irrational acts and wrong-headed arguments of her oldest male child . It is when in all seriousness the reasoning faculty is especially called upon , when serenity , coolness of judgment , sustained ratiocination are demanded , that woman is appreciably weaker than man . That is ail . And that all is much or little as you happen to think , as you happen to be a man or a woman . A friend who has read this article says , " Well , old man , it is pretty fair , butin one or two places you babble away like an old woman . " I thank him for the suggestion . The history of human thought , true and fallacious , is to be found in the uses of words . " Old man " as a vocative is almost always a term of affection . " Old woman " in its metaphorical uses is almost always ? clyslogistic.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
