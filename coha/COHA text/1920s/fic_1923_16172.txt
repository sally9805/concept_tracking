You did not come . &nbsp; JOHNBut I told you that something had happened to prevent it that night . My father died . &nbsp; MARIEBut I did not know that .

And I could not go back to my own home after my father had locked me out . It was not home anyhow after mother died So I took the train and came to Paris . You know the rest .

You are not this woman of whom all Paris is talking . ( During his speech , Marie is very much moved and apparently weakening Marriage and a home would appeal to her . John has his arms about her pleading and she is just about to turn to him when the doorbell rings and breaks the spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pierre calling to take me home . Home ? ( John opens door and Pierre enters . He is a dapper sort of figure dressed in the height of fashion , rather patronizing ) &nbsp; PIERRE ( Looking at portrait ) Ah yes , quite good .

But she will pay . &nbsp; PIERREPlease be calm . &nbsp; MOTHERI 'll fix her ( Goes to curtain and flings it aside showing Marie sobbing as she lies across boy 's dead boy .

I 'll attend to the police . &nbsp; MARIEI am going , for good . &nbsp; PIERREWhere ? &nbsp; MARIEAnywhere to get away from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to change it all .
