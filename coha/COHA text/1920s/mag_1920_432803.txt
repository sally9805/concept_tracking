MORNING works is done ? and some more already too . There is enough bark in for to-day and to-morrow . And many kindlings are now in on the floor by the big wood-box . I had my dinner at the noontime and I went into the barn . There were little sad sounds in the stall . It was the moos of Mathilde Plantagenet . Now I have thinks her moos were moos for some dinner at noontime . She has breakfast at morningtime and supper she has at graylight-time . But when noontime is come Mathilde Plantagenet is here in the barn , and her mother , the gentle Jersey cow , is away out in the pasture . I have thinks there is needs for me to take Mathilde Plantagenet from the barn to the pasture at noontimes , so she may have her dinner . I go now to so do . I did give the latch of the barn door a slip back . Then I led Mathilde Plantagenet out by the little rope I did use to use to lead Elizabeth Barrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went our way to the pasture . bars . I did give to one a push , and it made a drop down . Then I gave two more pushes and they went drop downs . We went on through in between . It took a more long time to fix up the pasture-bar . They have so heavy feels when I go to put them back again . When I did have them so put , see made a go on . We did not have goes far , for the gentle Jersey cow bad sees of ourcoming and she came to meet us . We was glad to have it so . I have thinks Mathilde Plantagenet did have most joy feels about it . She did stari to get her dinner from her Mother in a quick way . Seeing her have her dinner from her mother a long time before supper-time did make me to have such it big amount of satisfaction feels . The grandpa felt not so . There was disturbs on his temper . He was at our house when I was come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mamma did spank me some and some more . Now I linen wonders why was it the grandpa felt not satisfaction feels at Mathilde Plantagenet having her dinner near noontime just like most all other children . After the mamma did spank me , she told me more works to do , and she went with her father to the ranch-house to see her mother that was newly come back from the null town where she did go early on this morning . When the more works was done , I went in a quick soft way to the woods . I made little hops over the bushes ? the little bushes ? as I did go along . I went along the path until I came near tune , the way that does lead to the big old log whore is the moss-box . I hid behind a tree when I was almost come there . I so did to wait a wait to see if the fairies were near about . I had not seeing of one about the moss-box . I looked looks about . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned a big piece of bark over . Under it was something between two layers of moss , tied up with a pink ribbon . I felt glad feels . When I did untie the pink ribbon around the moss , there was lots more of pink ribbons . They did have little cards , and the little card on a nice long piece of pink ribbon said ' For Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus . ' Another card on a more long piece did say ' For William Shakespeare . ' Another card on a more short piece did say For Lars Porsena of Clusium ' ; and there was a ribbon for Brave Horatius and Isaiah and Elizabeth Barrett Browning and for Mathilde Plantagenet ; and there was more . I did take them all in my arms , and I did go to the mill in the far woods . I so went to show all those pretty pink ribbons to the man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice . I did show him all the cards that was on them . He was glad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and I ? we do believe in fairies . Near him to-day was working the man of the long step that whistles most all of the time . He is a man with an understanding soul . When Brave Horatius did get Isis leg hurt the other day , this man did wash it and mentholatum it and lie wrapped his handkerchief in rounds around it . Brave Horatius has likes for him , too . To-day when I did show to the man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice all the pink ribbons the fairies did bring , he did say he thought the other man would like to see Brave Horatius 's new pink ribbon that he was going to wear to cathedral service come a Sunday . And he did have likes to see it . When I told him how it was brought by the fairies to the moss-box by the old log , he said , ' By golly ? that 's fine . ' And the man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice gave me pats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box where I do keep things in the woods . Now I go to talk with the willows where Nonette flows . I am going to tell them about this being the borning day of Queen Elizabeth of York in 1465 . Then I am going goes to tell William Shakespeare and Lars Porsena of Clusium about it . I got Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus , and we went to the woods . Brave Horatius did come afollowing after . And Louis II , le Grand Conde , did ride in the sleeve of my warm red dress . As we did go along , the leaves of salal did make little rustles . They were little askings . They had wants to know what day this was . I made stops along the way to tell them it was the going-away day of Gentile Bellini in 1507 and Sir Joshua Reynolds in 179g and John Keats in 1821 , and the horning day of George Frederick Handel in 1685 . I have thinks they and the tall fir trees were glad to know . Brave Horatius barked a bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if we were coming . Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus did cuddle up more close in my arms . We saw six birds and I did sing to Brave Horatius the bird-song of grandpere of roitelet and ortolan and truant and etatemeau and rossignol and tourterelle and draine and peiche and cygne and hirondelle and aigle and ramier and tarin and roueserolle and emerillon and sittelle . Brave Horatius and William Shakespeare do have likes for that song . Sometimes I do sing it to them four times a day . We all did go on until we were come near to where were two men of the mill by the far woods . They were making divides of a very large log . They were making it to be many short logs . There was a big saw going moves between . One man did push it and one man did pull it . I went on . I did look a look back . I had sees there was a tall fern growing by the foot of one man , and he did have his new overalls cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it is the lumber-camp folk do cut off their overalls where they do meet the boots . When they so cut them they get fringy ? and such fringes are more long than other fringes . I wonder why it is they so cut them ? it maybe is because they so want fringes about the edge of the legs of their overalls . I would have prefers for ruffles . We did go on . We went a little way on and we had sees of more folks of the camp by the mill by the far woods . I did make a climb upon an old tree-root to have sees of them at work . Brave Horatius made a jump up , and he came in a walk over to where me and Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus were sitting . We had seeing of them all working . I have thinks the folks that live in the lumber camps , they are kindly folks . When they come home from work at eventime , I do so like to sit on a stump and watch them go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry their dinner-pails in their hands . And some do whistle as they come . And some do talk . And some that do see me sitting on the stump do come aside and give to me the scraps in their dinner-pails . Some have knowing of the needs I do have for scraps in the nursery and the hospital . And too , when they come home from work in the far woods , the men do bring bits of moss and nice velvet caterpillars and little rocks . Some do . And these they give to me for my nature collections . And I feel joy feels all over . Brave Horatius does bark joy barks . He does know and I do know , the folks that live in the lum. her camps , they are kindly folks . Most all this afternoon time I have been out in the field ? the one that is nearest unto the woods . I have been having talks with William Shakespeare . To-day he is not working in the woods with the other horses . He is having a rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altars I have banded for Saint Louis . He did lay there all of the afternoon . Tiredness was upon him I gave his nose rubs ? and his neck and ears , too . And I did tell him poems and sing him songs . He has likes for me to so do . After I did sing to him , more sleeps did come upon him . The breaths he did breathe while he was going to sleep ? they were such long breaths . And I gave unto him more pats on the nose and pats on the neck . We are chums , William Shakespeare and nse This evening I will come again to wake him . I 'll come just before supper-time , so he may go in with the other horses to eat his supper in the barn . I did . Sleeps was yet upon him . He looked so tired lying there . I went up to pat his front leg , but it was stiff . I patted him on the nose ? and his nose , it was so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said again , ' William // Shakespeare , do n't you hear me calling ? ' but he did not answer . I have thinks he is having a long rest , so he will have ready feels to pull the heavy poles on to-morrow . I now go goes to tell the man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice about William Shakespeare having all this rest day , and how he has sleeps in the field with the pink ribbon around his neck that Me fairies did bring . Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus is going goes with me . We will wait on the stump by that path he does follow when he comes home from work at eventime . We are come back . The man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice did go with us to see William Shakespeare having his long sleep there in the field by the altar of Saint Louis . Now I do have understanding . My dear William Shakespeare will no more have wake-ups again . Rob Ryder can not give him whippings no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long sleep . He just had goes because tired feels was upon him . I have so lonesome feels for him , but I am glad that Rob Ryder can not whip him now no more . I have covered him over with leaves . To find enough I went to the far end of the near woods . I gathered them into my apron . Sometimes I could hardly see my way because I just could not keep from crying . I have such lonesome feels . William Shakespeare did have an understanding soul . And I have knows his soul will not have forgets of the willows by the singing creek . Often I will leave a message there on a leaf for him . I have thinks his soul is not far gone away . There are little blue flews a-blooming where he did lay him down to sleep . To-day we did christen Solomon Grundy . He was honied a week ago yesterday on Monday . That 's why we did name him Solomon Grundy . And this being Tuesday , we did christen him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children about Solomon Grundy being christened on Tuesday . Yesterday I made him a christening robe out of a new dish-towel that was flapping in the wind . But the aunt had no appreciation of the great need of a christening robe for Solomon Grundy . And my ears were slapped until I thought my head would pop open , but it did n't . It just ached . Last night when I went to bed I prayed for the ache to go away . This morning , when I woke up , it had gone out the window . I did feel good feels from my nightcap to my toes . I thought about the christening , and early on this morning , before I yet did eat my breakfast , I went out the window that the ache went out in the night . I went from the window to the pig-pen . I climbed into the pig-pen . I crawled on my hands and knees back under the shed where he and his sisters five and his little brother were all having breakfast from their mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from among all those dear baby-pigs , him who had the most curl in his tail . I took him to the pump and pumped water on him to get every speck of dirt off . He squealed because the water was cold . So I took some of the warm water the mamma was going to wash the milkpans in , and I did give him a warm bath in the wash-pan . Then he was the pinkiest white pig you ever saw . I took the baby 's talcum-powder can and I shook it lots of times all over him . When the powder sprinkled in his eyes he did object with a regular baby-pig squeak . And I climbed right out the bedroom window with him , because the mamma heard his squeak and she was coming fast . I did go to the barn in a hurry , for in the barn yesterday I did hide the christening robe . When . I reached the top of the hay I stopped to put it on Solomon Grundy . Then we proceeded to the cathedral . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horning day of him I did ask that grand fir tree , Good King Edward I , to be his god-father . And that smaller fir tree growing by his side ? the lovely Queen Eleanor of Castile ? I did ask to be his godmother . We went aside from the path that leads unto the cathedral . We went another way . We went adown the lane to where dwell Good King Edward I and the lovely Queen Eleanor . And there beside them Solomon Grundy was christened . They who were present at the christening were these ? Saint Louis and Charlemagne and Hugh Comet and King Alfred and Theodere Rooseveltand William Wordsworth and Homer and Cicero and BraveHoratius and Isaiah . These last two did arrive in a hurry in the midst of the service . Being dogs with understanding souls , they did realize the sacredness of the occasion , and they stood silent near Charlemagne . When we got most to the end of the service , just at that very solemn moment while I was waiting for Good King Edward and his lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white head of the babe , he gave a squeal ? just the kind of a squeal all baby-pigs give when they are wanting their dinner . After the naming of him , I placed around his neck a little wreath that I made in the evening yesterday for him . Then I did sing softly a hymn to the morning and came again home to the pig-pen with Solomon Grundy . When I got to the corner of the barn , I pulled off his christening robe . I did hide it again in the hay . Then I climbed into the pig-pen . I did say the Lord 's prayer softly over the head of Solomon Grundy . After I said Amen I did poke him in among all his sisters and near unto his mother . Aphrodite gave a grunt of satisfaction ; also did Solomon Grundy . I went to the house . I climbed in the window again . I took off my nightcap and my nightgown . I did get dressed in a quick way . The little girl was romping in the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went to the kitchen for our breakfast . The mamma was in the cellar . She did hear me come into the kitchen . She came in . With her came a kindling and a hazel switch . After she did spank me , she told me to get the mush for the little girl 's breakfast . It was in a kettle . I spooned it out into a blue dish that came as premium in the box of mush when they brought it new from the mill town . After we did eat our mush and drink our milk , the mamma told me to clear the table and go tend chickens . I carried feed to them . I scattered it in shakes . The chickens cause in a quick way .. Fifteen of those chickens I did give names to , but it 's hard to tell some of them apart . Most of them have about the same number of speckles on them . I counted all the chickens that were there . There were n't as many there as ought to be there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken-house . I went in . I lifted them off . They were fidgety and fluff , ) and ducky . I did carry them out to the feed . While they were eating breakfast I counted their eggs . I made a discovery . Minerva had n't as many eggs as the others . That meant she would n't have as many children as the others would have . I did begin to feel sorry about that , because already I had picked out names for her fifteen children and there in her nest them were only twelve eggs . I did n't know what to do , and then I had a think what to do . I did it . I took an egg from each nest of the three other setting That fixed things . Then I thought I would go on an exploration trip and to the nursery , and there I would give the folks a talk on geology . But then the manuna called me to scour the pots and pans . That is something I do not like to do at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep saying lovely verses ? that helps so much ? and by-and-by the pots and pans are all clean . After that all day the mamma did have works for me to do . There was more wood to bring in . There was steps to scrub . There was cream to be slaked into butter . There was raking to do in the yard . There was carpet-strings to sew together . In-between times there was the baby to tend . And all the time all day long I did have longings to go on exploration trips . The fields were calling . The woods were calling . I heard the wind . He was making music in the forest . It was soft music ; it was low . It was an echo of the songs the flowers were singing . Even if there was much works to do , hearing the voices helped me to get the works done in the way they ought to be done . The most hurry time of all was the time near eventime , for there was going to be company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry to get sapper . So I helped her . She only had time to give one shake of salt to the potatoes , so I gave them three more . She did not have time to put sauce on the peas , so I flavored them with lemon extract , for the mamma is so fond of lemon flavoring in lemon pies . When she made the biscuits , she was in such a hurry she forgot to set them on a box back of the stove for an airing , as usual , before putting them in the oven . Being as she forgot to do it , while she was in the cellar to get the butter , I did take the pan of biscuits out of the oven and put them under the stove no they would not miss their usual airing . Then I did go to the wood-shed for more wood . When I did put it in the wood-box the mamma reached over for me . She shook me . She spanked me with her hand and the hair-brush and the pancake-turner . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to get out and stay out of her way . I came here to the barn . I sit here printing . In-between times I stretch out on the hay . I feel tired and sore all over . I wonder for what it was the mamma gave me that spanking . I have tried so hard to help her to-day . Solomon Grundy is grunting here beside me . I went by and got him as I came along . Here on the hay I showed to him the writings in the two books my Angel Father and Angel Mother made for me . These books are such a comfort , and when I have them right along with me , Angel Father and Angel Mother do seem nearer . I did bow my head and ask my guardian angel to tell them there in heaven about Solomon Grundy being christened to-day . Then I drew him up closer to my gingham apron and I patted him often . And some of the pats I gave to him were for the lovely Peter Paul Rubens that used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer he snuggled up beside me . To-night I shall sing to him a lullaby song as I cuddle him up all snowy white in his christening robe before I take him out to his mother Aphrodite in the pig-pen . I now have a bottle with a nipple on it for Solomon Grundy . But he wo n't pay much attention to it . He has prefers to get his dinner from his mother Aphrodite out in the pig-pen . After he so did have his dinner today , and after my morning works were done and I did have that hen started on a set . That hen had wants to set so much , I did have an awful time getting her off the nest at feeding-time . I had thinks I would set her myself , being as the mamma does n't want to bother about it . I had thinks I would put three eggs under her to-day and three more when comes to-morrow and three on the next day and three on the next . That will give her a good setting of eggs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her started on a set with three eggs , then I went to visit Dear Love . I did cuddle up Solomon Grundy in one arm and Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus in the other arm . And so we went to visit Dear Love . Solomon Grundy wore his christening robe and he looked very sweet in it . I gave him a nice warm bath before we did start so as to get all the pig-pen smells off . Sometimes smells do get in that pig-pen though I do give it brush-outs every day , and I do carry old leaves and bracken ferns and straws in for beds for Aphrodite . After I did give Solomon Grundy his bath I did dust talcum powder over him . I was real careful not to get any in his eyes . As we did go along I did sing to them a lullaby about Nonette and Saint Firmin , and more I did sing about Imouaddy . We went on . Then I did tell them about the beautiful love the man of the long step that whistles most all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-away look in her eyes . But he is afraid to tell her about it ? Sadie McKfrizie says he is . Sadie McKinzie says he is a very shy man . Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus did go to sleeps while I was telling them about it , and Solomon Grundy did grunt a little grunt . It was a grunt for more songs . So I did sing to him , ' Did he smile , his work to see ? Did he who made the lamb make thee ? ' He had likes for that song and he grunted a grunt with a question in it . So I did sing him some more : Indeed he did , Solomon Grundy , indeed he did . And the hairs of thy baby head ? they are numbered . ' Soon I shall be counting them to see how many they are . To-day was a very stormy day ? more rainy than other stormy days . So we had cathedral service on the hay in the barn . Mathilde Plantagenet was below us in her stall , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plato and Pliny , the two bats , hung on the rafters in a dark corner . Lam Per . sena of elusion/ perched on the back of Brave Horatius . Thomas Chatterton Jupiter Zeus sat at my feet and munched leaves while I said prayers . Lucian Horace Ovid Virgil was on my right shoulder , and Louis II , le Grande Conde , was on my left shoulder ? part of the time . Then he did crawl in my sleeve to have a sleep . Solomon Grundy was asleep by my side in his christening robe ? and a sweet picture he was in it . On my other side was his little sister Anthonya Mundy , who has not got as much curl in her tail as Solomon Grundy . Clementine , the Plymouth Rock hen , was late come to service . She came up from the stall of the gentle Jersey cow just when I was through singing 11o. sanna in excelsis . ' She came and perch ? ed on the back of Brave Horatiusback of Lars Porsena of Clusium . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he so did , Clementine tumbled off his back . She came over by me . I had thinks it would ? he nice if her pretty gray feathers was blue . I gave her a gentle pat and then I did begin the talk service . I did use for my text Blessed be the pure in heart , for they shall see God . ' And all of the time the raindrops did make little joy patters on the roof . They was coming down from the sky in a quick way . To-day I went not to school . For a long time after breakfast the mamma did have me to cut potatoes into pieces . To-night and to-morrow night the grown-ups will plant the pieces of potatoes I cut to-day . Then by-and-by -- after some long time ? the pieces of potato with eyes on them will have baby potatoes under the ground . Up above the ground they will be growing leaves and flowers . One must leave an eye on every piece of potato one plants in the ground to grow . It wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to grow without its eye . All day to-day I did be careful to leave an eye on every piece . And I did have meditations about what things the eyes of potatoes do see there in the ground . I have thinks they do have seeing of black velvet moles and large earthworms that do get short in a quick way . And potato flowers above the ground do see the doings of the field ? and maybe they do look away and see the willows that grow by the singing creek . I do wonder if potato-plants do have longings to dabble their toes . I have supposes they do , just like I do . Being a potato must be interest ? specially the having so many eyes . I have longings for more eyes . There is so much to see in this world all about . Every day I do see beautiful things everywhere I do go . To-day it was near eventime ? the time I did have all those potatoes ready for plants . Then I did go to see Solomon Grundy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron pocket for his dear mother , Aphrodite . She had appreciations and well looks . But the looks of Solomon Grundy ? they were not well looks . He did lay so still in a quiet way . I gave to him three looks . I felt a lump come in my throat . His boks they were so different . I made a run for the wood-box ? the wood-box I did bring before for the getting-in of Brave Horatius to service in the pig-pen . I did step on it in getting Solomon Grundy out of the pigpen . I did have fears if I did it in jumps as I always do , the jumps might bother the feelings of Solomon Grundy . So I did have needs for that box . It is such a help . Every time I do get a place fixed in the pig-pen so some of the pigs can get out to go to walks and to go to the cathedral service , the grown-ups at the ranch-house do always fix the boards back again . So a box is helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the top . When I did have Solomon Grundy over the top , I did cuddle him up in my gray calico apron . I have thinks he does like the blue one best . But to-day he had not seeings it was n't the blue one I had on . He did not give his baby squeaks . He was only stillness . I did have fears that sickness was upon him . He has lost that piece of asafiditee I did tie around his neck the other day . That was the last piece I did have . It was the little piece that was left of the big piece that the mamma did tie around my neck , and I did make divides with my friends . But Solomon Grundy ? he has lost his share both times . He does lose it in a quick way . And I did have no Castoria to give him , because the mamma has gone and put away the baby 's bottle of Castoria where I can not find it . I did not have knowings what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice would have knowings what to do for the sickness of Solomon Grundy . I made starts to the mill by the far woods . Brave Horatius was waiting at the barn . He gave his tail two wags and followed after . We went by Michael Angelo Sanzio Raphael . I did tell him the baby in my arms was sick . I said a little prayer over his head . We went along the lane . When we were come to Good King Edward I and lovely Queen Eleanor , we made stops . I did tell them of the sickness of the baby . I said a little prayer for his getting well . And I did hold him up for their blessing . Then we went on and Brave Horatius came a-following after . When we were come to the ending of the lane , I said another little prayer . When we were come near unto the altar of Good King Edward I , I said another little prayer . Then we went on . Elizabeth Barrett Browning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She mostly does so . And we went on . By-and-by my arms was getting tired . Solomon Grundy , now that he is older grown , does get a little heavy when I carry him quite a long ways . When I was come to the far end of the near woods I met the man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice . He smiled the gentle smile he always does smile , and he took Solomon Grundy into his arms . I have thinks he did see the tiredness that was in my arms . When he sat down on a log with the dear pig I said I had fears Solomon Grundy was sick . He said he did too . But he smoothed my curls back , and he said , Do n't you worry ; he will get well . ' Hearing him say that made me have better feels . Men are such a comfort ? men that wear gray neckties and are kind to mice . One I know . He looks kind looks upon the forest and he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen him stretch out his arms to them just like I do do in the cathedral . He does have kindness for the little folks that do live about the grand trees . His ways are ways of gentleness . All my friends have likes for him , and so has Solomon Grundy . To-day he said he would take Solomon Grundy back to camp by the mill to his bunkhouse . A warming he did need , so he said , and he said he would wrap him in his blanket and take care of him until morningtime was come . Then he did go the way that goes to the far woods and I did go the way that does go to the cathedral . I so went to have a little thank service for the getting well of Solomon Grundy . I do have know . lags he will be well when morningtime is come . With me to the cathedral did go Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Brave Horatius . My legs do feel some tired this even . time . I 've been most everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the plant-folks and the flower-folks and the birds about this day being the going-away day of one William Shakes . peare in 1616 . Before yet breakfast . time was come I did go to the cathedral to say prayers of thanks for all the writings he did write . With me did go Brave Horatius and Lars Porsena of Clusium and ThoMas Chatterton is. piter Zeus and Lucian Horace Ovid Virgil . When we were come again to the house , they did wait waits while I did go to do the morning works . After the morning works were done , I did put pieces of bread and butter in papers in my pockets for all of us . I put some milk in the bottle for Memo-der Euripides Theocritus Thucydide , He was waiting waits for me by the pasture-bar . He is a most woolly lamb . He was glad for his breakfast and he was glad to have knows about this day . While I was telling them all there what day this is , Plutarch Demosthenes made a little jump on to a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump-off . Sophocles Diogenes came a-following after . They both did make some more jumps . Their ways are ways of playfulness . They are dear lambs . While I was telling them all , Menander Euripides Theocritus Thu . cydides did in some way get the nipple oft ' his bottle , and the rest of the milk did spill itself out the bottle . I hid the bottle away by a rock . Menander Euripides Theocritus Thucydides did follow after me . He does follow an many wheres I do go to . We all went on . We saw fleurs , and I did stop moments to have talks with them . I looked for other fleurs that I had longs to see : Everywhere that we did go I did look looks for teverin and yellow Moire and pink mahonille and 111471110 and morgeline and herissone . When Brave Horatius had askings in his eyes for what I was looking , I did give to him explanations . He looked looks hack at me from his gentle eyes . In his looks he did say , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to font d'Ermenonvilleand for &; de Chantilly . We went admit Lounette to where it flows into Nonette ? and we went on . Everywhere there were little whisperings of earth-voices . They all did say of the writes of William Shakespeare . And there were more talkings . I laid my ear close to the earth where the grasses grew close together . I did listen . The wind made ripples on the grass as it went over . There were voices from out the earth . And the things of their saying were the things of gladness of growing . And there was music . And in the music there was sky twinkles and earth tinkles . That was come of the joy of living . I have thinks all the grasses growing there did feel glad feels from the tips of their green arms to their toe roots in the ground . And Brave Horatius and the rest of us did n't get home until after supper-time . The folks was gone to the house of Elsie . I made a hunt for some supper for Brave Horatius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special dish . Then I came again into the house to get some bread and milk . There was a jar of blackberry jam on the cook-table . It had interest looks . Just when I happened to be having all my fingers in the jar of blackberry jam , there was rumblings of distress come from the back yard . I climbed on to the flour-barrel and looked a look out the window . There near to to my churn 's special supper-dish sat the pet crow with top-heavy appears . There was reasons for his forlorn looks , for Brave Horatius had advanced to the rear of Lars Porsena of Clusium and pulled out his tail-feathers . I have had no case like this before . I felt disturbs . I had not knowings what to do for it . I had some bandages and some metholatum in my pocket . I took Lars Porsena of Clusium ? all that was left of him with his tail-feathers gone ? and I sat down on the steps . First I took some mentholatum and put it on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lars Porsena of Clusium where his tail-feathers did come out . Then I did take the long white bandage in the middle , and I did wrap it about Lars Porsena of Clusium from back to front . ? in under his wings and twice on top , so the bandage would stay in place on the end of him where his tail-feathers came out . Then I did make a start to the hospital . I did have wonders how long the needs would be for Lars Persona of Clusium to be there before his tail would grow well again . I only did have going a little way when I did meet with the man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice . He looked a look at me and he looked a look at Lars Porsena of Clusium in my arms . Then he did have askings why was it Lars Porsena was in bandages . I told him explanations all about it . He pondered on the matter . Then he picked me and Lars Porsena up and set us down on a stump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wonders about how long the need would be for Lars Porsena of Clusium to be in the hospital with bandages on him . He did talk on in his gentle way , of how it is birds that do lose their tail-feathers do grow them on again . He so said and I did have understanding . Then he did take up Lars Porsena of Clusium in his arms . And he unwrapped him from front to back and back to front . When the bandage was all off him , Lam Porsena of Cluslum did give himself a stretch and his wings a little shake . And I said a little prayer for his getting well and a new tail soon . And the man that wears gray neckties and is kind to mice said Amen . Then we came home .
