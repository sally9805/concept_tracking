From Cleveland to Rochester went troupers of the Metropolitan Opera Company last week , gave there their two last performances of the season-Rigoletto with Marion Talley , and Tosca with Florence Easton . At their hotel Miss Talley and her practical mother greeted eager reporters with a cable just received from Emma Calv , retired prima donna who , according to European reports , had presumed to censure the system that would permit such a premature Metropolitan debut as Miss Talley 's and the publicity that attended it . Said the cable : <P> " Statements in newspapers attributed to me utterly untrue . Never made any such comments . Accept my cordial congratulations . "
