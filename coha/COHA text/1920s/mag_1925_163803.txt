The past week in the court martial of Colonel William Mitchell ( TIME , Nov 9 et seq. ) was spent in taking the prosecution 's rebuttal testimony . Several naval officers were called as witnesses to answer the testimony of Colonel Mitchell 's witnesses who had supported the charges for the making of which the Colonel is on trial . <P> Commander John Rodgers , Commander of the PN9 No. 1 , which made the attempted flight to Hawaii , declared that the arrangements for the flight were satisfactory , and blamed an error in bearings or a possible error in navigation as the cause of the failure of the flight . <P> Lieutenant Commander R. E. Byrd , who commanded the naval planes which accompanied the Mac-Millan Arctic expedition , said that these planes were fit for service and were the best equipment to be had for the purpose . <P> Several officers who served aboard the ill-fated Shenandoah testified that the fatal flight was voluntarily undertaken , that the ship was in good condition , and that they did not regard it as unfit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War College in Newport , declared that in his opinion the air policy of the Navy Department was intelligent and sound . <P> Rear Admiral Edward W. Eberle , Chief of Naval Operations , denied that Commander Lansdowne had protested against sending the Shenandoah overland ; declared that he had consulted with the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Aeronautics and Commander Lansdowne before ordering the flight , had given orders that naval officers should use their own judgment in making flights . He said further that the Shenandoah was not sent on a propaganda mission but was on a training flight , since the ship might at any time have been compelled to fly overland from coast to coast for military purposes . <P> The usual bickering of counsel continued .
