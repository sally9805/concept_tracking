The tilt of the Brown Derby grew more and more confident last week , and with reason . <P> Ohio held a Democratic primary and instructed its 48 delegates for Favorite Son Pomerene . But voters in three-fourths of the districts expressed preferences as follows : Smith , 32,694 ; Pomerene , 9,588 ; Donahey , 5,271 ; Reed , 432 ; Walsh , 151 ; McAdoo , 37 . Favorite Son Pomerene was reported as seeing no reason why his delegates should not vote for Candidate Smith on the first ballot . <P> Pennsylvania held a primary and elected 76 delegates without instructing them . About 66 were conceded to Candidate Smith . <P> C. Massachusetts held a primary and there was no question but that the 36 delegates elected were Candidate Smith 's to a man . Not a few Republicans wrote " Smith " on their ballots . <P> Alaska Democrats instructed their six delegates for Candidate Smith . <P> Kansas Democrats , supposedly friendly to Candidate Reed , unexpectedly instructed their 20 delegates for U. S. Representative William A Ayres of Wichita . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted the naming of Candidate Ayres as a move to let Kansas clamber gracefully aboard the Smith bandwagon . <P> Adding everything up , experts announced the standing of Democratic candidates and delegates , as of last weekend , as follows : Smith , 492 ; Reed , 36 ; George , 28 ; Hitchcock , 16 ; Ayres , 20 . <P> Believing his delegate-strength was even greater than impartial experts said , anticipating a crucial victory in California 's primary on May Day , Candidate Smith inspected his campaign headquarters at the Hotel Biltmore , Manhattan , and approved the selection of George R. Van Namee as his pre-convention manager . Mr. Van Namee , a slightly bald , wholly businesslike , - most amiable Cornell graduate ( Class of 1901 ) , used to be Governor Smith 's secretary . Before that , when Smith was Democratic leader and Speaker of the New York Assembly , Mr. Van Namee was his familiar and chief clerk . In 1920 and again in 1923 , Governor Smith appointed him to the Public Service Commission . Than George R. Van Namee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is about the Brown Derby , and under it , that wins votes . <P> Manager Van Namee soon assembled a squad of polite gentlemen and young ladies to write letters , answer telephones , receive callers . Soon monster posters of the Candidate , which made him look more like an advertisement for cold cream and collars than like a Presidential aspirant , were hung upon the walls . Typical of the conversation which buzzed in the Van Namee offices was a spirited debate over when the brown derby hats should be handed out to the convention delegates , before or after the nomination . <P> " Before , I tell you , before . That 'll get - em going and make it unanimous ! " <P> ' ' After , I tell you , afterwards . If we pass ' em out before they 'll call it bribery ! " <P> The tilt of the Brown Derby was confident . ,
