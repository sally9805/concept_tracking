0TTO KAHN 'S interest in art and artists is , after all , his interest in himself . If he feels ? he is so courteous a gentleman  --  that you want him to speak of Service or similar large-so-unding subjects , he will do so . And without hypocrisy , even if without too great self-knowledge . But Service and Power and all the other high-pitched capital words are not the key to the matter . Kahn is an artist of a kind , and he loves his kind . If you would see him clear , then , you must begin by piercing such obstructions as the Opera , the old New and the new Little Theaters , foreign decorations , banking and the chorus of courtship forever chanted to Wealth . These are not alien excrescences upon the man ; but they too are not the essence . You must forget as well the country estates , the private golf-links , even the town residence , cold and unreal as a museum . Remote from the chilly marble stairs , you come upon a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting by Botticelli on the wall ; the other is a low-lying log in the hearth . Otto Kahn stands at the tea-table . It is the end of the day  --  the intermission between the day of the banker and the night of the patron , He pours himself a cup of tea which he forgets to drink . Be spreads thick jam on thin toast , and this he eats with school-boy relish . His face is a boy 's ; but no lad has this ease . The gray of his hair suggests a careful elegance , rather than his age , The rose in the lapel is fresh , although the day is old . And Otto Kahn is fresh . He seems strange to this pompous house ; strange to the formidable world of Money which he must , after all , have mastered in order to he able to play the pleasant lavish game that he has made of his life . If he talks " seriously " , the chasm grows between this amiable utterer of words and what you know he is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " ideas " ? If you examine these hands while he is talking , he will instinctively hide them in his pockets . There is in his smile a kind of pleading  --  for what ? in his firm eyes a modesty  --  toward whom ? But now , his subject grips him . It is " ideas " no longer . He talks of life . The boy hands clench ; the body is harder . The open face loses its genial and generous inquiry ? becomes sensual , ruthless . Here , where was an actor in a stylish game , is a man monstrous in self-absorption . You begin to understand the many mansions , the many theaters . It is a complex world in which Kahn moves ; and himself as complex as his world . He is fond of telling a tale of his beginning . Forty years ago , he was a clerk in a banking house in Carlsruhe . There were stamps quite literally to be licked and to be stuck on envelopes . Kahn licked more stamps and pasted them more neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the Head of Kuhn , Loeb and the Maecenas of our Rome " . Kahn misses the point of his tale . This is no efficiency-confession for the American Magazine . In licking stamps , Otto Kahn was not more industrious , not more intelligent , than the others : he was more artistic . The key to the man is a virtuosic grace . Grace of harmony and of athomeness . Through the Wall Street canyon , Kahn blows like a zephyr . Under the looming granite walls , he walks with round cheeks . Our world is a delirium of electric blares : Kahn 's eyes twinkle . Our world is a holocaust of dying civilizations , dead millions : Kahn knows not of death , he is a happy lover , lyrical and unattached . Accident , then  --  irony ? his high position in this self-same world ? Not a bit of it . We 've got the world wrong . Kahn is a better guide than all the statistics and all the realistic novels and all the communist cartoons . Kahn who is canny and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd and immature  --  Kahn who is so good at life , and who discussing what he is and does  --  can talk such unimaginable nonsense . Like the tight rose-bud that tips his morning coat , he doth tip Wall Street . But no . The analogy is bad , It takes a valet and a florist to select the sparkling boutonniere . This is artifice . One can , with violent effort , picture Otto Kahn without his rose-bud . But the man himself is integral of our age . Cut Kahn off and you would at once see this romantic childish monster known as the Age of International Finance grow another Kahn to take his place . Most men who achieve power do so by laborious study of the world they aim to conquer , and by ruthless excision of those traits in themselves which do not chime with their world . Not Kahn . He had at the outset the qualities , the appetites , the vices to make him what he is . That is why his face reveals no struggle . That is why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was twenty-five : I hope I am not much wiser . " He is not much wiser . He ignores the wisdom which he does not need . That is why he is seldom tired , seldom nervous , usually happy . He is at no odds with himself . He is this dapper , personable gentleman  --  so full of individual judgments and tastes and traits ; and ways of talking and ways of enjoying life . And yet , deeply , he is no individual at all : he is a swift and lyric symbol of the world he thinks he has conquered , He is an element of modern life . He is fate for once smiling and having a whale of a time . His story is soon told . Born in Mannheim he took to banking , as a duck to water . He learned English and finance in London . Ere he was thirty he was himself , in New York . He married into the Kuhn , Loeb clan . In 1897 , the austere Jacob Schiff , head of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in facts , believer above all in the eternal warfare between the world and the Jew , looked at this junior partner , new as a sunrise , and had a revelation of the passing of his ancient world  --  of the advent of an era that was to sweep , in a parabola of brilliance , beyond the realms of his eye . And Otto Kahn proceeded to express himself . This strict self expression was to be a conspicuous part in the expression of our age . But Kahn did not reason it out  --  not till after the fact . He had selected a career ludicrously well-paid beyond the common measure . He grew rich . He did not grow deluded . Money freed him ; and Otto Kahn was occasionally sorry that he had no God to thank . But he refused to be shackled by his wealth . Money is after all a circulation of the blood in the social body . It should be . It was , and is , in the youthful life of Otto Kahn . It flows : it induces no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good " . And so he spends a nickel every morning , to get from his residence at Fifth Avenue and Ninety-first Street to his office at ' William and Wall . He takes the subway . He chooses this daily bath in the populous current because he likes currents  --  because he loves circulations . For a similar reason , he braves the benches of the Provincetown Theatre ; careers through mixed companies of men , women , girls , drinking the effervescent wine of their unbottled youth . He enjoys this . He does what he enjoys . He dictates , probably , more personal letters every day than any other large man of affairs in a week . He is in touch with the romantic , ribald anarchists of art . Perhaps , they make pictures and music no one understands : at least they 're alive . Kahn flows through a processional of contacts . He needs no intimate friends , and he has none . There are too many thrilling heirts about , for single-hearted devotions . What he loves in this pageantry of life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . If you could take a slow moving picture of Kahn 's intricate day , you would be amazed at its grace . Gesture , posture , word and act melt into a unitary flow . The man is currency , too : chemic currency like the instinctive life of a flower . So he has blossomed , so he will fade . Quietly , pleasantly , resigned . And all the rest of him is accessory . Of course , he makes innumerable speeches ; he has even written hooks for which such prime fellow-virtuosi as Theodore Roosevelt wrote laudatory introductions . Of course , he discusses high topics  --  Finance , Politics , the Future of Jazz . It 's part of the delicious game . Part of it , too , to be a little taken in while one plays it . But Kahn is not taken in very deeply . The mechanism of a vast banking house requires a brain for running . Kahn has that kind of brain . Banking is a social mechanism . The banker needs a mechanic 's brain . Like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finite forces  --  Kahn 's brain is a machine . It has the limitations of a machine . As brains go in a world of philosophers , scientists and poets , the mechanic 's brain is not of a high order . But this brain , explaining the wealth of Otto Kahn , does not explain the man . A subtle , dynamic nostalgia moves Kahn into those very realms from which his technical mind would seem to bar him . It is not true that Kahn can give mere cash to artists . He has a restless conscience . He is pitifully moved by spiritual effort in these realms beyond him . He gives to artists , both good and bad , because he gives to the impulse of the artist . His wisdom in giving is not to wish to give too wisely . Otto Kahn , who has had success , demands his share of failure ! If he did not occasionally finance a " loafer " ? present his own ' cello to a musician who disappeared  --  back the wrong artistic horse , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kahn has fun out of his importation of Diaghileff , Copeau , Gamier , Stanislaysky ; out of building an Opera ; out of equipping ambulant art museums . But his most secret joy is not here . He holds the center of the stage at the Metropolitan auditions with a clear , forgivable under-emphasis  --  since he enjoys it : he foregathers the American great at lunch to meet the freshest celebrity from Europe and regales them with forgivable platitudes  --  since he enjoys it . But he is at his best at home , offering an hour ( and a check for a year 's leisure ) to some humble poet . Here , the man 's note is not false . For here , in helping , he is receiving what he needs . He looks at his Italian Primitives , at the illuminated manuscripts and at the bibelots on his Gothic tables with an easier eye . He has " atoned " ? his word  --  for his wealth . Kahn quotes Oscar Wilde : " ' God shows what he thinks of wealth by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps I can give the Divine Powers a slightly better opinion . " This conscience , this unease , this almost wistful , almost humble will to " make good " some spiritual debt he has never analyzed , never consciously acknowledged  --  this , added to the banker and to the player of life , gives you Otto K. ahn . Sociable , he is alone  --  a contented atom moving through endless provisional combinations , Replete with experience , he is a child at sixty  --  avid and naive . Cannily sure of himself , he is cautious and timid . Delicate in manner , his face reveals the force of his will . Favored by fortune and aware of his luck , he is bored by gambling , and haunted by the mystery of failure . Acknowledger only of the finite kingdom over which he rules , he is the patron and the friend of arts whose very end is to burst his kingdom asunder . All these contradictions to make the ultimate New Yorker : Mr. Otto Kahn , who lunches with the prime minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall destroy Babylon , the Minister and Mr. Otto Kahn . In the good time he is having , in the future he not too unconsciously abets , he proves the youth and mystery of our world .
