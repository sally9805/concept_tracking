Radio Lamp Lighters . Ordinarily street electric lamps are turned on and off in groups , by men throwing switches in scattered control stations in various parts of the community . Those control stations are expensive to maintain . To replace the men and stations Westinghouse developed a radio device , which Boston Edison Co. began to use last week on a circuit of 70 street lights . The device utilizes the fact that an electric wire can carry several currents of different frequencies . There are the carrier current and the riding currents . In the base of each of the 70 Boston lamp posts now is a small radio receiving set . When a special generation at the central station sends waves of 720 cycles a second along the light wires , the receiver shoves a switch which connects the individual lamp with the lighting circuit ; when the frequency is 480 cycles , the receiver pulls a switch that disconnects the lamp . All lamps in a particular circuit go on and off at the same instant , just as if a man operated one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps another pair of frequencies would operate the circuit ; and so on . The great advantage is that a few men in a central station could handle all of a city 's lighting . <P> Edison Radio . Thomas Alva Edison , who made the phonograph practical , for long would have nothing to do with radio because of static . His son Charles recently persuaded him to turn his wits to the radio . Result : a set to be put on the market next week . It contains two receivers , one for super-selectivity to get local stations exclusively , the other for sensitivity to pick up distant stations . Their machine also contains a phonograph . <P> Valveless Motor . Two Houston , Tex. , mechanics , H. S. Lyons and Victor Toce , last week demonstrated a two-cycle , four-cylinder internal combustion gasoline motor that had no valves or carburetor and only 13 working parts . A " turbulator " breaks the gasoline into fine spray ; two spark plugs for each cylinder explode the gasoline spray . <P> Smoke Clouds . Near Stuttgart , Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and from them spread wide layers of smoke clouds . Flyers in planes could not see terrain or buildings below the smoke . The device seemed a good protection to the Germans against an inimical air attack . <P> Lighted Cigarets . A coin dropped in the slot of a new machine makes a cigaret fall with its end against an incandescent electric coil . The heat lights the cigaret , which forthwith drops out of the machine for the buyer to smoke on his matchless way . One William Cohen of Brooklyn invented the device .
