txt Reports reaching Paris indicate that despite the denials of the Bratianu Government there is increasing agitation in Rumania , and that this agitation centres around sentiment in favor of the re- I turn to Bucharest of former Crown Prince Carol . As explained here , the sentiment of a large part of the peasant population favors a change in the existing . political situation , and this crystallizes about the person of Carol . In other words , instead of Carol being the object of hero worship , he represents a peg on which a growing dissatisfaction is being hung . Carol returned to Paris this afternoon from the villa he has bought in the Orne and let it be known at once that he had not resumed relations with Mme. Lupescu , the mistress from whom he broke off last week . The Prince once more proclaimed that he did- not ? desire of himself to start disturbances in Rumania , but that he thought that Rumanian people were being wronged by the suppression of discussion , for which he blames the Bratianu Government . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there exists no sentiment for his return , why does the present Government take such steps as the cutting off of communications and the establishment of a rigid censorship . He pointed especially to the arrest of M. Manoilescu , who bore letters from him to political chiefs . If he and his movements were indifferent to the Rumanian people , Carol wants to know why Premier Bratianu is so stirred up about him . Carol Gives Text of Letters . " I learned from the newspapers , " said Carol this evening , " of the arrest of Manoilescu , which astonished me . It is true that he had letters I had given him for the chiefs of Rumanian parties , including the Premier . " Carol was told . that M. Bratianu had said that ne had addressed appeals to party leaders to try to stir up a revolution and was asked if this were true . " The party chiefs asked me. " he replied , " to confirm a declaration I made in July to the Matin , for that number of the paper never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the text of these letters , all live of which are identical . " The following is the text that Carol handed out : " Certain dispatches sent out by official and semi-official agencies , as well as developments in the situation , oblige me to quit the reserve that I had imposed on myself for some time . For this reason , in July , several days after the death of my dear father , I made certain declarations which I wish to make known to the Rumanian people . These declarations , published in the Matin July 31 , could not be reproduced in Rumania , - and certain Rumanian leaders have questioned their , authenticity and asked me to confirm them . " Also , an official communique of the Rumanian Government , published in August exclusively in the foreign press , said that my declarations had produced no effect in Rumania , whereas the truth was that they had not been allowed to reach the Rumanian public .

My education and the purpose for which I was raised taught me to place myself abovg the resentments of political passions and to be guided only by the interests of my country . " Given the declaration I made , and the facts cited above , I consider as an elementary right that my declarations should be brought to the knowledge of my country in order to give to the people an opportunity to pass judgment on them freely , in the full knowledge of what lies behind them . " Carol 's declaration , in which he said that if his country called him he would heed the call , was inclosed I , with the letter . Carol was asked then to comment further on the arrest of M. Manoileseu , and said : " This arrest answers the question as to whether there is a movement in my favor in Rumania .

And you know that the Government has forbidden all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , the Prince said : " I consider what has happened as a direct infringement of the right of free discussion .
