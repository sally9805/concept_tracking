txt THE CONVENTION OF 1860 . The writer , now in his eighty-fourth year , as a boy of 19 was present at the Republican National Convention held in the historic old Wigwam at Chicago , in 1860 , when Mr. Lincoln was first nominated for President of the United States . The notice in yesterday 's TIMES of the death of Mr. Proctor , the last of the delegates to that convention . was to me a sad story . I remember so well looking upon that large easembly of fine , strong men who accomplished so much , and now all are gone . Of the thousands of visitors at the convention ? I fear there are but few left . The boys of 1860 are the old men of 1925 . Two years ego I gave a luncheon to all of the men I could find in and near our city ( something less than a dozen ) who voted for Mr. Lincoln . It was a unique party and was greatly enjoyed by all present I should like very mach to get a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wore present In the Chicago Wigwam in 1860 together for an old-time chat about President Lincoln and the great work for humanity accomplished by the delegates at that convention .
