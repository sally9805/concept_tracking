Federal Tax Returns for 1924 Incomes PUBLIC attention during the present session of Congress will be concentrated chiefly on the new tax bill and as an aid to discussion a re- port of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue giving a preliminary statement of income tax returns of individuals for 1924 is helpful . Statistics for 1 924 are based only on returns filed to September 30 , 1925 , and will be supplemented later by returns during the last quarter of the year and will be adjusted in many other ways . Still the information is ? the latest available and we may assume that the figures for earlier years through 1923 are now in - , final form and that those for 1924 are at least approximately correct . This report is dated November 14 , 1925 , and certain changes in the figures for 1923 incomes as given in the previous report issued on June 6 , 1925 , need brief notice . No changes are made for the income groups of $100,000 and over and only slight ones for the groups ranging from $25,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grand totals are as . follows : deleted table These comparisons are given because the changes are so extensive and because the writer used the earlier statistics in a previous analysis. * Some of the figures then given have been questioned as inaccurate and this explanation is appropriate . The change is one of a shift to lower groups . According to the June report there were 888,843 returns from individuals with incomes ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 ; their aggregate net incomes were $7,571 , - 9 8 7 , 936 and they paid $205,067,683 income tax . The later report gives only 569 , 431 in these classes with net incomes aggregating $5,276,353,118 and a tax yield of $159,345,789 . These alterations and others less striking show in the grand totals the same number of returns but a reduction of $1,496 , - 2 00,479 in total net income and of $40,310,660 in tax yield . These changes make necessary certain * See Special Supplement of the New Republic , November 4 , 1925 . This has recently been reprinted by the New Republic in booklet form minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax law in the last few years . It is unfortunate that Congress is planning so heavy a reduction in taxes . The federal debt is still over $20,000,000,000 . There are no productive assets behind it and every dictate of prudence demands that it be liquidated as rapidly as possible . Little assistance in this task will be received from the foreign debtors of our government as is clearly shown by every new debt settlement . New and heavy financial burdens may be thrust upon us at any time . The railroads or the coal mines may need federal control or perhaps ownership whether we wish it or not . Another war may come . The price level may fall . A business reaction is to be expected in time . We are prosperous and should eliminate the debt with the greatest possible speed , keeping taxes to do it . But arguments in favor of such a policy will receive scant attention at present . The real debate will centre on the nature and extent of reductions that are to be made . For this reason certain essentials need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are fully grasped the proper policies may be adopted . Our greatest trouble at present is a misunderstanding the facts . For a long while we even believed t-'that existing taxes were restraining business , discouraging enterprise and checking thrift . Now even the most superficial observer is aware that such statements are absurd . But there are other points on which misunderstanding still prevails . For example , the amounts actually paid by the various income groups are not clearly understood . Rates , especially surtax rates , are quoted from the law under the impression that they reflect accurately the percentages of net incomes that are paid in taxes . This is a misinterpretation of the law . For illustration , notice the following passage from the present law giving the surtax rate on one class of income : $17,020 upon net incomes of $100,000 ; upon net incomes in excess of $100,000 and not in excess of $200,000 , 37 per centum in addition of such excess . Let us suppose that A has a net income of $101,000 . His surtax then is $17,020 plus $370 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his net income exceeds $100,000 . His total surtax is $17,390 , or a little over 17 percent of his net income rather than 37 percent . Another man , B , has a net income of $199,000 . His surtax is $17,020 plus $37,730 , Or 37 percent of $99,000 , which is the amount by which his net income exceeds $100,000 . His total surtax is $54,750 , or a little over 27 percent of his net income . No taxpayer in this bracket is required to pay a surtax of 37 percent-of his total income , although in addition to the surtax we are discussing he must pay also the normal tax . The rates that have actually been paid by the various income groups are shown in the following table for 1921 , 1922 , 1923 , and 1924 . For 1923 the corrected figures as given in the report of November 14 , 1925 , are used . It is to be remembered that figures for 1924 are preliminary and incomplete , and that these rates include both normal tax and surtax. deleted table These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each of these groups by the aggregate net income of all the taxpayers in that group . First to be noticed is that at no time have the rates paid been as high as are assumed in current discussion . Thus the rate paid by the highest income group on 1921 incomes was not 8 percent ( normal tax ) plus 65 percent ( surtax ) or a total of 73 percent . Instead it was 63.59 percent which is what the law really called for . In 1922 the payment was not 58 percent of net income but 35.02 percent . Next to be observed is the decline in the rates paid by the various groups . These reductions are most pronounced in the lowest and in the highest groups . In the lowest four given above the rate paid in 1924 was about one-third that paid in 1921 and in 1922 . In the highest groups the reductions were very marked in 1922 , ranging from 30 to 45 percent while still more occurred in 1923 and in 1924 . It is to be noticed that the rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much lower than in 1924 . The law provided that for 1923 the tax be calculated in accordance with certain rates imposed and that from the amount thus found there should be a reduction of 25 percent . As a result rates paid by the largest incomes in 1923 were decidedly below these of 1922 and those of 1924 . The rates given show clearly that for 1923 the largest incomes were the greatest gainers . They paid only 23.53 percent which is 37 percent of the rate they were paying in 1921 . Other groups had reductions , but none so much as a group , the reason presumably being the distribution of incomes December 23 , 19:75 REPUBLIC within the group . Rates paid in 1924 show a distinct reduction over 1923 for the lower groups , a moderate one for incomes from $25,000 to $100,000 , a slight increase in rates for incomes from $100,000 to $1,000,000 and a marked increase for the incomes of $1,000,00 and over . Returns for 1924 show rates for net incomes up to $10,000 to be about one-third those in 1921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered , though less than those on the smallest ones . Reductions in rates have been least for incomes ranging from $25,000 to $300,000 . What do these figures mean ? Reductions in the law of 1921 were of little help in 1922 except to the largest incomes . The 25 percent reduction gave general relief in rates in 1923 . Changes of 1924 gave the greatest aid to those with small incomes . The largest incomes received " first aid . " Needless to say it does not follow that the relation among rates in 1924 is satisfactory merely because the largest reduction in rates has finally gone to those with small incomes . That would assume that the relationship between rates in 1921 was appropriate . Also it leaves out all mention of the important fact that a higher percentage of small incomes than of large ones goes to indirect taxes . But these figures are for rates . How about the aggregate amounts received from the various groups paying at these rates ? In 1921 it was maintained that high surtaxes were yielding less than could be secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The accompanying table shows the facts by classes of incomes . deleted table Rates have twice been reduced since taxpayers prepared their returns for their 1921 incomes . In that period there has been a pronounced revival of business with a consequent growth of 9 percent in the numbers filing returns and of 27 percent in their aggregate net income , but with a decline of December 23 , 1925 THE NEW 4 percent in tax yield . ( it must not be overlooked that these are preliminary figures . ) Percentage gains it will be observed have been greatest among those with the largest incomes ? $300,000 and over ? where the number of returns and the total net income have gained 214 and 215 percent respectively , but the tax yield from the group only 52 percent . Returns for incomes ranging from $100,000 to $300,000 have gained 133 percent and net income 138 percent , but tax yield only 45 percent . Lower rates have not brought larger returns from these classes but smaller when allowance is made for the growth of business and the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group described and more than doubled in the other . In the lower classes there has been a moderate increase in numbers and in income and the reduced rates have brought a smaller yield . A final question to which a decisive answer is now given is the extent to which people with large incomes are investing in tax-exempt securities . In the report of November 14 there are given the amounts of wholly and partially tax-exempt securities reported by various income classes in 1924 and the amounts of interest received thereon . For the classes with the largest incomes they are as follows : deleted table In this tabulation we have given the total net income for each income class and the total interest received from both wholly and partially tax-exempt securities . Finally comes the percentage of the interest received on tax-exempts to total net income . This is only 6.9 percent for the entire group and seems to dispose of some of the extravagant assertions about huge investments by the wealthy . in tax-exempts . There were said to be $13,552,000,000 of wholly tax-exempt securities outstanding at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as held by persons with incomes of $5,000 and over . The necessary steps should be taken to end the issue of tax-exempt securities but the facts do not support the contention that the situation demands a reduction of surtaxes to remedy it . The amount invested in this way by the rich is not large enough to warrant such action . Thus far the data made public by the office of the - Commissioner of Internal Revenue fail to support many of the assertions so commonly heard . High taxes are not curtailing busineSs or causing a short . age of capital . Reduced rates have resulted in ' lower returns . Investments in tax-exempts to escape high surtaxes have not been huge . Rates paid by - various income classes are far from being as high as the surtax rates so often referred to . In other words it is possible , for those who desire , to deal with the problem on its merits . Misleading assertions may be brushed aside and we may decide just what rates we wish to apply to various income classes . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income taxation and to progressive rates . Just what they should be for each class and how these classes should be arranged is perplexing enough in itself . A word may be said about the pending legislation . A bill has been prepared by the ' Ways and Means Committee of the House which may undergo extensive alterations after discussion by House , Senate , and Conference Committee . Yet it is well to remember that the rates in this bill are not so stated as to tax incomes at such high rates as many suppose . Under the present law there is a surtax of 40 percent on incomes of $500,000 and over , vet in 1924 those with incomes of $1,000,000 and over paid as combined normal tax and surtax only 30.13 percent ( according to the preliminary report . ) Discussion of the new law should keep this in mind . It is proposed to levy normal taxes of 1 , 3 , and 5 percent . In addition surtaxes are to be imposed ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent , the latter figure applying to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000 . The surtax actually imposed on an income of $14,000 is $40 or .28 percent ; on an income of $30,000 the surtax proposed is $920 or 3.06 percent ; on an income of $50,000 it is $3,460 , or 6.92 percent ; and on an income of $100,000 it is $12,360 or 12.36 percent . These taxes are , of course , in addition to the normal tax .
