txt Michael Faherty , chief of the board ' of local int ? Provements , and " father of the city hall experts , " marks a ceremony in connection with the Ogden avenue extension with an announcement that at ! east $7,000,000 more will be required from taxpayers to complete the project . That is more than three times the cost of the improvement , and double ill , ' official estimate upon which the original bond issue of *7.200.000 was approved . And this notwithstanding the fact that the bond Issue estimate was made at peak prices after the war . The city hall has the habit . It worked nicely be- the benefit of insiders in the Michigan bouletard link and bridge improvement . Why not in the Ogden avenue improvement ? Taxpayers ' money is easy money for its dispensers in the city hall , regardless of how hard it may he for the contributors . After sinking seven million dollars in an improvement which does not Improve unless It is completed these experts expect to find it easy to raise another seven millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost . There is no limit to the possibilities of such activities as long as city administrations and city improvements are left in the hands of a machine which fattens and grows strong on loot . The South Water street improvement is next . After that we will need further Improvements in the development of the city . We should have them , but we should have them at - reasonable ' cost , without putting millions of dollars into the pockets of " experts , " politicians , and favored contractors . The way to assure improvements without exploitation is to remove the machine which cornii ; nes the two . We are getting . exactly what we voted for when we returned the present administraI 1011 to office . We shall continue to get it as long as that adminIstrnt : . m remains . That will not be long . ( V , are paying too exorbitantly-for our lesson . We can prevent continuation of such tuition fees by removing . the teachers . And in the meantime the taxpayers might recover something by such suits as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city hall organization to disgorge a part of the loot.
