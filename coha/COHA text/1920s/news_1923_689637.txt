txt Suggestions fora Modus Bibendi . The bootleggers and the Government hay ' ing come to a point where they know where , they respectively stand , do you not think that it Is time that some sort of a working hauls. or modus btbendi. as I think I have seen it wittily expressed in your columns , should be arranged ? We citizens have some rights , and if the Government is not going to keep the bootleggers away , it ought at least to exercise some supervision over the quality of the goods which we are obliged to purchase . There are good bootleggers and bad bootleggers , and we ve got to take a chance ; but it is too much to expect a man to chase all over town sampling liquor until he finds a dealer on whose-statements he can rely . What I propose is that the Government establish inspection stations . Let the Government and the bootleggers play . as ? it were , a game of " prisoner 's base . " If the rum-runner succeeds in landing his cargo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to one of these inspection stations and have it passed on by the Government  --  say , the War Chemical Department , or one of those departments whose members do n't care what becomes of them . If the goods pass Inspection , then the bootlegger should nave the privilege of dispouing of them in the market . If not , he should be regularly released on bail , so he can go out and get another line . I apprehend that some of your readers might formulate a method even more practicable and more timely than the foregoing . H. A. NEN674NY. - New York . Nov. 26. 1923.
