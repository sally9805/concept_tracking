No merely promising young Congressman expects to be lionized and fted when , in Chicago by Mrs. Edith Rockefeller Mc-Cormick , Mrs. Potter Palmer or other Tycoon 's lady . But a third , second or first secretary of almost any embassy may aspire to these honors . They were bestowed in Chicago , last week , by Mrs. McCormick and Mrs. Palmer upon the Second Secretary of the Persian Embassy , one Prince* Mozaffar Firouz . The Secretary-Prince is slender , with large nose and an intelligent expression . Obliging , he read to smart Chicagoans a lecture : The Regeneration of Persia . Tidily he ate off the McCormick plate of gold , creating fewer crumbs than many another guest . <P> More select was another political feast , given in Madrid last week by Mrs. Ogden Haggerty Hammond . Present were Her Majesty Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain and General Don Miguel Primo de Rivera . <P> Mr. Ogden Haggerty Hammond has risen from small Hoboken real estate dealings to the position of a real estate tycoon and the rank of U. S. Ambassador to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of Hoboken , famed Castle Point . The present Mrs. Ogden Haggerty Hammond of New York City and Ambassador Hammond tendered their luncheon to Royalty , last week , on the eve of returning to the U. S. for a short visit . They leave in charge of the Embassy in Madrid , quietly renowned Counselor Sheldon Whitehouse . He prepared for diplomacy as private secretary to the late Ambassador Whitelaw Reid , graduated to be Chief of the Near Eastern Division of the State Department , is suave , astute . <P> Also returning to the U. S. on leave were Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow ( Mexico ) and Minister John Batterson Stetson Jr . ( Poland ) . <P> <P> *Not of the reigning House of Pahlavi.
