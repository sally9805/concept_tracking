txt The American Debt Commission has coldly declined to avail itself of the services of a private commercial agency which offered to collect our war debts on the regular 10 per cent . basis . It seems that for the successful collection of debts " a certain " amount of applied psychology is " necessary , " and the business organization which submitted the bid modestly believes that it has the psychology and also the system to produce results . The Washington dispatch does not state whether the psychology was to be applied to the debtor or the creditor . It Is probable that the successful system , being in the nature of a trade secret , was not submitted in detail to the commission . It is true that if the collection agency took over our entire war claims it stood to make something like a billion and a quarter dollars , which would be enough to cover salaries and other overhead for several years to come . Yet for our Government a 10 per cent . fee would not be excessive , if we think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct negotiations with our debtors we shall probably have to scale down a good deal more than 10 per cent . from the face value of our claims . But the Debt Commission turned down the proposition precisely because of the psychology which it was proposed to apply . If there is one thing in which the discussion of war debts has been particularly rich , it is psychology . Comparatively little real money has passed in settlement of war claims , but the expenditure of psychology has been enormous . Our European debtors have never given up trying to get us into the frame of mind where we would recognize that one of the worst things that could happen us would be to collect our debts . This marked eagerness to safeguard American industry and commerce against foreign competition by not paying us exists in every European capital . We , in turn , have been doing our best to get the European nations into the psychological condition where they would perceive that the best thing for them would be to pay up . It is reported from Washington that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner the debtor nations meet their obligations the swifter will be their own economic and financial recovery . It seems a , pity that .. Europe should be so concerned with America 's welfare and America should be so absorbed by consideration for Europe 's best interests that their minds can not meet . Europe implores us not to run the risk of collecting war debts even if it does delay economic recovery on the Continent . The American Debt Commission responds by inviting the debtor nations to pay up and never mind our feelings . The trouble with psychology as internationally applied is that it will not always take . In this respect it is like the celebrated Weber and Fields dog . LEW and Jos knew very well that the human eye can tame any strange dog . but the question was whether the dog knew it . At present ' the creditors know that paying debts is an excellent thing for debtors , and the debtors know that receiving payment of debts is a dangerous thing for creditors . If the impasse is to be broken it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
