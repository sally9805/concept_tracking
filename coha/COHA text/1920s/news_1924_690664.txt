txt The protocol on arbitration and security . devised by a committee of the league of nations , made Public in Geneva , has been discussed in connection with kir . Hughes ' statement early in August . It in , in fact , merely a new device to make effective the defense of the status quo . . American opinion will hardly condemn the determination of the victors in the late war to nail down such gains as accrued to them under the treaties imposed upon the vanquished at the conferences of len , . We Americans differ widely as to the wisdom or justice of many provieions of these treaties , differ in fact about as widely as Europeans do , for we reflect all the sympathies and resentments of Europe . But such American thought as is American , as British thought is BrItIsh , ? Erench thought French , Italian thought Italian . etc. , wilt find in the so-called protocol , or treaty of mutual assistance , a new reminder of the impossibility of our entering the league or Its outworks with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that matter , with any regard for our variegated sympathies or convictions . ons . The protocol may very well be a. useful device for imposing a certain stability upon the European turmoil . It is easy to understand why even governments of the countries which were penalized by the Paris treaties might welcome it as giving ! hem a space of enforced quiet to reorganize internal affairs and make more effectual preparation for future action . But analysis of the possibilities for us will keep us clear , for it Is merely another formula for assuming ali the responsibilities of the original covenant . For example , the ostensible purpose of the compact 1st() bind peaceable nations to aid any nation threatened by aggression . ' What is aggression is determined by the council . Thus any nation con , : eiving Itself to have been en/el:med by the treaty . of Versailles cr St. Germain or Trianon , and unable to obtain a correction and restitution from the league , will be declared aggressor if It proposes to fight for its right . Our pacifists will approve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation declared aggressor is obnoxious or suspect . But what Ainerican , thinking as an American , will care to be morally or otherwise obligated to assist in the permanent imposition of any partition devised in 1910 by and in the Interest of the dominant powers at that time ? Any disinterested Student of the revision of the Etropettn map must be convinced of the impermanence of its boundary making and of the very dubious justice or expediency of its contrivances . But the protocol of mutual assistance , translated into actual terms of power within the league , is merely . as we have said , a device in the guise of an bistrorr.ent of peace to discredit and . It necessary , to defeat revision except as it may seem profitable to the controlling members of the league . Of course . we might consent to It in and try to redress the balance . But how is an American reProsentative to express American preference in an itteue , for example , between Roumania or CzechoSlovakia .. and Hungary ? The great bankers and the sentimental partisans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the racial chi/-dren. of the revolting nations might declare for the fferent mass of be saved from or either .. , that if we were to bind ourselves to accept the . ' decisions of the council as to aggression or lack of aggression , the whole turmoil of European politics , with its claims and counter claims , would be thrust into American affairs .. Already they make unacknowledged issues in our campaigns and pervert judgment With alien irrelevancies . If we enter the league system , any hope of producing a homogeneous people under the American flag will be postponed for generations , it not utterly defeated . We have no disposition to dogmatize as to the benefits of the league or the protocol to Europe . We are inclined to believe in spite of tee fact that It is not what it Is offered to us for , and swallowed by impassioned theorists or partisans , it may prove to be a main instrument for supplying at this stage what Europe needs most , a stabilization . In time it may also be made an agency for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euro'peas governments , a means of evolving a statesrnanahlp capable of thinking and acting in terms of Europe . But all that is a problem which must be worked out ty the Europeans , and our participalion in the solution , if we are ' to look upon that as an altruistic mandate , will be effective in proportion as we are not bound in advance to any status quo . As to our right to preserve our own domestic harmony and protect our own independ. care and legitimate interests , a. commitment to the so-called Protocol of mutual defense , or to the covenant , is not deserving of consideration . As for the protocol as a preparation for armameat reduction , Americans can very Well say : We have not found it necessary to the reduction of our own armament to or below the limit of reasonable security . That we should be expected to make further encrifices Is not reasonable . If the protocol Is intended , as we believe , to fix the statue ouo , no measures of reduction will be agreed upon that are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same door where in we went " The . united States has given all the lead a powerfitl and pacific nation can tovvard International peace by reducing its organized military strength - ea , if not below , a defensive minimum and iff making peace treaties with our most probable opponents and with all weaker powers . if the American spirit and ? Metal example were Imitated In Europe , no other devices than we have used are needed . We can not impoite this imitation upon European governments nor ought we to try . Their dangers and difficulties are complicated and serious , and wcare not fitted to judge them , We should'be welcomed as an ally , not as a possible opponent nor as a Judge likely to render . adverse judgment . ' We are wanted to help impose and preserve the status quo . We may be wanted in the hoe ? that we will help to destroy it . It is foolish to think that any power in Europe is so humble as to want us for a judge with power to enforce our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
