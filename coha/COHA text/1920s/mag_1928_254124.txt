The silence emanating from the Administration 's busy beaverish heir and beneficiary became , as the hyperbolists said , almost deafening . Following his telegram of the acceptance to the G. 0 . P. Convention , Nominee Hoover addressed no word to the U. S. electorate . He actively avoided contact with the nation 's press . He shut himself in his big , bare office at the Department of Commerce . He left his chunky political secretary , George Akerson , onetime newsgatherer , to answer all questions . Newsmen remarked that this was but a continuation of the policy adopted by Secretary Hoover ever since he seriously began aligning delegates . <P> Callers . The newsmen simply sat , fidgeted , watched callers going in and out . Early to come was William S. Vare , Philadelphia 's pudgy boss , whose obtrusion at Kansas City embarrassed Hooverism and irked Pennsylvania ( see p. 13 ) . Mr. Vare also went to see Nominee Curtis at the Capitol . The nature of Boss Vare 's errands remained obscure . <P> Another caller was President William Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few National Committeemen who strongly opposed the Hoover nomination before it happened . Committeeman Atterbury seemed adequately Hooverized last week . <P> Nominee Curtis also called and with this visit the Hoover campaign for election formally began . The Hoover-Curtis conference , which lasted several hours , was for the purpose of drafting a new slate of officers for the National Republican Committee . Observers estimated that this conference consisted of about 98% Hoover decision , plus 2% Curtis suggestion . <P> To Work . With continued uncommunicativeness , except as to the factual results , the Republican National Committee 's subcommittee to cooperate with the Candidates was taken into conference , Hooverized , given some luncheon , dismissed . It did leak out that the Hoover campaign is to be a businesslike affair , based on the Coolidge record , with no mudslinging at the Democrats countenanced or tolerated . Senator Moses said : " When we begin to campaign . . . we wo n't call him ' AP but we will refer to him as the governor of New York . " <P> To replace William Morgan Butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work , grey-bristled Secretary of the Interior . Dr. Work 's centre of influence is supposed to be in Colorado , where he long practiced medicine and where , at Pueblo , he founded a hospital . The choice of a more easterly generalissimo for the G. 0 . P. campaign had been expected , since the ticket is California-and-Kansas and since the sharpest competition between the two parties is expected to centre in the urban East . But the Work-for-Chairman movement was many months old . Dr. Work was the first Hooverizer in the Cabinet . <P> Dr. Work 's career as a large-scale organizer began during the War , when he gave up his private practice and was put in charge of the medical aspects of the Army draft . Will H. Hays selected Dr. Work to organize the farm vote in the Harding campaign and later retained his services as
