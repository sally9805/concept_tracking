His Majesty 's Navy boasts a spry and cocky little marine who is listed officially as " First Class Bandmaster Percy Barnacle . " <P> At Gibraltar last week Bandmaster Barnacle became the star witness at the celebrated court-martial of two officers charged with having complained , " in a manner subversive of discipline , " against the alleged insulting conduct and awful oaths of their superior , peppery Rear Admiral Bernard St. George Collard ( TIME , April 9 ) . The two court-martialed officers are Captain Kenneth G. B. Dewar and Commander Henry M. Daniel . In support of their contentions Bandmaster Barnacle took the stand , braced himself and testified that he personally had been called a series of unprintable names by Rear Admiral Collard . The names , it appeared , all began with " b . " " They were ugly names and dishonoring names , " said Bandmaster Barnacle , " and I felt that after they had been uttered nothing could restore my prestige with the band . ... I wanted to leave the service . " <P> When Captain Dewar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received permission to cross examine Rear Admiral Collard . Then for some four hours snarling questions and vituperative rejoinders flew between Captain and Admiral , both of whom purpled gradually with rage and seemed to become oblivious to the presence of the august Court . Printable excerpts : <P> Dewar : " Now , Sir , I ask you to imagine yourself in the place of Bandmaster Barnacle . " <P> Collard : " I have no intention of imagining myself a bandmaster ! " <P> Dewar : " Did you ever say you were fed up with the ship on which I was your flag captain ? " <P> Collard : " I said I was fed up with you . " <P> Dewar : " Answer yes or no . " <P> Collard : " I will not ! I will answer as I see fit . " <P> After much further bickering the proceedings were closed . They had consisted of two distinct trials , respectively of Commander Daniel and Captain Dewar ; but the charges and evidence in each case were substantially identical . To an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted from commendable motives in complaining against a superior whose conduct had been well nigh unbearable . This view was taken by practically the entire London press , last week , including the usually antithetical Conservative Daily Telegraph and Laborite Daily Herald . At Gibraltar , however , the Court held to the unwritten law of Navy discipline and found both the accused " guilty . " Both were sentenced to lose their active commands and to go on half pay until the Admiralty shall see fit to order them once more to active service . Cried the Telegraph : " We must deplore the system of discipline which made the verdicts inevitable . " Echoed the Herald : " The public will receive the verdict with astonished indignation . " <P> To still such universal protest First Lord of the Admiralty William Clive Bridgeman shortly announced that the Admiralty had found a way to punish Rear Admiral Collard without actually court-martialing him . He has received orders , said the First Lord , which have the effect of placing him in provisional retirement upon half pay .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
