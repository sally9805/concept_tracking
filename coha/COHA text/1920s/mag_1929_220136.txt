Weather was gusty at Curtiss Field , L. I. , last week when Pilot Emil Burgin of the Acosta Airplane Corp . taxied a Fokker monoplane for a takeoff . As she moved forward a gust from behind caught her wings , lifted her , flopped her over on her back . She was little damaged . <P> At once Pilot Burgin , confident in the staunchness of aircraft , took out an Arrow sport plane . She would not rise properly , bucked a ground bump , flipped forward and over onto her back , with trifling damage . <P> Pilot Burgin , unhurt by two " mishaps " in one day , went home to supper .
