txt CHILD ADOPTION IN MIDDLE WEST . To the Editor of The New York ' Macs : The paragraph entitled " This Custom Unknown to Ourselves . " appearing in the April 22 edition of THE TIMES under the heading of " Topics of the Times , " indicates how our own " customs " vary with different localities and how provincial we may all be at times  --  even in our great metropolis . You state that " Few of us have more than one acquaintance who has adopted a single child , and most of us have read about the rare instance in which the plan has been extended , " Winnetka , where I live , Is a village of six or seven thousand inhabitants , suburban to Chicago .

The demand for girls appears to be greater than that for boys . Although I can in no way answer for the effete East or the circle of acquaintances of the writer in THE TIMES , I have been repeatedly informed that the practice of adoption referred to by Muriel Harris is quite common throughout the AlirY.Dp ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1022.
