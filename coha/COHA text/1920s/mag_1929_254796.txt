Edward Everett Gann , an unassuming man , long led a quiet life in Washington . He practiced law , he made some money . He never troubled his head about Society and Society never troubled its head about him . Edward Everett Gann was a happy man . <P> To be sure , he had married Dolly Curtis , a strapping , titian-haired lady whose Brother Charles was Senator from Kansas . But that fact did not affect the smooth and comfortable routine of his life . When Mrs. Curtis died five years ago , the Senator as a widower went to live in the vine-clad Gann home in Cleveland Park , informal Washington suburb . When his brother-in-law sought the presidential nomination last year at the Kansas City Convention , Mr. Gann journeyed out and took charge of the Curtis headquarters . It was pretty much a family affair and all very jolly . <P> Not until his brother-in-law was nominated and elected Vice President of the U. S. did Mr. Gann 's troubles begin . First he was brought in from the cozy Cleveland Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Gann , in a twelve-room suite at the Mayflower Hotel . Then he found himself being led off to great formal dinners with people he did n't know and who obviously did n't know him . A round-faced , bespectacled man , shorter than the large Mrs. Gann , the Vice President 's brother-in-law sidled into inconspicuous drawing-room corner , spoke when spoken to , wore a mask of polite pleasure . <P> Intimations of trouble came when the Senate Ladies Luncheon Club elected Mrs. Senator Moses of New Hampshire to succeed Mrs. Vice President Dawes as their chief , instead of Mr. Gann 's wife who , as sister of the widower Vice President-Elect , had already begun to function as the latter 's official hostess ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . <P> Then , on March 4 , Mrs. Gann rode to the capitol with Mrs. Charles Gates Dawes , only to find no Senate gallery seat reserved for her . Herbert Hoover Jr . gave her his seat . On that occasion Mr. Gann rode alone to the Capitol at the tag-end of the procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By last week , life had become acutely distressing for Mr. Gann as he observed that a major social war was whirling horribly about his wife , in highest , mightiest circles . Vice President Curtis had notified Secretary of State Kellogg that Mrs. Gann was his hostess and that , as such , she should have the full rank of the Vice President 's lady in the complex social scheme of official Washington . Secretary Kellogg had ruled that Mrs. Gann could not rate on the level of the Vice President but below the wives of the Chief Justice , the Speaker , the Secretary of State , and all foreign Ambassadors and Ministers . <P> To James Clement Dunn , Chief of the State Department 's Protocol Division , Secretary Kellogg had apparently gone for this precedent . And Mr. Dunn had apparently based his opinion upon the authoritative statement of Mrs. Kellogg 's social secretary , Miss Anne Squire , who had written : " Sisters . . . of an official take no precedence whatever . Even when they act as hostesses for the head of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived of the rank of wife . " To all Embassies and Legations had gone this Kellogg ruling on Mrs. Gann.
