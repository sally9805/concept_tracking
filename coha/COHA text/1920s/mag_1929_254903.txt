Thoughtfully picking his nose , Referee Jack Dempsey stood in the corner of a ring in Madison Square Garden while the announcer introduced two fighters . In this corner lantern-jawed Otto von Porat , Norwegian white hope . In this corner Philip Scott , onetime London fireman . The announcer withdrew . Von Porat , Scott , boxed clumsily for a round . In the second round von Porat hit the more agile Scott in the groin . Referee Dempsey helped Scott up and declared him the winner . From the ringside a reporter for the Norway Post , telephoning the sad news to his editor in Oslo , added the suggestion that the men will doubtless be matched again before one of them is picked to meet Schmeling or Sharkey.
