txt The Fourth of July plea of Congressman RATHBOXE of Illinois that citizens of the District of Columbia be granted the suffrage reopens a qtiestion which from time to timb has stirred Washingtonians to warm argu-1 ment . It is now fifty years since the last efforts to give the District a representative government proved so unsatisfactory that Congress reverted to the system , foreseen by the early lawmakers , of placing the administration of the national capital entirely in the hands of Congress . Shortly after the Civil War the negroes were given the vote in Washington . Although this offered opportunities for unscrupulous politicians to play upon the ignorance of the new voters , it was a number of years before the abuses became so great as to rouse resentment .. What did almost as much to influence Congree to abolish the form of government which the city enjoyed for a few years in the early ' 70s was . the extravagance of " Boss " SHEPHERD , who dictated the politics of the city for al number of years . To his energy largely due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid down sewers , put in drains , planted trees , and generally reorganized the public portions of the city . In his labors he har  --  the hearty support of President GRANT . But he worked with reckless Prodigality and endeavored to put through in a few years improvements designed to meet the needs of decades . This naturally brought upon him the criticism of property holders , who found themselves burdened with large ' taxes and saw the city 's debt steadilyi rising . His objective was good and his vision has been justified by thei subsequent growth of the city , but his methods were such that he was charged with playing polities without regard to the needs of the District , except in matters of construction . Congress , disturbed by the extravagance of the District Government and impressed wit4 the growing feeling throughout the country that . Washington was a Federal city and should be made into a national centre , decided to resume actual control , and in 1878 re-established in permanent form the commission government under which the citizens again lost the franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local expenses . During the last fifty years the buildings devoted to the National Government have greatly inertased in number and value ; and Washington is developing jnto almost a national shrine . The vast army of Government employes who live there have from time to time resented their non-partieipation in elections . Experience has shown , however , that the city has thrived without the franchise and that the citizens have had no more to complain about through not being able to vote than have the dwellers in other cities who , although they exercise the franchise , are not given to comparing their cities favorably with Washington . It may be , as the Congressman from Illinois so confidently asserted , that the " Fathers " and the statesmen who sat in Congress during qwq Washingtonians . But from the beginning they and the WAshingtonians seem to have been agreed that the special status of the District of Columbia justified the withholding of certain Privileges in exchange . for the enjoyment of others .               @ @ @ @ @ @
