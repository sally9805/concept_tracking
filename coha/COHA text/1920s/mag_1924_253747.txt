At Belmont Park , L. I. , pinard ( " Spinach " ) , French four-year-old stallion , who came to the U. S. last week for international match races this Fall , strolled lazily about the paddock with Satin Slippers , his two-year-old traveling companion ( female ) . He is a bright chestnut beast , slightly undersized , insured for $150,000 , valued at $300,000 . <P> At meals the equine friends munched American oats together , drank American water . Their owner , Pierre Wertheimer , and their trainer , Eugene Leigh , do not believe in " special fodder " as did Ben Irish and Basil Jarvis , owner and trainer of Papyrus , the 1923 invader . <P> American turfdom reiterated the question : " What horseflesh have we got this year ? " <P> Further answers to this question : <P> 1 ) At Empire City , N. Y. , Sting , a three-year-old , won the Empire City Handicap from a field that included Mad Play , Harry F. Sinclair 's crack three-year-old , in track-record time ( 1 miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore much less weight than Mad Play , was aided by the tactics of Rialto , an early pacemaker . Even so , his time was extraordinarily good ; he merits consideration as a candidate to meet pinard . <P> 2 ) At Empire City , Ordinance , aged 3 years , owned by August Belmont , picked up Jockey Kummer ( 112 lbs. ) and won the Mount Vernon Handicap in track-record time ( a mile in 1 min. , 38 sec . ) . Behind Ordinance came Sunsini , a four-year-old , then Mad Play , then Aga Khan , of the Belair Stud . Sarazen , Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt 's famed colt , led awhile but finished next to last . Significance : Ordinance had returned to form , had beaten Mad Play more impressively than did Ladkin , his stable mate , last week , in an Aqueduct race that won the latter the temporary toast of " best colt of the season " ( TIME , July 14 ) . <P> 3 ) At Chicago , Black Gold , aged three years , owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky Derby winner , picked up Jockey Mooney ( 129 lbs. ) and won the Chicago Derby by six lengths . Behind Black Gold came Giblon , then Senator Norris , then the famed Ladkin . The significance : Even if Ladkin was off form , Black Gold had regained much of his Spring virility . He can not be scratched off the list of possibilities .
