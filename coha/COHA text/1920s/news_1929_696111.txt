txt There is a passage in President Hoover 's message to the special session of Congress , where he speaks of his proposed Farm Board . which should give the farmers and his political friends serious pause . The President speaks of this as ' the creation of a great instrumentality ? ? ? of a strength and importance equal to those which we have created for transportation and banking . " If that new regulatory board is to be like the Federal Reserve Board in Washington or the Interstate Commerce Commission , the farmer may well shiver . If the Farm Board treats the farmer as the Reserve Board treats the banks or the L C. C. the railroads , with equal irresponsibility , the farmer will be well out of the frying pan but into the Sire . If the new board is really like the Federal Reserve Board it will invite the farmers , and indeed compel them , to put up the $500,000,000 revolving fund out of their own pockets . Treating good and bad alike , it will regulate them without respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know that the Federal Reserve Board is not necessarily or even usually composed of bankers . But if the Farm Board is to bear even an approximate resemblance to the Interstate Commerce Commission , the business of farming in this country win come to rapid and ignominious conclusion . The Board will tell the farmer what wages he shall pay , what hours his labor shall work , how be shall feed  --  and treat them and how many of them he shall employ . It will limit the price he may charge for what he produces , irrespective of the cost of production , exactly as the Interstate Commerce Commission fixes the price of transportation . It will compel him to keep a staff of clerks , at his own expense , in order to write interminable reports , much as the Pennsylvania Railroad writes about 120,000 reports a year , principally to the Commission , for only a part of its system . Under that munificent and paternal direction the farmer will not be permitted to earn more than 53,4 , % on the capital which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much capital be really has invested , a point upon which its decision will be final . Anything over that amount which a competent farmer may happen to make will be divided among incompetent farmers , who , however , will not be allowed to sell or shut down their farms without the permission of the Farm Board . Moreover the Farm Board being composed of politicians , will imitate the Interstate . Comerce Commission in another important re= zpect It will limit the-farmer 's profits but not his losses . If he loses money obeying the instructions be receives be will get little sympathy . The harder he works , the more successful his economies , the more modern his methods , the better his credit , the more severely will he be regulated . Indeed the only two things the Board will not restrict if they are modeled on the examples President Hoover cffers , are the farmer 's losses and his taxes . Have we not had about as much of noble experimenting as is good for us ?          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
