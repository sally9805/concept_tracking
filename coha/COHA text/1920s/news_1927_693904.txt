txt Will Rogers Set to Be First To Cross Atlantic by Bridge DODGE CITY , Kan. , June 6 . ? Three weeks ago Sunday I was up with Chamberlin in this same plane . If I had known he was thinking about taking an outsider over I would have joined out myself . Then I would have been the first scared comedian to go over . He is a fine , modest young man  --  another Lindbergh  --  and a great aviator , too . That he did n't jump weeks ago was no fault of his . He was the victim of rows and fusses in which he had no part . Do n't take any of the credit away from him because he was just the second one over . Say , the second plane can drop in that ocean just as easy as the first . Well , never mind , I will be the first one to go over on a bridge . WILL ROGERS . P. S. -- I am on the crack California train going West . There are several moving picture promoters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going on till their gas runs out . "
