The Nebraska State Bar Association sat at Omaha . Before it rose Mr. Leslie M. Shaw and launched an argument . <P> He asserted in effect : A man can be President of the United States only if elected to that office . If a Vice President assumes the duties of President , he remains legally Vice President . He is President dc facto but no President dc jure except by election . Therefore , Theodore Roosevelt had one term in office as President , ran for a second and was defeated . Therefore Calvin Coolidge is about to enter his first term as President this March . If he runs for President again in 1928 , he will be running for a second , not a third term . <P> This argument is likely to be heard more and more between now and 1928 . But who is this Mr. Leslie M. Shaw and how did the argument happen to occur to him ? <P> Mark Sullivan , famed Washington correspondent of The World 's Work , recently listed him some men whose fame has waned : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , FRANKLIN MACVEAGH . <P> 2 ) CHARLES EMROY SMITH , HENRY C. PAYNE , ROBERT J. WYNNE . <P> 3 ) JOHN D. LONG , VICTOR HOWARD METCALF , GEORGE VON LENGERKE MEYER . <P> To these might be added : <P> 4 ) LUKE E. WRIGHT , JACOB M. DICKINSON , HENRY L. STIMSON . <P> 5 ) WILLIAM H. MOODY , CHARLES J. BONAPARTE , JAMES C. MCREYNOLDS . <P> 6 ) ETHAN A. HITCHCOCK , RICHARD A. BALLINGER , WALTER L. FISHER . <P> Mr. Sullivan asked of the first group , and it may well be asked of the second group : " How many of these men can you identify ? " <P> All have been members of the Cabinet during the last 25 years . The first three were Secretaries of the Treasury ; the second three , Postmasters General ; the third three , Secretaries of the Navy ; the fourth , Secretaries of War ; the fifth , Attorneys General ; the sixth , Secretaries of the Interior . <P> It will be seen that Mr. Shaw was a Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt . His connection with Roosevelt suggests why he happened to think of the question of third terms . Some day , not 25 years hence , may not Mr. Mellon be referred to as " one Andrew W. Mellon " ?
