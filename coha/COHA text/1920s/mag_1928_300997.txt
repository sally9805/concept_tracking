Imagine seeing a black cat in front of the house , first thing in the morning of the day your husband expects to be elected President of the United States ! <P> Mrs. Hoover went out and caught the cat , took it indoors . After breakfast , she accompanied her husband to a polling place , with their sons and daughter-in-law . They returned to a house full of people , sandwiches , chrysanthemums , telegraph tickers and commotion , to wait and hear how many millions of citizens were voting the way the Hoovers had voted . If Mrs. Hoover thought about the black cat during the day , there was another " omen , " too . It was not only Mrs. Smith 's birthday , but Herbert Hoover III 's . <P> Three big blackboards were set up in the living room . As the sun sank returns began coming in . The Hoover secretaries darted hither and yon with slips of paper , chalk and chalk-erasers , like marker boys in a brokerage office . Mr. Hoover worked with them for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking a pipe . The buzzing crush of people seemed to bother him . He went into his study . Telephone calls were incessant . He discouraged premature congratulations , wandering between living room and study . <P> On the blackboards , positive claims were made with caution . At 7:15 p. m . Pacific time , about the moment that Executive Editor Swope of the arch-Democratic New York World was handing a yellow slip to a reporter , conceding the election , the Hoover quotation at Palo Alto was only 206 electoral votes . The total popular vote was even at three million for each nominee . <P> Fifteen minutes later , Palo Alto quoted 251 electoral votes . With great care , they had added New York 's 45 . Not until 8:43 p. m. ( 11:43 Eastern time ) did they chalk up Tennessee , Wisconsin and Iowa for a total of 289 . <P> Seven minutes later , in Washington , the thirtieth President of the U. S. , who had been reading telegraph returns alone in his study , went to bed . The thirty-first President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room became a loud caucus of triumph . John Philip Sousa 's band blared its best . The President-elect was sitting down at the moment . He did not get up at once but sat , eyes downcast , embarrassed , rubbing his forehead with his fingertips . They wanted a speech . " Not tonight , " he said . Outside the house , a phalanx of Stanford University undergraduates yelled persistently . The President-elect reluctantly took his way to the terraced roof of his house , under the California stars . Tears glistened on his cheeks as he looked down on that fragment of the electorate . He said : " I thank you all for coming up here tonight . I appreciate it from the bottom of mv heart . "
