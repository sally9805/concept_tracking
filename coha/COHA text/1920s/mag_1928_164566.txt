David Stern , owner of the Evening Courier and the Morning Post of Camden , N. J. , 42-year-old veteran of newspaper battles from Seattle , Wash. , to Providence , R. I. Like the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle ( see above ) , the Record goes to a local boy . " New ownership , " observed Mr. Stern , briefly , " implies no change in editorial policy . " <P> A change in business policy , however , was indicated by this announcement of the A. B.

" <P> <P> *The figures of the Audit Bureau of Circulations are the accepted indices of American newspaper circulation , relied upon by all conscientious advertisers .
