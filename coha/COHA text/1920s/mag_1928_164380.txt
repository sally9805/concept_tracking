On the other hand , my interest in the colored race and in the problems which it involves is urging me to say yes . Because of the splendid work which you are doing at Fisk University and because under your leadership this institution gives promise of being an instrumentality of widespread service to the whole colored race , I am yielding to my impulses and disregarding my judgment and am going to accept with pleasure your invitation . <P> It will be a pleasure to see you in the midst of your work and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for the invitation . <P> Very sincerely , <P> ( Signed ) John D.
