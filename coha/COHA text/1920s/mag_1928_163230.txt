The German State Railways officially announced , last week , for submission to the Reichstag a project to abolish 1st &; 4th class railway cars . The residual 2nd &; 3rd class cars will be redesignated " soft " &; " hard , " if the Reichstag approves , thus abolishing class distinctions which are felt to be inappropriate in the democratic German Republic . <P> The " soft " &; " hard " nomenclature for railway cars was first introduced , as everyone knows , in Soviet Russia .
