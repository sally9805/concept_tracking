Many a Presbyterian , profoundly aware of the existence of Rev. Henry Sloane Coffin among their fellowship , waited his word . Would his silence have the effect of committing the entire church " to work , and pray and vote for . . . Hoover . " Last week Dr. Coffin wrote a letter to the New York Times . Brief , compact , it follows : <P> " As a Presbyterian and one who in this election is supporting Mr. Hoover , I wish publicly to protest against the letter of the Moderator of the General Assembly calling on all members of the Presbyterian Church to support a particular candidate ( TIME , Oct. 1 ) . This is a flagrant instance of an ecclesiastic 's attempt to drag the Church into politics . As a citizen Dr. Walker is within his rights in giving his public support to any candidate he pleases . As a Christian minister he is justified in urging the maintenance of prohibition as in his judgment the wisest method of safeguarding the sobriety of the nation . But he usurps an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the members of the Church for whom they should vote . <P> " Members of the Presbyterian Church are presumed to possess minds and consciences of their own . Many of them will not agree with the Moderator as to the chief issues in this campaign . They may feel constrained to support Mr. Norman Thomas* as a protest against much that is sub-Christian in the platforms of both of the large parties . Or they may decide to vote for Governor Smith because they sincerely believe that prohibition does not really secure the maximum of temperance or for some other of his policies . <P> " In any case it is bad taste , poor churchmanship and a misuse of the ministerial office to attempt to line up the Church for a political party and its candidate . <P> " Sincerely yours , <P> " HENRY SLOANE COFFIN " <P> Dr. Coffin 's letter only partially counteracts Moderator Walker 's call for Hoover votes on behalf of " Christ &; Church . " It does , however , leave the Presbyterian church much less unanimously in politics than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ministers , the principal Protestant denominations were ranked last week as follows : Methodists , Lutherans , Baptists , Congregationalists , Presbyterians , Episcopalians ( almost no campaigning ) . <P> <P> *An ordained minister , Socialist Nominee Norman Thomas was once a pupil at the Union Theological Seminary of which Dr. Coffin is now president .
