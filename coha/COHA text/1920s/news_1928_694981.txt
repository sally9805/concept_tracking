txt A Wilkins makes search for land in the waters about the North Pole , and after repeated failure achieves his purpose . A Byrd plans to explore at even greater peril the wastes of ice and snow at the other Pole . A Millikan searches the skies and descends into the waters under the earth to determine the nature and force of the rays that beat upon the world from the cosmos . But there are explorers , here in the midst of our city 's millions , who in like spirit and with kindred courage , day after day and night after night , venture out into the realms of the unknown , thinking not of their own comfort or compensation , but only of what they may bring back for the enlargement of truth , or , like Prometheus , give to man as " alleviations of his state . " Among such explorers are Dr. WILLIAM H. PARK and his associates , who are setting out today upon a three-year expedition to discover if possible the means and methods of preventing or controlling infantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already to this problem , but though the microorganism which causes the disease is known , the possibility of developing an anti-serum vaccine " is a question of doubt . " Yet there is hope . The realization of that hope could hardly be possible without a special fund for the support of extensive as well as intensive research and experiment . This has happily been assured through the gift of Mr. JEREMIAH MILBANK of $250,000 . Grants are to be made to four of the leading universities of America and two abroad ( with the prospect of enlis - ing later the assistance of others ) , so as to encourage independent in ' vestigations , the results of which will be later coordinated . This research supplements what the city is doing in its own health laboratory , which , under the direction of Dr. , PARK since 1894 , has become , according to a statement made by Professor WINSLOW of Yale University , " the most important municipal public health laboratory in the world .

And it is not to be forgotten that this laboratory was started by Dr. HERMANN M. BIGGS , who also inaugurated the State health laboratories . One by one contagious diseases are being brought under measurable control . Dr. PARK stated two years ago that we had had only one case of smallpox in ten years . in New York , and that one came to the city from outside . It is believed to be possible , with general immunization , to put an end to diphtheria in a few years . The ravage of scarlet fever may now also be stayed . It is estimated that more than one hundred thousand people now living in New York City will be living a year from now who would have been dead except for what the health laboratories have done to save and prolong life . It can not be doubted that the field of control will be extended and that poliomyelitis will be prevented from laying its paralyzing hand upon children .
