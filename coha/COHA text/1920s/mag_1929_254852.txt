In Manhattan last week a rowdy , bloody battle broke aboard Authoress Joan Lowell 's first literary ship , The Cradle of the Deep ( TIME , March 18 ) . The book was published in March by Simon &; Schuster , playboys of the publishing world , who in 1927 promoted the bull-elephantine Trader Horn . <P> The whopper-publishers sent forth The Cradle of the Deep as " autobiography " - truth , human document , veracious account of the author 's first 17 years as a child of the sea aboard her father 's four-masted windjammer , the Minnie A. Caine , copra trader in the South Seas . The chaste and conservative Book-of-the-Month Club offered it to its 80,000 readers . The publishers offered it to the general public . Sales reached 107,000 . <P> In the great climactic chapter of her story , Authoress Lowell told of the burning and sinking of the Minnie A. Caine off the coast of Australia some seven years ago , she swimming three miles to a light-ship with a family of kittens clinging with their claws to her firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of the Minnie A. Caine , lying placidly at anchor in Oakland Harbor , Calif . She has been there for the past two years . Fact-finders were able to show that Joan Lowell and her father had been aboard the Minnie A. Caine about 15 months instead of 16 years . <P> Whopper-publishers Simon &; Schuster and Whopperess Lowell , replied cheerfully that she had used ' ' artistic selectivity . " Husband Thompson Buchanan , a journalist-playwright with Hollywood affiliations , admitted that it was true that his wife had lived on the Minnie A. Caine only a short time , but protested that she had lived on many another ship and that in her book she had merged all the real ships into one literary entity , thus demonstrating her good judgment . <P> The net result of the whole affair seemed to be just a lot more whacking good publicity for The Cradle of the Deep and for Simon &; Schuster as whopper-publishers , to whom any budding whopperist would do well to take his ( her ) manuscript .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
