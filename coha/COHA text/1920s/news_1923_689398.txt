txt As pointed out by The Wall Street Journal on September 5 , Baltimore &; Ohio directors in their June statement strongly intimated that a dividend would be declared on common stock out of earnings of the second six months of this year . At that time the board definitely appropriated out of first half year 's surplus the sum required to pay entire year 's dividend on preferred stock . Earnings of ' July and August , as stated , have covered current charges , with a surplus equal to $2.75 a share on common . There may he some question whether the appropriation of funds for preferred dividends satisfies the rights of the preferred stockholdprs , without actual declarations of their dividend for the second half of the year prior to declaration of any dividend on common .. If the lawyers decide that it does not , the board would have to declare the preferred dividend three months ahead of time in order to make any distribution on common . This question may come before the board at Wednesday 's meeting . In case it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be declared before action can be taken on the common , and directors are adverse to anticipating the December preferred declaration . common stockholders will be no worse off . In all probability the December meeting wig follow intent of the board 's June statement and declare a semi-annual dividend on the common , whereas any declaration at this week 's meeting could hardly be more than a quarterly dividend .
