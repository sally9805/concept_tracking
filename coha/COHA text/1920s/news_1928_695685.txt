txt The suit filed at Newark Thursday by Bethlehem Steel Co. and American Universal Co. against United States Steel Corp . and two of its subsidiaries for infringement of patents brings to a. head a situation that had been more or less of a disturbinr ; factor in the steel industry Car years . Eugene G. Grace , president of Bethlehem Steel Corp. , said no statement seems necessary with respect to tleth- , lehem 's action in filing suit against U. S. Steel Corp . and certain of its subsidiaries . As shown by the papers in the suit . Bethlehem 's claim , he said , is that U. S. Steel Corp . and subsidiaries have been and are manufacturing and selling certain steel products for which Bethlehem holds patent rights controlling the machinery used , the process and the products , and the purpose of the suit is simply to establish such claim . The Grey beam , over which conflict has arisen , owes its popularity to Charles M. Schwab . Early in the precent century , the inventor , Henry Grey . offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is reason to believe . United States Steel . It was rejected by one and all . When Mr. Schwab resigned from the presidency of United States Steel and purchased the Bethlehem Steel Co .. which later went into Bethlehem Steel Corp. , the patents were offered Bethlehem and at first rejected by the directors , because of the large expenditure , as it was then considered , needed to build a plant . Schwab 's ? Sudden Decision Mr. Schwab. the story goes , one night rang up his secretary at one a. rn. and ordered him to dress and meet him at the two a. m. train . " I do n't care what the directors say : I am going to build a Grey beam mill , sink or swim , and I am going to set about it the first thing this morning , " he is reputed to have said . The Grey beam completed justified Mr. Schwab 's expectations , proving highly profitable for Bethlehem Steel . It was not until a little over two years ago that it became known publicly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide flange beam , somewhat similar to the Grey beam , at a new mill at its Homestead plant . When this was called to the attention of the Bethlehem officials , Eugene G. Grace . president , said that Bethlehem 's patents were still rn effect . It was hinted at the time that the marketing of wide flange beams by any competitor might lead to a suit . A wide flange beam , however , was shortly afterward put on the market by Carnegie Steel . For Courts to Decide U. S. Steel ' Corp . interests have never admitted that they were manufacturing and selling the Grey beam . more commonly known as the Bethlehem section . They had been selling a wide flange beam . Whether this infringes the Bethlehem patents , it is. of courcs , for the courts to decide . Whether the filing of the suit indicates a renewal of the breach that once existed between the two greatest of our steel companies is conjectural . If it does , the consequence might be far-reaching in its effect on the steel industry and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possible that the suit is a not unfriendly effort to have settled definitely by the courts the tights of the two companies in the matter , in which event the suit should be beneficial .
