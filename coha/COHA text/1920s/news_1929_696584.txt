Editor of The Nem York Tines : In THE TIMES of today is a list of peed trips around the world , from rhich mine , made in August and eptember. 1911 , is omitted . The ! me was forty-six days and twentywo hours . I believe that this was h , e record . at the , time . for , a trip round to the west . DANIEL D. BIDWELL . East Hartford , Conn. , Aug. 30 , 1929 . THE OIL INDUSTRY . Vain Efforts to Bring About Limited Production . It is a curious example that the industry credited with the greatest sagacity should be precisely the one which has the hardest time managing its affairs . The petroleum business enjoys the highest reputation for genius of any latter-day activity . It has graduated a succession of wizards . Easily the first industry , properly speaking , of the United States ? " which is to say of the world , " as the American Petroleum Institute puts it ? it has drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the upshot ? A uniform state of defeat for everybody . Perhaps it is true that great generals are generals who have lost great battles . The oil industry started the year with a high resolve . Conservation of a great natural resource was the program which was to save the industry , the nation , and . tilt ! ' world . Oil men awaited only the formal signal to execute a well-matured world plan of sane production . It was judged fitting that the signal should come from the Federal Oil Conservation Board at Washington because it had guided the industry in its own internal reform . But at the capital " conservation " came suddenly to mean restriction of output , " stabilization " got translated into pricefixing , " overproduction " got somehow involved with the sinister , thought of governmental throttling of private opportunity . Clearly a conference would have to be called . A single careless word completely ! wrecked the Colorado Springs Con- ! fcrence . The word was " coercion . " Evidently there could be no coercion . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was manifestly high time to adjourn . The victorious nil-lease farmers set out for Washington to ask Congress for a tariff againstj Venezuelan crude , while the magnotes departed for London to negotiate with a Dutchman and an Englishman . All that was left behind of the spirit of conservation was cmbodied in an amiable and unintellH gible document announcing a new Code of Ethics , which by moral suasion alone would moderate competi-1 tion in the gasoline business . At London the attitude ? of Sir Henri ? Wilhelm Auguste Deterding was revealed by the Royal Dutch Shell 's American representative : Curtailment of production plans has broken down in the United States . Wide open conditions of output are prevailing in all of the principal oil fields of this nation . Yet the proposal is made to increase the export price . It is contrary to good business practice . If the price is raised now it will have to come down again . In the meantime , losses will be sustained by storage costs and evaporation and the repercussion on individual companies may be severe . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidence in the American oil industry may spring up in consuming markets of Europe . The matter must he looked at from the view of the buyer in London . Paris . Berlin or other European cities . The Export Petroleum Association was created not as a monopoly or a price-fixing agency but as a stabilizing influence in the interests of the people . the companies and the stockholders in those companies . With mounting production , in excess of requirements , it may be possible to hold supplies off the market for a time in the interests of orderly marketing . but supply and demand balance will return ultimately and the market might be seriously broken . Meanwhile- production of crude petroleum in this country alone has mounted to 2.900,000 barrels a day , 500.000 barrels a day more than a year ago . Imports from Venezuela have risen sharply . Stocks in storage are of gigantic proportions . There have been a few initial cuts of prices for crude in the field . Alone stands unyielding the price to the consumer .

New York , Sept. 1 . 1929 . Surface Car Delays . To lb , Eiltbo of The Nrir There are very few users of the surface cars of this city and Brooklyn that arc not unnecessarily inconvenienced , caused to lose time and frequently to miss trains because of the unconcern of the managers of the surface ear lines . Since the adoption of the traffic light system there is an effort on the part of all pedestrians , automobile and vehicle drivers to cross the street before the red light comes on . The exception to that sensible impulse is the street cars . While . they have the green light , they stop on the near side of an intersecting street in order to let off or take on passengers , and with the result that very frequently by the time the last passenger gets off or on the red light appears and the car with its load of passenger : is compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again .
