IT was not , genteel reader , the Con ? gressional Limited . In the first place , I am poor . In the second place , I smoke too much . In the third place , I never have , in compartments set aside for the privacies of men , those happy encounters which furnish so much copy for my livelier contemporaries . On the black-leather lounge I invariably find myself next to a gentleman who asks me what line I am in . Disturbing question ! If I lie I am sure to get caught . And if I tell the truth my interlocutor gulps , looks for the brass vessel of uncleanness , briefly inspects the scenery , and relapses into a doze . I therefore prefer the smok ? ing car of an ordinary train , where one is freer and where the society is at once more varied and less exacting . On this occasion , however , the society was rather more numerous than I had foreseen . In fact there was no free seat . And I was a little irritated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctity of the smoker but had reversed the back of a seat in order that she and her husband might each preempt a win ? dow . They were a rather fubsy pair whom in the half light I took to be im ? migrants ? although the native daughter has latterly been observed to find her way into my part of the train . I in ? stalled myself , with my mumbled apol ? ogy , with my week-end bag , with my book , and not without my air of slightly offended dignity , next the man , who faced the direction in which the train was about to start . Before it started a fourth member squeezed himself , by no means jubi ? lantly , into our none too hospitableparty . This was a glum-looking man , neither tall nor emaciated , with grizzled hair and a receding forehead and chin , who carried a brief-case . He looked as if he might be a tout for an uplift organ ? ization , carrying statistics down to Wash ? ington to confound Congressmen withal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronize smoking cars and usually travel by limited trains . However , he immediately began to re ? fresh his memory of his statistics . The lights of the platform slowly began to recede , we glided into an area of sunken daylight , dived into darkness under the Hudson . This proceeding seemed to interest the two by the win ? dows , who exchanged remarks in Italian . So that guess was right ! We emerged upon the Hackensack Meadows and went through the usual tedious perform ? ance at Manhattan Transfer . That done , I waited only to glance , before running through Newark , at the river with its curve , its factories , its black piles , its rotting hulks , which , to my un ? ending amazement , etchers steadfastly refuse to etch . Then I opened my new copy of Mr. Van Wyck Brooks ' The Pil ? grimage of Henry James , the last page of which I would probably reach around Baltimore . My calculation , as my calculations usually do , proved inexact . We were still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dis ? heartening than those of Picardy , Aisne , or Champagne , when I fell into conver ? sation with the Italians . It happened because the conductor tried to turn the woman out ? not rudely , really , but be ? cause he was a man of his generation and because she was a foreigner who probably did not understand the rules of the game . She did not ? even when he explained that there was a free seat in the car behind . She appealed to her husband , they examined their tickets , inquired whether this were not the Phila ? delphia train , said something about First and Second Class . That , of course , at once got everybody into deep water . I accordingly took a hand , telling the conductor not to bother about the woman and explaining to her and her husband that in America we had a little convention . We carefully avoided the terms First Class , Second Class , Third Class , etc. , in order to give ourselves the pleasure of believing that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , there were wagons where by payment of additional sums one might enjoy a little more space , slightly stuffier cush ? ions , and the attentions at the end of the journey of a dark-skinned gentleman in a peaked cap . Our little convention interested the Italians , who remarked on its similarity to one which used to prevail on the Hun ? garian steamers running between Fiume and Venice , where the Prima elasse was less luxurious than the Glasse di Lusso . Still , during their three weeks in America they had noted that we had other little conventions . And of course by that time I had found out that my first guess would have to be revised a bit . For al ? though not members of the great world , perhaps , they turned out not to be im ? migrants by any means . In fact the man 's English was far more correct and fluent than my Italian . It was his wife who was the more at sea among us . She could , and did , read Vitman and Poe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but conversing with their fellow countrymen she found more complicated . Italian , for instance , was pronounced as it was written ; whereas English ? ! The English of New York , too , she found more mystifying than the English of Loudon . And to a foreigner some of our conventions really did seem a trifle abstruse . It lasted all the way to Philadelphia ? whither my companions were bound , I learned , in order to satisfy a whim of the lady 's to get a glimpse of le foresee splendide d'America . I patriotically as ? sured her that they existed , the splendid forests of America ; that some of them , though not the most splendid , even ex ? isted within a few hours ' run of New York , if not on the way to Philadelphia . She was greatly disappointed . She had suffered , it appeared , disappointments and surprises not a few : the expense of living and getting about ; the difficulty of finding a decent meal at a decent price , and something decent to sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , the immigration authorities , the scant courtesy with which they had often been treated ? having no great sums to spend ? in hotels , shops , street cars , theaters ; the affair of getting one 's shoes cleaned ; the lack of facilities for diverting oneself , as she put it , easily , simply , quietly . And the devastation of the country through which we rolled , especially in the vicinity of the towns , obviously surprised and distressed her . We rolled swiftly and smoothly , it was true , and the train was gigantic in com ? parison to a little Italian rapido or di ? retto . Still , it struck her that the four of us would have been better , less crowded , perhaps more private , in a compartment . " You should take a night journey , " I said , " in order to try one of our sleep ? ing cars . Gigantic as you please , but without a place to dress or undress in except lying flat on your back in a box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We have something like that be ? tween Rome and Palermo , " she replied , " in the Second Class . But what would you ? It is in truth a New World ? with ? out cypresses , without olives , without stone pines , without nightingales . No walls , no wine , no balconies , no places to sit before dinner or in the evening ? on the sidewalk , under an awning or a grapevine . You do n't sing or play gui ? tars in the street , you do n't kiss , you do n't stab ! What do you do ? That is what I must find out ! " As for the man , he was plainly not enchanted ; but he was as plainly inter ? ested , if perhaps less outspoken than his wife . He found our post office , the his ? tory of registering a letter or sending a parcel , our arrangements fur checking and delivering baggage infinitely sim ? pler , more convenient , and less exasper ? ating than in Italy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vices for saving time and labor . Yet , of course , we did have those little con ? ventions . What interested him not least was our convention about liberty . In Italy one still had a king , to be sure . One also had Mussolini ! But after all one was allowed to wear a hat of a mark different from the next man 's hat , to swallow a quarter of a liter in peace . He was a professor in a university ( which interested him the more in the ass-eared towers of Princeton , discovered on their up-tilted sky line and so described by his wife ) and latterly he had been a Dep ? uty in Parliament . Having had some ? thing to do with questions of emigration , he had wished to see for himself . Well , he saw ! He saw for instance that while an American in Italy might quietly be smiled at , had even given rise to a noun which describes anything bizarre , eccen ? tric , fantastic , extravagant , exaggerated ? an americanata ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personage . For he frequented the first hotels , and he was an appreciable source of revenue . Whereas an Italian in America might also be a source of revenue . Otherwise his serv ? ices would hardly be so much in demand . But because he was generally poor and seldom frequented the first hotels , he and his fellow countrymen seemed to be re ? garded as persons of no consequence whatever , whose rights and feelings it did not appear necessary to consider . Yet the Deputato did not see so much but what he asked me whether there were official languages for the Parlia ? ment at Washington , or whether each Deputy spoke in his own ? English , Italian , German , Norwegian , Armenian , Polish , Yiddish , Greek , as the case might be . indeed , he was extremely surprised when I told him that English alone was the official language of our Parliament and that , so far as I knew , no Deputy had ever addressed it in any other . He had seen , he said , papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alphabet . Even . Arabic . We parted regretfully at Philadelphia , having formed imperishable ties , having also exchanged cards , addresses , augu ? ries of future meetings . But the glum-looking man , I observed with regret , did not disappear as well . Nor did he , as any right-minded uplift tout would have done , readjust the back of his seat , sit down with his own back to me , and con ? tinue to refresh his memory with regard to the contents of his brief-case . On the contrary , he merely shoved along toward the window and proceeded to eye me without shame or admiration . " Do you find that even reading about Henry James bores you ? " he presently inquired , seizing a lax moment when I was watching for such water glimpses as the vicinity of Philadelphia affords . " Well , " I replied not too encourag ? ingly , " I have n't had much chance yet . But reading Henry James himself does n't bore me , if that 's what you mean . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least have the courage of your convictions . " " I do n't see , " I let out with a certain irritation , " that it takes any courage to say what you like or do n't like . Of course I know it 's the fashion to knock the man . It has been ever since I first came across him ? which was in the day of Robert Louis Stevenson , Richard Harding Davis , and Jack London . But the kind of thing he wrote about I knew something about from my own experi ? ence . And it struck me that he was more grown up , however long-winded and roundabout he might be , than Jack London or Richard Harding Davis , or a few other people I might mention . " " Well , there 's something in that , " conceded the glum-looking man . " De gustibus , and so forth . But it strikes me that he missed getting on the band ? wagon . And whatever wagon he did get on to , he was certainly roundabout and long-winded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he saw . " " Mat of it ? " I demanded . " There 's more than one way to dress a hare . Per ? sonally , I like to try different people 's ways . Nor do I see why his way is so impossible as they make out . At any rate there are all sorts of queer and up ? setting little dramas that go on in people 's heads , under the rough and ready surface of life , and once in a while it amuses me to see how lie ferrets them out . In doing it he certainly did n't use the language of the telegraph office . I fancy there may have been something in the fact that he never wrote poetry and did n't greatly care for music . That must have meant that his ear for the sound and cadence of words was in one way less keen than some people 's . But he had an ear for sounds , and the mean ? ing of them , like an Indian 's ? or a chauf ? feur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us never notice , " The glum-looking man did n't object to that . But neither did he assent to it . He merely continued to eye me ? without shame and without admiration . " As for band-wagons , " I went on , get ? ting up steam , " you rather remind me of a prize-story competition that once made quite a splash in New York . The jury consisted of a publisher , a news ? paper editor , and a politician who had written a little , not too ungrammatically , in a historical vein ? which was as if for the jury of a portrait show they had picked out a dealer in miscellaneous art objects , a sign painter , and a modeler of patriotic figurines . Anyhow they made a report rejoicing over the fact that so many of the stories submitted were American , that so few had to be thrown out because they strayed beyond our frontiers . And they gave the prize to a story about a negro in the Philip ? pines ? the negro being in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American flag . One hundred per cent American , you see ! I suppose they would have argued that Merimee was not on the French band ? wagon because he wrote Carmen , that Flaubert was not on the band-wagon be ? cause of Salammb6 , that Stendhal and the Chartreuse de Parme , or Anatole France and Thais were not on the band ? wagon . Kipling , of course , was band ? wagon pure and simple , through the happy accident of India being a part of the British Empire . But Conrad , poor wretch ? where was his band-wagon ? " However , band-wagons were pretty dubious articles here when Henry James appeared on the scene ? in the forties , fifties , sixties , and seventies , to say nothing of the eighties , when taste and common sense reached in this country a depth of degradation which Heaven help us from ever coming in sight of again . Would you have preferred , for example , that he should mount the band-wagon of General Grant and the Reconstruction - Mansard- Roof period ? Mark Twain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and found a band-wagon which suited them , which suits us even better than it did our fathers . But why should you complain that Henry James did n't get aboard of it too ? He could n't help the fact that he was born well-to-do instead of poor , that he had a queer philosophical un ? standardized father who did n't want his boys to grow up in American streets , that he was dragged from Albany to New York , from New York to Boston , from Boston to Newport , from America to Europe and back again , without ever getting a chance to strike root ; that he had an unappeasable taste for decent houses , and landscapes that did n't look like the mouth of a mine , and people with civilized manners . Where on earth was he to find them ? Certainly not in New York , in 1870 . No , sir ! And to waste time , breath , or temper over the fact that at the end of a long life , in cir ? cumstances of peculiar disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of our race among whom he had found a home , or over the fact that he was not what he was not , is simply to skip the whole point of him . " The point is that he , and in his time he alone , portrayed a certain American predicament of which he was agonizingly conscious but Whitman and Mark Twain were n't , the predicament evoked for us by those Italians who were sitting here a little while ago ? of a transplanted European ( for that is what we Ameri ? cans really are ) with all the tastes , in ? stincts , and traditions of a civilized race , confronted by all the ugliness , meanness , and barrenness of New York and Boston in the Brown Stone Age . It is n't nearly so bad now ; but then it must have been unspeakable ? for a certain type of per ? son sensitive to the look and connota ? tions of things , and aware , as Whitman and Mark Twain were not , of what such things are in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as no one else ever did or ever can ? for it is no longer so sharp as it used to be . " And he did another thing . His scale of contrasts was n't visual only . It was psychological too . I ca n't think of anybody else who has understood Ameri ? cans so well , for instance , as to find the way to portray a certain type we propa ? gate ? of great simplicity , loyalty , genu ? ineness , good faith , in high relief against the rich , the colored , the complicated , the sophisticated , not to say cynical or occasionally sinister background of an older and harder world . And I notice that some of our contemporaries appear either to have had similar perceptions or to have read their maligned prede ? cessor with profit . There is no Adam Verver or Milly Theale in The Tattooed Countess ; but that book is Henry James cut down and done over in words of onesyllable , ad usum Delphini . I even have suspicions of Mr. Sinclair Lewis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? ground of contrast is n't visible and he uses words of two syllables . " This time the glum-looking man fa ? vored me with a reply , although with an inadequate one : " There is probably something in what you say . I do n't know much about these things . But of course no man is responsible for the time of his birth , the circumstances of his bringing up , or the particular slant on life which he inher ? ited or had pounded into him ? any more than he is for the color of his eyes or the shape of his nose . " I regarded the glum-looking man 's nose . It was not handsome , to be char ? itable to it . But as he showed no in ? clination to pursue the subject farther , I opened Van Wyck Brooks again , who certainly would not be finished by Bal ? timore ? or Washington either . How ? ever , I got in a chapter or two before the brakeman interrupted me by bawling " Wil-ming-ton ! Wil-ming-ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next and more welcome interruption of the hollow roar we made in rattling across the Susquehanna . I looked out , as I always do , for that long narrow woody island . Rivers are admirable , but islands are perfect . " Do you know Joachim du Belay ? " suddenly asked the glum-looking man . " Not too well , " I confessed . I had n't suspected the glum-looking man of that ! " This river , because it has nothing to do with the case , I suppose , always re ? minds me of a thing he wrote when lie came back from Rome . My accent is n't very good , but it goes something like this : Plus que Is marbre dur me plait I ' ardoise fine , Plus mon Loyre gaulois que is Tybre latin , Plus mon petit Lyre que is moat palatin , Et plus que Pair marin la douceur angerine . " ' His accent , as a matter of fact , was not bad . " Yes , " I said , " but how about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to forswear hard marble for pointed slate and the Tiber for the Loire . " " Never mind . They will come , " said the glum-looking man . " In fact they are on the way already ? just as some of them were on the Loire when du Bellay came home from Rome . " He said it with such conviction , ey ? ing me anew , that I resigned myself to the inevitable . I put a cigarette into Van Wyck Brooks for a book mark . " You see I happened to be born a generation later than Henry James , which got me out of the Grant era by the time I was ready to grow up . I also happened to be born on the other side , which get me out of being dragged there as a boy . The places I was dragged to were New York and Boston . To me , therefore , they were the novelty ? not London and Paris . " So we were in for the chapter of con ? fidences ! At any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunpowder Creek . " Paris ! " went on the glum-looking man . " Paris excites me about as much as your mother-in-Iaw . I admit that it 's an interesting and well laid out city . But why on earth people go so crazy about it beats me . It is n't as if they knew beans about its history , or lan ? guage , or literature , or collections , or architecture . If they did they would know that ten times better houses are being built in New York or Kansas City to-day than in Paris . All they know is that it 's a more amusing town to get divorced in than Reno , that food on the whole is better for the money than over here , that you can get soused there with ? out breaking the law or poisoning your ? self , that women 's clothes and gimcracks are likely to be good if expensive , that there is no Anti-Vice Society to inter ? fere with your recreations , that Mont ? martre is packed with dives where every-thing goes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French people , to be sure , but of all the scum of North and South America , and that there 's no place in the world where it 's so easy to pick up or to get picked up by mistresses and lovers of the more ephemeral sort . That 's all there is to Paris , so far as Americans are concerned . " It was my turn to eye the glum-looking man , without shame and ? without admi ? ration ? But he was n't through with me . " I suppose one thing about it was that as an infant the greatest rarity in the world for me , and the most desirable , was another American infant to scuffle with . I never quite got over that . Nor could I ever quite fathom what so many Americans were up to over there , among dark queer oily-eyed people who for me had n't a particle of charm or mystery . And afterwards , when I went back to make out what I could about it , all I could make out was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? cans if I could help it , always mooning about France and Italy , always exciting shrugs and winks among thenati ves , never really at home there or anywhere else . " And then , you know , there was an ? other thing ? as you say . I happened to be on hand when , at the beginning of the century , something happened to New York . I was perhaps the better able to watch what happened because I sat in a small room high in a tower ? the Hispano ? Mauresque tower on top of which St. Gaudens ' Diana drew her long bow . There was no Metropolitan Tower then to overshadow her . And when I went there that big jolly red-headed Stanford White , who had so much to do with what happened to New York , was still sitting in his studio between Diana and me . I forget whether Peter Cooper Hewitt and his unearthly green lights were above or below Stanford White . However , the Flatiron was new , the old Fifth Avenue Hotel flourished on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the publish ? ing houses were all down town . Part of what is now the lawn of Grace Church was a Vienna Bakery with a trellised court in front of it , where I often took my coffee of a morning . There was a Greenwich Village , but not the expen ? sive class-conscious Greenwich Village of to-day . It was merely a sort of slum , more red brick than brown stone and more accessible than Corlear 's Hook , Sutton Place , or Hell 's Kitchen , where rents were within reach of people like Jules Guerin and Willa Cather . Later on I tried it myself for a while ? before moving to a sailors ' hotel in South Street . But Times Square had yet to be invented . It was Longa cre then . And I was one of the Four Million for whom it was in ? vented . " I saw the Times Building go up , what was then the Knickerbocker Hotel , the Astor , the Belmont , half the inns arid theaters in the place . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventh and Ninth Avenues and uncover a fabulous cavern in the rock , out of which slowly rose the steel and granite of the Pennsylvania Station . I saw other acres , all over town , of brown stone , melt away , meta ? morphose themselves into white lime ? stone and Joachim du Bellay 's hard marble . I rode in the first subway , on the first day it was opened to traffic ? from South Ferry and Brooklyn Bridge to the Grand Central , and then under Forty-Second Street to Times Square and up Broadway . I saw Broadway fade and go out ? though to the country at large it is still , not altogether un ? justly , the symbol of all that is most brilliant and most sophisticated in New York . I saw the Fifth Avenue , as Mr. James calls it , transform itself from one of the ugliest streets in the world into one of the most splendid . I followed every detail of the Library as it grew up on the site of that hideous old reser ? voir in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winter pile one brick of the Hippodrome on another , melting the snow and ice with a steam hose as they went along , and marked how Park Avenue , especially around the rebuilt Grand Central Station , made re ? ality out of those fanciful old engrav ? ings of cyclopean architecture . I saw bridge after bridge slung across the East River , above the one which was there alone when you and I were born . " Those were days when the New York sky was scaled every morning by taller , steeper , wilder pinnacles , fired every evening by constellations as com ? mercial as you please but every evening newer , stranger , more audacious , more magical , in the ripple and glitter of their sidereal jewelry . And those were sights to see . Paris ca n't beat them . No doubt they have been and will be surpassed . No doubt many mistakes were made , many follies committed , many horrors perpetrated , many charms and memories destroyed . Nevertheless , there was in it something epic to catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been alive at that time , hi that place . I am not ashamed to belong to that race and generation . No other had seen that not a corner or two of Manhat ? tan Island but the whole of it , from the Battery to Inwood Hill , was destined to be the heart of its city . It went far to atone for the parochial shortsightedness and washerwoman 's taste of Gouverneur Morris , Simon De Witt , and John Ruth ? erford , who a century earlier , in 1811 , knew no better than to lay out the New York from which Henry James fled , mar ? tyrized it upon an inept gridiron , threw away its water front , and otherwise did their worst to ruin forever one of the most magnificent sites in the world . " I stared at the glum-looking man with some astonishment . He certainly had a line ! " It was a crime , " I agreed feebly . " Even Brooklyn is better , appalling as it is , because half a dozen gridirons are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little irregularity by the necessity of tying up their loose ends . " But the glum-looking man was n't thinking about Brooklyn ? or Manhat ? tan either . " ' Westward the star of empire --  ' " he began to quote . " Was n't it Addison who got off some blurb like that ? Em ? pires are n't so fashionable as they were in Addison 's day . Still , there is a pen ? dulum that swings in history . There are places , here and there , now and then , where something flares up for a while . Well , I have a notion that something may be getting ready to flare up here . Of course , we are often a century or a season behind Europe , in ideas , in fashions . How should it be otherwise ? We have n't been going long enough . Time and again have I come home from London , or even from Dresden , wearing in all innocence a tie or a hat which made people nudge one another on the street -- only to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time mine was worn out . I remember read ? ing Jean . Christophe , Pearsall Smith 's Trivia , Artsibashev 's Sanin on the other side , years before anybody but James Huneker had heard of them over here . But I notice that the interval is shorter than it used to be . Marcel Proust crossed the ocean much more quickly . " And I notice other things . This country used to be a region of myth and mist out of which poured into better lighted parts of the world an unceasing stream of rather unsympathetic tourists and into which , by some invisible process of suction , disappeared a counter stream of ' antiques ' and articles de Paris . It never occurred to anybody to find out what had happened to them . England was thinking about that ticklish empire of hers , France was meditating on la revanche and in gloire , Germany was up to God knows what . To be sure , they turned a spyglass on us once in a while . Washington interested them a moment . Monroe made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Grant and Lee brought out a Voild ! ' McKinley and Roosevelt caused them to ejaculate ' liens ! ' And Wilson ? then they be ? gan , under their breath , to mutter " H 'm ! " It bad never come into their heads before to look into the phenome ? non of the two streams . Who knows ? Either of those streams , or both of them , might some day slacken ? or even cease altogether . " " Close all the windows ! " interrupted the brakeman again . " Windows closed for the Baltimore tunnels ! " But he did n't interrupt the glum-looking man . " Anyhow , the German War was the end of an era . It definitely revealed the fact that the United States , however in ? adequately , exists . In 1918 it was dis ? covered by some that we could fight ? as cheerfully and nastily as anybody . It was discovered by others that we had certain notions , which might be as fool ? ish as the next man 's but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it was discovered that we were in a position to go on making ourselves heard and felt , partly because of the uncomfortable narrowing of the world , partly because we were so fantastically well off . We had not really changed , or suddenly grown more formidable . It was merely that we turned out to come surprisingly near filling the popular specifications of a grand seigneur . Emotions always have to be paid for , and we are not immune from that disagreeable law : witness the Civil War . But we do n't have to pay so heavily for our emotions of 1917 and 1918 as some other people have to pay for theirs . Hence the wide acceptance of the fact that we are now somebody . . . . And after this the tide of travel across the Atlantic wo n't be in one direction only . " Look at your Italians . Ten or twenty years ago who ever heard of an obscure Tuscan professor or member of Parliament , probably with a smaller in ? come than yours or mine , spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what it was like ? If he was famous and could get money out of us , that was another thing . But those people get out of us nothing but amuse ? ment and discomfort and , I am afraid , a good deal of impoliteness . Still , they may some day come back and get more . Or if they do n't , other professors and members of Parliament , rich idlers , poor scholars , all sorts of people , will come too ? in larger and larger numbers . Some of them will come merely to amuse themselves . Others will come because for political reasons it is important to find out what kind of animals we really are . More and more will come because in order to find out something about Chi ? nese and Japanese art , or Egyptian an ? tiquities , or certain European painters , or early editions of English , French , German , and Italian books , it has be ? come necessary to study our collections . " The Old World used to teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pected that the New World may have something to teach the Old . For quite a while the fine art of filling teeth was the only one which foreigners deigned to learn from us . Other arts like plumb ? ing , steel construction , flying , jazz music , and the new kind of dancing which goes with it , followed . It gradually came out , too , that we were not bad at sports ? even at such essentially British ones as golf , tennis , polo , rowing , sailing , boxing . Where we lagged behind was in science and the finer arts . Which is as it should be . Life comes before learning and art , if the cart is not to precede the horse . Still , certain little mechanical and elec ? trical tricks of ours have enjoyed quite a vogue in more civilized countries where it is known as well that , after others had given it up as a bad job , we contrived a short cut from the Atlantic to the Pacificand found a way to make Panama as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once reigned in London , two of our poets have ruled over Paris , there have even been other an ? swers to the famous question about an American book . An abrupt and silent young man who paddled the Merrimac River , climbed Mount Katandin , and camped by Walden Pond while all sorts of terrifying monstrosities were being built and admired in Boston , New York , and Washington , could tell you some ? thing about that . So could your friend Henry James . And his brother could tell you something about hooks of a more sci ? entific sort . In fact , I hear the interesting news that there are now more foreigners in American universities than Ameri ? cans studying abroad . Just you wait . When ? " " Bal-ti-more ! " bawled the brakeman ( which is by no means the way in which the inhabitants pronounce the name of that agreeable town ) . " All out for Bal ? timore ! The next stop is Washington ! " " Gracious !

" He and his brief-case disappeared . I took my cigarette out of Van Wyck Brooks . Then it occurred to me that I had n't exchanged cards with the glum-looking man .
