txt A momentous decision determining the future of the British Navy may be looked for shortly . The subcommittee of the Council of Imperial Defense , which was appoiskted in ' December last to investigate the question of naval strength as affected by the latest developments of naval war- ; I fare , has examined numerous expert witnesses , and there is reason to believes , says The Daily Ohroniele 's Parliamentary correspondent , that the subcommittee will decide against a continuation of the " big ship " policy . The preponderating effect of the evidence given before the subcommittee is understood to point to this conclusion in a definite and practical way . The subcommittee consists of Bonar Law , Walter Long , Winston Churchill , Sir Robert Horne , Sir Eric Geddes and Earl Beatty . It was decided at the outset to take evidence upon the position of the big battleship and the battle cruiser in relation to the latest developments and in the light of the experiences of the- latewar . One of those invited to give evidence was Sir Percy Scott , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times a vigorous campaign against battleships , on the ground tilat they had proved themselves useless , but he declined the invitation , which he described as a " trap to muzzle " him . If the forecast of the subcommittee 's decision turns out to be correct , Sir Percy may regret that he did not avail himself of the opportunity of emphasizing his belief in the uselessness of the capital ship . The Arguments ' Against the Big Ship . The evidence given before the subcommittee , according to The Chronicle 's Parliamentary correspondent , brought out the following arguments against a continuation of the big ship policy : First ? A continuation and extension of the big ship program would involve the country in a naval expenditure which would be absolutely crushing and would render any serious effort to reduce the war debt impossible of achievement . Second  --  The cost of the capital ship would not only swell from ? 3,000,000 to f0 , ( .0000 , but the cost would not stop there . Every such ship would require a flotilla of cruisers and destroyers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from attack by submersibles . Instead of 49 000,000 , the cost of each naval unit would probably be increased in this way to ? 14,000,000 or ? 15,000,000 . Third  --  There is neither dock nor harbor accommodation , sufficient . In only a few ports could such leviathans as are proposed find a safe ' anchorage , to say nothing of being berthed . An immediate result of a . big ship program on a new scale would be an immense expenditure on docks and harbors . May Cost Services of Beatty . " These considerations , among others , " says , the correspondent , " have undotedly had weight with the subcommittee . Their . cumulative influence is so convincing that the deduction can hardly err that it is all against the big ship policy . " A decision on these lines may cost the fleet the services of Admiral Beatty . On the other hand , it may not . The commander of the Grand Fleet has seen more than one naval policy scrapped or superseded during the last six years and his views may by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the view of the subcommittee .
