Hotel guests , not managers , took the initiative in the first effort to bring religion into the hotel . <P> They were two traveling salesmen and an insurance agent , who happened to be crowded together in one hotel room , in Boscobel , Wis. , 30 years ago . All earnest <P> Christians , they lamented that no Bible was handy . They organized the society of Gideons , which aims to place a Bible in every hotel room in the world , and has distributed nearly a million copies . <P> Last week it was a hotel manager-John McEntee Bowman , president of the Bowman Biltmore Hotels Corporation-who took the initiative in a new effort . <P> On the third floor of the Hotel Biltmore in New York a " Meditation Chapel " was opened , for guests and employes alike . It contained benches and a small altar , on which flowers will be kept fresh every day . Over the altar was the inscription , " Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meditation chapels " will be installed as soon as practicable in all other hotels operated by the corporation . Said Mi . Bowman : " The presence of one spot in the hotel , dissociated from the wordly things of life and dedicated to the God we profess to serve , is now recognized as a spiritual necessity .
