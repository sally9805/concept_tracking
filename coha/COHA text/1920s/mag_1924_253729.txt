In name and membership the National Museum of Engineering and Industry , Inc. , already exists . But it has no home . Its sponsors now propose to erect one on the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington . Its present headquarters are in the Engineering Societies Building , Manhattan . <P> Here would dwell the models of inventions , once revolutionary , now antiquated . Here the First Cause of street cars , steamboats , telephones could be seen . " In this way the U. S. will be given the kind of institution which all the great European nations have possessed for years . " <P> In the American plan , however , a departure is proposed , made necessary by the vastness of the territory . In addition to the central collection at Washington , special collections-such as replicas of historical exhibits-will be sent about for public view . Also " live machinery " of various modern processes will be placed in affiliated museums in the industrial centres of every State . <P> A number of very old models and records have already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new organization . <P> It was he who received this year the Kelvin Gold Medal from ) the Royal Society , at the Kelvin Centenary in London , " in recognition of his preeminence in those branches of engineering with which Baron Kelvin's* scientific work and researches were identified . " <P> Dr. Thomson 's first important invention dates from 1876-a centrifugal separator for fluids of different density . He achieved the thorough lamination of armature cores , and in 1889 greatly improved electric-lighting apparatus . Other inventions are : <P> a constant-current regulator for arc light dynamos ( he perfected the arc lamp ) , the induction motor , the art of welding metals by electricity , the magnetic blow-out for switches , lightning erectors of various types , constant current transmitters , a generator which was " one of the first and most effective and ingenious " in early electrical development , a recording watt hour metre . In the field of mechanical engineering he is respon sible for important developments in steam engines , steam turbines and the internal combustion engine . <P> Remarkable as is Benjamin G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Elihu Thomson has 700 . <P> <P> *Baron William Thomson Kelvin , born in Belfast in 1824 , was the most eminent physicist of his time . He published over 300 original papers covering every branch of physical science . He made possible submarine telegraphy , and invented practically all the instruments used by electrical engineers for measurement-.
