<P> While even great and good men have occasionally made sport of Virtue , in every age , it is still venerated with the utmost pomp by a Germanic branch of that famed brotherhood of nobles , The Order of St. John of Jerusalem . <P> Every knight of St. John swears to " protect women , the orphans , and the weak , " and must possess a name untouched by scandal . Last week , in Berlin , there was inaugurated as Grand Master of the Order of St. John a gentleman whose virtue is unsmirched , Prince Oscar Charles Gustav-Adolf von Hohenzollern , 38 , fifth son of onetime King and Emperor Wilhelm II . <P> On July 31 , 1914 ( the day before Germany declared war on Russia ) Prince Oscar , then a youth of 26 , utterly disgusted the Court by espousing in morganatic union a comparative nobody : Ina Maria , Countess of Brassewitz .

I swear it with the greatest possible pleasure ! " <P> Even so , the Order of St. John did not depose its Grand Master upon such flimsy , hearsay tittle-tattle . At last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had caused her " mental anguish . " Presumably this violated his oath to " protect women . . . and weak . " A conclave of ' the Order of St. John met secretly , accepted the resignation of Prince Eitel-Friedrich as Grand Master , then declared him " an honorary Knight of St. John . " <P> Only last week , eight months after the resignation of Prince Eitel-Friedrich , was the Order of St. John moved to invest Prince Oscar as Grand Master , after an exhaustive investigation of his private life . <P> <P> * Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie Luise ( 1776-1810 ) is chiefly famed because of her personal appeal to Napoleon at his camp in Tilsit after the battle of Jena ( 1806 ) . She begged him to have mercy upon Prussia , but was only partially successful in obtaining certain concessions which enabled the Prussian army eventually to build up its strength ,
