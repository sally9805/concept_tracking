Twenty-two million eggs , flounder eggs , traveled in a baggage car last week from Woods Hole , Mass. , where the Government maintains a fish hatchery , to Jamaica Bay , L. I. There they were dumped into the coast waters to hatch and grow . In three years , the new flounders will be big enough to catch and eat . The ocean around New York Harbor is too filthy for flounders to breed naturally .
