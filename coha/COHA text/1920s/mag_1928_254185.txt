Last week , the U. S. convened . <P> Philadelphia played host to bankers . <P> From the speech-making at the convention of the American Institute of Banking , earnest assistant cashiers culled these thoughts : <P> Bad checks ( forged , bogus , worthless , raised , altered ) are on the increase , both as to number and amounts involved . <P> Collection of checks by airplane will save money . A bank receives a check for $5,000,000 on a town 150 miles away , collects by airplane and gains one day 's interest ( about $625 at 4% ) . <P> Women in the financial world have a greater patience for detail than men , find feminine intuition useful . <P> Picklepackers , gathered at Chicago , gave way to general rejoicing . They hailed the creation of a new market , a substitute for the free lunch counters which vanished with prohibition . Thanks to the nation 's womanhood , bent on reducing , the industry is convalescent . <P> Eyes glistened , mouths watered , as C. J. Sutphen , pickle premier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crisp celery and olives and covered with cracked ice , pickles have held the rank of first of the American hors d'oeuvres . The most jaded of appetites respond to the stimulus of the pickle . " Comparing notes , jubilant picklepackers reported mounting sales , renewed popularity of pickles , plain and fancy , sweet and sour , dill , warted . <P> More determination than rejoicing marked the conferences of 100 macaroni and noodle manufacturers , also at Chicago . Olive-skinned , dark-eyed , they shouted Vivas when they heard Chief Noodle-maker Henry Mueller of New York announce that the average Italian eats four miles of macaroni a year . But they shook their heads dolefully at the pitiful 211 feet which is the per capita ration of the U. S. <P> Patriotically , they noted that in time of war the U. S. could squeeze its own dough , ooze it through its own long , skinny tubes , hang it up in its own drying-rooms , economically independent of macaroni-mad Italy . <P> " Stay East , young man , " counselled potent Meatpacker F. Edson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Omaha convention of the National Live Stock and Meat Board . Middle Western farmers , declared Meatpacker White , should discourage " back-to-the-farm " propaganda , should hope for fewer farmers , higher prices . Confounding calamity howlers , he compared yearly incomes of farmers in the Middle West with the national average . His comparison : Nebraska $4,010 ; South Dakota , $3,356 ; Iowa , $4,180 ; Kansas , $3,020 ; U. S. average , $2,350 . <P> Louisville heard the roar of airplanes , the rumble of private railroad cars , and knew that Indiana 's 89 realtors had arrived for the convention of the National Association of Real Estate Boards . Marion Stump , chosen to sing the praises of Indianapolis corner lots and bungalows , hoped to win the bitterly-fought " home town talk " contest . Hoosiers , among others , learned that the woman in the family buys the house , after considering these advantages : accessibility to golf courses , colored tile bathrooms , low window sills .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
