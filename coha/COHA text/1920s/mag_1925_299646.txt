Steel boats-900 bottoms in varying sizes-lie listless in U.S. estuaries . It cost about one billion dollars to make them and it costs the U. S. about $2,700,000 to keep them from one Christmas to the next . <P> Many a keen industrialist who keeps his eyes on things has proposed to buy them for scrap at scrap prices . But all was not generally known until the Chairman of the Shipping Board ( " T. V. O'C. " ) made a speech , last week , to some travelers on a boat plying between Detroit and Buffalo . <P> Mr. O'Connor simply said he had had audience with Henry Ford , from whom he had wrung a tentative offer to take 400 of the listless bottoms at something between $1 and $7 per ton ( scrap price ) . At $3 per ton , the entire listless fleet of 5,700,000 tons would bring about $17,000,000 . Mr. Ford would probably pay about half that for about half the fleet-all is quite vague . Mr. Ford thought he might use 30 or perhaps only 10 for commerce ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most inveterate bargain-hunters in the country . Old inns , old sap-buckets , old railways delight him . Particularly , he has been interested in dilapidated things which the Government has vainly clung to . Refused Muscle Shoals on his own terms , he now considers the idle fleet . Selling things to Mr. Ford , however , is no royal road to fortune . <P> His offer aroused little enthusiasm among the other members of the Shipping Board . It was received with some favor by business men , one of whom hoped that the Shipping Board would follow the boats into the junk pile : " Let the tail go with the hide . " Furtively , shipowners , native and foreign , prayed for the demolition of the ships because , bad as they are , they constitute a vaguely potential threat of competition . <P> <P> *Said Mr. Ford to the press : " Why , do you know it will cost us approximately $400,000 to get ready to pull the ships apart .
