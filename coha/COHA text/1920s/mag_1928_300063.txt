Seat . A New York Stock Exchange seat was sold last week for $415,000 . The previous high price was $398,000 , negotiated last May . The Exchange has 1,100 members . No indications exist that the membership will be increased and thus depreciate the value of seats . <P> Cinema . Warner Bros , bought control of the Stanley Co. of America , and thereby first entree to more than 3,000 cinema houses ( see p. 32 ) . <P> Car Loadings reported last week for the week ending Sept. 1 , totaled 1,116,948 . This was 36,108 cars more than during the previous week but 412 less than the same week last year . <P> 93-year Flame . From 1835 until last week , a mighty flame burned continually at a New Orleans artificial gas plant . Cheaper natural gas became available . So the 93-year flame was at last smothered . <P> Kroger Grocery &; Baking Co. now has 4,605 stores-by purchase last week of 125 B. C. Thomas stores and 41 K. &; B. stores at Grand Rapids , Mich . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery and a real estate company . <P> Wheat . Renick William Dunlap , Acting Secretary of Agriculture , warned farmers not to sell their wheat crop too hastily . The northern hemisphere is raising 2,873,000 bushels of wheat this fall . This is a trifle more than last year . But the world 's rye crop is 92,000,000 bushels less than last year ; the potato crop will be less ; Russia probably will have no wheat to export ; people are demanding more wheat ( as flour ) than ever before . <P> Autos &; Planes . Continental Motors has begun to make motors for airplanes . Ford , Packard and Auburn have long been connected with flying , General Motors not at all . Yet the du Ponts have given financial backing to Guiseppe Bellanca , plane designer . And the du Ponts are a large part of General Motors . So the industrial surmise is not so wild that General Motors will soon make airplanes and equipment . <P> Exported Autos . The American Automobile last week published its survey of the U. S. automotive industry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and trucks exported numbered 260,072 ( 44,837 more than in the first half of 1927 ) ; were worth $184,687,815 . Tires : 1,344,000 ( 225,072 fewer than last year ) . Parts : $55,318,127 worth ( $1,152,428 gain ) . Best car customer was Australia ; best truck customer , Argentina . <P> 5-Cent Loaves . Atlantic &; Pacific chain stores in and around New York began to sell 1-lb. loaves of bread for 5 . They also sold 2-lb. loaves for 8 . Wherever freight rates on flour from Minneapolis are as cheap as to Manhattan , there A. &; P. will sell loaves as cheaply . Other stores will doubtless follow . <P> Gold Movement . Because five hundred million dollars of gold had been shipped away from the U. S. this year , the shipment of $2,500,000 from England to the U. S. last week , was memorable . It was the first time in more than a year that such movement had happened . Interest rate on loans is the cause . Money in New York cost 7% to 8% , in London 4% ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
