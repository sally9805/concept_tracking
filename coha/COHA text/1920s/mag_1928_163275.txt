Harvard 's varsity crew weighs 1480 pounds . It is the beefiest crew that has been put together by any college for a long time . Last week in Philadelphia the Harvard cheering section sitting in a temporary grandstand built on the edge of the Schuylkill River yelled themselves hoarse and the student band boomed and whooped as that beefy crew pulled past the judges ' barge three quarters of a length ahead of Penn , with the Navy third . " Beat Yale at New London and then try for the Olympics ! " cried Harvard old grads . <P> At Derby , Conn. , the Yale crew , rowing beautifully , beat Princeton and Cornell without drama to win the Carnegie Cup . Cornell was four and a half lengths back at the finish and Princeton two lengths behind Cornell.
