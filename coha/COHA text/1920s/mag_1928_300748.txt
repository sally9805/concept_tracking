" Here is an issue , " cried California 's white-crested Senator Hiram W. Johnson to some Los Angeles lunchers last week , " on which no man , I do not care a rap who he is , should be silent . It will be the issue in the next Senate , when the fight for Boulder Dam will be up again . No man on earth is so sacrosanct but that his position on the Power Trust and Boulder Dam should be made plain to the people of the United States ! " <P> " Stand aside , ye flabby ones ! Stand aside ye fainthearted , ye who fear reprisals from power corporations and their wealthy and powerful allies ! Ye who are unafraid will go forward with us in this issue that must be settled right if the Nation is to preserve a Government of the people , free and unfettered ! " <P> As the lunchers well knew , Senator Johnson had been fighting for years to have the Federal Government block up the Colorado River with the Boulder Dam ( between Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better water and power supply . They also knew that the Issue forecast by Senator Johnson is against what is commonly called the Power Trust , meaning the potent , propagandizing private interests who have sought to prevent the erection of a Federal project on the Colorado . <P> The lunchers also knew that this particular speech opened Senator Johnson 's campaign for reelection , a campaign in which he was supposed to be fighting beside and with California 's favorite son , Nominee Hoover . The only conclusion the lunchers could draw was that Nominee Hoover , in conference with Senator Johnson last fortnight , must have agreed to be on the Federal-operation side of the Boulder Dam question . <P> This conclusion , if correct , constituted one of the week 's large pieces of news . Nominee Hoover is the heir of the Coolidge Administration . The Coolidge attitude on Boulder Dam has never been positively known . Toward the so-called Power Trust , President Coolidge has not , however , been cold . He pocket-vetoed a Muscle Shoals measure calling for Federal instead of private operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Power Commission , a man , Roy Owen West , who has long been the friend and frequently the employe of Samuel Insull of Chicago , the most potent public utility privateer of them all . <P> Considered as an Issue , Boulder Dam is not an inter-party but an intraparty Issue , a cross issue . Loudly as California 's Johnson may roar against the Power Trust , there are other Republicans , for example Utah 's Smoot , equally effective in its defense . Among Democrats , the same split exists . Smith Democrats , if their chief continues consistent with his State record , will be found on the Federal-operation side , with the Johnsons and ( unless signs have misled ) the Hoovers . Opposed will be old-linesters , like Maryland 's Bruce , who think that the Government should be kept from stepping into fields , or streams , ideal for privateering.
