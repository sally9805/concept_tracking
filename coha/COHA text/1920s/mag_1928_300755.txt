One midwinter day in 1900 , three men entered the gate in front of Kentucky 's capitol at Frankfort and started walking toward the edifice . Halfway through the grounds stands a fountain , the overflow of which had only partly frozen on the path . As the three men turned aside to avoid the sludge , five rifle shots were fired with terrible deliberation and enormous echoes from a lower window of the capitol . One of the men near the fountain collapsed , mortally wounded . <P> A cub reporter named Cobb , who had been watching the three men approach , dashed out of the capitol and across the frozen lawn . He knew it was Big News . The dying man was William Goebel , who had just successfully contested in the legislature the election of his Republican opponent for Governor of Kentucky . <P> A policeman , thinking he spied the assassin , whipped out his revolver and began to shoot at the scurrying cub . Someone knocked up the policeman 's arm , thus saving to posterity a famed storyteller . Cub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write Speaking of Operations , A Laugh a Day , Here Comes the Bride , etc. , etc. , and to reminisce last week about the Goebel murder , perhaps as famed a murder as there is in all hard-shooting Kentucky 's history . <P> Caleb Powers , then Secretary of State of Kentucky , was sentenced to death . An underling of the State Auditor was sentenced to life imprisonment . Powers was pardoned , as was the third and foremost figure on the Republican side of the case , whose death last week at 76 from natural causes brought the Goebel murder back in the news . <P> William S. ( " Hog Jaw " ) Taylor was his name . He was the candidate who had the Governor 's office while Goebel contested it . At his trial it was testified that he offered $2,500 to the man who would shoot Goebel . When Goebel was declared Governor by the Legislature , " Governor " Taylor 's friends had assembled an army of 1,500 hillbillies in Frankfort for a finish fight . After the shooting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weeks . <P> The case dragged along in the courts , and " Governor " Taylor kept out of jail . One day in May the Supreme Court of the U. S. made a decision. * Mr. Taylor paced up and down in the District Attorney 's office at Louisville , waiting for the news . Suddenly he cried : " I must go to my home in Butler county . ' " and rushed out of the room , his black coattails dancing behind him , his black " Colonel 's " hat flapping with the speed . <P> He slipped out a rear door and into a carriage ; eluded detectives ; drove across the bridge ( Ohio River ) into Indiana . There , despite several efforts to kidnap or to extradite him , and despite the pardon issued for him by Kentucky 's next Republican Governor ( Augustus E. Willson ) in 1909 , he lived until last week , a respected citizen of Indianapolis , but for reasons of his own an exile . <P> * Upholding Goebel 's case .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
