The U. S. people awoke last week to the fact that there was a great social phenomenon just out of reach of their spectacles-a phenomenon ranking with coups d ' tat , invasions and insurrections , but more timely-adjusted to the spirit and social organism of the age : the " general strike . " <P> U. S. labor is not organized as is British labor , but it has a powerful central organization in the American Federation of Labor . The possibility of a general strike rests on the attitude of the A. F. of L. That attitude was set forth last week by William Green , President of the Federation . Mr. Green stands in the shoes which the growing feet of the great Gompers stretched in years gone by . So largely is the history of U. S. labor the history of Samuel Gompers , that there is no question that he was completely adequate to the labor problems of his decades . It was the Gompers attitude and the Gompers policy which spoke again last week from the mouth of William Green : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with keen interest this experimentation in the use of the sympathetic strike as a means of bringing about the settlement of a wage controversy in a single industry . <P> " The great danger involved in a general or sympathetic strike is the possibility that the original grievances which are the primary causes of the strike , and which are , in this case , meritoricus , may be lost sight of because of the charge that the general strike is a challenge to Government and to the existence of Government . <P> " The American Federation of Labor is strongly committed to the policy of collective bargaining , of wage contracts and the observance of wage agreements . " <P> This last declaration is practically equivalent to the statement that until American labor changes its policy , there will never be a general strike in this country . With each trade having its own wage agreement , it can not go on strike merely in sympathy with the strike of another group . <P> Mr. Green , like Secretary of Labor Davis , has Welsh blood in his veins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in this country at Coshocton , Ohio . In the year and five months of his stewardship he has shown where his talents lie-as a conciliator and composer of differences within the ranks of labor and as a leader devoted to the policy of " the middle course " between a possibly imaginary Scylla of Capitalism and a certainly dreaded Charybdis of Communism .
