Readers of the August Cosmopolitan learned what the world 's two most potent antifeminists still think of women . <P> The two are , of course : First , Signor Benito Mussolini , 45 , who lives most of the year away from his wife , Donna Rachele , yet dotes on their only daughter , Edda ; and the Second , the Earl of Birkenhead , Viscount Furneaux , 56 , Secretary of State for India , a devoted British husband , and a hero to his two smart daughters-Lady Eleanor Smith and Lady Pamela Margaret Elizabeth Smith . <P> Opposite as sunny Rome and slate-hued London are the anti-feminist theories of Dictator and Earl . The Roman by sheer ardor would explode the very notion that a " new " or " modern " woman can exist . The Londoner , icily accepting modern woman 's existence , defines her function as competition with man , and brands her as a failure at her chosen game . <P> Said Mussolini : " Love is the prime pastime of mankind . . . . Modern woman can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no new woman . . . . <P> " Crushed and yet conquering . . . she is just what man wills her to be . ... Man is in full possession of woman 's liberties , and measures them out to her . . . . <P> " If fate has been kind to her she is bound , body and soul , to some dominant male . . . . She was in industry before the male . . . worked and worked to the limit of her endurance . . . . She is in industry today , but it really is only the modern form of her ancient activity . " <P> Said Birkenhead : " In England during the War , when millions of men were drawn away from industry for military purposes vast numbers of women were called in to take their places . . . . <P> " It is very remarkable how that great invasion of women into the workaday world has receded . Industry is not stationary ; had women shown themselves to possess the necessary skill and the inclination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced so easily . . . . Even a feminist must be aware that the reason , and the sole reason , why women have retained any hold on such posts is economic . They are permitted to do a man 's work because they do it more cheaply . The reason they are able to sell their labor at a lower price is because women in general receive a measure of protection and assistance from modern society which is not accorded in like measure to men . <P> " Every woman in industry who by underselling her labor deprives a man of his post is making more difficult the setting up of a home by that man . This prevents some other woman from becoming mistress of his home and exercising the rights and privileges inseparable from that position . <P> " Any skilled dramatist could simplify the problem , after the custom of his craft , by presenting to us a study of a man and woman about to marry and applying , each without the other 's knowledge , for the same post . If he secures it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the social loss is clear . This is what actually is taking place on a large scale-all over the world .
