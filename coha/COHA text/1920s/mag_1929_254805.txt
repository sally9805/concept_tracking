The dusty , musty smell peculiar to large expositions was missing from Detroit 's second All-American Aircraft Show last week . Several thousand sightseers and several score actual plane purchasers each day could comfortably inspect 104 plane models , exhibited by 44 oldtime and 16 freshly organized manufactories . Planes ranged from the tricky little Heath at $975 , which only the best of pilots dare handle , to the $67,500 Fokker , for which , with its ornate fittings* Cadillac 's President Lawrence P. Fisher just paid $75,000 . In between were sturdy one and two-seater open cockpit monoplanes and biplanes . Most models , however , were " closed jobs , " built as coupes , sedans , coaches , cabins , buses . All but four planes were single-motored , with Pratt &; Whitneys , Wrights , Warners , leBlonds , for the most part. + Exceptions were the trimotored Fords , Fokkers , Boeings and Kreutzers ( a new Los Angeles product ) and the twin-engined Sikorsky amphibian . Notable for the interest they excited in visitors and the sales they engendered were : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrow , Bellanca , Berliner-Joyce , Boeing , Cessna , Chance Vought , Command-Aire , Curtiss , Fokker , Great Lakes , Hamilton , Knoll , Lincoln , Mahoney-Ryan , Mohawk , Moth , Parks , Pitcairn , Simplex , Spartan , Stearman , Swallow , Swift , Travel Air , Whittlesey . <P> Safety . Inherent stability is what every exhibitor claimed for his plane . Only a Department of Commerce certificate warrants confidence in such claims . Most craft at Detroit last week did have such certification . As a safety factor practically every plane carried a stabilizing apparatus which might be fixed to prevent it from suddenly going into stall , tail spin , or nose dive . Otto W. Greene , gaunt Elyria , Ohio , inventor , showed an aero-dynamic automatic control . It consisted of a small vane projected from a wing of his model plane . As the plane tilted or teetered the vane lagged and activated levers which forced the controls automatically to pull his model back to its course . No practical plane yet uses this device . Only one ship at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which greatly retards stalls and landing speeds . <P> Another protective device fixed in most planes nowadays is a broad canvas belt to be strapped across the passenger 's lap . It keeps him from being tossed out of an open plane and , in case of crash , from being hurled the length of the cabin . When necessary he can unfasten the belt in less than one second . <P> Comfort . Even the open sport planes had their comforts-a pad for back of the pilot 's head and one in front , if he jounces forward . Cabins had wicker or upholstered chairs or seats , ash trays , drinking cups . Large and small transports had washstands , toilets and kitchens . But informality is still essential for most air travel .
