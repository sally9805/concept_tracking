THE CABINET <P> " It has been said that republics are ungrateful ; but you will agree with me that this is not the case . . . . What we sometimes do here , in order to express our appreciation , is to give a man a public dinner and that is a doubtful pleasure nowadays as long as we have to be ' dry .
