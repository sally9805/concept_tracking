The Last Edition was doomed to dislike by the newspaper commentators . It is a newspaper melodrama done without regard to verity . Possibly it is not so utterly unlike journalism as society pictures are unlike society , or Parisian underworld pictures are unlike Montmartre . Rich people and French cocottes have no opportunity and probably small inclination to complain , but not so the critics when they dislike the distorted version of their colleagues . Furthermore it was pretty stilted melodrama . <P> The Eagle . Rudolph Valentino has pulled himself successfully out of the mud . The last drying flakes of his tour in favor of Mineralava Beauty Clay have disappeared , and he is once more a foremost favorite of the screen . This latest picture is among his best . It was adapted from the novel of Pushkin , and treats of a Russian youth who ( figuratively ) thumbed his nose at the Tsarina and considerably displeased the royal household . He becomes a Cossack and makes love , without too much exaggeration , to Vilma Banky . <P> Old Clothes . Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his stories are getting just a trifle tiresome . This latest , perilously parallel to The Rag Man , shows him as a boy business man and a lover 's confidant . Yet any picture with Jackie Coogan is good entertainment , provided it moves . <P> Rose of the World . This somewhat far flung title is tacked to an ordinary movie story of a couple of unhappy marriages . One of the wives and one of the husbands were in love but were impeded , chiefly through their own stupidity , from getting married . Therefore reels of unhappiness until the other wife rode a spritely horse and the other husband fell off a cliff . <P> The Ancient Highway . Jack Holt and Billie Dove wasted several weeks in making this one . It is a preposterously usual and unusually preposterous melodrama of the logging countries .
