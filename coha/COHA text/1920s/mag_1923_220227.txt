( Cheers . ) I would say that the popularity of fox hunting , far from being reduced , has been increased . I think that anybody who has hunted since the war must have been greatly struck and delighted to find the number of fellows who managed to hunt . ( Cheers . ) It has often been a struggle for them to do so , which shows how keen they are . " He was referring to the new poor , many of whom now attend meets on foot . " May I say a word also about the wonderful co-operation of our farmers at the present time ? ( Cheers . ) Many of them can not hunt , but without their help we could not hunt . " <P> " I have hunted with ten packs this season ( loud cheers ) and have come across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are grateful to the farmers for the help they have given to keep going a sport without which I do not think this country would be what it is today . " ( Prolonged cheers. )
