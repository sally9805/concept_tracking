Though Mount Vesuvius is ever a-seething and a-smoking , timid tourists do not fear to ascend , when told that the funicular railway is owned and run by Thomas Cook &; Son . <P> In fine , where Cooks will take you , it must be safe to go . Last week this largest tourist firm announced , for the first time , that they will hereafter make travel arrangements " for all those who may wish to go to Soviet Russia . " <P> The once insuperable difficulty in obtaining a Soviet Visa has been overcome . Russia is safe , stable . And Cooks will sell to anyone for approximately $280 a transportation ticket , including sleeping berths where necessary , for the 12-day , 7,530-mile journey from Paris via Moscow and Siberia to Peking . <P> Seasoned travelers who remember the Trans-Siberian trip from before the War , could not detect , last week , anything changed or unfamiliar in the following description , released by Cooks , of the journey as it is today : <P> " The sleeping cars are clean and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles per hour with frequent stops to fuel at wood piles along the way . . . . About half the passengers usually eat in the diner . The other half buy food from the peasants and have picnic meals in their compartments . The peasants gather at the stations at train time with all kinds of cooked food for sale . . . good bread , golden honey , boiled milk , roast ducks and chickens . . . . <P> " Each of the first-class sleepers is provided with a samovar kept going all the time , so that one can always get a glass of hot tea , day or night . " <P> In the old days it was the privilege and habit of the Tsars to stop their Imperial Train on the single track Trans-Siberian line at any point which fancy might dictate , while they picnicked , strolled in the woods , or received the homage of peasants . Meanwhile , for scores of miles up and down the line , local traffic would be suspended and of course all through express trains stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
