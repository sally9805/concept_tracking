No really rich and potent tycoon likes the idea of sitting on a " sub-committee , " and so last week the three sub-committees of the second Dawes Committee-now sitting in Paris to revise the Dawes Plan ( TIME , Feb. 18 , et seq. ) - were rechristened " Informal Groups . " <P> When the odious " subcommittee " ghost had been pretty well laid , it was revealed that for almost a week previously John Pierpont Morgan had been sitting in on an informal group chairmanned by Baron Revelstoke , the softspoken , intensely aristocratic tycoon who heads the great British banking firm of Baring Brothers &; Co. , Ltd . <P> It very soon appeared that this informal group was the inner banking circle of the committee-for with Mr. Morgan and Lord Revelstoke sit Dr. Carl Melchior , partner in Germany 's great house of Warburg , Belgian Tycoon Emile Francqui , and Economist Antonio Suvitch , personal representative of Benito Mussolini . <P> The mere announcement that this informal group exists stirred up such a news flurry that the tycoons , cautious , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news-starved correspondents were fed titbit after titbit about what the group was preparing to do . Meanwhile Mr. Morgan ran over to London , as he said , " for a cup of tea " ; and various other delegates paid flying visits to their homes . When everyone had gotten back from wherever he had gone , <P> Baron Revelstoke appeared as rapporteur for his informal group before a secret session of the second Dawes Committee and made an oral statement* understood to be in substance : <P> 1 ) The informal group suggests that the payment of German reparations be administered by a corporate trusteeship on a strictly business basis . <P> 2 ) The corporate trusteeship to be called the Reparations Settlement Institute , and to be constituted as an international banking corporation . <P> 3 ) The new institute to absorb all the functions of the present Agent General of Reparations , Seymour Parker Gilbert , and of the Reparations Commission and the transfer committee . <P> 4 ) The institute to hold as trustee certificates of indebtedness indorsed by Germany and classified as " A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> 5 ) The preferred " A " certificates to be issued in an amount representing a sum for which Germany would be unconditionally liable . Next , the " B " certificates to represent what the creditor Powers expect to obtain directly from Germany in cash transfers . Finally , the " C " certificates to cover what the Powers expect to obtain in kind , that is , in transfers of raw materials . <P> 6 ) The Institute to have power , at the absolute discretion of its board of directors , to issue bonds against the security covered by the " A " certificates only , and to devote the proceeds to repaying the creditor Powers . The series of " A , " " B " and " C " certificates to be issued substantially in the form of promissory notes of 1,000,000,000 marks each ( $250,000,000 ) , and these notes to be cancelled one by one as Germany pays her creditors billion after billion in each of the three ways outlined , namely from the proceeds of bonds , by cash transfers and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
