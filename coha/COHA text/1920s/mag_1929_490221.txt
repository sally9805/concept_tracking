WE met a young man recently who astonished us beyond measure and enlarged our conception of what goes on in the world . This young man is working toward a definite goal  --  he seriously intends to become President of the United States , and candidly admits it . Further , there is very little doubt in his mind that this happy consummation will come about . All the details of his life are being shaped with this end in view . He has entered the law and is making advantageous contacts with persons who are in a position to launch him into public life and smooth the long path to the White House . He recently broke his engagement with a young lady because he discovered in her certain qualities which he thought unfitted her for first lady of the land . ( He found her kissing another gentleman . ) The most amazing thing about the case is that , as far as we can see , his chances of becoming President are excellent . We never knew anyone in whom the characteristics of Calvin Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conversation he refers to the nation of which he is to become the head as " this great country of ours . " We hail him already , although reserving our vote . FOR years , a friend of ours has been quietly at work on a scheme for reducing the quantity of unsolicited mail matter which arrives on his desk everyday . He now reports progress . At one time he was on the mailing list of practically every business house in the country , and reluctantly opened and read his mail every morning . Now , every piece of worthless literature he receives he immediately places  --  envelope and all  --  in a cheap , large envelope and addresses it to the highest ranking executive of the concern from which it came . He then drops it , without affixing any postage , into the nearest mail box . His theory is that after the business houses have expended a sufficient sum on " postage due , " they will cross his name off their mailing lists . Last year he received two hundred and eighty-nine fewer pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Path rooster that comes out and crows at the start of Pathe pictures , would be a welcome fowl to us if we could be sure that he and his kind would supplant those introductory film titles that appear letter by letter before our eyes . In our day we have sat through tens of thousands of words spelled out one letter at a time  --  sometimes the letters jumped out of inkpots , sometimes they turned somersaults , and always they were too slow for us and we knew what the word was before they had completed it . The rooster , and things like it , may possibly be a step forward ; we can never be sure . Like as not the next trip we make to the movies we will have to sit through a crowing-rooster and words spelled out . That would be more than we could bear in our weak condition . OUR admiration for all industrials is great ; but we feel a particular admiration for the makers of paper drinking-cups . We have been studying the paper-drinking-cup racket around our office , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glue , or whatever holds them together , is of such a consistency that it lasts just long enough for one drink ; then disintegration starts . When you first seize the cup and pry it open , it is stiff , able , and tight . You drink , and at precisely the right moment the cup wilts , seams open up , and in your hand is nothing but a wet piece of paper . For a second drink you must take a new cup . It is with pride that we think of the men who must have worked hundreds of hours in big smelly laboratories to perfect a cup which would take you through one drink , and no more . FEY is the office boy , very fey . We could not live without our office boy , and we have the greatest difficulty living with him . Yesterday , during one of our long redundant absences , he took a phone call that came in . " I called to ask if Mr. ? can come to dinner tonight ? " said the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeably . Later he told us all about it . " Very good , " we said. , " and may I ask who I am to dine with tonight ? " He did n't know . He did n't get the name . The Rescuers A NAUTICAL man tells us some-/ thing of Captain Fried , and also Chief Officer Manning , who commanded the America 's lifeboat when it rescued the crew of the Florida . Fried started as an enlisted man , or plain gob , in the navy , and his rise is an unusual achievement . His home is a prosaic four-room apartment in Broadway near 214th Street , the walls of which are hung with chromos of sea scenes , family photographs , the scrolls presented to him after the Antinoe rescue , and his marriage certificate . He is ashore one week in five in the winter and four days a month in the summer . During such times he rarely goes out in the evening , preferring to sit around the house in an old pair of flannel trousers and a striped blazer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours at a window , smoking his pipe and watching the traffic. , which fascinates him . Or he may read . He is a considerable reader and , as his reuorts on the Florida rescue showed , commands a clear narrative style in writing . He collects stamps , pieces of pottery , and has several shelves of autographed books , inscribed mostly by authors who have travelled with him at one time or another . He accepts these books , but ashore he rarefy associates with the celebrities whose acquaintance he makes aboard ship . He gets numberless invitations but rejects nearly all of them . He drinks enormous quantities of coffee , having formed the habit because of the long stretches he puts in on the bridge , frequently of forty hours . The only dessert he ever eats is apple pie . On his birthday Mrs. Fried puts candles in a pie instead of a cake . He will take a ship through any kind of weather but he will not drive his automobile in heavy traffic . Every morning , when living at home , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling his wife he must superintend something or other . Often there is nothing to superintend. , but he never omits the trip Manning , the chief officer , is just past thirty . He took to the sea as a lark in 1914 , some school chums having persuaded him to go along with them and join the Nautical Training Ship Newport . He did n't like the sea , and had decided to take up another occupation when the war came along . He went into the transport service . By the time the war was over he had such a good job , having won several promotions , that he remained a ship 's officer . Since then he has advanced rapidly . Four times he has commanded the Roosevelt on voyages to Europe and back , being on such occasions , we are told , the youngest skipper of a transatlantic liner . From time to time , he speaks disparagingly of the sea . Hr dislikes standing watch in storms because he is easily affected by exposure . On several occasions he has been sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor does he get along with some of the old sea dogs . Once he got transferred from a ship because he did n't like to say good morning to the skipper , and would n't . Captain Fried is an idol of his , however . Catching the Name MISS MAUREEN ORC Uri ' , metropolitan women 's golfing champion , attending a dinner a little while ago , drew as a dinner partner a Mr. Foster Gilroy , a golfer . He had n't caught her name and when , in response to a question , she said she had played golf a little , he told her she ought to go in for it seriously , that it was fine for young women , developed their muscles , and so on . He was shout to illustrate by means of a fork one of the beneficial strokes of the game , when someone on his left gave him the word as to who the lady was . Miss Orcutt overheard this and was downcast . " Now just you go right on and tell me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ha ha , ah well , " and inspected his oysters with profound concentration . Famous Pancakes A FELLOW who set about , in the 1 . restaurants of the city , to learn the origin of Crilllpes Suzette has wound up in bewilderment , for while each of the chefs he asked told him readily and eloquently how the dish came about , they all told him different stories . He got as ninny as three distinct explanations , and various versions of these . He is now at an impasse , afraid to pursue the matter further with his sources of information , since he realizes that French dishes are not invented or named lightly and that he might easily create a situation that would be provocative of argument and , perhaps , duels . The first , and the prettiest , account credits the origin of the Crepes to Henri , owner , maitre d'h &tcl,; and life of Henri 's excellent restaurant at Lynbrook , Long Island . In his younger days Henri ( it is related ) was chef at a distinguished restaurant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare a dinner for Edward VII , then the Prince of Wales . Traditionally , a chef was expected to bring forth a new dish under such circumstances , and on this occasion Henri produced his at the end of the meal . At dessert time he appeared in person at the table , with chafing dish , ingredients , and a committee of assistants , and , with great flourish , turned out the dessert in question . The Prince liked it much : Ind inquired its name . Henri bowed and announced it as Cr4es au Prince Edouard . To this the Prince objected , saying such a charming dish should bear a lady 's name . " Why not call it after the lady who is present ? " he asked . This baffled Henri , for the dinner was stag and no lady was present ; but the Prince then enticed a very small girl from beneath the table , whither she had fled upon the magnificent approach of Henri . She was a waif who had strayed into the restaurant from the streets . Henri asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alois , " said Henri , " voici des Crpes Suzette ! " The second story , of which Lion , maitre d'h6tcl of the Caviar Restaurant , is sponsor , goes back to the timesof Talleyrand , at a moment when he was the admirer and protector of a charming actress named Suzette . On the occasion of a dinner given in her honor , the chef , in this tale one was called upon to prepare a dainty dish and used what then passed for a chafing dish to create what he called , in tribute to the guest of honor , Crepes Suzette . ' The third tale is that the dish was created in the year 1860 by Monsieur Dugniol , ge'rent of the famous Restaurant Paillard in Paris . He made it of sweet butter and fine champagne and called it by the name of Crepes Diable Boiteux . Later , for some reason lost to memory , the name was changed to Suzette . Sweet butter is still one of the main ingredients but the liqueur has been changed , the ac-cepted recipe calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his research , the investigator learned of one French dish whose origin seems clear , namely , pommes soirifiees . This delightful way of fixing potatoes was discovered by accident in 1845 , when the first railroad in France was inaugurated . The chef of the dining-car was disturbed when his guests were an hour late , because the French-fried po-tatoes had grown cold and were apparently ruined . When the diners did arrive , however , he put the potatoes -- porames kites were then cut in ovals  --  into the hot fat to see if he could revive them . To his astonishment they puffed up like balloons and proved to be most excellent to eat . It was a gala day for France , with a new railroad and a new recipe for potatoes . TV it THE patience of an irritable industrial chemist has been sorely tried by receipt of wrong numbers over his bedside phone . He woke up the other morning to be jawed at about the non-delivery of bathtubs . " We 've got them in now , " said the chemist , " thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow you a big discount because of the delay . " " That 's fine , " said the comolainant , cheerfully . " We 'll man received a call the next morning from a man who demanded brusquely , " Hello , Credit Association ? " " Yes , " said the lying chemist . " How 's credit Smithers &; Watkins ( or some such firm ) in Bridge-port ? " " Rotten , " said the chemist . " Uh , " said the voice , " they do n't pay in sixty days ? " " Never been known to , " replied the fiend , and that ended that . He does n't know what happened in these cases . In connection with /41e.t-,1 the telephone corn- pany , we have a correction to make . We stated recently-that the Hotel Majestic was listed first in the directory by using the device of prefixing A. A. A. to its name . The fact is that this was just a break for the hotel . A. A. A. stands for American Automobile Association , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pointed out to us ) know . Carnival THE first adventure in our own personal investigation of the present traffic situation in the theatre district Caine at Forty-third and Sixth Avenue , where a cop pushed us gently hack upon the sidewalk . " Oop , " we said . " Sorry , " he said . " Your first contact with this , eh ? " Be was quite friendly . We made for Times Square . The green light was shining east and west at Forty-second Street , but when we tried to cross a policeman who was talking with a man stopped us . We tried again . " Hold it , mister , " said the cop . " Green light , " said we . " Oh , terrible sorry , " said the cop . ve ybody made mistakes , even the but it was infinitely gay and charming . The carnival spirit continued all week . The cordons of policemen at every curb chatted with the girls , and the ? . girls teased them . Everyone was gay and did everything het @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carnival was the large triangle of pavement roped off in front of the Astor , where stands four telephones and a switchboard which connects with twelve other booths in the restricted area . A gold watch hangs on the wall of the booth which , on the evening we were there , usually contained two or three men in evening dress , in addition to the officers . Cream-colored scarves , silk hats , gold-headed canes , moved about in the cramped space . Every so often , ? Viialen appeared from somewhere , bobbed into the booth and out again . Twice , when he plunged away , we were told , it was to make talks at banquets . About eleven o'clock his car came hack with only the driver in the front seat and the Commissioner 's malacca cane in back . He had got out somewhere in the Fifties to walk down .

" Tragedy NE Marshal of France we heard X- , of had for weeks been looking forward to the Beaux Arts Ball but was bitterly crushed the following morning to realize that he had n't got there . The senior partner of a law firm , he had had a hard day at the office , and had been wearied further by fittings for his costume . A festive dinner made him drowsy , and by the time he had , by a mighty effort , got into tight breeches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , and completely worn out , went into a dreamless sleep . Rockefeller Fun TROM a recent guest of the Rockefellers at Pocantico Hills we learned of the playhouse John D. , jr , , has built for his five sons there . It is a three-story affair , made of native rubble-stone , standing a few hundred feet from the elaborate Rockefeller mansion and near the cottage which Ahh ' , Rockefeller , her husband , David Milton , and their infant daughter , use for a weekend home . The first floor has a swimming pool , showers , dressing-rooms , and great stone fireplace  --  the Rockefeller boys are all skilled swimmers , having been tutored in swimming and diving almost from the time they could walk . On the second floor are a kitchen , pantry , breakfast-room , and a number of bedrooms , the whole fully staffed with servants . The young men frequently entertain guests overnight . On this floor is also a photographic darkroom where the youngsters may indulge the hobby , shared by all five , of making movies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which doors lead to a card-room and two fine howling alleys . The third floor houses a music-room where the youngsters and their friends are occasionally entertained by professional talent from the concert world , and off of this room are dens  --  one for each son  --  studies , and a billiard-room . The grounds round about are fitted up with tennis courts , a baseball diamond , and a croquet court . The tennis courts are surfaced with materials brought from Europe . The Rockefellers have been coached by experts in this game and they all play well , although Nelson , who is twenty and a senior at Dartmouth , is the only one who has won any athletic distinction off the Pocantico 2-rounds . He made the varsity soccer team . just now all the boys spend most of their play hours in skating , at which none of them , however , is as adept at either speed or figure-cutting as their fiftyfour-year-old father . Flotsam ONE story of the killing of Roth- stein had it that he was n't shot over a disputed gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous , more or less , " floating " crap game . Rothstein had intended to start up one or two pretentious gambling houses and went to the Park Central to serve notice on the " floating " gamesters that they had to stop operations  --  their type of game seemed likely to interfere with business in established gambling houses . Rothstein was dictatorial and an argument resulted in which he was shot . That was the version . As to the truth of this , we know not , but the " floating " game did exist , being held in a different place each night , and it is said still goes on . Evi-dence to this effect is offered by a gentleman who descended into a lonely subway station late one night last week . No train being in sight , he was stroll-ing along the platform whistling quietly to himself until distracted by noises emanating from the porter 's room built into the wall . Peering in , he saw five or six men on the floor , shoot-ing craps . He entered , with some vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove fraternal . He was discouraged in this at once , however , when he saw that they were playing with thousand-dollar bills and when one man rose to go , calmly declaring , " Well , that 's sixty-two thousand , and enough for tonight . " The stranger quietly departed the room and resumed his strolling and whistling .
