HENRY HUDSON-Llewelyn Powys-Harpers ( $4 ) . Two waters on the North American continent were grooved by the bow of Hudson 's boat , and now bear his name to witness it . <P> One is the river that slides down through a quiet country where the hills are piled up like velvet pillows , past the quick glittering chaos of Manhattan , into the quiet Atlantic . Up this river the Captain sailed , hoping to find the splendor of China and a western ocean beyond some twist of a valley in those small and comfortable mountains . <P> The other water is an enormous shallow bay , spread like a thin shield across the North of Canada . Into this grey harbor also Hudson sailed ; and here , after spending a winter on its frozen shore , he stayed to watch his ship , manned by a mutiny , putting back for England , leaving him and two companions to drown or freeze or starve . It is idle and unpleasant to imagine how the tireless captain accomplished death ; it is possible , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in a small boat , listening to the slap of water on its gunwale , watching the departure of his crew with courage , despair and fury . <P> As written by Author Powys , the story of Hudson 's voyages-these two to the U. S. and two earlier ones to the north of Europe-is an intimate and elaborate chronicle . All the familiar details of life that precede and accompany the gaudiest adventures , like the supplies with which a captain fills the hold of his ship before a long voyage , are carefully inserted by Author Powys . He tells how an Indian visited the Half-Moon above Manhattan , how the Indian stole a shirt out of the mate 's cabin , and how the mate shot him dead as he was paddling across the silent river valley , back to shore . The sea , the polar bears , the casual , surly , craven sailors of Hudson 's crew , the companies who in England planned the hazardous voyages that their captains undertook , the acquittal which an English court allowed the mutineers who had marooned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Author Powys . He writes about them with his customary precision and subtlety and imagination . <P> The Author is 44 years old , the son of an English vicar , the brother of John Cowper Powys , author and lecturer and T. F. Powys , novel-writer , a graduate of Cambridge . In 1909 , afflicted with tuberculosis , he went to a Swiss sanatorium , an experience about which he later wrote a book . In 1914 , still diseased , he went to South Africa for five years : this visit supplied the material for Ebony &; Ivory , Black Laughter . In 1920 , he came to the U. S. without fame , wealth or a wife ; in 1925 , he left the U. S. with all three and lived in England for two years , writing about Henry Hudson . Now he is back in the U. S. , doing book reviews and other things .
