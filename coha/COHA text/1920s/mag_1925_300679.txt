It was a big fuss . Any attempt to render deliberate justice in a controversial case usually brings on a big fuss . In the court martial of Colonel William Mitchell ( TIME , Nov. 2 et seq. ) there is little doubt that the nine generals who are the august judges , were , if given any instructions at all by the War Department , told to conduct the trial in such a manner that Colonel Mitchell could have no complaint of unfairness . <P> Last week began the lengthy business of taking testimony . As a prelude Congressman Frank R. Reid , counsel for Colonel Mitchell , opened with a modest address of 22,000 words telling what he proposed to prove for his client to back up the sweeping statements for which Colonel Mitchell is being tried . He said he would prove that the lost Shenandoah was not a first rate dirigible and not in the best of condition , that a Navy officer had tried to persuade Mrs. Lansdowne not to testify that her husband had protested against the Shenandoah 's fatal trip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made false and misleading statements to investigating committees to the prejudice of aviation , that the Air Service is controlled by non-flying officers , that many flyers have been killed because they were forced to use old machines , that the MacMillan expedition was equipped with machines not suited for Arctic use , that , in general , the military and naval Aviation Services are in poor condition . <P> Then the defense began to call its witnesses . The first called was Brigadier General Amos A. Fries , Chief of the Chemical Warfare Service . He was called to refute a statement by Brigadier General Hugh A. Drum , Assistant Chief of Staff , that it would take 5,530 airplanes and 9,573,000 pounds of mustard gas to force the evacuation of the District of Columbia . General Fries believed that 1,000 airplanes and 40,000 pounds of tear gas would get rid of the civil population . Major Carl Spatz , D.S.C. , flyer , told the Court that Air service equipment is " obsolete or obsolescent , " and told how , in an attempt to find a suitable range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable place was found for a rental of one dollar a year the War Department did not want to part with the dollar , although it finally did so . General Howze , President of the Court , inquired : " Who was responsible for the delay ? " <P> Major Spatz : " The pursuit squadron is under command of the commanding officer of the Sixth Corps Area . " <P> The commanding officer of the Sixth Corps Area , Major General William S. Graves , a member of the Court , " twisted his hands in nervous rage , " and began to ask questions seeking to fix the blame . <P> Captain Robert Oldys was another witness . He told of the death of his commanding officer , Major Harley Wheeler , in a crash at Hawaii . Major Wheeler told him a few minutes before his fatal flight that he had been " bawled out " by Colonel Chamberlain , Chief of Staff of the Hawaiian Department , because so many machines had been smashed . Major Wheeler took the air ; at 200 feet his engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to save the plane . He was burned to a crisp when he was found .
