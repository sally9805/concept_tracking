Jim Watson as its mouthpiece in the Senate ; when it places its future in the House in the hands of Congressmen like Tilson of Connecticut , it need only anticipate creeping paralysis . Of course it is the fashion to lay all the blame upon the Progressives and to say that if they had only remained loyal everything would have been satisfactory . Nothing of the kind . If the Senate had immediately voted the Tariff Bill as it came from the House it would in our judgment have put Mr. Hoover in a worse position than he is in now . This not only because it would have proved the complete ineptitude and the crass selfishness of the Republican leadership of both houses , but because it would have constituted a direct violation of his promise to alter the tariff only on schedules affecting the farmer . It is a stiff dose for the President to swallow , but it has saved him from a bitterer . T E ADJOURNMENT of the futile special session Hof Congress , after the Senate had been solemnly warned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , marks the complete bieakdown of the Republican Party 's conduct of the government . It reflects upon the President who , as Paul Anderson points out elsewhere in this issue , has shown not only a total lack of leadership but of any understanding of what should constitute leadership , and in equal measure upon the so-called Republican leaders in House and Senate . When any party has sunk to such a pass that it finds itself compelled to fall back upon a P RESIDENT HOOVER has now completed his dele- gation to the London Disatmament Conference by the selection of Ambassador Morrow and the Secretary of the Navy , NIT- . Adams . We confess that Mr. Morrow 's name alone prevents us from having a complete sinking of heart as we regard the commission which now stands as follows : Ambassadors Gibson , ' Morrow , and Dawes ; Secretaries Stimson and Adams ; Senators David A. Reed and Joseph T. Robinson . Even Admiral Jones has , to our regret , had his feelings assuaged and will go along as an adviser . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on record at Geneva , Senators Robinson and Reed are of the imperialistic and militaristic type of mind , and Secretary Adams is reliably reported to be opposed to the abolition of battleships unless the navy is " compensated " by additional cruisers , submarines , destroyers , etc . Secretary Stimson has spoken out well so far and both he and General Dawes have a special personal stake in bringing home a substantial success for their chief . Mr. Morrow 's wisdom and sincerity , and the absence in him of professional office-holding narrowness , are the best assets of all . I T WAS THE PROPHET ISAIAH who saw a vision 1 of Judah and Jerusalem nearly three thousand years ago , in which the Lord was to judge among nations and the people to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning-hooks . It is the modern prophet Judah Magnes , chancellor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , who sees and preaches a new vision of Jew and Arab cooperating to build in Palestine " an interreligious and an interracial home . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up in his university to preach that message , so eloquently in accord with the ancient splendor of Jewish tradition , little bitter-minded Jews should have hissed him , a Hebrew newspaper should have called upon his students to strike until he resigned , and the officials of the American Jewish Congress , led by Dr. Stephen S. Wise , should have hastened to denounce him . They seem to want the Jews to follow the alternative method of Joshua . But unfortunately , today , merely to shout with a great shout does not cause walls to come tumbling down . W HAT WAS IT that Dr. Magnes said which roused such a turmoil ? He said that " if Jew and Arab are to live together in Palestine it must be as an act of faith  --  of faith that they are brother peoples , and that they can rise above their weaknesses and their passions , however difficult this may now seem . " Instead of insisting , as the little people do , that the Jews must preserve a flinty solidarity against the Arabs after these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloriously dared to talk it here in America in the midst of the World War . " The more generous and open-hearted Jew and Arab are to one another light now during these times of hatred and ' distress , " he said , " the longer they will remember each other in gratitude and friendship . " Jewish aspirations , he insisted , would be meaningless if they rested upon the steel of British bayonets , and the Balfour declaration had in some ways been a handicap to real Zionist progress . Dreams of a political Jewish state could not endure . Because Palestine is the holy land of three religions , Dr. 1Iagnes asserted , it would continue to need international government , but he would prefer that the government be more directly responsible to the League of Nations than under the present British mandatory system . The immediate protests in Jerusalem were natural enough products of the inevitable war psychology of people who have lived in fear of their lives for months . But the haste with which the leaders of the American Jewish Congress rushed into print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Magnes 's statement , and denounced his attitude as breaking " the virtually unbroken front of the Jewish people , " was a sad recurrence of war-time psychology . It is good to note that the important journal , the American Hebrew , supports his attitude . T HE QUEST throughout the world for raw materials continues . Coal , iron , rubber , coffee still arouse bitter controversies . But markets for investments and for manufactured articles are becoming a far more important bone of contention . Germany is afraid that , after the recent stockmarket collapse , American manufacturers may begin " dumping " in an effort to find markets and employment for idle capital . Lord Melchett , England 's most brilliant industrialist , supports Lord Beaverbrook 's scheme for free trade within the Empire and protection against the rest of the world  --  meaning the United States . Europe talks of economic union and Briand proposes his " United States of Europe " because the new Colossus of the West threatens to swamp all the rest of the world with its surplus food and excess factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , we accumulate a surplus of manufactured articles , they must , in the nature of things , be exported . We shall see our high-powered salesmen sent out in search of new fields abroad to conquer They will compete with Germany whose reparations payments depend on a favorable trade balance , and with England whose life 's secret is foreign commerce . They will seek additional markets in China , Australia , Russia . The result must inevitably be heightened international tension C ONFISCATION OF ALL German private property in England , including German-owned stock in British corporations , was one of the vengeful privileges accorded by the Treaty of Versailles of which the British Governmentpromptly availed itself . The proceeds of the property were to be used to pay certain British private claims against Germany or German subjects , and any surplus was to be turned over to the Reparations Commission for distribution among the Allies or among the German owners . The surplus , said to amount to over $100,000,000 , has been claimed by the German Government , but AIL Snowden , British Chancellor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the result that the German press is pointedly inquiring of what British public morality consists . Mr. Snowden , who had to defend himself before a disturbed House of Commons on November 21 , pleaded the provisions of the Dawes plan and the Young plan , decisions of the Reparations Commission and the Interpretation Tribunal set up under the Dawes plan , and " compassionate allowances " of $25,000,000 to individuals and proffered waivers of $25,000,000 more of unliquidated claims , as his excuse for holding on to the surplus . The MacDonald Government will have a heavy burden of moral responsibility to carry if it keeps this money . T HE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA is having its own troubles in the legal proceedings against four union organizers , led by Alfred Hoffmann , of Wisconsin . Hoffmann and his three associates were first charged with " insurrection and rebellion " against the sovereign State of North Carolina . The Court threw out the insurrection charge at the beginning of the trial and would not permit the remaining charge , that of rebellion , to go before the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resisting an officer , which is a long way from treason . But unfortunately the prosecuting attorney had wrongly worded the true bills found against the prisoners , and the Court , in the person of Judge G. V. Cowper , threatens again to throw the case out of court . Solicitor Pless has now decided to try Hoffmann , Hogan , Fowler , and Lewis in place of fifty-four union organizers and strikers indicted on charges of rioting and resisting an officer . In the face of legal tangles such as these the layman may well throw up his hands in despair Several facts emerge from the confusion . Judge Cowper seems consistently to have maintained a clear head and a fair and impartial approach to the whole proceeding ; the events out of which the trials have grown ale , in plain language , that , while a crowd of strikers were attempting to dispossess a strike-breaker , Sheriff Adkins was threatened by defendant Fowler with a knife , one of the other defendants had a stick , and somebody hit a deputy over the head with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawful , probably ; but certainly not rebellion and in=urrection , and one might think , also . worth less time and money than is being spent on it . C HINESE POLITICS ate evolving at something more than their usual kaleidoscopic pace President Chiang Kai-shek has been speeding up and down the Yangtze , organizing the resistance of the Nationalist Government against its insubordinate generals . In Hunan , where the major battles have been fought , he has turned back the stubborn advance of Feng Yu-hiang 's armies ; in the Han Valley he has avoided the oft-threatened collapse But no sooner is one victory won than a new civil war threatens . Far to the South Chang Fa-kwei , ousted three months ago from Hunan , is now advancing on Canton with his Kwangsi allies . If Chang Kai-shek , who has acted with superhuman and quite un-Chinese vigor , emerges victorious from these trials he may have proved himself indeed the long-sought strong man of China . It will remain for him to prove that he is also the organizer of Chinese democracy . Meanwhile new troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so consistently exaggerated and even downright false that one takes with several grains of salt the announcements of large-scale Soviet invasion . The Russians themselves report that they have captured 8,000 Chinese troops . Thus far , however , the Manchurian game is still played with pawns ; the " invasion " may be taken seriously only when it seriously threatens Harbin . D AY BY DAY prohibition gets buried deeper under a weight of legal logic and illegal liquor . And strangely enough the most assiduous workers at piling on the intricacies are the victim 's friends . Thus dry Iowa , through its Supreme Court , rules that liquor obtained without a search warrant may be used as evidence against a defendant ; Senator Brook-hart smells and tells ; a very dry " Dry , " Representative Denison of Illinois , joins the distinguished company of another voting Dry , Representative Michaelson , when he is found to have incriminating connections with leaking trunks ( what this country needs apparently is mule-proof baggage ) ; Dr. James M. Doran , Prohibition Commissioner , in a report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer arrests in seven months of 1929 compared with the same period in 1928 , but that the " quality " of enforcement shows " marked improvement " ! And finally a federal judge in Illinois , invoking an act of Congress passed in 1790 making a felon of any person who knows of a felony , proves with logic which he himself regrets is incontrovertible that any person who is present while liquor is being sold or who knows of its transportation or manufacture is a felon under the Jones law unless he reports his knowledge to the government . Meanwhile consumption of liquor , at least in the cities of America , has become a commonplace . B OOKS , MORE BOOKS , and then some is the record of the publishing season thus far , with only the usual subsidence of the flood between the pre-holiday and post-holiday periods The responsibility for the imposing output can not be laid upon the book clubs , for they at best dispense only a volume a month each , and the new books that have no club sponsorship are legion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wave . Great and small among the dead have had their life histories recounted , no matter how often or how well the thing has been done before , and an insinuating number of the living have come forward either with their reminiscences or in biographies at which they presumably have connived . Not to have had one 's life written or the book at least planned and contracted for may before long cause one 's friends to arch their eyebrows . Psychology and philosophy come next in of der among the new books in point of importance , with fiction a poor third in quality in spite of its bulk , and after that a generous but miscellaneous sprinkling of travel , economics , history , and hooks on business subjects . There has been the usual threshing over of old straw in the form of compilations or new editions , and an increasing volume of translations . On the whole the quality of the native product , outside of fiction , has been good but not i emarkable.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
