In the King 's name : <P> Pants Shirts Cravats Coats Shaves <P> Such was the gist of a Royal Decree at which robed and bearded members of Afghanistan 's Parliament trembled , submissive but indignant . Meekly they obeyed . <P> Seven hundred strong they marched through the Capital City of Kabul to the Great Bazaar . There , by the generosity of alert , up-to-date King Amanullah of Afghanistan , they were assisted into pants , buttoned into shirts , tied with cravats and hustled into coats . All these garments , cut after modes observed by King Amanullah on his recent tour of Europe ( TIME , Jan. 23 to June 4 ) , had been made by Afghan needlemen from native approximations to suitings and shirtings . Remained only the titanic project of clipping , shaving . <P> At this crucial point several of the patriarchs in pants positively refused to be shaved . They pointed out that the Koran enjoins all Moslems to go bearded and turbaned , like the True Prophet . Enough to have transgressed the first of these commandments ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be shaved ! <P> When tidings of insubordination came to King Amanullah , he acted with wily moderation . In the King 's name it was shortly proclaimed that only those who especially desired the favor of His Majesty need shave . When Parliament assembled most chins were nude . <P> Suavely King Amanullah addressed the 700 . A despot , he can charm with honeyed words . He did . Perspiring patriarchs ceased to wriggle in their pants , succumbed to royal blandishments , beamed when King Amanullah implied that their high destiny is to make Afghanistan pants-conscious . <P> Later at a Grand Fete in the gardens of His Majesty 's palace , a special detachment of police gently prodded stray Parliamentarians who forgot that they were not robed and proceeded to squat upon the ground , though chairs abounded .
