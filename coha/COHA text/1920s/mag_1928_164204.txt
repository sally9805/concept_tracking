Wraith of a dreadful era , Gaston Bullock Means got out of prison last week .

The names in that were Fall and Denby , two Cabinet officers who were ousted , disgraced . Fall was tried but not convicted . <P> Means was not involved in the Veterans ' Bureau scandal . The name in that was Forbes , whose term at Leavenworth Penitentiary ended last winter . <P> Means was only a witness in the Alien Property scandal . The principals in that were Daugherty , the U. S. Attorney General , and Miller , the Alien Property Custodian . Miller went to Atlantic Penitentiary . Daugherty got off by one juror 's vote . <P> The Means crockery was only minor graft in the Department of Justice where he was lodged under Daugherty .
