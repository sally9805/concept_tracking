Aviators on the ground were speculating as to ? whether Robbins and Kelly would bring the ship to earth : around 4 o'clock , as they had stated they would in a note dropped at 1 P.

" thousands .. of spectators cried . The echo had hardly died away when the wheels and tail stick of the plane touched terra firma for the first time in more than seven days . Kelly was at the controls when the landing was made , with Robbins at his side . Throughout the week the flier on " rest " seated himself at the auxiliary controls in the rear of the plane 's cabin , but Robbins was in front with " Jim " when ' the ship came down . . The crowd , estimated ' tonight to have numbered 40,000 , had been kept in front of a roped-off area ' of about a half-mile for some two hours before the landing , but when the plane touched the earth and started to taxi " - to . the space where the ? spectators were waiting , the 100 police who had been also keeping them back were helpless : The great crowd swarmed onto the field . sweeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . policemen rushed to the plane , formed a human , chain around it ? and by main strength held the excited thousands at bay untitLady.Mary Heath , the fliers ' wives ana camera men and reporters could reach the aviators . .

" I knew you could do it , daddy , and when I get big-I 'll beat anybody who tries to beat you , " shoutedJack , the 6-year-old son of Robbins , as his . mother held him out . in her arms and his father took him on-stepping from the plane . . Then the problem of taking the now famous monoplane td a ? hangar and escorting the aviators to waiting automobiles ? presented ? ? itself .

" he said to his wife as they seated themselves . - " Why ? " Mrs. Kelly asked . " Because I was pining for you and I 'd have jumped down to you about Thursday , " was the reply . The Kellys have been married only two weeks . " How are those boys up at Wichita . Kan. , coming along in trying to beat our record , " Kelly asked a correspondent . " They 're still-up , " he was told . " That 's fine , " he replied , " I hope they make it . " Lady Heath Loses Shoes . Lady Heath rode with Robbins and his wife from the field to the city . She had lost her shoes in the mire of the landing field as the crowd swarmed around the plane . ' I did n't even know my shoes were gone - until .

Berreta of San Antonio , timer for the flight as the official representative ' Of the National Aeronautical Association . tonight wired the organization- that he clocked the landing at- exactly 4:05:25 , meaning Robbins and Kelly were in the air continuously for 172 hours ; 32 minutes and 2 seconds . ? Tonight the monoplane was safely stored away in a private ' hangar at Meacham Field , and , will not be put on display until tomorrow afternoon , when State troopers will be called to the field to stand guard . The Smithsonian Institution at Washington will receive the plane within the next month and has requested that it be safeguarded from souvenir hunters . Fliers Still In Joking Mood . From behind a week 's growth of stubble , James Kelly and " Reg " Robbins , pilots of the Fort Worth , joked with each other and with newspaper men half an hour after they had been lifted from their record-breaking plane . " What was the hardest part of your flight ? " Kelly , aged 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , was asked . " Keeping ' Reg ' awake long enough to pilot the ship so I could snatch a little sleep , " he laughingly replied . Both fliers declared they " would have stayed up a week longer " had the propeller . been in shape . Kelly believes the propeller was damaged when he threw the buckle on the safety belt with which he held himself to the tiny cat-walk under the machine 's engine . This happened last Monday morning and had no effect on the plane until . noon Saturday , when vibration of the motor was noticed . This was caused by the wobbling of the wooden propeller . During the rain early Saturday water . seeped into the split in the propellor and threw the blade off balance . Though the vibration increased steadily , Robbins and Kelly determined , at any cost , to stay in the air until 7:30 Saturday . when they smashed the Question Mark 's record . After this the fliers were spurred on into another night - of flying by the offer of the presidents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every hour- they maintained . their flight from - the time the record was broken . . Worried by Vibration . " Looked for sure like we would have to land about 2 A. M. , Sunday , " Robbins said . " Jim was at the controls at that time and I had been asleep . for about two hours . When I awoke , he called Mk attention to the fact that the vibration was so bad it was hardly likely we could- stay . up more than a few hours at the-most . " But I told Jim to let . me fly her awhile and . forget about the motor 's sound . Then Kelly gent to sleep and . I kept her going , hugging Meacham Field the rest of the night . " In a position where we might have had to bring the plane down almost any moment , I had to stick right over the field , because I had been notified by the National Aeronautical Association before starting that the record would not count if we did not land at the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight again Sunday morning . Kelly and I decided to see if v.a could n't make the old bus keep going until we had been in the air a week , which was at 11:33 A. M. today . When 10:15 A. M. came I dropped a note to Manager Fuller of the airport telling him we were about ready to come down with the propeller acting badly and vibration making every moment a risk , " But Jim and I kept thinking of the thousands we knew would want to see us land and we figured the crowd would be at its peak around 4 o'clock this afternoon . That 's why we set 4 P. M. as the time for our landing in the note we dropped at 12:52 P. M. " Motor Still Fit . Eddie Walsh of Dayton , Ohio , chief aeromotive expert for the Wright company for this section , inspected the Wright Whirlwind engine tonight and declared it to be fit for another week 's continuous flying . Physicians who examined the aviators soon after they landed thus described their condition : " Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormal condition we find is a slight deafness on the part of Robbins , occasioned by the continual drone of the airplane motor ; this did not affect Kelly , who hears perfectly , but is not sure he can be heard and talks in a louder than normal tone . He will regain his sense of proper tone of conversation after he has rested . " Large beefsteaks , hashed brown potatoes and sweet milk were ordered for the fliers for their first meal on the ground in more than seven days . Special attention was given tonight to Jack Robbins , 5-year-old son of the pilot , who is the idol of . young Texans at this hour . The Panther Boys ' Club , composed of newsboys of the city , honored Jack with a program in their club rooms . Kelly Within Inches of Death . FORT WORTH , Texas , May 26 QM . ? An accident which brought instant death near James Kelly , ' one of the pilots , forced the landing this afternoon of the monoplane Fort Worth . Examination of the propeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object which dented both blades and caused cracks to appear . Last night during the storm , while Kelly was suspended on a precarious perch under the motor of the plane greasing the rocker arms of the . valves , a buckle on- his belt nicked the propeller . Had the blade struck him even a slight , glancing blow he probably would have been cut- pieces by two sharp knives mving ' 1 ; 300 revolutions - a minute . In any case he would have been- thrown to the ground several thousand feet below . Experts who ermined , the propeller said that the blow of the belt buckle undoubtedly . split ? the properler . The fliers previously had ? believed the propeller had - been damaged in. the rainstorm encountered Saturday night , ' Say and Robbins by their feat James Kelly , Ex-Cowboy , Who Had . Had Little Air Experience eclipsed . the best . mark for singlemotored and tri-motored planes and for lighter-than-air machines , and " . all records for crews regardless of size . The fliers not only rode to fame , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Fort Worth Association of Commerce has passed the $12,000 mark and is mounting rapidly as a number of Weal Texas communiteis have suddenly taken an interest in it and made contributions . Presidents of a number of air transport companies yesterday promised the fliers $50 apiece for every hour they stayed aloft after the record was broken and this will amount to $2,200 or perhaps $2,300 . In addition to this . they already have opportunities to obtain many thousands of dollars with newspaper and magazine articles and vaudeville tours . All this is in addition to - any bonuses they may receive from the manufacturers of their equipment . Examination of the plane showed that the motor was still in good condition , and probably could run many more hours . The second-hand Whirlwind engine which Robbins picked up after another flier had discarded it never missed a beat in all the hours in the air . The propeller was the only part of the plane damaged , and long cracks in . - it showed the severity of the hail which the plane went through last night . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Lady Mary Heath of England , famous feminine pilot , who returned to Fort Worth front Temple this afternoon to see the end . of the flight . She is on her way " to the Pacific Coast . As the crowd made its rush for the plane , women and children were knocked to the muddy ground . Shoes were pulled by the sticky . mud off the feet of dozens of women , who could . not have stopped to pick them up had they wanted to because of the pressure behind . The official reception committee . Which numbered 100. was practically lost ' in the crowd- that ' before the plane landed . ? was massed around two sides of the 170-acre field . Tell of Intention to Land . Earlier in the afternoon the fliers had dropped a note , telling of their intention to ' land . " Fort Worth will - be landed around 4 o'clock , " said- the note . It added . that their ? propeller was " battered " and there was too much vibration . The , propeller fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated in the message . A second message stated that the fliers planned to remain . up as long as possible but might have to land at 4 P. M. The vibration caused by an unbalanced propeller revolving 1,300 times a minute would soon . wear it out or tear it from its moorings , pilots on the ground said . A forty-mile wind , accompanied by lightning and rain , swept the field last night and drove the fliers to Dallas , where they hovered for two hours . Today the plane had been seen over the field frequently under a high ceiling of gray clouds . The seventeenth refueling contact was made early this morning and 110 gallons of gasoline , with a bale of congratulatory messages , was passed to the aviators . ALL DURATION RECORDS FALL . Fort Worth Exceeds Marks of Both Planes And Dirigibles . The last duration-in-air record to fall before the Fort Worth was that of 150 hours and 40 minutes , made by the army 's endurance flight plane Question Mark , flying over Los Angeles last January . Before that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 25 minutes in 1928 by two German fliers , Wilhelm Zimmerman and Johann Risticz . The records of dirigibles for duration flights had been much longer , but ' even they were exceeded by the Question Mark and the Fort Worth . The Graf ** time in the air on its last trip from Germany to Lakehurst was 111 hours and 46 minutes . The world record , however , for dirigibles , was made by the FrenchGerman ship . Dixmude , vAiich remained in the air 118 hours and 41 minutes during a test flight over Southern Europe and Northern Africa two months before it was lost at sea . Former time records were held by the British R-34 , which occupied 108 hours in the first flight ever made by a dirigible across the Atlantic . The German-built ZR-3 , turned over to this country by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , and now known as the Los Angeles , remained in the air eighty-one hours when it flew from . Friedrichshaferi to takehurst , a distance of 5,060 miles , in October . 1924 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan brougham monoplane Fort Worth , piloted by Robbins and Kelly , took the air at 11:33 o'clock on the morning of May 19 , with a motor that had been previously used for 500 hours of flight . They planned , according to Robbins , to " stay up until she falls apart . " The Fort Worth was of virtually the same model as ' that used by Colonel Lindbergh in his Paris flight . The motor was of the Wright Whirlwind model . The ship had ' been entirely ' rebuilt , but Robbins had objected to having the motor - rebuilt . He said that he could " coax it better " if it Were not changed . The fliers maintained an average rate of sixty miles an hour ; ' keeping the plane near the landing field so that their records , would be , protected if they were ' forced into a sudden landing . They traveled a total of about 10,000 miles , about - three times the distance covered by , ? Colonel Lindbergh in his Paris flight - His flight was about 3,600 millet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Former Railroad Mechanic and Self-Taught Flier . veteran , who - flew for France ' before the United States entered ' the war , - piloted the refueling plane . The Ship was equipped . with a catwalk which surrounded the motor . A second unusual feature installed- by Robbins was a dual control situated back of the gasoline tank , which occupied the space in the cabin formerly designed for passengers . This dual control was operated by Robbins while Kelly handled the refueling hose when the ship was being refueled . The ship took off with 250 gallons of gasoline and added 100 gallons every twenty-four hours of the flight .
