txt WOOL TARIFF . Says Tailoring Industry Is Against Increase . To the Editor of The New York Times : The Tariff bill has been reported back to the Senate by , the Senate Committee of - Finance , with certain revisions . It provides for a rate of 33 cents per pound on raw wool , and an increase of 50 per cent . in the present schedule on Manufactured woolens . The ? enactment into law of this increased tariff must inevitably result in very unhappy consequences to both the Wool growing and moot manufacturing industries . Indeed , in my humble opinion , it would ' not be surprising if the public reaction from such duties as the bill provides for were an irresistible demand for free wool . Since the Senate Finance Committee reported the increased wool . schedule , the American Woolen Company announced increases of from ten to fortyfive cents a yard . They have  --  Justified this because of the Increased cost of raw materials . Further increases may be expected from all woolen manufacturers until the cost ' of woolens comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , the woolen menufacturers are known to be in favor of the increased duties on manufactured woolens . This will permit them to raise their prices ; and this they will do without any regard for the public . Both these rate increases are being I fostered by groups of selfish interests acting entirely Andependently of the general welfare of the clothing industry , and Of the country as a whole . Final attention should be given to the ultimate consumer . The proposed duty of 33 cents per pound on the scoured content of wool and that of 45 per cent . ad valorem on cloth would increase the cost of the average suit of clothes to the extent of from ? $1 to $5 , thus adding an additional burden where ultimately the high cost of living is most keenly felt . The consumers of cloth in the United States would be taxed many millions of dollars yearly to protect the wool growers , whose entire output multiplied many times would not begin to clothe the country . The big fight of the retailers has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are just now getting prices down to a point where the public will accept them as fair . If these increased duties go into effect , prices must go up again . This will result in two thinga ; some clothiers will retain their quality and raise prices , thereby forcing the consumer out of the market again . ? Other clothiers will attempt to retain the present prices , through plundering quality . No matter what the clothier does , he is headed straight for another lengthy depression and general unhealthy conditions in the industry . Clothing is a big part of the high.cost of living and , this being a period of reconstruction , what the public needs is a reduction of its clothing bill , not a multiplication of it . Speaking for the man who buys clothes and speaking for the tailoring industry as a. whole , we unalterably oppose any increase in the wool or woolen tariff . IV . W. ARNHEIM . New York , April 29 , 1922 . WOMEN 'S RESOLUTIONS . Corrects Report as to Remarks Made to Senate Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you permit me to correct several inadvertent- errors , in the report published this morning under the heading , " , Miss Kilbreth Denounces as Bolshevists Women Urging Congress to Reduce the Army " ? The report is inaccurate in ascribing the presentation of the resolutions to me , as they were presented respectively by Mrs. B. L. Robinson . President of the Massachusetts Public Interests League ; Mrs. Rufus M. Gibbs , Secretary of the Women 's Constitutional League of Maryland , and Mrs. Leo H. Fallon ; Chairman of the executive board of the latter organization . The reporters arrived , I believe , after the three other women had been heard , and hence no doubt supposed that the last speaker , had been the only woman testifying . I did not call women who urge a small army " Bolshevists , " as indieated by the report and heading . I did not call them anything . I simply read from the official proceedings of the international Congress of Women at Zurich in 1919 and from the International Congress of Women at Vienna in 1921 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did refer to the present so-called " Pan American " conference at Baltimore as " The Women 's Third International , " which I believe a Very accurate description sustained by the proceedings , and it was by " association of Picas " that this was reported as " Bolshevist in principle . " The report says that " she did not indicate the women to whom she referred . " On the contrary , names , dates and statements from official documents were used throughout my testimony and were filed with the committee and examined by the reporters present , The report is otherwise fairly accurate and my only reason in calling attent ; on to its errors is to protect myself from the charge of having ' made wild , reckless and obscure charges , when , in fact , I presented only official documentary evidence , with little comment , and no calling of these women " Bolshevists , " although I did read one letter from a woman endorsing commuri ism , Whose name I also gave . The inaccuracies the . report are not criticised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tinder which newspaper men must work . But to let them stand without correction would be to invite editorial criticism based on what somebody hurriedly supposed I said , instead of on my own Words , or the documents which I submitted to the Appropriations Committee . MARY C. KILBRETH . New York , April 25 , 1922 . Check Payroll Difficulties . To the Editor of The New York Times ; Does Mayor Hylan , in his character of Friend of the People , see that paying by check woUid ! moos a burden on wage earners ?

If they go to a bank It must be in working hours , perhaps Paying carfare and losing time furnishing satisfactory identification ; If they ask the favor of an acquaintance they place themselves in a position which may likely embarrass them . If they offer checks ' to the few tradesmen to within- they may fortunately be known , they similarly ' incur . obligation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bar themselves from the free competition of other- tradesmen they could approach with money in hand .

To the Editor Jf The New York Times : Your readers have doubtless been delighted by the words and sentiments with which the genial and gifted Edward Beck has so enlivened your editorial page of today . From behind the mask of a gravity almost if not quite as profound as that of the great Conan Doyle himself , he has launched forth jest after jest with surprising ease and bewildering rapidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his ghosts in an array which might well confute the skeptical . Please allow me , in the same broad spirit of conviviality , most heartily to agree with Mr. Peek in the perfectly obvious fact that ' there is no effect without a cause . " Permit . me also to , express perfect accord with his statement : , " That the existence of this energy is a fact is absolutely proved by experimen t . " Joseph Rhin has made corns most conclusive experiments along these lines . Professor Crawford also made some very remarkable experiments ( until he discovered that his life work had been utterly confused by rascally mediums and committed suicide ) . Paladin ? , Mary Ellen and many others have likewise conducted most astonishing experiments  --  until they were found out But I would ask of Mr. Beck that , in the gay abandon which marks his consideration of the subject , he exercise some care not to Confuse the mind-reading and telepathic stunts accompanying the usual seance with the purely physical phenomena of tabletipping , levitation , &c.,; so familiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? manifestations " offers an interesting field or investigation for the psychologist , the loa ? tor of medicine and the private detects ... The second is properly the province of the physicist . the chemist and the engineer , who in due time will doubtless be able to control these " forces of nature for the benefit of mankind . " Meantime , for the sentimenta.list. the emotionalist and the would-be leader of a new sect to tamper with such things is not only unprofitable but decidedly dangerous to the Innocent bystander . As for Conan Doyle himself , I can not consider Sir Arthur without calling sharply to mind certain recent articles by . Stephen Leacock JOHN WHIPPLE . New York , April 15 , 1922 . Dogs , Police and Robbers . To the Editor of The New York Times : At this time : when crime is rife , robberies and hold-ups daring and unhampered , it will doubtless afford complete gratification to our citizens to learn /that since Jan. 1 there have been 1,020 arrests of dog owners for allowing their dogs- to go unmuzzled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken care of , evidently . What does it matter if houses and stores are robbed and harmless persons assaulted in our streets , if dog owners are brought to time ? Naturally the police , absorbed in this vital pursuit , can not be expected to attend to little matters like burglary and assault . Those of us who live in the Washington Square section were greatly interested to find that on a recent Sunday , at the hour when a house was entered and its occupants locked In the vault , a guardian of the law in the square in front of the house was manfully doing his duty by serving a summons on a man whose small terrier was unmuzzled . Yes , it is great to feel that we have adequate protection and our laws enforced . WASHINGTON SQUARE . New York , April 23 , 1922 . , Quebec 's Temperance . To the Editor of The N.cw Ym-lc .

Ills two weeks ' visit to the Province enabled him by a " careful investigation of one year 's results " to pronounce the law a success . As the law came in force May 1921 , and Mr. 's careful investigation was only up to Dec. 31 , 1921 , Ills one year is somewhat limited . Too short to pronounce on the law 's success or failure . In the United States those who favor the Eighteenth Amendment and the enforcing laws are more liberal in regard to time allowance . it will take ten , fifteen or twenty ykars to solve the problem of an age-long evil and to say whether a law dealing with such a vast problem will be successful .
