txt The staccato beats from six hammers rent the air over the prairie at One Hundred and Third street and Perry avenue yesterday afternoon . In neat piles lay sections of a ready made house . The busy workmen were the mly relief in the prairie setting . Downtown in his office sat Adolph F. Kramer , president of the Chicago real estate ' board . He was smiling . A. vision appeared before his eyes . First there was , the barren prairie . Then suddenly a small house appeared . Many more houses like it dotted the landscape until finally there was no more prairie . It was Mr. Kramer 's dream for the solution of the high rent problem in Chicago . Nucleus of a New City . The start of all of this was about to come true . The workmen were putting up Chicago 's first portable home in which some tenant would find relief from high rents . It was the nucleus of a mushroom city of portable homes to be occupied by hundreds of other desperate tenants . Several sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . R. S. Bassett of the Alexander Lumber company was whistling . The house was to be a surprise to the committee to show its members how the high rent situation can be met tlAugh the portable home plan . Appeared there , then , Francis Beemster , business agent of Carpenters ' union , local No. 434 . Beemster surveyed the scene quickly and raised his hand . " Come out of there , " he called to the carpenters . " Stop this work at once . There will be no portable houses put up by Chicago union labor until we get orders from headquarters . " Nothing Doing . ' Bassett ran over to Beemster as the men dropped their tools . " But this is union made goods , " he pleaded . " There is not a board in these sections that has not been put there by a union carpenter . It is true this house was made outside of Chicago . But it is the quickest way of getting buildings put up to relieve the shortageof homes here . " " Makes no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Carpenters ' District council , says nothing doing on this kind of a house . Better see him . " And thus was stopped the first effort to end the high rent conditions through the housing of families in quickly erected buildings . Charges a Combine . " This looks to me like a combine between the union officials and the building material interests , " said Mr. Bassett last night . " We secured a building permit to put up the house and hired union carpenters to put it together . In fact , all the work on it is union . The rub is that the material was not produced by a Chicago concern . " Mr. Brims , who was reached at his home in Austin last night , said : " The portable house is a project against the interests of our organization , " said Brims . " I consider that the only real union made house is the one manufactured on the ground by Chicago carpenters . As for a combine with the material men , that is absurd . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to investigate first whether it is union made , " said Beemster . " If it is I think there ought not to be any trouble getting it erected . " Faith in the portable home project was not lost by Mr. Kramer . ' This is a serious thing , but I think there has been some mistake , " said Mr. Kramer : " I think it can be straightened out with the union officials .. We will endeavor to reach a . settlement tomorrow . "
