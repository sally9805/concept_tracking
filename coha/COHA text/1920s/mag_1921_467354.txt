ALARM at the ignorance of young men just out of college , and middle-aged men around college , and other men at any distance from college has not only always been easy to me ; it has always been very agreeable ; and I believe this is true of all my acquaintances . I doubt if I have ever met a man of mature years who did not take a genuine pleasure in the ignorance of other people , whether in or out of college . I do not know what the sociologists have said about it , but I suppose they have shown that upon this instinct all human conversation is founded , modified , of course , as civilization advances . Buns , I imagine , would call it the cause of all human laughter , arguing that prehuman laughter probably had some other cause . Guns , I believe , regards it as the source of both talk and laughter , whether of man or beast . Wunz , on the other hand , while all for the prehuman origin , would incline , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to say , of the ignorance of other people as the pleasure-source of talk . I have not looked up the passages , but from what I know of the spirit of their writings I believe these authorities would divide in about this way . Before going farther , I will say that the point I am coming to has to do with the discussion following the appearance of Mr. Edison 's list of questions for young men just out of college and with the samples offered by educational writers before and since of the sort of things all other people , young or old , under the sun should know . But in accordance with contemporary literary usage , I shall not advance abruptly to that point , if I advance to it at all . I shall first go back to dawns and origins , not forgetting for one instant that both the reader and myself are members of human society . I shall go back only to primitive man , though I might go back much farther . Like other admirers of Mr. H. G. Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do not choose to do so any reader of this article may simply thank his stars . Now , in primitive life , as I gather from Mr. Havelock Ellis , or Mr. Graham Wallas , or Doctor Dreimacher , or M. Bergson , or the late Joseph Deniker ? or , at any rate , as I gather ? in primitive life human conversation was exceedingly cruel , began , indeed , as cruelty in a modified form . When the torture and killing of captives gave way to the milder satisfactions of enslavement men missed the rude gayety of the earlier sport . Talk in a measure supplied it . The stronger talked and the weaker listened ; the answer , in the modern sense , did not exist . Conversation was not , as the word implies , a turning about ; there was no turn about , it was one-sided : if two tried to do the talking one was killed . Among the Zingputs conversation was always opened by a blow from the bashdab husher ) , a short , blunt instrument of burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recipient remaining on the ground . Men listen where they fall , says the Zinout proverb . Among the Magrubs , the chief always carried the teeka-teeka ( literally , talk spear ) , made of the tusk of the swamp hog , which was driven through the fleshy portion of the left thigh of listeners into a painted post provided for the purpose . In the Goli language the verb " to listen " meant literally " to have both legs broken " and the noun " listener " meant etymologically " the man unable to move . " It is curious to observe that the word " poet " in many primitive tongues meant merely the " man who holds you down . " According to Spickert , it was the Chinese , foremost in so many of these early particulars , who first observed that talk might proceed without maiming and who bound their listeners to trees ; and ropes were used by the Gauls before Caesar 's time , and leather thongs in the conversation of Germans , if scholars are right in their latest conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Imbrocatti . It never dawned on anyone , until long after civilization had done so , that any man could desire to know what anyone else desired to tell him . Signs of this in our present speech will occur to everyone . Lier conversation avec , holding a conversation , engaging one in conversation , fixing the attention , carrying the hearers away , and such terms as cogent , penetrating , enthralling , compelling speaker , gripping drama , rapt , ravishing , rani , carried along , swept off the feet , and a hundred others , now associated with mild or pleasurable mental states , all point to those centuries of physical violence and pain in talk ? to the seizure , throttling , stretching , binding , and perforating of the talked-to by the talker , the grapple of interlocutors , the clutch of the stronger speaker on the other 's throat , the stunning , dragging off , and spiking down of listeners . The modern vocabulary of conversational conditions is the blood-stained record of the efforts of the human mind to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Transactions of Bulgarian Royal Academy of Anthropology , vols. ilex , passim ) the pleasure of conversation never arose from merely telling others what they did not know , but required always that they should not wish to know it ? old battle-joy , torture , and blood-feast impulsions ; instincts of beating down , ramming , gouging ; pokes and thrusts of protoplasm in primordial slime , according to Mr. Wells ; throbs and churnings of the elan vital , according to M. Bergson ; all working themselves upward and outward on the secondary , or what is more commonly known as the human , plane of expression . But for the resistance to conversation , it is doubtful whether any of it would have occurred , and save M the very highest forms of civilized life none of it would have been accompanied by pleasure . Analogies in the life of the sphex , in the ejaculatory habits of the holothurians , and in the courtship of spiders will of course occur to everyone , but I have decided , at the risk of seeming superficial , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing that the word human is employed in this article , as in the best contemporary , social-evolutionary literature , with a watchful eye to possible mistakes . A careful writer nowadays will so use the word human that no lower animal whatever , on seeing the text , will think it refers to him . Hence the frequent distinction in contemporary belles-lettres of the human mind from lower minds in passages where a rabbit might otherwise be led astray . Publishers ' announcements that a biography deals with a man 's " human " side insure against any feeling of disappointment among vegetables . Formerly the word human was used regularly in contradistinction to the divine , lest the book might fall into the hands of the Lord and puzzle him . I follow recent usage here , taking only the biological precautions regarded as necessary in my time . Divorce of conversation-pleasure from early pounding and jabbing joy has proceeded slowly and with many back-settings , and , of course , has never been fully attained . But it has always been one of the chief , though undefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him even with agreeable teller , toin order that others might hate less to he told by him has always been a hidden motive of the teacher 's art . And here and there in the course of time the gesture of conversation did become less akin to that of murder and more akin to that of sport . In Greece , for example , where the answer was first invented , then endured , and finally welcomed , the original motive was for a few years and in a single city almost completely subdued , and men talked on an equal footing in the reciprocity of mere amusement , neither desiring that the other should carry away anything at all sticking in him . Talk was irrelevant to battle , food supply , transport , the defense of the state , the mastery of nature for physical ends ? not that it refrained from mentioning these activities , but that it did not display the qualities peculiar to them . Men did not talk as if they were fighting , or driving an animal to market , or forcing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts . Savage , that is to say instructive , conversation was not tolerated by those who knew the art , and the barbarity of the unmeaning , unrelated detail and anecdote strung along , as at a modern dinner party , was forbidden . The contents of pocket manuals of useful information were addressed , as the title indicated , merely to the pocket , and never communicated from mind to mind . Seeds for planting were not consumed in conversation , as fruit and facts were not valued for this purpose till after they had sprouted . This element has reappeared occasionally , but in no constant relation to the other elements of civilization , the talker often remaining brutal or barbarous when everything around him was mollified or improved . Still , it is an element always desired by educators even in societies wholly intent on the increase of men and of physical facilities ? even in societies like our own . VOL . CXLIII.  - -  No , 856. - 61 For the United States , according to the accounts of travelers and the confessions of its most enlightened natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk is still in its earlier stages among the highest in the land , being always the bare thrust of undesired information into the mind of a neighbor considered as a hole ? instinct of making and filling holes everywhere , instinct of woodpeckers , gophers , golfers , ground rodents , as Mr. Graham Wallas has probably put it . There is , to be sure , a sort of equilibrium . One half of our best society is always telling the other half what it does not wish to know , but the two halves take turns , and this establishes the conversation , usually on a peaceful basis . Control of the impulse to strike the other down has been acquired . And so in the equipoise of this give and take of the hated information we have the early form of social intercourse which we see to-day , among our upper classes , as when several of our better families meet for a little rough-and-tumble bout of it , for example , or as in our higher club life . All the best clubs in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that a man shall take his turn , that there shall be no blow struck , that for receiving information , however wide or miscellaneous , there shall be no other redress than returning it when the time comes . In club life if a man 's facts are more than the others can bear and his repression of them is impossible , he will now communicate them to a magazine , rather than push the matter hand to hand to its logical issue as in cave life . To this level my fellow countrymen and myself have climbed and we remain on it with difficulty . Mr. Edison 's list of questions , the sort of attention paid to them , and the articles of educators for twenty years as to what all other people ought to know add , I believe , to the danger of relapse . For they seem to imply that the very things we hate to hear , but love to tell one another should not only be learned by heart by young people , but should be learned by them at the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the informative portions of a Sunday newspaper , the better it is for the progress of the world ; and that a good mind will always retain all the miscellany that is thrown in it . Tell it the date of the battle of IEgospotami , who invented the scoop , the gallipot , the winch , where the Pescadores are , the Simplon tunnel , the Eustachian tubes , the doldrums , the Dolomites , the pituitary body , and the richest nitrate fields , when Dante died , how beans are canned , and what glue , zinc , guttapercha , macaroni , and Epsom salts are made of ; and then if it spills out any of these things , no matter how much it may wish to do so , it is not a desirable mind . A good mind may shoot them out even when unprovoked , but it will never throw any one of them away or drop it . There is not a word in these articles and not a hint in the manners of the men who write them that any humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , it is implied in the very nature of all articles on education that you should treat a subject just as disagreeably as you can . And all this simply because by a social accident manymen of this quality are for the moment heard from in high places , although in a few short years , assuming some slight improvement in our lot as listeners , we may have them all behind the bars . This view of the mind as an arsenal of undesired objects held solely in the hope of causing annoyance later on is of course common in the - writings of educators , but it may well have come to Mr. Edison independently and almost without reflection . It probably came to him in a flash , and when he was thinking about something else , as ideas generally do come to writers on education . And an idea darting into an educator in this manner out of the air around him may have fixed itself in solid form in institutions , perhaps in dozen schools and dormitories , and eye : then neither he nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A writer falls into a kind of doze , sees a bluebird nesting , writes an article for the Atlantic Monthly , and perhaps three years later all the school children at Arethusa , Indiana , are singing , " Drink to me only with thine eyes " and sewing the buttons on their mothers ' shoes , joy in every heart , unconscious of the taskmaster , with the whole bright world thrown open to them , containing the following objects : " geographical magazines , news weeklies , lantern slides , picture post cards , railroad folders , manufactured products , excursions to museums , and institutions and factories , " hardware catalogues , advertise-merits of gasoline , telephone directories , and the entire mail-order business of the country to roam in , not counting nature and the songs of the birds . And no reasonable man will object to it , or if he does object to it he will withdraw his objection the moment he sees the persons opposed . For , as has been often noted , all American culture battles end from the spectators ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side blocks the other , but that both sides fall of themselves ; and from the first moment it is evident to the spectator that the result of the conflict does not matter to him . Education is never at stake in educational discussions , although there may be one advantage to an educator in reading them . How not to employ the language of educational debate is one of the most useful things an educator can know ? probably inseparable from the art of teaching . I suppose no one in a fully conscious state ever enters an educational contest or , at any rate , ever does so with success , but if , as in dreams or in drunkenness , the world seems simple and things look smooth and he sees " broad outlines , " as the college presidents say , then he is ready to begin , and out of the air will come to him a battle cry . In the approach of the mind to a vacuum the social certainties expand . On the eve of public discussion they become enormous , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying with Mr. Bernard Shaw we had better stop teaching altogether , saying with Mr. Wells we had better leave it to international films , saying anything , for you can hardly tell one mind from another after its contents are removed . And in this country it is certain to occur , if lie has been wrapped up in one subject to the age of sixty-five , for in that case his advice is desired on all other subjects . Sixty-five years old , a monolith towering in a bank , or among automobile supplies , hams , cash registers , phonographs , ten-cent sales , or biscuit , he is certain to draw educators for the value of his views on other things . And as a practical man he naturally answers that there is no other thing , or if there is one that it is wholly subsidiary to a bank or a ham , and that children should be raised accordingly . Mr. Edison believed that all the college students in this country should be preparing for entrance in his shops . A powerful and specialized intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of repose . If I were an industrial specialist , even a little one , I am sure I should dislike the fumbling social processes around me , probably could not bear to think of them , and after one tenth of Mr. Edison 's astounding application to one set of things , everything else in the world m ould seem irrelevant to me . And as to mere young people miscellaneously growing up , I should not wish to see them growing up at all . I should much prefer that marriages be followed immediately by the birth of incandescent bulbs . Indeed , had invented a single incandescent bulb every particle of my mind would have gone to it and I should retire from the world in a self-respecting , and I hope respected , imbecility . A world perfectly illuminated , with perfect air traffic , perfect power and voice transmission , full only of rather elderly people with no nonsense about them traveling very fast everywhere , talking all the time to the people at home just as much as if they had not left them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interchanging by the best appliances of wireless items from the Pocket Dictionary of Engineering , Ploetz 's Epitome , and the Statesman 's Year Book ? I do not say that this is the idea of every great industrial genius ; I merely say that had room been made in my less spacious mind for any noticeable industrial ability , this is about the sort of idea that would have been left over ; and I believe that something like this idea always appears when you draw out a great industrial mind in the absence of its industrial genius . Blaming the industrial specialist as Matthew Arnold used to do is unimaginative and inhumane . As for me , I can blame no industrial wizard for forgetting certain objects when I , myself , after . a concentration far inferior to that of wizardry , after seeing a good play , for example , usually forget all objects , including objects really important to me , not merely the public objects that nobody carries home , such as a church , a nation , the future , human welfare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wizard should be admired , any more than I am , just at the time when he is forgetting these other objects . The attitude of other people toward myself seems much more sensible . Absorption in a good play is desirable , but the dropping of objects all the way home afterward is not , and while I have found much sympathy as an admirer of a good play , I have never received a word of praise as a dropper of valises afterward . Not once has a man come to me for advice on the bringing up of his children , simply because he saw me lose my hat . Yet that is the precise moment in the lives of all industrial wizards when the most intelligent of the reading public gather around them , educators in front taking notes for pedagogy . And since the industrial wizard can not , as a rule , tell the blessings of his life from the curses of his preoccupation , he is as likely as not , when consulted upon some general aspect of affairs , to advise everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing out of the practical men who can do things seems simply the turning of them on their backs like turtles , and I believe if the qualities they then display were acquired they would reary prevent anybody from doing anything . These lists , together with their context , must all be banished from the thoughts of men , for we are unpleasant enough to one another as it is . They check the rise of all the arts of peace . As to the art of conversation , which , in its civilized form , appears to be an agreeable balance of the contradictions of life maintained in common inquiry and speculation , they would put a stop to it if it ever should begin . They are merely weapons in the cutthroat competition of talk , and the most brilliant of contemporary talkers is armed with them to the teeth . They are based on the idea that it is the duty of all eon-temporaries to be contemporaneous , which comes as near to not being an idea as is possible . In proof of the perfect impartiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an editor of encyclopedias for twenty years I should not only profit financially from the prevalence of these views ; j should be able to shine with peculiar luster . After a new edition of my encyclopaedia with all the twenty-five volumes of it fresh in my mind , I have been so radiant with general information that people almost closed their eyes . j might , had I chosen , not only have held brilliantly my part in conversation ; j might have owned it all . I believe it was the look in people 's eyes that deterred me . At all events , instead of going on to this Napoleonic consummation , I turned aside and plucked out from my memory one by one , like slivers , thousands upon thousands of these little things , more useful than in the list of any educator , lest I might do some damage by them . But many still remain and I can still be , in the most useful and general way , disagreeable . Anger me , and I believe I could hold my own to-day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
