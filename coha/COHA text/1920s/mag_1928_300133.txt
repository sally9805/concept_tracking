The great U. S. communication systems are : 1 ) American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. ( telephones ) ; 2 ) International Telephone &; Telegraph Co. ( telegraph , cable , wireless , foreign telephone ) ; 3 ) Western Union Telegraph Co. ( telegraph , cable ) ; 4 ) Radio Corporation of America ( wireless telegraph , radio telephone ) . The four corporations are separate utilities and compete against each other for the U. S. communication business . <P> Their lust for business last week befuddled the much badgered Federal Radio Commission . Two of the companies-the I. T. &; T. ( through its subsidiary Mackay Radio &; Telegraph Co. ) and R. C. A. demanded the right to set up wireless telegraph stations and sell service between cities in continental U. S. <P> Heretofore , with a minor exception , they have kept their business to sending messages over seas-to stations abroad , to ships on the oceans or Great Lakes , to coastal shipping points . <P> That one exception is on the Pacific Coast . Between Los Angeles , San Francisco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the . I. T. &; T. ) operate a land wireless system . It is the only continental commercial radio service in the world . <P> The I. T. &; T. wants to make such land wireless service cover the continent . Through Charles Evans Hughes Jr . it demanded of the Federal Radio Commission 60 short wave wireless channels. * <P> R. C. A. declared that it needed 32 point-to-point stations at once , wanted the right to 67 , would like 148 all told . Colonel Maton Davis , R. C. A. general counsel , was the spokesman . He had persuasive technical men fortify his case . <P> The members of the Federal Radio Commission last week listened to these demands . They listened also to two other and similar demands-from Inter-City Radio Telegraph Co. of Cleveland for 50 stations , from Universal Wireless Communication Co. of Buffalo , a new concern , for 125 stations. + <P> These demands put the Federal Commission in quandary . Wireless experts figure that 208 short wave wireless channels can be used for communications within the U. S. Of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so are forbidden to U. S. commercializers . Not enough channels are available to satisfy even the present four petitioners . <P> Then there is the interstate business that these companies want to do . In such respect the radio commissioners realized that they must be circumspect in their judgments-not to infringe on the surveillance and authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission . <P> Also there is the maintenance of competition , the avoidance of monopoly , which the Federal Trade Commissioners like to oversee . Already the Postal Telegraph ( I. T. &; T. subsidiary ) and Western Union are sending telegrams and photograms over Bell Telephone wires . I. T. &; T. has not abandoned its hope of buying control of R. C. A. Yet the appearance of competition seems certain to persist . Transoceanic wireless has forced the reduction of cable rates until the two services now charge practically the same prices . What land wireless rates will do to land wire rates no one before the Federal Radio Commission last week could estimate . President Simon of the Inter-City Radio Telegraph Co. stated that his rates between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rates .
