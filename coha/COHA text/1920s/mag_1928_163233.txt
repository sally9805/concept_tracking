Dawn revealed on a field of honor near Budapest last week two duelists , a Hungarian cavalry officer and an Italian count , who faced each other with sharp swords because of a U. S. Negro danseuse from Harlem , famed Josephine Baker ( TIME , July 4 ) . A year ago La Baker was the tawny , chocolate toast of jaded Parisian boulevardiers . Later in Vienna her dances-by turns sinuously seductive and jazz-mad-created a sensation so profound that a socialist deputation petitioned the Austrian Government to " prevent the nude , brazenfaced and heathen dances of Fraulein Josephine Baker from taking place anywhere in Austria " ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) . <P> Though the petition was unsuccessful , La Baker has since progressed from Vienna down the Danube to Budapest . There she has developed a penchant for riding through the stately boulevards of the Hungarian capital in a small , trig carriage drawn by an ostrich . Naturally many a Hungarian dandy and fop has ogled Negress Baker through his characteristic , heavy-lensed monocle . . . . <P> <P> Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became too fervently gallant to be stomached by La Baker 's manager , Count Pepito di Albertini , an Italian of doubtful nobility whom tawny Josephine Baker once positively declared to be her husband , a statement she later denied . Therefore , last week , the proprietary Count challenged the ogling Captain . <P> For their field of honor the duelists chose appropriately a cemetery . There , seated on a tombstone , La Baker screamed Afric encouragement to her Count , last week , while he bravely parried for ten minutes the shrewd sword thrusts of Captain Czlovoydi . When the Cavalryman at last slightly pinked the Count on the shoulder , Negress Baker flung herself hysterically between the duelists , and shrieked her loudest , until the seconds hastily agreed that honor had been satisfied and the duel was at an end .
