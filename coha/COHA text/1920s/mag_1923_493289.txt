. The Rising Tide of British Labor SUPERFICIALLY the important lesson of the British election is the defeat of the Tory government as a penalty for its general ineptitude . There are , of course , many facts which corroborate this interpretation . The Baldwin Cabinet had failed to handle the critical problems of either foreign or domestic policy in a manner which eased the discomfort or increased the self-esteem of the British people . Considering the completeness of his failure to get the better of his country 's problems , Mr. Baldwin 's sudden appeal to the voters on the irrelevant issue of protection looked like poor politics and worse statesmanship which the British people have punished as it deserved . This , comment is true , but it is far from being the whole or the most important truth about the British election . Although Mr. Baldwin has suffered a deserved defeat , his defeat may eventually prove to bring many compensations ? if not to his country , at least to'his party . The Conservatives will certainly turn out to be stronger and more capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A really successful government . for Great Britain is just at present difficult almost to the point of impossibility . Mr. Bald-win 's successor , whoever he may be , can not form a government with a united and aggressive English majority opinion behind it ; and even if he could the practical impossibility of formulating and carrying out a capable foreign and domestic policy would before long assure his downfall . If he be unsuccessful and another general election soon follows , the Tories , would enter the contest under so much more favorable conditions that they might well win a clear victory . After a demonstration that the only practicable substitute for a Conservative government was one which is no more capable of governing successfully than the Conservatives had been , the British public might jump to the conclusion that the Conservative party provided the least undesirable variety of fumbling . And whenever they resumed power they would be more united than they have been , more sharply distinguished from their adversaries and more confident of the comparative availability of their own modest program . The most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not the defeat of the Conservatives but the unexpected increase in strength of the Labor party . Labor fought the election under prodigious handicaps . It suffered from insufficient preparedness and equipment , from the lack of aggressive fighting spirit , from a dearth of well-known candidates and popular speakers and from a somewhat general attitude of discouragement within its own ranks . Its program contained a number of unpopular planks and no longer aroused as much enthusiasm of conviction among its supporters as it once did . It was opposed not only by a more united Tory party but by a reunited Liberal party . Its opponents appealed to the voters through the voices of the most capable and popular speakers in Great Britain , including practically every man who had served in the government for the last ten years . The Liberals in particular were aggressive and confident . They fully expected to substitute themselves for Labor as the party second to the Conservatives in ' strength ; and they expected as the result of the election to demonstrate an increase in popular support which would prophesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these handicaps the Labor party won an astonishing victory . It elected almost 190 members to the new Parliament as compared with less than ' so in the last . With one exception it returned to Parliament all its most capable leaders , which was not true of either of its rivals . Its candidates triumphed in almost half the constituencies which it could afford to contest . If it could have contested another hundred seats , it could have increased its strength considerably . The next Parliament will contain approximately almost more Labor than it will Liberal members . The party is by far the most compact , able , experienced and trustworthy organized group of political and economic radicals which has assembled under one political flag in any modern nation . Hitherto its sympathizers in other countries , if they were candid , could not reasonably conceive it as anything but a plant of tender growth which might not survive the rough and tumble fights and the costly vicissitudes of practical politics . But as the result of this election the Labor party can fairly claim to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British political and social life to survive much unfavorable weather . It is likely to keep growing and ultimately to undertake the responsibility of government . The Labor party won its victory even more at the expense of the Liberals than at the expense of the Tories . Its success increases the probability that Labor rather than Liberalism will finally emerge as the official competitor with Conservatism for temporary possession of the right to rule Great Britain . The Liberals have steadily insisted that , if they were reunited and presented with an issue which sharply distinguished them from the Conservatives , they would regain their prestige and popularity and reduce Labor to the negligible dimensions of the former Independent Labor party . This claim now seems less plausible . The recent elections reunited the Liberals and gave them the one issue about which they could talk most confidently . Yet they added little to their popular support and still ran a poor second to Labor . What will become of them hereafter ? Are they capable of gaining enough votes at the expense either of Conservatives or of Labor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain in this way , are they not likely to shrivel as Labor adds to its membership , until in the end their right wing will ? go over to the Conservatives and the left wing rally to Labor ? These are , of course , extremely practical questions ; and the events of the next few months will throw some light on the answers to them . English government in its traditional form becomes impossible when Parliament is divided into three factions , no one of which contains a majority and no two of which will coalesce . That is apparently the situation today . It is probable that one of these three factions will have to give way and , distribute its members between its rivals . Manifestly it will not be the Tories . In any changing constitutional state , one party must represent the class which benefits from the established institutions of the country and consents reluctantly to proposed alterations in the balance of political and economic power . The question is whether the alternative party , the party of conscious organized social progress , will call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remains doubtful , but after the election it is more than ever probable . that Liberalism will eventually combine with Conservatism to form a party , which , while it would not merely obstruct political and economic readjustment , would use every pretext to prevent reconstruction from travelling too far or too fast . The reason why Liberalism will probably coalesce with Conservatism rather than Labor and thereby lose many of its more radical members is sufficiently obvious . Liberalism is less divided from the Conservatism of today than it is from Labor . The first two are expressions of the points of view of a middle class , whose prestige depends on the association between the ownership of private property and political power . They are alarmed at the prospect of confiding the government of the country to workers who do not own ' private property . At present both of the older parties are partially progressive . They admit the necessity of planning innovations in industry and government , but they are not willing to accept the shift in the distribution of social power for which the Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private property by distinguishing drastically between those forms which are socially beneficial in their operations and those which are not beneficial . It represents the rise of a class which , while it seeks increasing comfort and leisure , is trying to obtain what it seeks not by personal accumulation but by increasing the amount of socialized property and by giving increasing dignity and competence to labor by hand and brain . A class of this kind has , as the result of the trades-union and the cooperative movements , gradually overcome the obstacles to its social leadership . No doubt it still needs an increase in numbers , in self-consciousness , in technical ability and in social vision before it can successfully assume the onerous responsibility of governing in the interest of reconstruction , but it is going strong and it has a fair chance of arriving . Its advent and its increasing success are quite the most promising and significant political and social enterprise which is taking place in the world of today .                @ @ @ @ @
