Two men shook hands on a mat in full view of 15,000 Kansans . One was Wayne ( " Big " ) Munn of Kansas City , local hero . The other was Ed . ( " Strangler " ) Lewis , world 's heavyweight wrestling champion , whose unpopularity was evinced by squalls of boos . <P> Then began the slapping , spanking bout of brawn and brain . A sinewy limb slipped under an unprotected crotch , another encircled an unguarded torso , there was a sudden jerk forward , followed by a heavy fall , and Champion Lewis found himself pinioned beneath 250 pounds of his opponent . <P> The second fall began with feline caution . The two wrestlers stepped this way and that but never a hold did they get . Suddenly Munn strode forward , seized the hapless Lewis , heaved him high into the air and over the ropes . The fall was heavy , but its noise was drowned by the thunderous applause from the Kansans . Lewis lay prone . Invectives were hurled at his limp form . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped into the ring . " It 's a foul ! " cried he . " A dirty foul ! You 've got to award us the match ! " The swarthy Munn peered querulously across the mat , tore off his bathrobe , assumed a bellicose attitude , confronted the irate manager . Munn 's manager likewise grew threatening ; but for all that the referee gave the fall to Lewis on a foul , allowing the latter 15 minutes to get back into the ring . The crowd was indignant , stormed about the ringside , hooting , booing . <P> The last fall was quickly decided . Lewis appeared , his back well bandaged ; soon he was lying limp on those bandages . The heavyweight title had passed to Wayne Munn . The crowd went " mad-dog , " scrambled on its seats , shook the rafters of Convention Hall as it screeched , boomed , barked salvos of shouts for the victor . Many sportsmen caterwauled at the dejected figure with the bowed head in the centre of the ring . A yokel was heard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're hurt ! " <P> After the match , Lewis was taken to a hospital , where it was said that he was suffering from a strained sacroiliac joint ( that part of the vertebra that joins the pelvis ) . His discharge from the hospital was considered imminent , but there were plenty of opinions that said he would never Wrestle again . <P> Manager Sandow remarked after the match : <P> " If Munn thinks he is going to get that diamond belt* he is mistaken , for he should have been fouled out of the bout when he threw Lewis from the ring . " <P> * Belt studded with 39 diamonds and worth $10,000 . It was awarded to the champion several years ago by the Central Athletic Club .
