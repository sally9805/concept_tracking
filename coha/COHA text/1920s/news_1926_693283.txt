txt A cablegram from King Ferdinand today caused Queen Marie to abandon her plans for an extensive trip through the South and prepare to sail from New York Mir Europe on Dec. 11 . The message from the King told Queen Marie that both he and the Rumanian people were anxious to hay " . their Queen back with them for Christmas . Queen Marie sent back word this evening that she would be home for Christmas and those in charge of her tour in this country began making plans in conformity . Plans for the Queen 's return had been tentative ever since her arrival and at first it was understood that she would sail about Dec . Within the last few days plans for a trip through North Carolina and possibly into Florida had been far advanced . In accordance with her royal husband 's request for her early return , the Queen gave up most of the Southern trip tonight After the royal family 's return to Washington , however , they will ' go to White Sulphur Springs and Richmond . Va. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit it is hoped will afford quiet and rest for the Queen . A one-day trip to Boston will be made in this interval . Arrangements were made this evening for the Queen and her entourage to sail on the Majestic on Dec . Rumanian Jews Honor Marie . Queen Marie , whose visit to America has prompted numerous resolutions of protest against alleged persecution of Jews in Rumania , made a graceful gesture toward the Rumanian Jews today when in the midst of a crowded program she spent three-quarters of an hour in a Rumanian synagogue , far out on the West Side of Chicago . It was also a gesture of friendship on the part of the Rumanian Jews toward the Rumanian sovereign . The synagogue of the First Rumanian Congregation at Douglas Boulevard and Millard Avenue was packed to its capacity of 2,000 three hours before the Queen , Prince ' Nicholas and Princess Ileana arrived . Thousands more waited outside all afternoon in a drizzling rain and milled about in the mud , all for a glimpse of the Queen . The boulevard and its connecting streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party arrived , an hour behind schedule , the police bad difficulty to provide a , path for them . There are 8,000 Rumanian Jews in Chicago , and it seemed as if they ' ere all in the church or massed outside it . Leaders of the Rumanian colony here explained that the illfeeling of Rumanian Jews toward the Crown was limited almost entirely to the Jews of the provinces acquired since the war . The Jews of the old Rumania , they said , were loyal to the sovereign . Three middle-aged women and three men who were distributing handbills attacking the Queen among the crowd about the synagogue were arrested by policemen and detained for several hours . They were booked on charges of disorderly conduct and were released on bond of $50 each . The pamphlets charged that workers were murdered or imprisoned in Rumania , and spoke of " extravagant orgies " in the royal ' court . One Hint of Criticism . In one of the speeches of welcome to the Queen , however , that delivered by Judge Harry M. Fisher of the Circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of criticism of the position allotted to Jews in the Queen 's realm . This occurred in his remark that he hoped that " some dal even our people will share in they prosperity of Rumania . " If Judge Fisher intended this for criticism , he neutralized it a moment later with the declaration that , " if any greet you without the appreciation that we feel for your Majesty , remember that ' they are only individuals and are speaking only for themselves : " Queen Marie , looking decidedly tired and drawn , spoke only a few words in acknowledgment of the greetings . " I am happy to be among this Jewish community , " she said . " The news of the loyal way in which you have received me here will give great satisfaction to the King , for the Jews constitute a very dear part of his people . " Today 's ceremonies had been arranged by A. G. Feldman , President of the congregation , and B. J. Braunstein , President of the United Rumanian Jews of Illinois . Henry Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was decorated ' - by King Ferdinand for his gifts to Rumania during and after the World War , presented a gold-bound booklet to the Queen . Cantor Theodore Killay rang psalms of welcome to the Queen and her children , while a choir in the gallery chanted responses . The reception to the Queen in the synagogue offered a nice problem in etiquette . Custom requires that hats be doffed in the presence of royalty . The Jewish religion requires that men remain with heads covered in their houses of worship . All conformed to the religious rule . During the playing of the American and Rumanian national anthems some men stood at salute , while others stood with their hats lifted slightly above their heads . Flashlights boomed for a battalion of cameramen throughout the ceremonies . One final blast near the royal family was so loud that all started , and Prince Nicholas . who also is showing the strain of the strenuous programs , positively glared in indignation . Because of the unrest among certain sections of the Rumanian Jews the police had taken unusual precautions to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were scores of detectives . The police reported afterward that their only difficulty had been in quelling the enthusiasm of the crowd , which made it break police lines and almost block the exit of the royal party . At a Greek Orthodox Church . Preceding her reception by the Jews , Queen Marie and her children attended a Rumanian Greek Orthodox Church , as they have every Sunday they have spent in America . The church , St. Mary 's , is a tiny structure among workingmen 's homes on Webster Avenue , one of the most densely populated parts of Chicago . The Queen and her children stood under a scarlet canopy and listened to the chanting of the Te Deum by five priests in robes of red , gold and silver . The priests bowed low and kissed the Queen 's hand at the conclusion of the religious services . Again the cry " Traiasca Regina " ( long live the Queen ) rang out in the little edifice . It was taken up shrilly by girls in Rumanian pea sant costumes . A group of photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no photographs should be taken there , and they filed out again . The Queen 's day of public appearances began at 11:15 o'clock this morning , when a military band formed outside the Lake Shore Drive Hotel , where the Queen and her party are : staying , and played martial music . The Queen , who had been awake since early morning , appeared in the door , and the royal salute of twenty-one guns was fired . The Queen and her children were guests of honor at a luncheon at noon of Mrs. Rockefeller McCormick at her home on Lake Shore Drive . There the Queen saw Samuel Hill for the first time since he left the royal train under ' pressure at Seattle . Mr. Hill at a conference last night had told Colonel John H. Carroll , in command of the train as the Queen 's host , that he was here only on business and would not call on the Queen , except at her request . His appearance at the luncheon , it was understood , was in response town Invitation from Mrs. McCormick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hill arrived alone and had no conversation with the Queen , except in the general conversation at the Queen 's table , where he sat . He did not join the party after the luncheon , but left alone and departed at 9 o'clock for New York . The luncheon was an informal affair attended by a small group of Chicago society folk . Among the guests were Mr. and Mrs. J. Ogden Armour , Joseph G. Coleman , Mr. and Mrs. William M. Blair , Prince and Princess Michael Cantacuzene , Mrs. Waller Borden , the Duchess Torlonia , Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Patterson and Mr. and Mrs. Robert R. McCormick . Before the luncheon the Queen and her children were taken for an automobile ride , in the course of which Queen Marie laid a wreath before Lincoln 's statue in Lincoln Park and visited a fresh-air sanitarium . At the sanitarium an unscheduled reception took place . The Queen , herself the mother of six , left her role of sovereign a moment to take up in her arms an unusually pretty infant , the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentedly against the Queen 's astrakhan coat , the Queen pressed her face against the baby 's pink neck and cooed to her as she had cooed to her own in their infancy . Again the photographers came into play . The Queen protested . " You 'll frighten it with the light , " she said . The photographers said they hoped not , that the picttl , re was too good to miss . " I know you 'll make it scream , " the Queen insisted . The blasts were set off . The baby in the Queen 's arms bore it stoically , although there was a wail of indignation from adjacent cribs . Prince Nicholas and Princess Beane also seemeu charmed by the little Rumanian girl . " Her eyes are so like yours , mother , " remarked Nicholas . " And almost as blue as yours , Ileana , " the Queen said to her daughter . Late this afternoon the Queen attended a. reception given by Rumanians at the Congress Hotel . There she saw still more of her countrymen in the garbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazily had dinner in private at their suite and later in the evening attended a ballet given by the Allied Arts Club at the Eighth Street Theatre . Tomorrow morning the royal party will go to Gary , Ind. , in a special train to visit the steel mills there , returning to see the University of Chicago and other interesting places . Colonel Carroll , who caused the expulsion from the royal train at Seattle of J. B. Ayres , the representative of the Ford Motor Company , managing the Lincoln car transportation of the Queen 's party , sent a telegram to the Ford Company tonight informing them that they could place . a representative on the train . Ayres was not mentioned , but it is understood Colonel Carroll would not object to him , even though he did resent statements attributed to- Ayres in the press . The motive for Colonel Carroll 's invitation is believed to be the fact that the automobile transportation provided for the party has not been as good as It was when Ayres was personally On the ground to supervise it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
