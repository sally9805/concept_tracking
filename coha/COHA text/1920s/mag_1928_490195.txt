THE sorrowing voice of the elec tric fan , the hot sounds that come through the window from the slow-moving town  --  these make the declining August a sultry time for the drones who have stayed home this summer . It 's hard for them to think of New York as anything but dull and uninspiring . But we are assured by a traveller returning from distant climes that the town is marvellous , full of exciting discoveries . Peaches and pears on the push-carts ( they were cherries when he left ) ; striped awnings on One Fifth Avenue ( they were bare windows in June ) ; window displays in the shops he knew so well  --  all changed ; even the designs of neckties different ; powdered sugar dissolving in tall glasses of tinkling ice-tea in summer gardens ; iced honeydew melons ; blackberry pie ; slim girls on every block , narrow-hipped and beautiful . He says it 's a marvellous town . EVERY one of us has certain intimations of the passing of time . Sunup and sun-down , magnificent signal fires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that . Our heart goes out especially to the girls who sit in the new telephone exchange known as Meridian 1212 , where they tell you the time for the price of a local call . It 's bad enough to face life as it is , but how would you like to sit all day saying : " This is Meridian 1212 , it is nine fifteen and a half ; this is Meridian 1212 , it is nine sixteen ; this is Meridian 1212 , it is nine sixteen and a half . . . " ? That 's just counting out fate on your fingers ! S Commander Byrd sails away with eight thousand dollars ' worth of dog biscuit stowed in the hold , he carries with him the blessings of the nation , plus a certain normal curiosity on the part of everybody as to what it 's all about . Columns and columns in the Times have left us in the dark . We know how parkas are made with fur on the outside , how senna grass is being taken along to line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried by turning them inside out but all this fails to give us anything but a general picture of Antarctic ennui . Still , there is one item in the published expense account which tends to shed light on what the explorers are going to be doing way down there at the Pole ; that is the item : Kardex and office supplies , $2,500 . Apparently they 'll be busy every minute with book-keeping and general office management . Every night some one is in for a big job of filing  --  we can see that . PARK AVENUE in summer is a strange thoroughfare . We decided to walk up the Avenue from Forty-sixth Street the other day to set ourself straight as to who is now in residence there . Our report on persons we saw is as follows : First block , no one at all . Second block , a woman with scarlet hair and black cotton stockings . Third block , a woman in the black velvet bodice and flowered skirt of a Swiss peasant . Fourth block , a stout smiling gentleman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back . At this point we began to become worried , and cast about to sec whether we were where we thought we were . Fortunately a cab rolled up at that moment , and there alighted a young man who could have been nobody in the world but a member of the Racquet Dub . NEWS from Panama is that Richard Halliburton , the hundred per cent romanticist , is swimming the Panama Canal . He swam into the Gatun Locks and the lock-keeper consented to shut the gate so he could be lifted about eighty feet and continue his swim ( and , later , his lectures ) . All this stirred only a modicum of interest and curiosity in us . The only thing we wondered about was whether the lockkeeper who opened the gates had ever read any travel books . Signpost AS the automobilist passes under the New York , Westchester &; Boston tracks near White Plains , on a much-travelled road , he may see a sign which once read " Rye and Port Chester " and which once pointed in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God or man 's intention , we know THE NEW YORKER Mr. Augustus Busch , of St. Louis , keeps an elephant named Tessie on the grounds of his summer place at Cooperstown , N. Y. , as a plaything for his grandchildren . Motherhood I you remember , we recently scooped the town by printing an announcement of the birth of three kittens to the cat on the first floor of the Union Club . The first public appearance of the mother cat , fallowing her confinement , was in a window of the club on Fifth Avenue , where she and the kittens were seen surrounded by enthusiastic members . At the time , we supposed that the Union Club men were merely interested in the general theme of motherhood , and that they were crowding the window only because they wished to indorse life 's tender pageant . But yesterday we received a letter from a Union Club man , saying that there was more to the scene than met the eye . It seems the Union Club has a troop of cats to each floor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce , repressed jealousy exists between the different groups . Some of the members are Second-Floor Cat men , some are First-Floor Cat men ? like that . Feeling sometimes mounts to fever intensity , and the rivalry extends to the cats themselves , who hate a ctively . Hence , the arrival of three new first-floor cats was no mean event , fraught as it was with the potential overthrow of the present balance of power . Our correspondent tells us that the members who were seen bending over the little newborn kittens in the window were not paying tribute to motherhood ? they were laying bets . The tiny creatures , their eyes not yet open , were the subject of long odds covering the complete annihilation of the second-floor cats within a specified period of time ( he would n't tell us how long ) . We are very proud of this story , because in this city it is very difficult ever to get interesting items about either Union Club members , or cats . Keeping a Secret WE suppose that a concern which ogees out s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off some which sound silly . At any rate , a friend whose phone number has been Butterfield 6520-J has received one . It seems that a letter added to one 's number sometimes signifies that it will shortly be changed . Thus recently the gentleman received this note from the company : " Your telephone number will be changed to Plaza 6751 on Saturday , August 25 , at eight-thirty o'clock , but please do not tell any one . " Beacons THE sweep of searchlights across the skies around here has become a bit confusing , but inquiry reveals there are only two big ones . One is on the St. George Hotel in Brooklyn , the other on the Beacon Hotel at Broadway and Seventy-third Street . Their strong rays drown out the mild gleam of the older light on the McAIpin , The Brooklyn hotel sets a lot of store by its beacon . It has been officially authorized by the Airways Division of the Department of Commerce and thus , from sunset to dawn , serves as a hobby for the hotel management and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to fliers in its six months of existence . One , for instance , picked it up just out of Boston and came right to a local field without having to fuss with compass and other instruments . This is an instance , they say , of the beam having been visible four miles above the earth . Under the most favorable conditions , it can paint its light on a cloud five miles from the ground . The light is of four hundred and eighty million candle-power , and if you want to know how strong that is , it is twenty-eight times as strong as any one of the beacons in the government 's sixty-eight major lighthouses . Not content , however , = '  - -  4 the hotel is about to put up a new light which will be five times stronger . It will be visible for five hundred miles to aviators at high altitudes . NVe did n't go into precise figures on the new light  --  too dizzying  --  hut it will he the largest in the world . Searchlights are not simple . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of whom must be on duty all night long , to keep the St. George light going . Carbons must be changed every hour , for one thing . This causes a pause of twenty-five seconds in the regular swing of the beam , which is at a rate of two revolutions a minute . The cost of the present light was thirty thousand dollars , and it takes twenty thousand dollars a year to run it . One of the motors used operates a cooling plant which forces cold air through the cylinders . Otherwise the heat would melt the whole contraption down to a couple of tons of steel and glass . The Hotel Beacon light on Broadway is of the same make and power ( both were manufactured by the Sperry Gyroscope Company ) but its throwing range is not so great because its ray is of a greater diameter . In the terminology of the searchlight people a beacon is said to " speak , " not to " shine . " Therefore , they tell you that the St. George light speaks ten times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Odd Job THE attendant at the parcel-post window of a midtown post office is fussy  --  unduly fussy , it has frequently seemed to us  --  about how packages are wrapped . Outside his cage we have encountered a sleeve-plucker who stands ready to produce twine , paper , and even cardboard from behind wastebaskets and radiators end to rewrap your package in such a manner that it will be acceptable to the clerk . This fellow has several times caused us to reflect on the strange ways of making a living engendered by the complexities of metropolitan lift . We have wondered if he is in cahoots with the clerk , but all we have been able to establish is that sympathetic cooperation exists between the two . We offered the fellow a quarter if he would have the clerk change a half dollar . He returned with five dimes , remarking that the United States was short on quarters at the moment . Thus he forced us to give him three dimes. outfitter MOST of the explorers know Captain Fiala and his store in Warren Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years or so . The Roosevelts , father and sons , bought guns and sleeping bags and hunting knives in his store for their adventurings . It was , in fact , the former President who encouraged Anthony Fiala to strike out for himself as an outfitter . Roosevelt met Fiala in 1913 when the latter was in charge of the outfitting department for Rogers Peet &; Co. , where Roosevelt bought his stuff for his trip into the River of Doubt country . The two men became friends and Captain Fiala accompanied the Colonel on that adventure . Afterwards he set up shop for himself and has been official outfitter to professors , scientists , aviators , and ordinary campers . Professor Hobbs , of the University of Michigan , confers with Fiala each year before going to Greenland , where he is making an extensive study of wind currents and their effects on New York weather . In addition to going into Brazil with Theodore Roosevelt , Captain Fiala has made two polar expeditions , which won him a place in Who 's Who and membership in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th Baldwin-ZiegIer trek toward the North Pole , and two years later he was commanding officer of an expedition that spent more than two years in the Arctic . He has published two books on the perils and findings of those expeditions and he is favorably known to Arctic explorers for his invention of a sleeping bag for sub-zero temperatures . Scandal PERUSING the questions and answers column of her favorite movie magazine , a serious-minded lady of Montclair , New Jersey , was horrified to note that the summer address of a prominent actress of the films , noted for her playing of romantic roles , was 1 , Rue des Italiens , Paris , the very same address her nephew had given her when he went abroad . This caused her great concern until a neighbor pointed out that the address is that of the Guaranty Trust Company 's Paris office . Hastening Ills ATE mentioned in our melancholy V 1 way not long ago that the Connecticut farms of the old Colonial soldiers have fallen into the hands of writers , illustrators , actors , and such . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has had the same destiny up there . It is called Lime Rock and is in the lower Berkshires . Once it was the home of hardy men who fought the British , later the site of a railroad car-wheel factory . The generation of brawny fellows that made the iron car-wheels , getting the iron out of nearby mines , decayed . " I want something-I can swim in , of course . " A later generation , in the first years of this century , bankrupted the business . Fewer young men grew up who liked to compete at rolling engine-wheels on a Saturday afternoon . Diabolo , burnt-wood sets , and , later , gin came in . The town became almost deserted . Ten years ago only a few score people lived where once had been several thousand . About a year ago an enterprising realtor bought the whole town site . He had the houses repainted , put on red cornices and orange shutters , hung blue blinds and swung ship lanterns over doorways , and attached cute weathervanes representing Scotties and Sealyhams . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocked there . Nnw the little hillside village , with its tradition of gruff old codgers , has become a nest of tearooms , gift shoppes , and Ye This-and-thats . An art exhibition is being held there now . Everyone has stationery engraved , with unconscious irony , " Lime Rock , the Deserted Village . " So Near and et- UITE by accident the label had Nie come off a bottle of near-beer which a soft-drink concessionaire at THE NEW YORKER Coney Island served to a patron one Saturday . The customer winked . " Real stuff , eh ? " he whispered . The concessionaire is quick-witted . " Yeah , " he said ; " cost you thirty-five cents . " " Worth it , " said the other and ordered a second bottle . The soft-drink man slipped the moist label off another bottle , under the counter , and handed it to the enthusiast . " Real stuff , " repeated the customer . He spread the word about . The stand did a big business all day and , we hear , still does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gloria Transit NOTHING is glamorous long . At Curtiss Field , of a Sunday afternoon , the chap next to us , in shirt sleeves , smoking a cigar , and wearing a funny Panama hat , turned out to be a pilot . Practically everybody at the field seemed eager to go up . Most of them are as used to planes as they are to buses . Even a year ago it was different . Then the crowds hung back , girls shivered , men stared as planes started across the field . Only brave and reckless blades came forward to buy the five-dollar tickets for a ride . We hear that not so long ago every one of the three hundred members of some sort of outing party took a flight . They got into the planes as they would get into a ferris wheel , probably even with less twittering and fewer witty goodbyes . Mothers and fathers now line the field 's edge waiting their turn to take the children for a ride . These flights -- the standard price is five dollars  --  have become about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard his pilot as a hero and would as lid tip him as tip a major-general , gratuities arc now the rule . It is not unusual for a passenger to hand a dime or quarter to the pilot after the trip , we observed . Sometimes the tips are much larger , particularly after extended flights . Mothers with children pester the aviators , just as they pester the merry-go-round man at a carnival , demanding the best seat for the youngsters , criticizing the price asked , and the way-the whole business is managed . Last Sunday a portly lady , after paying the two dollars asked as fare for her small son , complained bitterly when the boy became violently ill in the air . She ordered an immediate landing . She accused the pilot of wiggling the plane . After making a scene and demanding a refund which was not given , she left the field in high dudgeon . Flying has not taken on among negroes , but we saw one couple go up . First , however , the gentleman asked the pilot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera . He wished to be photographed with his girl , standing in front of a plane  --  the Coney Island touch . After a brief wait the pilot grew disgusted and flew off without the pair . They had to wait for the next trip . After all , an aviator has certain rights over and above the men who collect fares at a merry-go-round and swing little children up onto the zebras and the giraffes . Park Prank TWO gay youths , recently of Cornell , perpetrated an elaborate prank upon the Central Park police . At their direction a carpenter made a bench , a replica of those the city places in the parks . When the pair paid for it they demanded a bill of sale from the maker . One moonlight night they fared into the park , toting their new bench . A few minutes later a policeman saw two fellows , who at first had been sitting upon a bench , coolly arise and start off carrying it . Of course , the officer stopped them . Patiently they explained they had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paused to rest . The explanation falling flat , the youths were marched to the park police station . To an amazed sergeant they produced their bill of sale and grumbled over the inconsiderate interruption . Being set at liberty the fellows started off . Before long they were back again in the custody of another officer . Suspecting that this might go on all night , to the complete demoralization of the park police force , the sergeant met the situation with sagacity . He ordered the youths and their accursed bench out of the park by the shortest possible route and sent a patrolman with them to warn all his brethren that they were not to be again apprehended . Keeping Cool IN one of the Schrafft restaurants the other evening , a middle-aged lady attracted general attention . After being seated she postponed ordering until she had taken from her reticule a device which , when unfolded and set up , turned out to be a miniature electric fan with a storage-battery attachment . This she set to humming by the pressure of a button , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her meal and coolly ate it . She then folded up her fan and departed , having at no time paid any attention to fellow diners who looked on in wonder .
