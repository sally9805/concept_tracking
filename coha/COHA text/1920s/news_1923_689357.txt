txt It is a trick of the demagogue , to say nothing of the untrained reasoner anywhere , to beg his question by using a word in two different senses , or the same word for two different things , in the same argument . Senator Capper is a good example of the demagogue who has found that his political job is hurting his outside business . He is in the business of a newspaper publisher , selling papers to farmers , and he finds that his customers are tired of being told that they are ruined . Before making this discovery he played up the " agricultural bloc " in Congress for all it was worth . He might almost be called the father of it . k is difficult to guess whether Mr. Capper wants to prove that a bloc no longer exists or only that it is harmless . But he makes one statement , made before by Brookhart and others , which is flatly not so . He says , in his speech at Topsfield , if the Boston Globe quotes him Correctly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . Others have been there for many years . " There is a Manufacturers ' Bloc which has been ' well organized in and out of Congress . It has great influence . I do n't say it ever attempted anything wrong . The Railroad Bloc has paid high salaries , and has lavish quarters . Then there is the Wall Street Bloc . I do n't say this in a spirit of criticism or antagonism . " Capper must know the difference between a bloc and a lobby , but he thinks his hearers do n't . Both in name and fact " bloc " is of French origin and represents a combination in a legislature of members agreed on one point , prepared to sink their differences on other points in order to carry the point of agreement . The transaction is perfectly open , and the agricultural bloc in Congress is , or was , made up of Democrats and Republicans . But this is the only bloc Congress has ever seen . Tariffs are a matter of dicker . There is no member of Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ought to admit , that he is part of a Wall Street bloc . It is needless to say here that there is no Wall Street lobby in Washington , because the financial centre of the country is interested in a thousand things represented by a thousand different minds . It is interested in the welfare of the farmer , to an extent which Mr. Capper is too ignorant to understand . There is no railroad bloc in Conpress , as Mr. Capper has from time to time asserted . There is just one bloc  --  the agricultural bloc  --  and its single triumph is also Mr. Capper 's . It has destroyed , by the futures law , the farmer 's free market for grain . No wonder Mr. Capper is beginning to cool off about blocs . In his first experiment in leadership he has red his follow ; ers into the quagmire . His efforts to struggle out reveal exactly the qualities which caused that fiasco . To put it shortly , the agricultural bloc in Congress s the first experiment of the kind . Capper has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Britons taxed $5 per capita against 10 real cents for the Germans arc naturally skeptical about hard luck tories .
