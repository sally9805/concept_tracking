txt // Mendelian law ; nor does the tiger lily seem stereotyped because we know under what genus and species it may be catalogued . The classification of children into types is an essential part of the scientific approach to education . The method of science is thus described by Bernard Hart : " It consists in : ( I ) The observation and recording of the phenomena ; ( 2 ) The classification of the recorded phenomena into groups or series ; ( 3 ) The discovery of a formula which will enable us to resume these series in the most comprehensive and convenient manner . The formula may be altogether conceptual in character . The only test which it is required to satisfy is the test of utility , it must explain the facts which we actually find and it must enable us to predict the occurrence of future facts . " 1 If this is the method of science which is applied to other departments of life , it must also be the one which education must adopt instead of the blind trial-and-error method with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extent , the popular " hunch " is right : no two individuals are alike ; a child may be one type intellectually , another type emotionally , another physically , and so on throughout the series , discovered and undiscovered . The crossing of types and the interplay of tendencies make for infinite variety of personality . The more one knows about the types of human beings , the more one knows about a child . The more one knows about children , the more one realizes that the number of types in regard to any one trait is finite . While placing an individual child in a type does not solve his problem , it is one of the greatest aids in thinking about him clearly . It helps the teacher to call upon those resources which have a particular reference to him . If she realizes that he is of the same type as another child on whom she has spent ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL i i i much time and trouble in the past , she goes to work more constructively . If her earlier experiment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically in dealing with another boy whom she knows to be of the same type . She will rather undertake some new plan and in a more hopeful spirit . All this means new possibilities of initiative for the teacher as well as a better outlook for the pupil . It is for lack of such a positive and constructive attitude toward the human material in their hands that many teachers fail to find a personal stimulus in their profession . A better understanding of the mental problems involved would do much to relieve teaching of its drudgery and revivify the atmosphere of the classroom . CHAPTER VI THE COURSE OF STUDY Before we go further in our description of different types of children and the reason why they are misfits in the school , we want to make clear that we hold no brief for the curriculum as it is , even for the normal child . The following chapters will deal with the adaptations that a flexible curriculum should make in response to the needs of children who deviate from the average in one direction or another . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the middle 75 per cent of the curve of distribution , whose individual differences lie within the normal range of variation . Let us assume , for present purposes , a group of pupils who are not mentally defective , exceptionally bright , dull , neurotic , or physically handicapped . Against these average children , we wish to measure the public school curriculum , which was supposedly made to serve the needs of this so-called normal group . We can not criticize the present method of administering the course of study in standardized doses without taking into consideration the force of the demand made upon public schools for uniformity . About one-seventh of the elementary school population of New York City changes from one school to another in the course of each school year . This means that nearly 100,000 pupils move from a grade in one school to the same grade in another school overnight , and are expected to find a niche in the new classroom similar enough to the one they have left not to feel the jolt . We are not able to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the year actually lose their promotions . 112 // It is our impression , however , that this number is not small . The child who enters the class during the term runs a special risk of being left back . The teacher who gives as excuse for a child 's non-promotion that he has come so recently from another school that he has not yet caught up with the class , is listened to without question . No supervisory staff is deaf to the flattery of the implication that the standards of other schools are not so high as those of its own . If the assumption is true that many of the transferred children risk their promotions anyway , why make such a fetish of uniformity to prevent something which it can scarcely be said to prevent ? Any proposition to experiment with the curriculum never fails to encounter this objection . Must we then everlastingly sacrifice the 85 per cent of the children who stay put for the hypothetical benefit of the 15 per cent who move ? Probably the inflexibility of the goose-step curriculum is itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is totally lost if he is one beat out of step . His chances to right himself would be better under a more elastic interpretation of the requirements . Possibly the substitution of pedagogical tests , with age rather than grade norms , will be one means of lessening the hardships of the minority of children who change schools during the year . Since we are speaking of normal children , the whole question seems more or less academic anyway . The school could well afford to put more trust in the normality of the normal child , who is well able , with a little leeway , to get off and get on again educationally in the same way that a healthy infant can fall down and get up again . Another bogey that confronts the advocates of a more flexible course of study is the universal goal of getting every child ready for high school at a stated time . At present all children enter school at the age of six with the general expectation I14 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD that they will enter high school at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every effort is blindly bent toward its accomplishment , and little consideration is given to what is happening to the child along the way . If the attainment of this goal were possible for 100 per cent of the school population , it would still be doubtful whether the destruction it entails would be justifiable . As a matter of fact , however , the school statisticians furnish figures to show that only 13 per cent of the six-year-old aspirants enter high school at fourteen ; and less than 20 per cent enter high school at any age . Here again we are submitting 8o per cent of the elementary school children to a rigid lock-step procedure on a theory which absolutely flies in the face of the facts . It would seem as if the very tenacity with which the goal is pursued helps to defeat its attainment . Perhaps , if we were more interested from the beginning in making the school fit the child and permitting him to enjoy life within its walls , there would be more children desirous of continuing their education beyond the elementary grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who now go to high school coincided with the number of individuals along the curve of distribution who were endowed with the type of intelligence which could successfully meet the present standardized requirements for high school entrance , the case would be no better . Does it not seem odd that the people of limited intelligence should be discouraged from prolonging their period of training by such a narrow view of education ? Would it not be more logical to extend , especially for those who adjust to life with difficulty , the protection which a higher school should ideally provide for the years of adolescence ? The elementary school and the secondary school are at present cooperating all too well in terminating the education of 8o per cent of the school children at the earliest legal moment . With a different con // ception of what education is about , it would be possible to establish the same degree of cooperation in the direction of permitting every child to pursue his education profitably and happily from his sixth to his eighteenth year . If this attitude of anxiety concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of growth , much-needed experimentation with the curriculum would then be encouraged . We all know the folly of pulling up a bean to see how it is growing , but we have not yet learned to trust the human plant to flower without a periodic panic about its rate of progress . Under our present educational system , every pupil is conscientiously yanked up by the roots at least twice a year . With this official inspection always impending , neither teacher nor pupil breathes an atmosphere of freedom , which is the first condition of unself-conscious growth . It is too much to ask the school authorities and parents to grant complete exemption from this time-honored custom ; but enough uneasiness concerning the old methods exists to justify the demand for longer periods between successive days of reckoning . Furthermore , psychological tests have produced surprising results in showing that normal children of the same age arrive at very much the same place by widely varying educational paths . There is reassurance in this for those of little faith who fear that any departure from the conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AN EXPERIMENT WITH A NORMAL GROUP The only experiment 1 with the curriculum for normal children in our school was undertaken with the understanding // that no rigid academic standards were to be enforced until the fourth year . A group of thirty-five boys was selected with IQ 's from zoo to 115 . The classroom was equipped with movable furniture , benches , tools , and a piano . A specially trained teacher was provided in addition to the regular one until it was possible for one of the regular staff to train herself to take full charge . The group has remained practically unchanged throughout the experiment . The class was assembled at the beginning of the iB grade , that is , after they had been in school one term ; and it has now reached the beginning of the fifth year . The story of what was done with this class had best begin with what was not done . We did not enforce the taboos , restraints , and prohibitions of the ordinary classroom . The interests of the children were largely allowed to initiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One group of ten underweight children undertook the study of nutrition , which entailed buying , cooking , and eating their own lunches in the kitchen of Christodora House . Another group became interested in the study of transportation in the streets and from the docks near by . A third group was chiefly interested in drawing and color work and clay modeling . The whole class was enthusiastic about the dancing , singing , story-telling , and excursions into all parts of the city . They became interested , one year especially , in studying the lives and habits of animals , both in the animal room of the school and in the zoo . One of their favorite activities from the first was in dramatics and impersonations . They loved to improvise plays and costumes , and fell into it as readily as many children play tag . They learned to know and use each other 's talents , and cooperated in many enterprises that kept them together outside of school hours . The group spirit was strong and the many learned from the // few . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class went to ? Wanamaker 's store to see the Christmas toys , he strayed by accident into the art gallery . The next day he was truant , and on the next he was discovered with paper and colors copying the " Holy Family . " Instead of being rebuked , he was allowed to take part of the class with him , each to copy a favorite picture . From this experience , they got the idea of painting the fish in the aquarium and the animals in the park . They sketched boats from the dock , trees from the window , and made portraits of each other . Thus they grew away from the neighborhood conception of art as literal copying and photographic imitation . Although the formal work had always been given a secondary place and had been allowed throughout to function as means to an end , at the end of the fourth year it was found that the class had suffered no academic loss . On the contrary , a series of pedagogical tests showed them to rank above their grade as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no individual laggards . At the beginning of the fifth grade when the experiment was regarded as ended , they fitted into the formal organization of the school without any academic dislocation . Incidentally , they had done seven terms ' work in six . The testimony of the teachers was that they were more stable , and socially better adjusted than the average fifth grade child . They had read more widely , spoke more fluently and correctly , and asked more intelligent questions . They were outspoken , inquisitive , and fluent letter writers . Their superiority was visible to the naked eye and visitors always mistook them for a Terman group . WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRICULUM In watching the progress of this experiment from week to week , we have come to see more clearly what is wrong with // the regular curriculum from the point of view of the normal child . In the first place , it is too much concerned with giving information and too little concerned with affording opportunity for experience . In the second place , it deals too little with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and symbols . In the third place , it disregards the capacities of the child by forcing subjects down his throat before he is mature enough to digest them . In short , the stereotyped course of study has been built up to follow a logical sequence from the point of view of the adult mind rather than to follow the development of spontaneous interests in the child . Education should not consist of acquiring information but of acquiring experience . A youngster may grow up in an environment rich with educational possibilities and yet be entirely shut off by the attitude of the people around him . Just as the child in the home of an ignorant farmer may grow up without any acquaintance whatever with the plant and animal life about him , so the city child is apt to know nothing of the industrial processes and the other occupational features of his own environment . As soon as the child enters the school , it begins to separate him from reality . Many a six-year-old does not know the names of the garments he wears and the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelling words and rows of figures without regard to whether this mental food is analogous to milk or pickles . The modern science of nutrition has far outrun the science of education . It emphasizes not only the quantity of food but its quality and kind . Furthermore , the unscientific pabulum of the school is administered on an unscientific schedule . Why do we have to hurry things along so fast ? If adding is hard at seven years , why not leave it till nine ? If reading is hard at six , why not teach it at eight or nine ? There is enough educaTHE // tional experience that is wholesome for six- or seven-year-old children , without overdrawing their account with life in advance . It is like paying a high price for strawberries in February when you can have them abundantly in June at moderate cost . This hot-house forcing is characteristic not only of one subject in the curriculum but practically of all of them . SHALL READING BE LEARNED AT SIX It is almost impossible for a normal child not to learn to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who value them . On the other hand , it is often torture for an imaginative child of six or seven years of age to sit through period after period of " was " and " he " and " go " and other abstract symbols . The irksome drill of the reading class is not really for the good of the child , but serves chiefly to allay the fears of parents who are in a panic lest their children may turn out at ten to be illiterate . They seem to need reassurance all along the line by a series of universal signals that their children are as well equipped as other children are . If Willie can read as well as Johnnie , then Willie 's mother can look Johnnie 's mother in the face without shame ; and it is the exceptional father who does not love to take his nineyear-old daughter 's letter from his pocket and exhibit it to his business friends . For such reasons , the child is subjected for several hours every week to stories of Johnnie Jack Rabbit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and misadventures of Gruby-Gruntum and Toby-Trottum , until , if he has any mind at all , he learns to close it when the reading book is opened . Is not literature a broader foundation for culture than this parrot-like drill , made necessary by trying to teach the child to read two or three years before it is easy for him ? Ito PITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD Almost no child is too young to begin the study of literature . Mother Goose rhymes , folk tales , stories of everyday life begin to interest a child during his second year , and from then on he will take all that he can get . Because he is not taught reading at an early age is no reason to skimp his fund of imaginative material . In a public school no reliance can be placed on what the child gets at home ; the classroom must undertake to provide content and culture for him . The young child 's mind is avid and curious and responds to the appeal of literature before it develops to a point where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child has for the ideas that come out of a book , the less resistance he will have to acquiring the symbols which represent them . The relation of the middle and upper grade pupil to the printed page exhibits the failure of the formal reading lesson as an educational method . Although he has presumably mastered the technique of reading by this time , he is helpless in the face of a printed paragraph . If he is put to a test based on his comprehension of something he has read , he is likely to grow paralyzed or panicky at once . Place in the hands of any sixth grade boy or girl a can of soup on which are printed the instructions for serving , and observe how far he can carry them out without appealing to some adult with questions which are answered in the print on the can . The same child will read you off the sentences aloud with absolute correctness and complete self-satisfaction . His self-confidence begins to fail him just at the point where he is asked to evince his comprehension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conventional reading course often leads children into a kind of glibness which actually prevents them from gaining any real rapport with the printed page . For this reason good oral readers sometimes fail in a silent reading test . // DRAMATICS IN THE SCHOOL If young children are genuinely thrilled by word-pictures and stories , their first impulse is to act them out . A large part of a little child 's imagination is in his muscles and senses : his concept of a toad is a hop ; his concept of a dog is a wag ; his concept of a pig is a grunt . As he grows older he elaborates these simple imitations into more complex acting . One of the advantages of story-telling in the classroom instead of at home is that the children form a group which can cooperate in playing out all the characters of the story . Impromptu dramatizations of stories read and original plays , all done spontaneously and not rehearsed , are educational experiences . If the idea of adult audiences is entirely eliminated , then originality and spontaneity , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsals . The emphasis here as in anything the child does should be placed on what happens to him in the act of creating , not the quality of the finished product from the grown-up point of view . The worst enemy of true education the fetish of perfection . TEACHING THE SCHOOL CHILD TO TALK In its feverish haste to teach the child to read , the school forgets entirely to teach the child to talk . The taboo on talking in the classroom is carried to such an extent that even when the children are turned loose on the playground , they communicate with each other almost entirely by nudges , shouts , and monosyllables . With the single exception of the kindergarten , no provision is made in the public school curriculum for children to introduce topics of interest to themselves and discuss them with their classmates . Is it not within the province of the school to teach children to converse with each other intelligently instead of placing a premium on furtive whispering , which is at present their only // outlet for a normal desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop fluency on topics which are stimulating and thrilling to them , then perhaps the " Oral English " periods of the older children would not be so lacking in ordinary coherent and vivid presentations . The pitiful struggle of a seventh grade teacher to make a boy use a subject and a predicate in the same sentence is but the natural consequence of the monosyllabic and savage communication not only tolerated but encouraged by the methods of the lower grades . Little children are not supposed to have anything to say . They are therefore expected to sit still and have information poured into them until about the age of twelve . At this point , the process is reversed and the school suddenly begins ? to demand of them that they shall show evidence of the accumulated erudition they have passively received . Unfortunately , the human mind does not work in this way , and the result is usually a disappointment to those who have devised the scheme . Perhaps if the children were allowed to discuss the things they were interested in and to assimilate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a fund of information about life that would make them able to respond , at least more intelligently than they do now , to almost any question a seventh grade teacher could ask . LEARNING TO WRITE BY ORDEAL Nothing so violates the knowledge we have concerning the physiological development of the child as the early insistence on learning to write . The child struggles and strives and spends enormous energy in trying to make good handwriting at an age when he ought not to be writing at all . The school considers that the push-pull refrain that enlivens the writing period in most classrooms is a great concession to the use of // the large muscles . Even if the method does away with the use of the small finger movements , which is doubtful , it demands a close coordination between hand and eye which ought not to be exacted . Probably no child under eight should be expected to form letters less than three or four inches high , and even then no high standard of perfection should be imposed . The amount of nervous strain which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ready is more than a growing organism should be subjected to . It is one of the most egregious of all our inherited educational errors . THE VENERABLE ABSTRACTIONS OF ARITHMETIC Dare we question the most sacred of all the three R 's , arithmetic ? Entrenched behind centuries of tradition the teaching of arithmetic has grown into a pedagogical bad habit almost impossible to break . Why do we have to teach children to count to 20 in TA and to Too in TB ? Largely for the same reason that a master teaches his dog to sit up and beg ? because he has heard it can be done and wants to try it and see . Would it not be worth while to see if there is not something of equal or greater value from the child 's point of view than the trick of counting Too or writing it on a blackboard ? If a child of six is interested in Too at all , which is doubtful , would he not be more interested in seeing Too buttons on a table , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seeing Too children when three classes are assembled ? He would eventually become interested in stepping Too steps , bouncing his ball Too times , and so on indefinitely with his hundreds and fifties and twenty-fives and fives until numbers really had some meaning . Perhaps as he approached eight years or so , it does not matter exactly when , he might be glad to write the symbol Too , to score a game or to satisfy some other end of his own . 1 24 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD With no real concept of the " feel " or use of numbers , the only motive that can enliven a class in arithmetic is the rather hollow and too self-conscious rivalry that is artificially stimulated by the teacher . Concrete materials should be provided in abundance . Every kind of actual and practical device for weighing , measuring , and realizing quantity and number should be familiar to children before they begin to write symbols on paper . Because bright children learn abstractions more quickly and easily than slow ones is no reason why they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly to the stage of desiring the convenience of using symbols , they will use them more comprehendingly and originally if the symbol has content for them . With an introduction to arithmetic composed of experiences connected with quantity and number , much time now spent in so-called " number-drill " might be more profitably employed . In fact , if the use of concrete materials were introduced into other occupations of the day instead of being isolated into a single separate period , it would establish . a healthy union between mental and manual work now absent from the curriculum . Guessing heights , weights , lengths , and distances , and checking up by means of accurate measures may be made a part of any occupation from the playground to the cooking class . SCIENCE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN What is there behind the idea that science and mechanical interests belong to the high school years and abstract numerical work to childhood ? The inside of a lock , the turning of a sprocket-wheel , the action of a piston are all within the grasp of a seven-year-old child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things , but from observing how they work he can get a primitive conception of // cause and effect . The child understands a see-saw . A simple latch works like a see-saw ; you push down one side and the other goes up . A more complicated lever but working just the same way is mysteriously concealed between the door knobs of any classroom . But who ever thinks of telling these things to young children ? Simple mechanical and scientific facts are really better tools for the child to reason with than the multiplication table . Science deals with concrete things appropriate to young children ; it gives information of a type that interests them . Yet the subject is usually reserved until adolescence has awakened a desire for more idealistic and romantic interests . THE BOOKISHNESS OF GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY The teaching of geography and history is blighted by a bookishness that often shuts the child out from the world he lives in , instead of opening it up to him . He learns the points of the compass from a conventional map before he learns them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north always remains strange to him because his desk was screwed to the floor in such a way that the lines of longitude ran east and west . He is crowded by symbols even when the facts of nature are within his reach . Still less does the school attempt to make up for the facts of nature beyond his reach . The city child knows nothing of the railroad , the movements of the tides , the formation of hill land and swamp land . The curriculum should provide excursions to the country as well as to other parts of the city . Every school should own a bus large enough to carry a whole class . The children could then be taken into the country for nature study , for gardening , for out-of-door cooking . These excursions are now sometimes made once or twice a year as rewards for good behavior , the teacher bearing the expense . // They should be a regular part of school work and the means of transportation should be provided by the school . The educational value would surely justify the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own environment , which can be used to open up all the avenues of the world and all the chapters of its history . The street experiences of the neighborhood are rich in suggestions . The children come in contact with the dress , manners , and language of many foreign countries . They have an unusually early acquaintance with the uses of money . A timber-yard , a fish market , a cap-maker 's shop are familiar sights ; yet few children can tell you anything about them . Why should they not be as much interested in these everyday affairs as in the headhunters of Australia or the worship of Buddha in India ? As a matter of fact they are ; but in entirely different ways . One represents reality , the other phantasy ; the well-educated child would be stimulated towards an interest in both . WHAT THE VOTING CHILD SHOULD LEARN Young children should learn to use their bodies and muscles ; to be gentle , polite , and curious . They should learn to ask questions and be interested in the answers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if there is need of learning languages , the period under ten years is the time when this is most readily done . Music may be learned almost unconsciously by little children . Why are not rhythm of motion and sound , dancing and singing and beating a drum more appropriate to seven years than the stereotyped abstractions of academic lessons ? Many children acquire a permanent dislike for literature , music , or mathematics through the shortsighted policy of the school which forces these subjects upon them while they are still unprepared for them . The difficulty of the conceptual // material or the adult point of view leads the child to dislike the subject all the rest of his life . From simple dislike it is a short step to the feeling that one has no aptitude . We are constantly meeting adults who say that they have no appreciation for music or that they always hated mathematics . Such attitudes are often traceable to wrong methods of teaching and to associations formed in childhood and now grown to such proportion that they form a real adult disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociability . The faults of an educational system based on the three R 's are so manifest that intelligent parents sometimes raise the question , why send the child to school anyway ? Can not the well-educated parent , though an amateur , do better by his child than the professional teacher ? But the school is not merely a place where lessons are learned and recited ; it is preeminently the place where the young individual learns to make social adjustments to other individuals of his own generation . Since the family has grown smaller , the social contacts of the schoolroom have become more important than ever . The school provides this opportunity and is in this respect unique . There is no substitute . It is possible to educate a child ideally from the intellectual point of view , and yet to educate him in such a way that he is wholly set apart from his fellows . The parents of gifted children especially have this danger to consider . While genius has existed in isolation and has made historic contributions to civilization , there are few parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A person 's adjustment to other people depends to a large extent on sharing with them a common mental background . Even the public school curriculum , with all its faults , has at least this social value . It supplements the more specific social value of the human contacts made in school . r 28 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD THE CLASSROOM As the child needs other children around him , he also needs concrete materials to handle . The emptiness and colorlessness of the typical classroom from the child 's point of view represents extreme poverty of experience . The ideal classroom will have plenty of wall space and small blackboards . A screen or a bulletin board for the class to use for posting is necessary . A property box , no matter how simply stocked , is essential . A glass case or cabinet for collections forms the foundation for the class museum . A piano and at least one work bench and a box of tools , regardless of the shop , should form a part of the regular schoolroom equipment . A closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , etc . If possible each child should have a locker in which to store unfinished pieces of work . Rooms for younger children should have a rug for each child and one large rug , so that the children may sit on the floor for stories and reading . Furniture that can be moved and chairs to fit the tables and also to fit the children are desirable for the sake of free atmosphere as well as for physiological reasons . HOW LARGE SHOULD CLASSES BE Equipment of this kind presupposes classes of not more than 25 children . Good education , like everything else , can not be cheaply obtained . Classes of 40 and 5o children can never be made really educational by means of any thinkable reform . Even homogeneity of intelligence does not justify these unwieldy groups , for , as we have said over and over , the child does not come to school merely to be efficiently instructed . Since the day of Jean Baptiste de la Salle , who founded the Order of the Christian Brothers and invented group teaching , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Herbartian movement of the nineTHE // teenth century tended to center all educational endeavor in the problem of standardized instruction and the adoption of stereotyped forms . Under the influence of these pedagogical traditions and the stress of congested city populations , the schools have , with but slight apology , permitted 40 and 50 children to be assigned to one teacher . Public education has come to be a highly specialized technique for mass teaching . This is so true that most teachers , when placed in charge of groups of 20 to 25 pupils , use the very same methods of teaching and class management that they used in teaching classes with registers of 45 and 50 . This is probably the reason why Rice , in his investigations some twenty years ago , found that the results of instruction bore no relation to the size of the class taught . So far has this process now been carried , and so intrenched has it become by the methods in normal colleges and training schools , that teaching the individual child has become one of the lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rediscovery of the individual child by the individual teacher . In the foregoing chapters we have described certain scientific aids to this discovery . But until we have smaller classes , no educational reform of any character will avail very much . Classes should be not more than half their present size and no system of classification will ever make a larger class unit into a really teachable group of children . THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL In regard to matters of discipline and conduct , the school has adopted formal standards similar to its scholastic requirements . This leads to mere negativism and repression , since the more positive virtues of human character are difficult to standardize . No martinet can help children to be really // " good , " for conduct which deserves this name is never the same as routinized behavior . To anyone who is sensitive to such things , it is possible to detect almost immediately upon entering a building the temper of its leading spirit . We tried in our school to be rid of that oppressive something which strikes you with an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over-regimented school . Children should not burst forth at noon like the cork out of a bottle ; some of the freedom of the playground should come in with them and some of the dignity of the schoolhouse should go out with them . THE EMOTIONAL EDUCATION OF THE CHILD The school should above all things be a place for children to get the habit of being happy . Has anyone ever yet read the record of a crime which was committed by a contented and happy person ? We have been forced to the conclusion that many of the so-called problem cases of every school would be no longer problems if we realized the effect of our school curriculum upon the pupils . The children often develop antagonisms to teacher , subject , and school because they are bored . How many healthy , normal , grown-up people would patiently stand the daily grind of a so-called education which they did not understand or which did not give some play to their natural and instinctive desire for selfexpression ? It is true that Rousseau stressed the value of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , that Herbart spoke of character as the desideratum of education , and that Froebel was dominated by the idea of free development ; yet while we speak and think in terms of these great reformers , the schools in practice have never yet succeeded in catching up with the spirit of these leaders . // One of our high schools has taken for its motto , " more happiness in education . " It is not enough , however , that such well-intentioned slogans should be adopted by the school . They may prove as sterile of results as the inspired teachings of our educational geniuses . This is sure to be the case , as long as they remain , from the teacher 's point of view , in the domain of pure theory and sentiment . The school has this to gain from an alliance with mental hygiene : that happiness in education need not remain merely a pious hope but may be translated into a technique of living . The educator can no longer evade his responsibility for the emotional development of the child on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginnings of such a science and technique are in existence and are widely applied in the cases of people with pathological tendencies . The improvement as well as the utilization of this technique rests largely with the schools where the emotional education of the normal child is more neglected than that of his erratic brother . The school has assumed that the emotional development of the normal child could be taken for granted , but that his intellectual development should be subjected to ceaseless prodding and surveillance . What education chiefly needs is that we shall take more for granted in regard to the child 's intellectual development , and take more thought about teaching him the art of happy and productive living . CHAPTER VII THE UNGRADED CLASSES The first and most popular use of psychological tests was in the scientific detection of feeble-mindedness . The implications of this use are numerous and far-reaching . The imagination of the biologist , the sociologist , the criminologist has seized upon it as a method of negative control ; the biologist sees it as a means of eugenic selection ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sociologist , among other things as a new way of controlling immigration . In one fashion or another the intelligence test has been chiefly viewed as a scientific method of improving the race and society by the elimination of the unfit . " Let us have the fingerprints ( of every person in the nation ) , " writes a biologist , " but before everything else let us have a mental classification of all children of school age . When once this has been clone perhaps the least intelligent group can ultimately be denied the suffrage as are imbeciles , insane , and criminals at present . " 1 These negative functions may be logical deductions from the social and evolutionary point of view , but for the educator they are not relevant . It is the factor of individual educability that interests the teacher . For him the only legitimate point of view is to educate the child for himself , which is ultimately for society . The first consideration with every child is this : what kind of school experience is going to contribute most to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too apt to form the habit of thinking of all mental defectives as imbeciles or idiots . Before the introduction of psychological tests , the diagnosis of defectives was largely dependent on physical stigmata , such as a misshapen head , lagging gait , drooling at the mouth , or a foolish grin . Only the lowest grades of feeble-mindedness can be thus distinguished . Such children exist in limited numbers in every community and should receive the same consideration which is given to physical cripples . They should not be barred out of school but should be given a nurse 's care , if necessary , as it is given to cripples and cardiac cases . Unless their parents are able and willing to place them in institutions , the school should provide for them . When properly taken care of , they are not a menace to other children , and the public school offers their only opportunity for training and education . All children above the grade of idiot are to some degree educable ; should they not therefore have the right to some kind of schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in institutions . If parents do not voluntarily prefer custodial care for them , there is no place other than the school where they may receive the limited amount of training which they are able to profit by . THE UNGRADED CHILD In the ungraded department of our school there were scarcely half-a-dozen children who could be recognized as mentally deficient by their appearance . The few low-grade children who came to us were exchanged with other schools for highgrade problem cases . Our group of 150 ungraded children did not include any low-grade imbeciles ; the IQ 's ranged from 41 to 75 , the mental ages from 4 to I I years ( see Tables XVIII and XIX ) , with the greater proportion in the upper ranges . These children represent a more important educational task 1 // than the low-grade group , both because they form a larger group within the population , and because they must be fitted to take some part in the work of the world , while the lowgrade children eventually find their way into institutions or come under some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more obvious types of mental defectives . As the knowledge of types increased , the department was gradually extended to meet the needs of high-grade defectives also . The originator // of the ungraded department , Miss Elizabeth Farrell , discovered about twenty years ago that there were children in the school who could never meet its inflexible standards and rigid demands , and that the school itself must bend if these children were to be educated . The spirit in which the department was conceived was that of trying to make it up to such deprived children for what had been omitted from their native endowment . The department was not created primarily as a method of segregation nor as a means of getting rid of an inferior group of individuals . It was planned from the beginning as a place where the mentally defective child could receive the kind of training that he needed . For his sake , the most unquestioned school conventions were set aside and an entirely new type of education was invented . This educational aim has been consistently pursued . Throughout its history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it existed for the child as a sufficiently important end in himself . The discovery of this type of child-mind , retarded and yet educable , and the invention of a special kind of education for its needs , is a notable chapter in the history of the science of education . It is one of the anomalies of the public school system that the best education is given to the children who are intellectually the least endowed . This is one of the few departments of public education into which imagination has gone in the last hundred years . The truly creative pedagogy of this era has been concentrated on making a curriculum for children of limited intelligence . THE UNGRADED DEPARTMENT Freed from the pressure of the conventional public school demands , the ungraded department has been able to duplicate in many respects the conditions of the best and most enlightened private schools in the country . The classes are // small , between fifteen and twenty children forming the register . The ungraded rooms have no fixed furniture ? the prison furniture of our public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the registers are cut in half , as is already clone in the ungraded department , it becomes practical to humanize the atmosphere of the schoolroom . Not a desk nor a table nor a seat is screwed to the floor throughout the ungraded department . Each child has individual treatment ; he is not fubbed off with one-fortieth or one-fiftieth of the teacher 's attention . Not only in size and equipment do these classes set a high standard , but everything has been done to make the ungraded teacher the best representative of her profession . With the adoption of a special curriculum , it was soon found that specially trained teachers were necessary . Not only preparatory training but continued training has been the requirement for this work . Along with the courses in classroom technique , the teachers are required to study psychology and social science as related to their special problems . An increased salary schedule has made it possible for the department to keep up these standards . All this has served to bring about a professional attitude toward their work which is characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are assigned to the classes by the clinical staff of the department . Clinics are held at headquarters and also in different schools . The child is given a physical . psychological , pedagogical , and sociological examination before being placed in the special class . When the ungraded department was first originated , the available methods of examination and diagnosis were more or less crude and tentative , so that only the most indubitable types could be distinguished . But the department itself has done a great deal towards the development of clinical methods which increase the accuracy of diagTHE // nosis and make it possible to distinguish the higher types . The arrangement whereby a central responsible staff was put in charge of assignments to the ungraded classes has prevented them from becoming the dumping ground of all sorts of problem cases and has preserved them for their original purpose . The most radical innovation of the department is found in the curriculum . The fundamental novelty is that it takes account of the child 's capacity and experience instead of merely carrying on the accumulated traditions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own course of study , which has been developed by a process of actual experimentation . One of the characteristics of the subnormal child is that his sense-organs are under-developed as well as his intellectual grasp . Just as in the normal child an ear for music may be cultivated , so in the subnormal child the five senses are amenable to training . Periodic tests throughout the year have shown that the keenness of his senses increases under cultivation . Not that it is n't equally true that any normal child would do better to learn to hear , taste , and smell , than to read at the age of six ; only the schools have not yet discovered this . Another characteristic of the subnormal child is his helplessness . By working with concrete materials and producing tangible evidence of control over his environment , he vindicates his existence . The child who takes home a yellow box of his own making is able for the first time to put himself across with his family . Incredible as it may seem , many of these children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in the classroom . A feeling of budding power over his environment in an individual is perhaps the most educational experience he can have . This comes to the normal child seldom enough but to the subnormal child scarcely at all unless it is especially developed in him . He // becomes accustomed early in life to being pushed aside from almost every undertaking by someone who can do it better , until his originally feeble stock of initiative is entirely sapped . It is an important job , but not always an easy one , to nurse it back to life . Without such fundamental experiences as these , there is no such thing as growth . It seems unfortunate that such an intelligent way of constructing a course of study should benefit so small a group of children . There is no type of child who would not profit by some modification of this humanized curriculum . Parents of normal children might well covet for them the superior advantages of the ungraded course . It is at least a hopeful sign that such a department exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence far beyond its own boundaries - for the better education of all children . // The ungraded department of Public School 641 started with two classes in 1913 . They were made up of high-grade , middle-grade , and institutional cases . The pupils were selected in the regular way , the teachers reporting troublesome boys or boys who could not keep up with the class work . The good boy who merely sat quiet often escaped the notice of the teacher and was not singled out for the ungraded class , while the boy who could not control himself in this way but had to do something to attract the attention of his fellows , was recommended . There was always a long waiting list because of the large school population and the limited equipment and room space . A new admission took place , not when a boy was found who should be in an ungraded class , but when an // ungraded pupil became sixteen and left school or when one moved out of the district . The two original classes occupied one room , the instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute teacher who acted as a helper . The thirty-two pupils ranged from institutional cases to children who were but three years backward , and ranged in chronological age from eight to sixteen years . The work resembled a three-ring circus , with " Fat " using the cloak closet as a street car , with his constant " Whoa , " " Fare , " and " Ding-a-ling " ; with Pasquale demonstrating the method of procedure in taking an apple from a push cart ; and with Stanislaus constantly cutting the other children 's hair when he could snatch a pair of scissors from a child who was doing paper cutting for busy work . The teacher , in the meantime , might be trying to teach an arithmetic or reading lesson in front of the room to the accompaniment of the hammers and saws of boys who were finishing their shop work . The first thing done to alleviate these conditions was to separate the classes , the substitute teacher taking one group at a time to the yard for physical training , number games , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the departure of Isaac , at least half an hour formerly devoted to his daily " fit " was saved for class instruction . The next step was to arrange with neighboring schools for the transfer of our mentally low-grade children to their schools , and the transfer of their mentally high-grade children to ours . Now the pupils made a better social group , and were better graded in their school work . With the formation of a third ungraded class , another room was set aside so that three classes now used two rooms . One room was fitted as a shop , so that the hammering and sawing no longer interrupted the reading and arithmetic . A // departmental schedule was put into effect with one group in the shop , another having school work , and the third in the yard for physical training and games . In this way it was possible to place a boy who had a special disability in reading , in a lower class for that subject and in a higher one for arithmetic . With the organization of more ungraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the school was already overcrowded , many classes being on part time . This difficulty was obviated by the adoption of a departmental schedule and through the cooperation of the Boys ' Club near by . On pages 141-2 appear the program of school activities carried on under this five-class organization , and a supplementary program for a single class organization . The objection sometimes made to the departmental scheme is that it is hard for the children to adjust to three or more teachers during the day ; but this is offset by the fact that each teacher , instead of being a " Jack of all trades and master of none , " can perfect herself in her chosen subject by taking courses in allied branches . For example , while teaching the scholastic subjects , she can take college work in the teaching of reading , arithmetic , etc . The teacher of physical training can take work in games , corrective gymnastics , or folk dancing . The shop teacher can be taking work in caning , cobbling , basketry , and toy-making . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more resourceful in understanding and building upon the interest of the children . To be a good ungraded teacher is not the work of a day nor a year , for there are many different subjects to be taught , and each child is a special problem in himself . In a departmental schedule , where the teacher has the class but one and one-half hours during the day , both teacher and pupil feel that they must work at top speed to accomplish // what has been planned . From an economic standpoint , there is a decided advantage , for one well-equipped shop is better than a bench or two in each room , together with a few tools . Each class has the use of tools and benches usually provided for three classes , and the period can be devoted by the entire class to shop work without fear of interrupting a reading or arithmetic lesson . The same is true of the physical training equipment . When the classes were three in number , the teachers of older boys in the district asked for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general " get together " meeting , at which each school stood ready with something for the program . This gave the teachers and pupils an opportunity to see the work of the other classes and promoted a desirable rivalry among them . The visits to the Club revealed the remarkable facilities such as the swimming pool , gymnasium , auditorium , and game rooms , which were used in the afternoon and evening by the members of the Club . A plan of cooperation was evolved by which the ungraded boys of Public School 64 were allowed to have their physical work in the Boys ' Club instead of in the school yard , which was overcrowded and unequipped . Two classes were accommodated at the Club in the morning and two in the afternoon . In time , about half the ungraded work came to be carried on in the Boys ' Club , the teachers and the boys spending about half the day there . The class had the use of the shower-baths daily , the swimming pool once a week , and access to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and auditorium entertainments . An evening club was formed , which met every Saturday night . The qualification for entrance was membership in an ungraded class . These boys were well known to the workers at the Club , and every advantage was given them for afternoon and evening work , such as being monitor in the games and check room . This not only helped the boys toward becoming self-supporting , but also kept them off the streets . Most of them were cared for at the Boys ' Club Camp for a part of the summer , and many remained for the entire season . The connection has been a continued resource for the ungraded boys after they have left school and gone to work at the age of sixteen . The Boys ' Club remains a refuge where a welcome awaits them , backed up by an intelligent appreciation of their peculiar problems . // ATTENDANCE INSTEAD OF TRUANCY In the original ungraded class , with its thirty-two boys in a room equipped for sixteen , there were some advantages in a poor attendance , for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy one chair and the problem did not seem quite so hopeless . On the other hand , the boys who stayed away were being encouraged in habits of truancy , in lack of respect for law , and in spending their time on the street . The result was a truancy problem of no small proportions . As the ungraded department handles its own truancy cases , it was necessary to develop an effective home-made technique . The method adopted was to appoint from the class assistant truant officers to help the teacher at noon-time to investigate the causes of absence in the morning ; and to help in the afternoon or evening in the investigation of absences occurring in the afternoon session . This gave the boys a sense of responsibility toward the school , and at the same time encouraged their own attendance , for no one could be an assistant truant officer who was himself a truant . It was found that the former truants made the best officers , for they knew all the places where the truants " hung out . " The work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance during an entire term . It was of course an exceptional record ; but , with improved conditions , truancy has become on the whole one of the minor problems of the ungraded department . The history of Guiseppe Cifuni was not unlike that of many boys . He was eight years old and was on the roll of a regular class which he seldom attended . The truant officer always found the apartment where he lived closed , as both parents worked and Guiseppe roamed about the docks all day . During one of his sporadic and enforced visits to the school under the chaperonage of the truant officer , he was given a psychological test and recommended for the ungraded class . The // struggle began all over again . Cooperation from the home was out of the question ; the boy himself had to be habituated to coming to school . Sometimes the visiting teacher brought him in , violently protesting . More often he was brought by another ungraded boy who lived near him . Finally he began to turn up of his own accord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled down at last and had an almost perfect attendance record for two successive years . There is nothing impersonal or formal in the ungraded department 's way of handling absences . Once the boy is in the class he becomes interested , and this is where this department has resources which the regular grades lack . It is not obliged to try to win a boy without any regard for boy nature ; it may and does try to arrange a program suitable to the mental capacity and actual interests of the pupils . A MODIFIED CURRICULUM To make the school more attractive than the streets is not extremely difficult , once the school can bend its pride to accept the task . One of the chief daily attractions of our ungraded department was an orchestra . The boys were allowed the use of the kindergarten room for music and rhythm . The problem of instruments was solved by making drum-sticks of dowel , eighteen inches long , pointed at one end , which were used upon drum-heads made by stretching cloth over a frame and shellacking it to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blocks of wood , three inches by five inches , were rubbed together in time to the music . " Clappers " bought for five cents each took the place of " bones . " Two tambourines , bells , zonophones , and a triangle , together with the piano , made enough noise to satisfy almost any boy . The appeal was made on a low plane , but in teaching children we must take them from the place where we find them // and lead them gradually to the place where they should and can go . Although the " orchestra " at first was merely noise which satisfied the boys , they gradually grew able to soften the tone and keep time to the music in various ways . The practice in rhythm gave every boy , no matter how low-grade mentally , an opportunity to do something , for a boy can ring the bells or use the sandpaper at almost any time and not spoil the performance , provided the time is kept by the drummers . The work improved each year so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first beat while others used bells on the second , third , and fourth . The performers were promoted from one instrument to the next as they gained in proficiency , until they had mastered all . The present of a real drum enhanced the performance greatly , and when two brothers who played the violin and the cornet were admitted to the ungraded class , the boys felt that they were a real band . They added stunts that they had seen at the local vaudeville houses , such as ball-bouncing , hand-clapping , rope-jumping , and roller-skating in time to the music . It is not difficult to see that in these stunts , done separately and in couples , there was the opportunity for real training in physical coordination and sense development . In time , the teachers gradually substituted for the popular airs with which the children were familiar the simple melodies of classic compositions . Once they had become familiar with airs by MacDowell and Beethoven , they were able to render them with the same enjoyment they had previously derived from street tunes and monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the teachers . In arithmetic , teams were organized for number games which furnished drill in fundamentals , and graphs were drawn showing the progress of the teams . These graphs were posted on the bulletin board , Achievement tests were used to show // the progress of individual pupils . The model store served for all phases of scholastic work , from " playing store " for the lower grades to taking inventories and making bills in the higher grades . Matches in arithmetic were arranged with regular classes of the school , for , although the ungraded boys were not able to compete in problem work , they were capable in memory and drill work . Usually , five were selected from each class , an ungraded and a regular class , the principal and assistant attending , thereby lending dignity to the occasion . You can readily picture how happy these boys were when they tied a 7B grade class , three of whose team were to be skipped to the 8B grade at the end of the term . Although most of these ungraded boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third year book . As they strenuously objected to reading from a " baby book , " they made their own readers from newspapers , which provided material more vital to them than " Bo-Peep and her Sheep . " They made phonic and reading charts for the use of the first , second , and third grades , but no boy was allowed to print the charts unless he knew the letters and could read what he was printing . In this way , the most elementary reading lessons were given them without offense to their selfrespect . For this consideration must always be remembered when dealing with these larger boys with backward minds . Material was selected from the shop for reading , spelling , composition , and arithmetic . In this way the names of the tools were learned , descriptions for making models were written , and spelling became vital , for a boy had to know the name of a tool and how to spell it before he was allowed to use it . Fractions were not merely a page in the arithmetic book but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which caused serious difficulty in the work . // The well-equipped shops and the efficient shop teachers are an added attraction for these boys . In the ungraded classes , because of the small numbers and the fact that the boys might supply their own material , they are allowed to choose their own models . The choice was usually something that could be used at home . Five or six models were finished in a term . During the war , wool was supplied by the Red Cross for knitting sweaters , and the class enjoyed knitting as much as any girls ' class . Their knitting needles were made from dowels . Toy-making also proved successful , the materials for this work being secured through the Junior Red Cross . Once a year a bazaar was held at the Boys ' Club and with the money thus raised , new material not on the supply list was bought . Two looms for rug-weaving were purchased from the school fund . Chair caning was also popular , many orders for stools being secured each year . In appreciation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs of the Club were caned , the Club furnishing the material . Brush-making was another activity in which the boys became proficient . The material was furnished by the Board of Education and the finished products went to the supply department for use in the public schools . The Boys ' Club afforded a place where dramatics were encouraged . The large stage ? the floor of the gymnasium ? gave an opportunity which the over-used auditorium of the school could not . The first work done was a Thanksgiving pageant in which every boy in the department had a part , even if it was no more than dressing up as an Indian . The next attempt was a minstrel show . Under the guidance of the teacher the boys wrote the play themselves , which served to motivate the work in reading and speech improvement . The jokes were culled from the newspaper and censored by the class with the help of the teacher . Popular // songs were selected and some two-part singing was taught . Acrobatic stunts were included and the boys suddenly found the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a success that it was used as the basis of the graduation exercises of the school the following June . No doubt many people would consider the introduction of such trivial material into the serious atmosphere of the schoolroom as an unwarranted departure from the sacred purposes of education . As a matter of fact , the minstrel show stimulated more direct initiative and sustained effort on the part of the boys than we had thought them capable of . One of the most profitable terms of the school centered around the circus which followed the minstrel show . It provided material for the entire term ; all subjects were correlated with it . The drills and acrobatic stunts were prepared in the gymnasium periods . The songs and music for the band were studied in the music period . The stage properties were made in the shop during the shop period . The signs were made in the sign painting shop , and the costumes were loaned by the Boys ' Club and others were made by the garment design shop . A description of the circus may be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appeared two clowns carrying the big bass drum and followed by another clown carrying a sign announcing the show . Then came the ring master in his full dress suit . The brass band played as the freaks and performers marched across the stage in parade . The parade consisted of a giant , a dwarf , a headless wonder , the strong man , the wild man , the Japanese magician , the bearded lady , animal trainers from India , a stuffed bear , a trick elephant , tramps , clowns , and Jewish and negro comedians . Each of these appeared in a special stunt . The ring master gave a comical introduction for each one . Financially // the circus was a great success . It provided funds to treat the nine ungraded classes to seats at Barnum and Bailey 's Circus , it provided new instruments for the orchestra , and it gave money to the school fund . The circus had a remarkable effect on the morale of the ungraded department . It had met with well-merited success . Certainly no one who sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys with IQ 's of only 50 to 70 . The ring master was gifted with unusual good looks and a charming personality , traits which received the tribute that was their due on such an occasion . The ability of the boys to " get the laugh " in the right place showed an integrity of purpose and a coordination of effort which might easily have been lacking in a more pretentious piece of work . This was but one of a series of entertainments which led us to wonder whether the mimetic faculty which plays so large a part in every dramatic performance is not compatible with a much wider range of intelligence than is commonly supposed . Is the sympathetic personality which can get itself across the footlights conditioned on intelligence ? From the Court Jester to Sir Henry Irving , the profession of the entertainer is not generally undervalued . In all of its forms , it can be reasonably sure of an economic reward . It is characteristic of the experimental spirit of the ungraded teachers that whatever ability a boy may possess , manual or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and receives encouragement and appreciation . COOPERATION WITH THE HOME Much of the success of an ungraded class depends on cooperation with the home . Here the tact and skill of the visiting teacher are very much in demand . With these children more often than with others there are physical defects to be // remedied . There is a natural resistance on the part of a family , especially if the other children have gone through school in the regular way , to having a boy in a special class . But when a hitherto difficult child settles into school for the first time in his life , and ceases to harass his parents with bad reports and frequent summons from the school , the family is usually reconciled . Sometimes this is not accomplished without many visits on the part of the visiting teacher , who must interpret this new kind of progress which the boy is making . A legitimate concession was made to the feelings of these boys and their parents by changing the name of the ungraded classes for current use , although the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ungraded " was removed from the classroom doors and " Junior Shops " was substituted . It is by no means necessary , even in a complex public school organization , that concessions made to dull boys should be compensated for by stigmas and labels . So far as such things still persist , they are a survival of the old dunce-cap atrocity . A scientific attitude towards children will do much to eliminate all forms of mental torture from the schoolroom . For the teacher needs not only charity but science to perceive the futility of penalizing a child for failing in that which he absolutely can not do . The teacher of a regular class who is really trained in psychology will be unlikely to threaten a lazy child with the " ungraded class , " and thereby bring into disrepute the children of these classes . It is by learning the actual natures of dull children that we come to have the most charitable attitude toward them . But the threat of the dunce-cap as a form of discipline dies harder than the threat of the birch-rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the ungraded children , new teachers were prone to offend . The pride which the ungraded teachers took in their own classes has done more than // anything else to counteract this depreciation of the status of their department . A zealous but inexperienced teacher came to the door of an ungraded classroom one morning escorting a young culprit who had been late for the fifth time . " This boy , " she said in righteous indignation , " has been late four times . I told him if he came late again , I would put him in this class . " And she waved him in . " Indeed , " said the ungraded teacher with equal indignation , " you have brought him to the wrong place . Every boy in this room comes on time every day . " And she pointed to a 100 per cent record on the blackboard . While the rebuff was hard on the young teacher , it was an absolute necessity from the point of view of protecting the self-respect of the sixteen boys in the classroom . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adhere to the spirit and ideals of the ungraded department of the city . Our experiment had the cooperation and the confidence of the department . The distinctive features of the local work were limited to these : the cooperation with the Boys ' Club , already described , which brought increased facilities and resources ; the tendency to include a higher type of boy in the classes than in most schools ; the establishment of observation ungraded classes for the younger children ; and the initiation of classes for neurotic children , to be discussed in a later chapter . THE BORDER LINE BOY In many schools there is a tendency to regard the ungraded department as a place of punishment and to feel that it is an injustice to a well-behaved child to recommend him for admission . In fact , before psychological tests were introduced , boys were recommended on the basis of behavior rather than intelligence . For this reason , it was difficult to make these classes serve the type of boy who needed the work most . The attitude of the teacher towards a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the doubt by keeping him in a regular class . We , on the other hand , considered that giving a boy the benelit of the doubt often meant giving him the opportunity of getting a good education . The choice which we were sometimes obliged to make in border line cases usually fortified this point of view . Peter Lutz had an IQ of 75 , and so had a great many other boys . Peter 's outstanding characteristic was that he felt compelled to act the fool on every occasion . He was an expert at making faces and giving silly answers . In short , he was a " cut-up " and a clown of the most annoying brand . With it all he had a streak of common sense that made the teachers hesitate to banish him . Finally , rather against the judgment of the teachers , the principal and psychologist decided to ask to have him put into the ungraded class . Without demonstrating any miraculous conversion , Peter gradually learned to exert himself seriously at tasks which he was able to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dullness by his outrageous capers . He had the kind of pride which would have obliged a brighter boy to stand at the head of his class ; but since he had not the capacity for this , he had used whatever resources he had to command attention . Finding his milieu in a class of boys who were duller than he , this trait led him to be in time the brightest , most industrious , and most dependable member of his group . When too much was demanded of him , as occasionally happened , he fell back temporarily into his former mode of behavior . On leaving school , Ile was given a recommendation for a job by his teacher , who could conscientiously consent to do so . Many instances could be given of similar cases of boys who had formerly just scraped along at the bottom of their classes and who seemed to discover new and astonishing abilities in the atmosphere of the Junior Shops . // While it is true that education does not change the mental status of this type of boy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may materially affect his social and economic status in after life . While his IQ is not improved by training , the place he finally comes to occupy in the world may be greatly altered thereby . Of two persons with an equal IQ , the one may make a far better place for himself in society than the other if his training has been based on his actual equipment and not on some hypothetical average . It should not , therefore , be necessary to guarantee that a child will not " be able to manage his affairs with ordinary prudence " ( a frequent definition of mental deficiency ) before placing him in a class where he may learn to do so . He is amenable to the formation of good habits while he is under its care , and if he is started out with well-established practices in regard to health , work , and pl ay , there is a strong likelihood that they will last . This is perhaps even more true of a child with a low IQ than with a high one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies them literally . A more intelligent and imaginative youth has to work things out for himself , and if this gets him into difficulties , he can extricate himself ' by the use of his intelligence . The dull child accepts moral precepts without criticism and , therefore , the school should concentrate its efforts towards teaching him social habits which conform to the existing code . He is not qualified to become a pioneer in higher ethics ; he has a better chance for a happy and serviceable life if he is well drilled in the simplest and most commonly needed ethical conventions . The more diversified his school experiences are , the more opportunities he has to build habits of social conformity which are to be the guide of his later life . An ingenious teacher , during the child 's school course , can manufacture for him // many typical situations which he is likely to meet in his wageearning career , and prepare him to meet them in such a way that they do not arise as emergencies . For a limited intelligence is more apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation than in any other way . FINDING THE SLOW CHILD EARLY When the entire school was classified by intelligence tests , the need for more ungraded classes for the younger children was strongly felt . No such classes had formerly existed . Under the old method of selection by recommendation of the teachers , it had been the rule that no child should be assigned to this department until he had spent at least three years in the regular grades . Frequently he had reached the age of r a to 14 before he was sent , and the teacher was confronted by the task of reconstructing in two years the bad habits which were based on long years of continuous failure . The great majority of boys came to the ungraded class after they had spent five or six years in the grades acquiring habits of truancy , laziness , furtiveness , and devious compensation . Almost every boy entered the department under a cloud . When it became possible to select the children on a scientific basis , it was no longer necessary to wait for the accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest group of first grade children by the psychological classification was taken over by the ungraded department as an observation ungraded class . In the same way , a corresponding group was organized for each succeeding grade . These children were not diagnosed as defective or anything else . They were merely classified as the least promising from the point of view of adjustment to school life and curriculum as it is . There is a certain number of children in every entering class of six-year-olds who strongly suggest , by personal traits and // behavior , and by their family histories as well as by their psychological tests , that they are going to need extra time and extra help to fit into school life . The children who would under ordinary circumstances later be admitted to the ungraded class , will undoubtedly be included in this group . How many of the others will later be returned to the grade above is a question which depends very largely for its answer on the further question of whether the grade will develop a curriculum which will come half-way to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to the sensetraining and individual care given in the ungraded class that it seemed best to try him in a regular class . But as a matter of fact , very few of these children profit by being returned to the present academic grades . Unless some compromise can be worked out which will give the benefits of both the present academic curriculum and the present ungraded curriculum , they are likely to thrive best and make more actual progress in the more humanized environment of the ungraded class . With the establishment of the observation ungraded classes , the department in Public School 64 became subdivided into two groups : four classes of older boys and five classes of younger ones . The make-up of the ungraded department according to the chronological ages of the children is shown in Table XX . The shop equipment for the younger boys was a problem . The department had no equipment for children of this size . Only the regulation academic sittings of the old-fashioned prison type were available for six- and eight- and nine-year-olds . Fortunately the school shops were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ungraded plan . Tables , benches , and chairs were constructed in the joinery department , and small stools , on which the children stood while they worked , enabled them to use the regular benches // and do genuine work from the first with regulation tools . The making of this equipment by the older boys illustrates the kind of service which they commonly gave to the school in the way of repairs and upkeep . The idea of useful work was not imparted merely as a theory but as a practical , daily habit . There are many advantages in placing the children in observation ungraded classes at six or seven years of age . In the first place , they are saved from wasting time , and time most precious to the slow learner . In the second place , they enlist the sympathy and affection of the teachers of the department more readily as little children than as older ones . The deficiency of a six-year-old appears in the form of a babyish demeanor . This is in itself an appealing trait which naturally arouses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's backwardness becomes more outstanding , there exists already a history of affection between them which helps to mitigate the teacher 's impatience and displeasure . This applies , of course , only in a school where the ungraded // teachers know the boys throughout their school career , as is the case in Public School 64 , where the department is a school within a school , with an intimate and informal atmosphere of its own . After all , the principal advantage of early assignment to ungraded classes is the protection of the child 's disposition . At home , his backwardness has usually been tolerated and shielded , but as soon as he encounters the requirements and the competition of the first grade , his disposition begins to break . With every added failure , his feeling of inferiority is enhanced . How can he keep up courage or develop cheerful industry ? His gradual loss of confidence and incentive renders him at last unable to do the work even up to his limited capacity . It is important to remember in this connection that self-confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings with feeble-mindedness . These personal attitudes are founded less on actual ability than on the child 's experience with his family and his school . The boy with a 75 IQ who is treated by his parent or teacher as if he were somebody is not so likely to suffer from morbid diffidence and discouragement as a boy of 125 IQ who is habitually snubbed by his elders . The boy with a low IQ who goes all the way through school and leaves it with a socialized friendly attitude towards others , carries within himself the greatest possible protection against danger . He has established habits of frictionless relationships which are the best social safeguard that can be given him . Students of delinquency estimate that from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the population of the prisons are mental defectives . This is enormously high by comparison with the proportion of mental defectives in the population at large . It has led many people to believe that mental defectiveness is in itself a cause of crime . But if this were the case , what light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison population ? It is not the lack of intelligence which gets people into prison ; it is their dispositions . The fact that so large a proportion of the mentally defective go to prison is evidence of how far the schools have failed in their task . The subnormal person is often malleable and educable . The constant nagging and punishment which are meted out to the stupid boy in the average school give him a kind of special training in resentment and antagonism . Later on , these unlovely qualities , the product of his education , wreck his industrial career . They lead him to hate the boss , quarrel with his fellows , and lose one job after another . If he reaches prison at twenty-four and is there diagnosed as mentally defective and emotionally unstable , the emphasis should be placed on the second feature of the diagnosis as the significant factor of his tragedy . After the history of conflict through which he has passed , it is legitimate to wonder whether mental defectiveness alone would ever have brought him to this pass . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations on which civilization depends which may readily be performed by a person with a 50 to 75 IQ . The boy or girl who goes out into the world with an unspoiled disposition and a mental age of only 8 to 12 years may present a very good front before his neighbors and fellow-workers , who do not inquire whether he left off at school with long division or analytical geometry . He can do many things along with the cleverest . Anybody who is trying to learn to run a motor car may encourage himself with the reflection that a moron can do the same . There are brilliant women who are proud that they can knit , and would probably be surprised to know that this is a normal accomplishment for a seven-year-old mentality . It is true that the low-grade intelligence which is engaged 16o FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD in running a motor car or knitting or any of their numerous equivalents does not make the same general impression as the high-grade intelligence similarly employed . There is an unconscious recognition in the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have such a nice little grocer 's boy , " says a lady , expatiating on his faithfulness and regularity , which she rewards with occasional presents . " A nice little seamstress " is very popular with a certain family , who do not stop to reflect that the quality of dependence which makes them all fond of her is not a truly adult quality . The use of such phrases indicates a certain awareness of the diminutive development of these people . But so long as the friendly feeling prevails , the person so referred to does not lose his job and become dependent , although his IQ may be below the median IQ of the population of Sing Sing . This is what the ungraded teachers have come to realize and why they answer " no " when people ask them whether they do not find their work depressing . After all , the education of dispositions is perhaps a more subtle and interesting occupation than giving information to bright or average children who would probably get it anyway . CHAPTER VIII THE DULL NORMAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as many people seem to think , take away from them their infinite variety and stamp them with a tiresome uniformity . When the government tests the army and publishes the results , it does no injustice to the individual . The Federal Census reports tell us certain facts about every person in the country age , sex , occupation , marital status , and so forth ? but we do not assume that this is all that could be told about him . In the same way , the psychological test ascertains the intelligence rating of a group of individuals without assuming that this is all that might be told about the members of the group . It is not the function of the psychological classification , any more than of the census classification , to reduce human beings to the dull facsimile of a swarm of bees , a flock of sheep , a shoal of fish . If anyone hears of classifying school children by intelligence tests , he should not envisage them therefore as a crowd of orphans in blue-checked gingham , forlorn imitations of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school children are said to have a common IQ of 85 , it should be remembered that this is really the only trait in which they are even approximately alike . It happens that in the business of education , this kind of homogeneity has primary importance because it so largely determines the child 's reaction to being taught . But the experienced psychologist who dis-161 // covers that a child has an IQ of 90 does not believe that he has exhausted the subject . Indeed , he is more aware of the uncharted and untested influences which remain after the IQ has been estimated than the well-meaning but unscientific person who believes that academic education of the kind now current is a remedy for every human limitation . As soon as you begin to put things together by reason of a certain similarity between them , their dissimilarities begin to stand out . A button here and a button there are just buttons ; gathered together in a button box , their various differences are instantly noted , large and small , blue and brown , round and flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to sort them by sizes , the varieties of color begin to appear ; sorted by color , they refuse to look alike in regard to shape . The discovery of a similarity is always an aid in the process of differentiation . The person who is not impressed with the dissimilarities of similar things is the person who is at a distance and has no intimate contact with them , who sees them only through the newspaper column , the printed page , or common talk . To people remote from the material , the one effect of classification seems to be uniformity , because it offers a single trait whereby the imagination , working at a distance , may hold the whole group in mind . But the teacher who stands before a class of children with similar IQ 's , or the psychologist who is in daily contact with them , is less conscious of their common traits than of their individual differences . The individualizing of the child in the teacher 's mind is facilitated by this grouping . Once she perceives the quality they share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not share . Formal academic education builds on what people have in common ; real education should take account of the individual 's possible contribution through personal tendencies and endowments , and should // seek to make this potential contribution a real one for every individual . While the mental capacity of a person does more or less to determine his place in school or sphere in life , it does not determine his success within that sphere . But this is the kind of success on which personal happiness chiefly depends and which practically every grade of intelligence may hopefully pursue . Psychological classification does not encourage the idea that only the best intelligence is worth while and the rest nowhere ; on the contrary , it leads us to value all kinds and grades of intelligence and to try to understand how to develop them towards a life of personal effectiveness and social usefulness . SIZE OF DULL NORMAL GROUP The group of children whose IQ 's are between 75 and 85 and whose potential mental ages between 12 and 14 represents for several reasons the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made , the size of this group has shown a tendency to disturb the normal curve of intelligence . In the army , it assumed surprising proportions . " It appears , " says the report , " that the intelligence of the principal sample of the white draft , when transmitted from Alpha and Beta examinations in terms of mental age , is about 13 years ( 13.08 ) . Here we have a measure of the average intelligence of nearly 100,000 white recruits . " Commenting further on this group , the army report says , " We know now , approximately , from clinical experience , the capacity and mental ability of a man of 13 years . We have never heretofore supposed that the mental ability of this man was the average of the country or anywhere near it . " 1 In other words , we have never been willing to admit the // prevalence of this grade of intelligence among the general population . We have preferred to believe that Socratic and Jeffersonian intellects were at least embryonic in everybody . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with surprise over the outstanding proportion of this group and searching for special reasons for the bulging of the intelligence curve just where the dull normal folk come in . A more practical alternative would be to admit that there are a great number of these people and that they form no negligible problem from the social and educational point of view . In our school , about one-fifth of the children were classified within the dull normal group . For practical purposes , however , the number should be considered a much larger one , perhaps one-fourth . The psychological line of demarcation is not absolute ; you do not keep a boy out of high school because he has an IQ of 89 , nor refuse to classify another as dull normal because his IQ is 86 instead of 85 . Such literal distinctions would be absurd . There were overlapping IQ 's in all our groups in Public School 64 . A child is not saved by intelligence alone ; all his attributes of character have an influence on the issue . Yet it is a doubtful kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined to be always at the tail-end . Children with IQ 's between 85 and 90 seldom do well in the high school courses which prepare for college , and many of them should be included in any public school program which is adapted to the 75 to 85 IQ group . This does not mean that they should have no secondary education , but that the present high school fails to provide a congenial program for them . Such a program does not exist even in the elementary school . What actually happens in all public schools , as every educator conversant with the situation knows , is that about one-third of the children sit around while the other two-thirds are being // taught . This recognition is not limited to the educator ; it is a matter of common knowledge , a subject to be treated with tolerant mirth . A recent cartoon in the New York World showed two little boys engaged in a gutter conversation about the approach of school days . " Ai n't you goin ' to school this year ? " said one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't learn anything last year . " The joke has its serious implications for the educator . The number of little boys who might say this with literal truth is startlingly large . They are generally children whose IQ 's are anywhere between 75 and 90 . If we were to analyze 2000 school children who are social and educational misfits , the great majority would certainly be found to belong to this group . The truants , the hold-overs , the disciplinary cases are preponderantly of the dull normal type . They are a symptom of protest against our inadequate school organization . Under our present arrangements , the dull normal child misses out all along the line . He is denied the opportunities which are provided for the ungraded child and he can not profit by those which directly prepare for the high school course . Even the trade school becomes practically inaccessible for him , owing to his belated graduation from the grammar grades and the selective policy of the trade school , which can always choose boys with good marks who can not afford a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do good work and a great variety of useful and dignified occupations are open to him ; but the school insists on preparing him to be a lawyer , or doctor , or banker , or pedagogue . He sits on in classes conducted on this theory as a child sits through a dreary sermon . If he suffers from boredom , says the school authority , it is his " fault . " The schools are made for children who can " take an education " and the standards must be kept up , etc. , etc. // During the years of the experiment in our school , an effort was made to come to the rescue of these children in various empirical ways . No other group seemed to be so much in need of imaginative and constructive guidance . The existence of the opportunity classes within the system was seen to be an entering wedge on their behalf . These classes were specifically organized to enable over-age boys to overcome their retardation . The usual plan had been to group the slow normal together during their last years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we established opportunity classes for the younger boys and continued this process until one opportunity class was formed for each grade all the way up and down . These were permitted to have a smaller register than the regular classes , but the further adaptation of the opportunity classes remained behindhand . There was no special equipment for them and there were no specially trained teachers . An organized constructive plan was impossible . Experiments with the curriculum had to be left with the individual teacher , with the result that here and there some progress was made with certain classes . The animal-room , the window-gardens , and the shops were at least available , and functioned well in the hands of creative teachers who could exploit their possibilities . AN EXPERIMENT WITH ATTENDANCE With one class of 5B grade boys , a more intensive attempt was made . The class was comparatively small with only twenty-five on the register ( later increased to thirty ) , because it was known to contain so many difficult boys and so many stubborn cases of truancy , over-age , and other disciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen years . The older members remained in school until sixteen , because the compulsory school law would not permit them to // go to work before that age unless they had completed at least the 6B grade . The teacher who was placed in charge was a young man of good personality and adequate technique with a regular class . While he was liked by the boys and did very well considering the group under his care , truancy continued to be rife among them , and there were constant complaints against his pupils for infractions of school discipline . The parents of these big boys could give little or no assistance . We determined to see if it was possible to interest this blase group in school . It should be noted that the course of study did not provide shop work for fifth year classes . Regardless of the curriculum , we asked the shop teacher to provide an hour each clay for the instruction of this experimental class . At first the boys were not interested because they had had no training to do the jobs they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill in the use of material and tools and learned the magic feel of success . By the middle of the term , all of them were intensely interested in the shop work and had developed a more active spirit of work in every direction . They attacked the formal subjects of the curriculum . At the end of the term , the tables , chairs , and willow-work they had produced were among the best in the shop 's exhibit . The manual training department no longer condescended to accept these boys , but looked forward with assured success to their second term of work . The other innovation was the introduction of a swimming period once a week . Here again the Boys ' Club came to the rescue with the provision of a swimming pool and a skillful teacher . Because the pupils were interested in learning to swim , they did not take less interest , but more , in the arithmetic period . Too often the guardians of children think that this or that interest " takes the child 's mind off his lessons . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage // every normal boyish interest which leads to the acquisition of skill . When a child cats the butter off his bread , he is not deprived of the butter , which he needs , but is taught to " bite through " and eat the bread also . But too many of our educational processes insist on the child 's learning to like dry bread , and too often the school goes about its work in a spirit of foolish pride , which refuses to compromise with childish interests and spirits . It then puts all the responsibility for failure where it least belongs on the unsuccessful child . The change which came over the spirit of this group of boys was little short of remarkable , and it was all due to the fact that they were given something to do which they liked and that they had found something that they could do well . The problems of attendance and discipline grew fewer and fewer until , before the year was over , these no longer existed . Table XXI shows the record of attendance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same teacher was in charge during the four terms , but it was not until the end of the second term that the adjustment of curriculum was made . The marked improvement in attendance is shown by the reduction of total absences from 5731 clays in the second term , to 3201- in the third term , and 2822 in the fourth term . Everywhere the dull normal boy is the despair of the teachers , supervisors , and parents . Only today we read in the newspapers of the alarming conditions in New York City , and the inadequate facilities for dealing with the truant and other delinquency cases . This state of affairs must continue to exist so long as we fail to recognize the true cause . In the best parental and disciplinary schools the boys are given a kind of curriculum which approximates an adjustment to their abilities . If the same modification of curriculum had been provided for the same boys while they were still in the middle grades of the school ? or preferably , even earlier 1 70 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the schools decide to provide , as they very well can , the conditions and activities which will hold these boys , it will not be necessary in so many instances to take them from their homes and confine them in institutional environments , which we then strive in vain to render educational and home-like . The class experiment just described was but a demonstration of what might be done for boys of this type . It was but a scanty handful who benefited by the plan when compared with the group of boys in the school who needed similar treatment and more of it . So cognizant were we , however , of the specific social dangers which confront all ill-adjusted schoolboys , that we made every possible effort to treat each one as an individual case . The visiting teacher is the most valuable aid which the school has developed for handling these difficult children , and there is a tendency in the school which is not psychologically orientated about its material to concentrate her effort too exclusively on this type of problem . Billie Jackson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his home the visiting teacher learned that Billie 's father " had not had much schooling and did not like school . He never could learn anything there and neither could Billie . " It was true ; Billie was intensely bored by school books and much preferred to spend his time lying on the iron grating above the subway and watching the trains pass below , and in similar pursuits . The complacent ignorance of his parents did not help his school attendance . He became an incorrigible truant . One day he casually appropriated ? Unfortunately , by no acceptable standard test , could Billie be called a mental defective . His IQ was 88 . If he could // have been put in the ungraded department , his problem would have been helped . It was indeed a case for desperate remedies , if we could think of any . Billie developed a fondness for one particular teacher who had the faculty of keeping up his attendance whenever he was in her room . The teacher happened to be promoted with her grade from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping now and then , without entirely disregarding his grade-progress through school . Whenever his truancy grew worse , he was re-consigned to Miss X and the habit would be abated . This treatment may have been empirical and unorthodox , but is not anything better than a fanatical law enforcement which makes this type of boy into a social outcast before he has reached his teens ? We thought that it was . Bennie Eichenbaum , IQ 88 , was by no means a neglected boy . His first appearance in the school was at the age of eleven and in the fifth grade . His father had just made a second marriage and brought Bennie home from the Hebrew Orphan Asylum . A well-intentioned stepmother shared in the ambitious plans which Bennie 's father had laid out for him . The boy always came to the school extremely well dressed in brown corduroy suits and with longish hair ; for Bennie 's father had determined that he was to be a violinist and insisted that he should dress the part . The boy objected to the clothes , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disliked the idea of being a violinist . When his father insisted on his going to the public library to take out a book , Bennie lost the book and his father had to pay for it . Mr. Eichenbaum came to school frequently to make anxious inquiries about Bennie 's progress , but Bennie showed no interest in his lessons . His father consoled himself by constantly singing the praises of Bennie 's brother , who was boarding with a family in New Jersey and was making such a fine 1 72 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD record for himself in every way that his father forbore to bring him home . The legend of the other boy 's superiority was constantly kept going in the family circle , in the hope that it might stimulate greater effort on Bennie 's part . Naturally , it increased the boy 's discouragement . His reaction to all this was to take refuge in a stupid passivity in the presence of his elders . He had two absorbing interests : the wish to possess a bicycle ( instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father refused to allow him to have a bicycle for fear he might be run over in the street . He reveled in the movies , however , for which an aunt secretly gave him money . This aunt , to whom Bennie always referred dramatically as his " dead mother 's sister , " fancied that the boy was ill-used by his stepmother and spoiled him with misplaced sympathy . He began to indulge in romantic adventures which led to truancy and vagabondage . With another boy , he undertook to enact a hanging scene in a cellar ; but he became frightened and ran away without cutting down the victim . The boy was rescued just in time , and Bennie 's reputation as a desperado was greatly enhanced . He had taken to staying out overnight and , from this beginning , he continued to wander farther and farther afield . One morning his distracted stepmother rushed into the school bearing the evidence of his latest crime wrapped up in a Yiddish newspaper . It was a small bank which Bennie had forced open . He had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappeared . Fortunately Bennie 's parents , who had started out with the idea of curing him by invoking the law and the courts , had formed the habit of bringing his offenses to the school instead . The visiting teacher was repeatedly appealed to : " You helped me with that boy before . Now , tell me , what shall I do ? " When suggestions were made to the father // that some of his methods only made bad matters worse , he tried conscientiously to change them . The boy , who admired and feared his father extravagantly , would have liked to please him ; but the standard of the ambitious parents had been placed too high for him . The school requirements were always just beyond his reach . His failure to graduate from the 8B class was a disaster which sent the visiting teacher posthaste to the boy 's father to break the news to him and persuade him not to " kill " the culprit . There was no special disability in Bennie 's case . But academic subjects had no attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home could do to arouse his interest in lessons left him apathetic and furtively recalcitrant . If he had been given bicycle and shop and swimming lessons instead of violin and grammar lessons and library books , he might have become a wide-awake schoolboy . Instead , he hovered constantly on the edge of juvenile delinquency , and it was only the work of the visiting teacher which kept him from becoming a court case in early childhood . WHAT SHALL BE DONE FOR THE DULL NORMAL BOY The distressing problem presented by children who can not cope successfully with the regular academic requirements and who are , nevertheless , not mental defectives , is a daily experience in every school . Evidence of this came to us in the form of frequent requests to receive big boys of thirteen or fourteen who were still obliged to go to school , although they had been eliminated from one school after another . A number of such boys were enrolled and allowed to do shop work , which they considered manly and which reconciled them to the rest of the curriculum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these boys will find no dearth of them knocking at its doors . Some of those who came to our school r 74 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD lived in the farthest parts of the city , and traveled long distances daily on the subway . One of the boys became very able in electric-wiring and supervised the younger boys in work which was done in the school offices . Another built a gasoline engine from the foundation up ? a piece of work of which the school was rightfully proud and which was a more than creditable achievement for any fifteen-year-old boy . This boy was excused from all other school work and allowed to work in the machine shop exclusively . He came to be an assistant to the teacher , and his engine was an object of admiration to hundreds of boys who passed through this shop each week . This last year of school meant everything to a boy who had hated it always . We had had to compromise with the requirements , but we felt that the boy had been rescued . Not children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistence of characteristics is extraordinary in both cases . For the last century at least , a single uniform academic course of study has been uncritically accepted as suitable for all children of the elementary grades . Nothing has hindered the progress of education more than this erroneous view . The aristocratic education once developed in the palaestra and the monastery and the English public school for the upper layers of intelligence , has been regarded as the one possible basis of school work . Compulsory education was never thought to be inconsistent with this idea . The public school could think of no other way than to dilute the scholastic system more and more and filter the ever-thinning mixture on down through the elementary grades . As there was no scientific knowledge of the development of children before and during their teens , our educators took the philosophy of Aristotle for an ideal and thinned it down until they produced a dose that the average six-year-old could bear . It still // remains to be proved that even the normal child of this age profits more by the mild dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plight of the pupil below the average in intelligence is cumulative . He can tolerate a great deal , like the young child who sits still in church with his elders while the sermon goes on over his head . But the endurance which goes on in the schoolroom day by day involves a far greater strain , although the material is not quite so remote from perception . By the time he reaches the middle and upper grades he is in revolt , or apathetic , or mentally ill . The grammar grades can do nothing for him ; the school can only go on with its program of feeding sugar to diabetics . In most occupations , people take account of the material with which they are working , and modify their methods to suit its conditions . The housewife boils her jam a longer or shorter period of time , according to whether the berries are wet or dry . If the jam turns out badly once , no trouble is too much to take to avoid the same mistake again . Only in school do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the same traditional method . Then when they turn out badly , we start all over again with the next batch with the procedure absolutely unchanged . We are not forgetful of the matter of social approval , to which the child is and should be sensitive . While he is entitled to receive the traditional course of study , he also has a right to be trained according to his personal endowment . After all , we can not develop and build without regard to the native capacities and abilities of children . This general principle has always been accepted , but not until recently have we come to realize the wide range of individual differences ? mental , physical , and emotional ? which exist among children . To adjust to these conditions does not require the // complete abandonment of all the traditional values of the schoolroom . The boy wants to have history , and civics , and science because all the other boys in his street have these studies . " What , do n't you have history in your class ? We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing that one boy likes to hear from another , and against which the school should seek to protect him . As a matter of fact , the dull normal child can be taught much of the conventional subjects if he is taught in the untraditional , or ungraded way . Science includes much practical matter extremely attractive to him . It is one thing to teach him by demonstrating the inside workings of a Ford engine but quite another to teach him the inside workings of the solar system . Yet both lessons may be justifiably listed as science , and the public school is confronted by the necessity of regarding them as equally important . Usually the school is far more willing to buy a uranosphere to show the movement of the heavenly bodies than to purchase a Ford engine to interest the boys , although all gradations of IQ 's are fascinated by the latter . While the dull normal child does not generalize easily , this does not mean that he can not generalize at all . It has been fairly well established by psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelve-yearold intelligence . The dull normal child goes beyond this point in his development , but reaches it later . He has not the same facility to learn through symbols and from the printed page . Once the school has condescended to teach him by experience , he can be given a genuine understanding of all that he is supposed to learn . A project , like that , for instance , of running a lunch-room , can be made to motivate the work of the standard curriculum throughout the year . Geography , arithmetic , and English composition take on a // new aspect for the 7A grade boy when they are a part of running a little business or some other boyish project equally concrete . If , however , the school has no equipment and no imagination to provide these concrete projects , there will surely be truants , delinquents , and social problems of all sorts to be adjusted outside the school . This is why it may be said with perfect truth that our schools make children bad . The ancient reasons for truancy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but slightly altered these attractions ; pigeon-flying becomes the competitor of arithmetic for the boys ' interest . It is the wise school which takes stock of the errant pupils ' habits and diversions . At Public School 64 , we instituted a pigeon-fly in the animalroom . The breeding of carrier-pigeons was an enterprise which outranked the ordinary pigeon brood of the tenement housetops . There even came a day when the school pigeons were carried in a patriotic parade and released in front of the public library to find their way back to their home . The thrill of the event was not felt alone by the boys ' class , which welcomed them back in the animal-room the next morning , but by the whole school as well . If it comes about that the boys are playing truant to go a-fishing , then the school might do worse than to set up a fishpond alongside of the unabridged dictionary . As we have already said , truancy was not a desperate problem in our school . But whenever we found a truant on our hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we attacked the problem individually and pragmatically . THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TEACHER The dull over-age boy is so frequently a center of disciplinary problems , that there is a tendency to place him under a man teacher . The common assumption is that these boys // need a strong arm , an iron fist . In this connection , it should be remembered that the overgrown , unsuccessful schoolboy is almost invariably on extremely bad terms with his father . This probably means that coercive discipline is not new to him . The school has doubtless increased his familiarity with firm methods , and strengthened his resistance and defenses , whatever these may be . Much of this coercion may have been exerted by parent and school in an attempt to force the boy to do things actually beyond his capacity . In such cases , a continuance of the method is obviously worse than futile . A severe man as teacher may mean , to the rebellious boy , just another father to be resisted . The dull normal boy is very likely to linger in the elementary school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time , he will go forth to work . He has before him , probably , a lifetime of adjustment to one " boss " or another , for his abilities are not commensurate with a career of independent and self-directing endeavor . It is highly important that during his last years in school he should not build up quarrelsome and recalcitrant habits of relationship with his teacher , for later he is likely to carry over this attitude to his job . A man teacher whom he can admire for his athletic prowess or skill in shop work has the best influences on him both then and later . Sheer authority is a poor thing to invoke ; tact and Salvation Army methods are usually worth more than regimental discipline . The boy who is at odds with his father , on the other hand , often has his mother on his side . There were women teachers in our school , middle-aged and maternal , who had excellent success in keeping these boys busy and interested . Children should have , of course , both men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from forming habits of enmity towards their school teachers of both sexes . // For all that we have said about the dull normal boy shows that this is his greatest danger ? that he shall learn , in the words of a well-known prison expert , " to fear and hate his teacher because she does not have the same smile for him as for the boy who knows his lesson . " 1 Much of this kind of boyish unhappiness , which leads to lawlessness , can be prevented if the teacher knows more about the actual capacities of the boy , and in addition realizes that no child can turn out to be a moral success if he is made to feel himself a mental failure at every stage of his school career . CHAPTER IX THE NEUROTIC CHILD Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the school experiment was the formation of special classes for neurotic children . Had we been deterred by the difficulty of the questions which challenged us in regard to these elusive and baffling individuals , we should not even yet have reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are neurotic children ? How do you detect them ? and , What can you do for them ? can so far only be answered on an empirical basis . We had , to encourage us , the precedent of the feeble-minded , who had been recognized , segregated , and educated for many years before any adequate objective method of diagnosis was invented . We knew that the neurotic adult did not become so overnight , but as the result of a warped development beginning during childhood . We also knew that neurotic adults are unhappy themselves and a source of unhappiness to others ; that they have a tendency to become dependents if not delinquents ; and that they are a source of emotional as well as economic waste . It scarcely seems necessary to apologize for an honest effort to prevent them , nor yet for methods used , so far as they were vindicated by results . We do not minimize the value of the ambulance and fireengine because they serve only a small percentage of the population . In the same way , the seriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because their proportion is small . The exigency of the problem faced by the educator in connection with these children is such that 18o
