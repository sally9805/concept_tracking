AUGUST , 1928 . This is the year and this the principal month of the Olympic Games , the modern sporting revival of those sacred games of ancient Greece held in the valley under the shadow of Mount Erymanthus in western Sparta over two thousand years ago . The news despatches suggesting the friendly intermingling of the athletic youth of more than fifty nations make it seem jolly and delightful ; there is a pleasant air of informal good sportsmanship about the reports that flutter daily across the ocean from Amsterdam . Yet occasionally a paragraph creeps in that leads one to wonder whether all is really well upon the sporting Potomac , whether these modern Olympic Games are working out quite as Baron de Coubertin and his committee hoped and expected when they first met in Paris in 1894 . Indeed , in certain outspoken quarters there is a belief that it would be best to drop them altogether . Thus a recent editorial in the London Daily Express said , " The British nation , profoundly interested in sport , is intensely uninterested in the Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as every student of the classics , is vaguely aware of the existence of the Olympic Games several thousand years ago ; but not everyone realizes what an important position they held in the Greece of 400 B.C. or thereabouts . For more than six hundred years , no matter who was fighting or what kind of warfare was being waged , a truce was always proclaimed throughout the land at the time of the Games in order to allow spectators and athletes to make the journey to Sparta in safety . A winner was escorted home in triumph in a chariot and taken into his native city through a breach in the walls made to signify that a town capable of producing such a man needed no protection . Poets like Pindar and Simonides composed hymns of praise in his honor ; for a long time the Olympic victor was regarded as the expression of Grecian culture at its highest . But as the Games grew in importance and prestige their spirit and that of the victors changed immeasurably . This change seems to have come about first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Originally the single contest was a footrace within the Stadium ; then the chariot races were added , next came other races of various distances between the contestants . Very soon it was found that the earlier winners , men who devoted little or no time to preparing for the Games , were being beaten by men who took months to train seriously for the different events . Towns and cities discovered how beneficial it was to produce the winner at Olympia : grants of money and assistance were given their athletes , and before long the simple wreath of olives was by no means the only prize the victor at Olympia received . Indeed . so open and so apparent were the corn . mereial recompenses dispensed , so fat did the games begin to drift from the Olympic ideal of old , that men like Platc and Socrates denounced them in public doubtless receiving the same sort of de rision as those who venture to question our sporting panorama of the twentietl century . Then , as now , a class came int ( existence which openly devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocation , as well as its avocation , was the Olympic Games . Before long whole towns began to compete for the services of athletes in much the same manner as our professional baseball players are bought and sold in the open market to-day . Thus we are told how Astylus of Crotona declared himself to be a citizen of Syracuse , and how Sotades of Crete became a citizen of Ephesus , both men receiving large sums of money in the transaction . Furthermore , not only were the amounts bestowed upon the winners by grateful townsfolk enormous , but not infrequently the victors were given the right of " Sitesis , " or free subsistence for life , in other words a kind of athletic pension . Solon alone among the Athenian lawmakers of his time dared protest at the corruption of the Games ; indeed , it was principally owing to his efforts that the prizes for winners , which for some years lad been given in the form of money , were limited to five hundred drachma apiece . So open was the venality of the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vas lost sight of , and when athletes beanie out-and-out professionals , abantoning all other occupations , interest in he contests ' began to abate . It was the ieginning of the end of the famous ) lympics of Greece . These Games , eoneived in a spirit of religious purity , ecame the victim of corrupt professionlism , and after a period of more than wen hundred years of existence , came to n end in X93 A.D. 4 The more one studies the history of ie original Olympic Games and cornarcs them with their modern counter-art the more is one struck with the ! semblance between them . Like the resent Games , the Olympics of Sparta here held in summer and in the month 0 August . Like the Games of old , the ? esent Games were begun in a spirit ofalmost religious devotion to an ideal . It was agreed among the committee which met in the Sorbonne in Paris at the invitation of Baron de Coubertin that the principal result of the reinstitution of these great sporting gatherings would be the friendly feeling they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to know a man well is to like him , and that the peoples of the world would be drawn into close contact through athletics , the committee looked forward to the immense benefit the Games would bring to nations unable to understand one another except upon the meeting ground and through the common language of sport . That in many and devious ways the peoples of three or four continents have grown to know more about one another through their sporting representatives in field and track is true enough ; but that the Games have been a vital factor in the promotion or the cementing of international friendships is something not quite so evident to the casual observer . One can imagine the leaders of the Olympics of , say , the year 100 B.C. , the executives of the Spartan , Theban , and Athenian Amateur Athletic Associations , talking blandly of the vast benefit of sport in international relations to anyone presumptuous enough to question the lasting value of the Games . Yet it appears that international relations do not always get the best of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bast been so altered that neither dogs nor any person in town could recognize thee , " says an old report about a man who had just competed in the Olympics of ancient Greece . And in the last of our modern Olympic Games Bruisse , the French **27;801;TOOLONG champion , so lacerated the breast of Mallon , the English boxer , that he was disqualified for biting ! But perhaps boxing is a sport that tends to arouse the ugly passions of the healthy young animal . Let us have a look at some sport of less rough-and-tumble a nature . For instance , fencing . Yet a little investigation will prove that fencing is hardly a case in point for those who hold that these games bring about amity and good feeling . For it appears that in the Olympics of 1924 the Italian team , " dissatisfied with the decision of the referee , behaved in a most unsportsmanlike manner and withdrew from the competition . " Perhaps they were within their right in so doing ; but at any rate there was little justification for their star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the judges , met him later and promptly knocked him down . For this he was barred by the Jury d'Ilonneur , the Supreme Court of the Olympic Games , from taking part in any future Olympics , and a severe reprimand was administered to the entire Italian Fencing and Saber Team . Study closely the history of the modern Olympics , and you will have difficulty in discovering many which did not leave a series of unfortunate incidents in their train . The aflermalli of the Games of 1908 in London was a series of booklets and pamphlets attributed to Mr. Gustavus Kirby on our side , and on the British side to Mr. ? now Sir ? Theodore Cook , each man pointing out the inaccuracies of the other in no uncertain manner . In fact , it was Mr. Cook who set us down properly by remarking that " the 1908 Olympic Team from America will go down in history as the team on whose behalf more complaints were made than any other . " It may have been true that our 1908 team did win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually the British that year who protested over the decision in the four-hundredmeter run ? In the final heat of this event there were four Americans running against a single Englishman , Lieutenant Halswelle . As they came into the turn the Englishman found himself unable to get past his four opponents , and after the race the claim was made that he had been boxed , that is , deliberately pocketed so that he could not get by his competitors . This all the Americans energetically denied , stating that it was every man for himself , and that if HalsweIle had been pocketed it was his own fault . British judges sustained the British protest , however ; Carpenter , the winner , was disqualified , and the race ordered rerun . The American captain refused to permit his men to compete again , and Halswelle ran the race alone as the winner . A few hard names were called by both sides during the rest of the meet , and one American correspondent wired home that the sentiment in London was " anything to beat the Yankees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Dorando , the Italian Marathon runner who had collapsed in the Shepherd 's Bush Stadium four hundred yards from the finish , was picked up by officials and carried across the line as Johnny Hayes , the American , enterec the field . The decision , first given to th ( Italian , was later reversed , but not unti some heated words had been exchange ( by British and American officials . After the recent disclosures of Mr Charles Paddock , there is occasion , a The Sportsman of Boston remarked , ti lose our faith in American sportsmanshij at the Olympics . You may remembe the admissions of Mr. Paddock , mad over the radio , and later confirmed in letter to the Amateur Athletic Unior It seems that in the finals of the hundrec meter run in the 1924 Games , in whit four Americans and one Englishman wei running , the former agreed that eac American in turn would " jump the gun . This would cause the Englishman jump the gun also and thereby gi penalized . " Of course , " calmly add ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called hack he would undoubted ' win . " Actually the idea fell throng the race was fairly run and the Englis ' man won . But the fact remains thi the trick had been deliberately planne The Sportsman in commenting on it say " It was as if they ( the Americans ) hs said , ' We planned to win by sticking rake handle between Abrahams ' le at the fifty-yard mark . It was a good scheme and it seemed sure to succeed . But at the crucial moment we did n't do it . This is real sportsmanship . . . Heretofore we have naively believed that the protests of the English in 1908 and of other foreign teams in later Olympics against the morals and manners of the American delegation were inspired by nothing more than the chagrin of defeat , but now ? now our faith begins to falter . " " The VIII Olympiad , " said Colonel Robert M. Thompson after the last Games , " marked one more step forward in the promotion of understanding and good will among the nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , one gets a slightly different impression . Manager Sam Goodman , in speaking of the visit of the American rugby team to the Olympics in Paris , wrote , " Without going into letails about our stay in the French Dapital , it is only necessary to remark ; hat we were accorded anything but iospitable treatment ; in fact , many times were treated with open hostility . " Ind later on , he remarked casually in his tecount of the game between the Ameri.an and Roumanian teams , " Through-at that game the ten thousand or more orench spectators cheered the Roueanians and booed the Americans with Teat consistency . That attitude seemd o us unnecessary ; at any rate , it failed o improve our feeling and love for the rench . " This one can readily understand . Tor ? according to Mr. Goodman 's reort ? did the finals in which the AmeriIn team defeated the French appear to Dow the step forward so plainly indided by Colonel Thompson . For , said fr . Goodman , " Athletically speaking , ublic feeling generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doing , and hissing which the American 1g and the American players received the conclusion of the match . " Much the same thing happened at the ames in Antwerp in 1920 , when the owd of Belgian spectators became weary of the continual American victories in track and field and the continual hoisting of the American flag to the top of the pole as a symbol of our triumphs . The report on the Games of that year , in its naive explanation of how we managed to win the fencing events , also gives an insight into the tactics used by some of the athletes of the United States to obtain victory , and may possibly explain our unpopularity at the Olympics . Denmark used epee methods , fought bitterly , and employed all the rough tactics of which they were capable . When the score stood 7 to 3 the United States braced . They found that very little attention was being given to the right of riposte and the conventions of foil fencing made so much of in England and the United States . " Form " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denmark 's savage rushes were met with solid body-checking , and by seizing the attack and adopting the fighting methods of the Danes , the United States won six consecutive bouts . And a very good job , too , you can almost hear the author of this enlightening document say to himself . In other words , anything to win . We must have a victory to show the folks back home , because , alas , Americans worship victories , and some day we shall be asking for money to come over again to these Games that do so much for the promotion of good feeling among the sporting nations of the world . Sometimes one is tempted to wonder whether opinions expressed about the beneficent effects of the Olympics on international relations always coincide with opinions felt . Thus , Mr. Edward L. Farrell , one of the assistant track and field coaches and not one of the least capable , says bluntly in his report upon the last Olympics : Colonel Thompson in his public speeches said , " It is not so much the winning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . " Very good ; but yet I overheard Colonel Thompson bewail the fact that we lost the one-hundred-meter run and the Marathon . In my opinion he was holding the coaches responsible . That the Olympics are a great international gathering of the best athletic stars of the entire world no one can deny ; that they are productive of keen competition , new records , immense crowds , profitable weeks for the hotel-keepers and shop-owners of the city in which they are held , no one will for a moment question . But that they have succeeded in becoming a beneficial force in the spreading of peace and good will throughout the world , or that they bring together the various competitors in friendly social intercourse is not so certain . For , as Mr. George Trevor of the New York Sun said recently , in what close observers will agree to be a conservative statement : " The history of the Olympic Games since their arrival in 1896 has been marked by sporadic dissension , bickering , heartburning , and one or two old-fashioned rows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline , when the professional athlete superseded the amateur , the winning of first places became a business for which intensive preparation was necessary . Galen tells us something of the severe course of training the contestants underwent for nearly ten months before the Games started ; it included special dieting , gymnastics , massage , breathing exercises , and other exercises for runners , wrestlers , boxers , and weight men . Indeed , the similarity between the modern and ancient methods is sometimes amazing . As we have developed a great system of try-outs held all over this country for places upon the American Olympic teams , so in ancient days the Isthmian and Pan-Hellenic Games fulfilled exactly the same function for the Games at Olympia . We are even told that the athletes of 200 B.C. were forbidden at meals to discuss anything but the lightest topics for fear that headache and dyspepsia might be produced by the mental strain . This custom has carried over to the present time , and prevails , so we are informed by those who have firsthand knowledge , at our university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keeping with the wishes of Baron de Coubertin or the ideal spirit of the Olympic Games than the American system of training would be difficult to imagine . What is the purpose of training tables , managers , trainers , try-outs , practice on shipboard , shutting up athletes in remote villages while the contests are going on , and all the rest of the system built up by our professional athletic directors at present ? Simply the desire to iliac ( American competitors in the field in the pink of condition , to insure by ever3 possible means a string of victories Now this intense training , this stressing of the wish for victory , is one of th. things which many observers believe i tending to destroy the Games as it ha obviously destroyed their aim and thei purpose . Any informality , any levity any suggestion of a friendly and ope : spirit in the preparation for the Game is frowned upon , with the obvious resul that the atmosphere becomes so charge that one might be excused for thinkin the American forces were going int battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is no mere figui of speech , as one would doubtless di cover if one could see the games from tl inside . As it is , one of our assistat track coaches in the last Olympics al mitted that his duties consisted " scouting the teams of other nations Shades of the God of American Footba Who can say after this that we are n an efficient nation in sport ? Victory ! That 's the ideal of o teams . Win . Come in first . T ) or stop to bother about friendly intercom . with the athletes of other lands . did n't come to Amsterdam for tip As another coach expressed hims after the 1924 Olympics , we should ma " the winning of games the real and or incentive within the realms of dec ? sportsmanship and curtail to a minims the social functions . " No one can deny that this incentive prevailed at Paris in 1924 . The American athletes were lodged in the little village of Rocquencourt nine miles from the scene of the Games , in frame shacks and huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men away - from the temptations of Paris . " A laudable desire but one carried rather to excess in the selection of so inconvenient and uncomfortable a place . To practice , the men were obliged to travel over rough roads for two hours by motor bus . Frequently during the actual contests they got back so late at night that no Food was provided for them at the camp . Naturally under such conditions the reaction on both men and women runners and swimmers was unfavorable ; indeed , it could hardly have been otherwise . Long , monotonous evenings in a lismal cantonment ? that was what the aeads of the organization thought neecsiary to keep the athletes " trained . " ) ne coach , even after this , had the temerty to recommend that in future a special oixialittee of non-athletes he selected to . epresent the United States at all social unctions . It is easy to understand the amazenent of the British team who , at the ime our men were living like prisoners , seorted back and forth to the Games in . uto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living a normal fe in a hotel on the outskirts of the ity . One can also imagine the British aking wine or ale with their meals , cooking a pipe or two after dinner , seeig an occasional show if they so desired , nd acting more like normal human eings than is consistent with the best rm in American training circles . Very kely our trainers and executives were locked at this attitude of license in port . Can they not point with pride ) the large number of victories won by merican athletes and the small number on by the British ? Very likely also , Le British might retort , " What of it ? " et they would be greeted with derision they ventured mildly to suggest thattheir attitude toward sport was closer to the true Olympic ideal than that of the American machine with its trainers , coaches , managers , and other supernumeraries so necessary to the efficient twentieth-century athlete . This summer it would appear that the business of serious training is to be carried to a still further extreme . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New York Evening Post of April 11 , 1928 , our team was to assemble at Hoboken on July 11th ( after the final try-outs in the Harvard Stadium on July 6th and 7th ) . The SS . President Roosevelt was to sail on the 11th , the entire boat having been chartered for the American Olympic Team , officials , and camp followers . Once on hoard this floating prison , the athletes were not to leave it , except for the brief moments when they were to be unleashed for competitive purposes , until their return late in August . Unless this preliminary plan is altered -- and as I write at the end of May it is still unchanged -- the athletes are to remain constantly under the eagle eye of the leaders of the American Olympic Expeditionary Forces for a period of seven to eight weeks . Thus at Amsterdam while the games are in progress it is planned to transport these unhappy warriors each morning to the scene of their labors and , once the daily stint is over , they are to be rushed back aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of a period of five or six weeks ? the Games last until well into the middle of August ? one can easily imagine how much love of sport for the sake of sport will remain in these three hundred and twenty-six young men and women who have been cooped up like performing animals in a zoo . Dr. James J. Walsh , who besides being eminent in his profession is a close student of modern athletics and was at one time a competitor in college sports himself , said recently : We carry this training business to an absurd length . Of course this is what gets the men so keyed up that thy readily break down and go stale . We hear about men weeping over the loss of a game , and scenes of this kind are described as if they represented heroics instead of hysterics . Surely this is pushing the cult of the trivial to the last degree . IV Was Paavo Nurmi , the Finnish distance runner , a professional ? If so , why ? Did Charles Hoff , the Norwegian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete in the present Olympic Games , receive money for entering in our amateur track meets ? When Charles Paddock , the sprinter , comes east to engage in a track meet , does he pay his own way ? And if not , does that make him a professional ? Just what is the reason why amateur athletes hire managers as theatrical stars and movie actresses do ? And what function exactly do these managers fulfill for the amateur athletes in question ? Anyone able to answer these problems with any degree of accuracy would go a long way toward solving the great amateur-professional issue which has troubled the world since the days of the Olympics of Sparta . To decide just when the Olympics of old began to decline is a difficult problem ; even classical scholars do not try to fix the date precisely . But it is certain that when the Games began the winners at Olympia ? indeed all the contestants ? were men of " high social quality , " men who frequently held office in their native cities . Their victories were typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were looked up to on every hand . But about the time of Plato we begin to hear of the first professional , a man who abandoned all other occupations and " professed " the business of devoting himself to the Olympic Games . Interest then slowly but steadily declined . The fine and cultivated men who had seen a noble ideal in the Games found this ideal no longer being adhered to . The spectators who cameto see them as a magnificent spectacle discovered that the competitors thought only of the rewards to be obtained , and had but little interest in the towns they happened to represent . Corruption of athletes crept in ; at one of the Isthmian Games , Philostratus tells of a victory bought for the sum of three thousand drachmae , and of wealthy communities contributing to bribery funds . The end of these sacred festivals was , of course , in sight once these practices began . Professionalism has bored its way into the modern Olympics in a much shorter time . Its presence became clear this past winter when the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very center and focus and shrine of international purity in sport , " as Sir Theodore Cook so eloquently puts it , declared that it would sanction " broken time " in football . This expression simply means that when a player gives up a job to compete in the Olympics he shall be paid by the authorities of the Games his salary for such time as he is playing , in order that he may lose nothing financially by his absence from work . This worthy idea , carried to its logics : conclusion in other sports , would throw open the games to everyone , amateur and professional alike , and would , o. course , mean the eventual disappearance of the amateur athlete with everything that be has represented . The Englisl Football Association protested vigor ously at such a ruling , and has firml : refused to send a team to Amsterdam thi summer ; but the harm has been don with the repudiation of the principle o amateur sport which underlay the re institution of the Games by Baron d Coubertin in 1896 . The editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport. , predicts or rathe suggests in a recent article the secessio of England and the United State : " those countries which value pure amm teurism , " from the Olympic Games i the near future and a meeting betwee them after the pattern of the Olympic THE OLYMPIC GAMES 3l1 One would like to believe , as he points out , that amateurism is valued and appreciated in the United States at its true worth ; but little incidents such as the following cause one to wonder . As I have already indicated , the status of many of our leading track and field athletes is somewhat uncertain . Are they amateurs or professionals That , no one seems able to decide ; but a significant announcement on the subject came recently from such an amateur body as the Illinois Athletic Club of Chicago , which stated publicly that it was going to cut down its staff of amateur athletes because they cost too much money ! Commenting on this amazing declaration , the sporting editor of the Chicago Tribune , Don Maxwell , said , " The very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the premise that the public is simple-minded enough to believe that our young men are willing to go from Chicago to New York and run their heads off for the pleasure of making the trip . Some of them may be . I ioubt it of many . " Without wishing to show as much ) rutal skepticism as Mr. Maxwell retarding the standards of our principal tmateur athletes , I think it can hardly ) e denied that on the Continent , at any ' ate , there is hardly the slightest concepion of what an amateur sportsman is , ior any keen intention or desire to help thletes live up to the spirit of the rule the Olympic Games . The successful . gitation for " broken time " showed his only too clearly . Many of the fading French tennis players not only aake a living out of lawn tennis and constantly violate the amateur ruling rider the eyes of their officials ? perhaps not extraordinary occurrence , for it has , ern known to happen in other landsut see no harm in what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne ventures to question their athletic itegrity . And just as professionalism reeping into the Olympics of old foreiadowed their eventual abandonment , ) professionalism creeping into themodern Games through Continental sources may be the beginning of the end . Dr. R. Tait McKenzie of the University of Pennsylvania , who accompanied our last Olympic team abroad , said in his report to the National Collegiate Athletic Association : Another impression I got was the vagueness in the minds of a good many European competitors and committees of the distinction between the amateur and the professional . I remember going out with a group to a military school and speaking to some of the instructors there ; it was taken for granted that they should represent the nation . I believe that such is a very general impression through a good many European countries . . . ? Of course , if that feeling grows instead of dwindling , it means that our amateur athletics will not progress as they should , because we all know that the amateur and the professional competition can not mix , never have mixed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the true amateur competition . It is inevitable . V The first of the series of modern Olympics was held in a Stadium erected outside the city of Athens , partly by the Greek government and partly by private subscription . It was an informal affair compared with the complex and highly organized system of events now being run off at Amsterdam some thirty-two years later . In those Olympics of 1896 the vital spirit of the Games of old was faithfully embodied . Historians with a cynical turn of mind might observe that lack of money prevented anything else . What a difference between those Games at Athens and the gigantic carnival at Amsterdam ! Instead of a small army of many thousands of competitors from fifty nations all over the world which are competing to-day , there were less than a thousand athletes in action at Athens , and of this number four hundred were Greek . Instead of being concentrated in camps and on boats like prisoners of war , the entire assemblage lived simply and modestly together in a few schoolhouses thrown open by the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toward one another was in direct contrast to that of the pampered athletic stars of the present day . At the Olympics of 19Q0 in Antwerp , American competitors , housed by the Belgian government in schoolhouses , openly revolted at such " conditions , " and one of the coaches of the team of 1924 attributed the poor showing of some of his athletes to the fact that the food was poor , stating that " you could not get an egg cooked the way an athlete wanted it , " and that they " ran out of shredded wheat and corn flakes . " A serious matter , this , to those who engage in the serious business of Olympic competition nowadays . The Olympic Games lost . ( or nearly lost ) for lack of shredded wheat and corn flakes ! Except for what was contributed toward the building of the Stadium , there were no government grants to those early Olympics for the good reason that the Greek Treasury had no money to grant ; but if the Games were much more haphazard and informal than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truer success . Officially , the French won the majority of prizes , although thirty-two Americans ? a modest team compared with the three hundred and twenty-six athletes plus their official retinue who are making the trip this summer to Amsterdam ? ran away with the track and field events . As showing how casual the proceedings were , it is worth noting that the discus throw at Athens was won by Garett , an American who had never seen a discus until he reached Greece . Trainers , coaches , managers , assistant managers , assistant coaches , team chefs , attendants , rubbers , chaperons , nurses , doctors , officials , newspapermen , and all the rest of the great army who nowadays accompany our athletes abroad were totally lacking when this little body of athletic pioneers ventured across at the request of Baron de Coubertin to compete in thisathletic revival in 1896 . Just what their expenses were is a little hard to discover at this late date ; possibly no one kept an accurate report to present to His Excellency the President of The - United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of running the Games was less than a quarter of a million dollars Now it is estimated that the Americar team in Amsterdam will spend an Olympic Fund of something like four hundrec thousand dollars before returning to these shores . An expensive victory ! As the Games of old increased in im portance it was observed that many nevi events were added to the original num ber of exercises . At the outset all cere monies and contests took place between dawn and dusk on a summer 's day , the first strictly athletic contest as we under stand it being what would be called th two-hundred-meter run , for it consistel in a sprint the length of the Stadium which was approximately two hundro and thirty yards Iong . Later a doubt sprint was added ; in the seventeent Olympiad was also added the long cours of seven times around the Stadium , th forerunner of our modern distance event : Then came the Pentathlon , in th twenty-third Olympiad the boxing , an later the Pancratium in which boxing an wrestling were combined . Curiousl enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attention of the nation at large , were least a symptom of the decline of tl Olympics of old . At the very tin when new extraneous contests wei added ? contests in which the majority of the people had little interest ? tl Games began to lose their hold on tl public imagination . Those who try to account for the lo of spontaneous enthusiasm for tl modern Games attribute it partially the fact that there are too many Olymp competitions in which only a small nur ber of people or only a few nationaliti axe interested . At present the Gam start officially in the month of Februa : with winter sports in French Switzerlai at Chamonix . Just why there should be winter sports in Olympic competitions , sports in which nations in South America and the East and even European countries like Portugal , Spain , Roumania , and Bulgaria have little interest , has never been explained ; but that these contests held in French Savoie are a splendid advertisement for the local hotel industry no one can very well deny . the Olympic Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them !

Los Angeles Knows How ! " We are told that the chariot races in he ancient Olympics were added to make sure of the attendance of the , ealthy people who cared for this kind of port . New events were added to our modern Games for similar reasons . The wedes and Norwegians do not care overmuch for the track and field events be%use they have few runners and jump.s ? Very well , let us add winter sports m the official list . The South Amerimils never saw a ski or a bob-sled ? All ght , let us get up a competition in soccer iotball , in which they excel .

There is grave doubt as to whether , in the manner in which they are conducted at present , they contribute anything toward the improvement of international relations ; it is certain that they contain too much insistence on training for victory at the sacrifice of natural friendliness and good sportsmanship ; that there is about them a great deal of unnecessary ballyhoo and a good deal of money wasted ; and that there is too frantic an attempt to sustain popular enthusiasm by adding in substance what has been lost in spirit .
