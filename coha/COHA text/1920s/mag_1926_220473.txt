During the two decades of his adolescence and manhood there have been persistent rumors that he may marry . Why not ?

" My country , " he declares , " must not be put to the vast expense of a coronation . . . . " <P> Why not ? Coronations do not come so very dear . Subtle ex-Tsar Ferdinand smiles in his beard . He answers no questions . Little Tsar Boris motors with abandon , hunts in picturesque attire , confides to pressmen that he loves birds , flowers , wolfhounds , but no woman-and witless rumors fly . Behind the iridescent screen of these puerilities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in welcome obscurity , continues to be a force which statesmen do not neglect to recognize .
