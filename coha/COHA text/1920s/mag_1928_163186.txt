At Pawtucket , R. I. , last week a group of cotton manufacturers solemnly watched an oblong bronze plaque uncovered and heard Vice President Robert Amory of the Cotton Textile Institute say : <P> " Today the National Association of Cotton Manufacturers meets here one century after the invention of John Thorp , to honor his memory by dedicating this tablet . We should all solemnly resolve that the industry which John Thorp , more than any other man , made possible , shall not languish , but shall gather renewed energy to the end that the textile industry of New England shall regain the leadership to which it is entitled . " <P> John Thorp 's invention was a ring device for spinning cotton thread from cotton fibre more rapidly and perfectly than any previous machine . Mainly because of it is the present vastness of the world 's textile industries possible . Of 160,000,000 cotton spinning spindles in the world , 100 , - ooo.ooo use the Thorp ring . Very little is known about the inventor . The Ency-clopcedia Britannica mentions him only twice , misspelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles H. Clark , editor of the Textile World , has been zealous &; learned . He solemnly told the cotton men at Pawtucket last week , that : " Thorp was born in 1784 , presumably in Rehoboth , Mass. , the son of Reuben and Hannah ( Bucklin ) Thorp . No records of the date and place of his birth have been located , but entries in the Bibles of his brothers , David and Comfort , agree that at the time of his death , Nov. 15 , 1848 , he was sixty-four years old . For the assumption that he was born in Rehoboth there is the fact that his father and mother were married there and a record showing the birth of his elder brother , David , at Rehoboth , Mass . . . . Thorp died without issue and outlived his wife . . . . He had left no evidence of having been distinguished by any quality excepting great mechanical skill and vision . " Bound to this sadly thin genealogy was a picture . The New York Journal of Commerce reproduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorp , Putative Photograph of Inventor of Ring Spinning Honored at Cotton Manufacturers ' Convention . " No more .
