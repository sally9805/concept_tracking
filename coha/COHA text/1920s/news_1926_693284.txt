txt The situation that has developed in the relations between the United States and Mexico , growing out of the latter 's alleged interference with the internal affairs of Nicaragua , may still further complicate American negotiations with respect to Mexican oil and land laws and possibly result in diplomatic exchanges dealing with the apparent aim of Mexico to extend her sphere of influence into Central America . It was made known at the State Department today that this Government will exercise its good offices in an endeavor to compose political strife in Nicaragua in compliance with the appeal of Adolfo Diaz , new Nicaraguan President , who in a communication transmitted to Washington by Lawrence Dennis .

If , this step fails the United States may intervene by landing marines in Nicaragua , acting in this manner in cooperation with President Diaz in an effort to effect the establishment of a stable Government . It also has been suggested that if the Nicaraguan Liberals turn a deaf ear to the persuasive influences that may be brought to bear by Secretary Kellogg the United States may rat the embargo on shipments of arms to Nicaragua so far as it applies to the newly recognized Government of President Diaz . The United States has strong naval forces in the South which can be quickly impressed into service in case of trouble in Nicaragua requiring action on the part of the United States .

Bolshevist agencies in Mexico are held by American officials to be partly responsible for the present state of . affairs in Nicaragua . That there have been gun-running expeditions between Mexican ports and centres of Nicaraguan revolutionary activity has been substantiated to the satisfaction of this Government .

President Diaz 's Appeal . A summary of President Diaz 's letter to Mr. Dennis made public by the State Department , after referring to Mexican aid of revolutionists and armed intervention in Nicaraguan political affairs , reads : " For these reasons and appreciating the friendly disposition of the United States toward republics and the intentions which your Government has always manifested for the protection of the sovereignty and independence of all the countries of America by morally st pporting legitimate Governments in order to enable them to afford a tranquil field for foreign capital needed for the prosperity of these countries , I apply to you to solicit , with the same good-will with which you have aided Nicaraguan reconciliation , for my Government and in my name the support of the Department of State with a view to reaching a solution in the present crisis and avoiding further hostilities and invasion on the part of the Government of Mexico . " I desire to say to you at the same time that whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State they will meet with the approval of my absolute confidence in the high spirit of justice of the Government of the United States . " Recognition of President Diaz by the United States evoked p. protest today from T. S. Vaca , representative of the Nicaraguan Liberals in Washington , who characterized it as an exemplification of " dollar diplomacy " and in the interest of Waitreet bankers . Mr. Vaca indicated . in his opinion the next step in our relations with Nicaragua would be " armed intervention " in favor of an administration that wanted to sell the national banks and railways to New York bankers . Denial was made that this Government has any official knowledge of a protest reported to have been made by President Green of the American Federation of Labor against this alleged proposed sale on the ground that the stock in the two corporations belonged to the Nicaraguan people . General Chamorro . who is represented as interested in the alleged deal , has no authority , it was asserted , to dispose of it ..        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
