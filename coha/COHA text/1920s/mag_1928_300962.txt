Concerning Faunce <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of Oct. 22 appears an article entitled " Faunce Out . " This contains a farrago of insinuations and trivialities , many of them untrue . For example , Dr. Faunce appreciates a good cigar and keeps a box of one of the best brands always ready to enjoy with his friends . The appointment of Percy Marks was terminated before the publication of The Plastic Age . Neither Chinese nor Negroes are numerous at Brown , although her gates are open to both , and should be so in a land of equal opportunity . Far from being undistinguished in his undergraduate days , Faunce was one of the leading scholars in his class . You ought to know better than to suppose that the degrees of D. D. and LL . D. are conferred for postgraduate work . Instead of merely receiving these honorary degrees from his own university and from a small southern college , as you imply , a casual glance at Who 's Who in America would have informed you that he holds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that of Doctor of Laws from half a dozen institutions . Any competent editor on seeing the article in manuscript would instantly have realized that it must be written by a personal enemy of Dr. Faunce and would at least have consulted one of the many prominent Brown graduates within a mile of your office who could have informed him that the article conveys an inaccurate and wholly inadequate impression of the President of Brown . <P> Inside your front cover are these words : " Cultivated Americans , impatient with cheap sensationalism and windy bias , turn increasingly to publications edited in the historical spirit . These publications , fairdealing , vigorously impartial , devote themselves to the public weal in the sense that they report what they see , serve no masters , fear no groups . " <P> If your magazine is meant to conform to this ideal , the least that you can do is to print an apology for your article of Oct. 22 and tell your readers what has actually been the career of Dr. Faunce at Brown . He came to the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rendered a large portion of the alumni hostile to the new president . Because of his tact , honesty , and faith in the university , the breach was quickly healed . A natural reserve made it difficult for Dr. Faunce at first to enter into the life of the undergraduates , but this defect soon dwindled away because of his genuine desire to share the troubles and aspirations of young men . He has been in office longer than any other college president now living , and he approaches the end of his service honored and loved by all the students who have known him . At the close of his twenty-fifth year and again during his recent illness , large gatherings of the alumni gave enthusiastic expression of their devotion . Nor is he merely the leader of a small university . He has been a prominent and fair-minded exponent of Christian liberalism , and he is one of the very best speakers of our day . Whether he addresses college graduates or businessmen his hearers are stirred by the beauty of his words and the nobility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed by any reader of your article , which is wholly unworthy of the standards which you usually maintain . <P> ZECHARIAH CHAFEE JR . <P> Law School of Harvard University , Cambridge , Mass.
