Two editors of reactionist party newspapers were summoned to appear before the Supreme Court at Leipzig , Saxony , on the charge of conduct prejudicial to the safety of the republic . Both declined to appear or to acknowledge the authority of the court , stating that only a Bavarian court could try Bavarians . <P> Adolph Hitler , Fascist leader , also expects a summons to appear in Leipzig before the Supreme Court . He told his supporters that he would not go and exhorted them " to stand hard as steel by our movement . We wo n't talk . " <P> General Ludendorff inspected several detachments of the Fatherland League troops ( unofficial royalist army ) . After the men had goose-stepped past him , he addressed them : " The time is soon coming when the whole German people will be called on to free our country from the foe , when we can again serve in the good cause of our old ruling house , which we formerly so loyally and honorably served . " <P> The whole Munich press is against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ruhr struggle , the present time is singularly inopportune for provoking an internal struggle . <P> The relative position of General Ludendorff and Hitler in relation to the reactionist movement in Germany is that while the former has his headquarters near Munich , he exercises control over the whole movement throughout Germany . He is the supreme agitator-in-chief of the royalist factions . Hitler is the strong man in Bavaria as leader of the Bavarian Nationals , who are out for a monarchical government ; and he is always in close touch with Ludendorff.
