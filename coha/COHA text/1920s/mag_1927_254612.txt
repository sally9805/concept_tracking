" <P> Mr. Root , aged 81 , spoke to rebuke the U. S. for deserting the League of Nations . Said he : " We have allowed insensate prejudice , camouflaged by futile phrases , to appear , but falsely appear , to represent the true heart of the American people , with all its idealism , with its breadth of human sympathy , with its strong desire that our country should do its share for peace and happiness and noble life in all the world . " <P> Next day , Mr. Root gave his $25,000 check to establish an endowment fund for the magazine Foreign Affairs* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and edited by Professor Archibald Gary Coolidge of Harvard , and Hamilton Fish Armstrong . <P> <P> Inspired by the Wilson Day celebrations , there arose within the nation an anonymous donor with $50,000 .
