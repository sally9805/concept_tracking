MY DEAR HARRISON : I HAVE before me your letter asking advice . You write that you would like to become a teacher of college English , since it would give you the opportunity to make living and real to others the works of the great English masters ; that you would appreciate information which would aid you in accomplishing your desire . To begin with , as a teacher you must have a Master of Arts , in addition to a Bachelor of Arts degree . I should recommend some first-class Eastern or Midwestern university . At a smaller college expenses may be less , but you will work just as hard , and your degree will not have the prestige that one from a large institution conveys . It will cost you approximately $1,000 , an amount you should possess before you start ( borrow it , if necessary ) , since earning your living and studying in the graduate school , as I have found , are entirely incompatible with the best achievement . Then , with your master 's degree , you can probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do n't think that you have begun to mount the ladder of teaching success ; you have not yet reached the first rung . As soon as you are a Master of Arts , your superiors will inform you that you can advance neither professionally nor financially without a doctor-of-philosophy degree . Your money is gone , you reply ; what are you to do ? That is your affair , you are told ; get a Ph.D . or get out . Well , you can attend summer school . All the large universities offer summer courses , and while the instruction is , in most cases , inferior to that of the winter terms , time spent thus is better than time spent in private study ( for you are at least earning credits ) or in doing some uncongenial type of rxierital or vhydical - labor . In the meantime , you must be saving . yolu. /flOrivy. for your " year off , " the year when youwill show that you possess a reading knowledge of French , German , and Latin ; that you have mastered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole range of English and American literature ; and that you are capable of writing , in from 50,000 to 120,000 words , the results of some philological investigation or literary research  --  your thesis . All in all , your Ph.D . will have cost you $6,000 , and your reward will be the title of Assistant Professor of English at a salary of $2,300 . You will be , then , about thirty-five years old . In the meantime , what of your teaching ? What of that yearning to make the great world-writers " real and alive " to the younger generation ? Shakespeare , Wordsworth , Tennyson , and the others will , indeed , furnish mental pabulum , but only for you . In the classroom you will speak of commas and semicolons , of restrictive and non-restrictive clauses , of " so-faults " and of " and-which " constructions . For you are not a teacher of literature ; you are a teacher of composition  --  three to five sections  --  and you will have 100 to 175 300- to 500-word themes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the few far-fetched occasions when you can make a reference to " The Lady of Shalott " or " To a Skylark " or the " Ode on a Grecian Urn . " With the acquisition of your Ph.D. , your composition sections will be cut to two or three , and you will be allowed to offer a course in your beloved Tennyson-Browning-Arnold , if you have made these writers your " field " in the graduate school . You , with your Ph.D. , are now on the first rung of the teaching ladder . After two or three years , you are still in the same position . Why are you not being advanced ? Your superiors will tell you that you are not publishing anything . You immediately write and publish a series of articles dealing with the teaching of English ( articles which pay nothing financially , and which add nothing to , if , indeed , they do not detract from your teaching reputation ) . And you suddenly find within you a certain lyrical vein , which , when mined , gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite beautiful enough to appear in the " paying " magazines , but beautiful enough to be welcomed by the poetry journals that pay in " prizes " and subscriptions . For some reason , you have lost that youthful desire to create short stories , and to finish , perhaps even to begin , the novel you once planned to write . The academic atmosphere is not conducive to creative writing . By the time you have read the weekly average of 40,000 words in student long-hand , by the time you have made your class-preparations and have thought out new plans and methods for revivifying the deadly composition meetings , your mind desires passive recreation in the form of some stimulating reading , not renewed activity in artistic literary creation . Also , the academic life is not the life from which come the great modern masterpieces , or even interesting , readable literary productions . The teacher of literature is experiencing life vicariously , through the eyes and through the words of those who have lived life at first hand and have written of it and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds in the course of a year . All of the teachers of English in this generation who have become successful in writing readable and potentially enduring creative literature could easily be gathered , without danger of overcrowding , in the smoking room of a Pullman car . With your twelve or fifteen educational articles , your twenty or thirty poems , you send in a list of your " publications " to your superiors . And they tell you that still you have not published anything ; that anyone can write articles dealing with teaching problems ( which is true ) , that creative writing in any form , unless it bring national reputation , can not be considered " publishing " in the eyes of the university . You must do research . So , for ten or twelve years you spend from $300 to $600 a year visiting Chicago , Washington , New York , Boston , and London , in order to make use of the library facilities in each city . You write research articles , tracing the definite article " the " through its ramifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy , the day , month , and year on which each of Bacon 's fifty-eight essays was written ; you publish a scholarly monograph on the ablative case in Latin , and announce that you have almost enough material ready for a similar monograph on the Latin ablative absolute . Or , if your field is the nineteenth century , and some one has shown that Godwin influenced Shelley 's ideas to a great extent , you prove that Godwin 's influence on Shelley 's ideas is entirely negligible ; if it is commonly believed that Tennyson was profoundly disturbed by the tendencies of his age , you show , with convincing logic , that it was the tendencies of the age which were profoundly disturbed by Tennyson . And so on . The philological journals are glad to get your research articles and pay you with complimentary copies of the magazine . For the $300 to $600 you spend in the summer doing research , the university increases your salary $100 a year . Your reward is coming at last . By the time you are forty-five or fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,700 or $3,000 . And at fifty or fifty-five , if you have managed to include two or three books in your publications , you are promoted to professor of English , relieved of all composition work , and given a salary of $3,000 or $3,400 . Your life , then , will have been an exceedingly busy one . I do not believe that you can afford to marry . The first years of your teaching you will scarcely earn enough to support yourself and pay your expenses in summer school , in addition to putting aside a few dollars each year for your " year off . " You can not count upon a Sabbatical year , with half-pay , for instructors usually are not accorded Sabbatical privileges , and you can scarcely hope for an assistant professorship before acquiring a Ph.D . Scholarships , fellowships , and loan funds are at best uncertain sources , and often embody undesirable conditions by which the student should not be hampered . Even with your Ph.D . salary , I doubt if there is enough for two people to live comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial position to marry before you are forty or forty-five . By then you may have lost the inclination ; you may feel that you can no longer make the personal adjustments which marriage demands ; or you will have fallen in love so deeply with your mistress , literature , and her child , research , that you will be unable to sacrifice this interest for any one . If you do marry early , you will probably succeed just as well in the end , but the price you will pay for that success will be immeasurably great . " Love , " my married colleagues say , " overcomes all difficulties , " but I often wonder ! Married , you will have to " skimp " twice as much to save half the money that you did before . And wife will have to work bitterly hard , doing her and your washing and ironing , mending and sewing , cooking and housework . And you will groan and curse , impotently , but the authorities above you will answer by saying , do graduate work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies ; there usually are , no matter how carefully a young married couple plans . Then , when you have saved the sum for your year off , if , indeed , you ever do , you will go to the graduate school , and live for a year or more , with your wife , and a baby or two , in a couple of rooms which must serve as kitchen , dining-room , bedroom , nursery , study , and library . Unmarried , you will be able to maintain yourself , modestly but without danger of starvation ; you will be able to do some traveling , including , perhaps , two or three trips to the Continent and to England , the country whose literature you teach ; you will be able to enjoy occasionally  --  and from orchestra seats  --  the theater , the opera , and music ; you will be able to build up a library without feeling that you are robbing your children of a possible college education . Perhaps I am wrong on all this ; perhaps marriage , a loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all sacrifices made . I do not know . I have never felt that I was in a position to marry and find out . You are thinking that I have painted only the dark side of teaching college English , that there must be a bright side . There are , indeed , certain advantages . Your hours of work are virtually your own ; you are not under an eight-to-five regime ; you can postpone work to the evening , to the next day , sometimes for several days . You have leisure for reading , perhaps the most desirable advantage of the situation , and leisure for writing if you can overcome the inertia imposed by enervating academic conditions . Sometimes , but not often , your leisure is destroyed by some additional work imposed by the university which even a stupid stenographer could do just as well . You are constantly in contact with minds on the threshold of developing , minds seeking for satisfactory nourishment , and one of the teacher 's great personal satisfactions is his feeling , rightly or wrongly , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When your years of composition apprenticeship are ended , and you begin to teach the authors near to your heart , this satisfaction is infinitely increased . Also , the teacher who conforms to the " system " and makes research the one great lasting reality of his life finds after a certain span of years that he has developed a genuine enthusiasm for his work ; that the search for new truths or old truths reinterpreted , as he phrases it , is worth a man 's best years . And , quite recently , there have arisen two factors , already in force in a number of our larger universities , which will tend more and more to alleviate the financial strain under which a teacher works . One is the " permanency of tenure " rule , by which a teacher , if he shows promise of excellent teaching ability , genuine scholarship , and productive research , is , at the end of a certain period of years , usually four or five , given a permanent contract with his university . If , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two qualities ( the Ph.D. , after all , is a training for research , not a training for teaching ) , he is politely discouraged , and , if this has no effect , he is impolitely discharged . More important than permanency of tenure are old-age pensions . A small percentage of the teacher 's salary is withheld annually , and an equal sum is added by the university ; then , when theteacher reaches the age of 65 , he is retired , and is given a certain sum each year , sufficient for the necessities of existence . This old-age pension idea suggests two interesting points of view : first , that universities realize teachers are not paid sufficiently to enable them to make their own adequate provision for old age ; and , second , that a widely current belief is true , namely , that teachers , with ministers , are the most impractical and gullible of men , and therefore unable to save money . These , then , seem to me the advantages and disadvantages of teaching colleee English . These seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rewards one receives for the service . They seem to me to be true of the average college or university . There will be exceptions , of course , more desirable conditions prevailing in some places , where teaching conditions and salaries are especially good , less desirable conditions prevailing in other places . But no one , unless financially independent , should enter the field of college English , without a reservoir of enthusiasm and energy which can supply a broadly flowing river for thirty years . Your desire to become a college teacher of English is an honest and a laudable one . But my best advice to you , present conditions considered , is Don't.
