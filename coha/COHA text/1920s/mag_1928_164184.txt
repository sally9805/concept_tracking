THE WITHERED ROOT-Rhys Davies-Holt ( $2.50 ) . " You Welsh ! A race of mystical poets who have gone awry in some way . " But this judgment by a cynical agnostic had no dampening effect on Reuben 's religious fervor . Born of a stoic collier and a bibacious mother who starved the boy for affection , he was a child of curious , conflicting emotion . Gleefully he chopped up frogs and roasted mice alive ; demurely he followed his father to church , and gradually religion won out-he was hypnotized , obsessed . Evenings , he pored over the Bible , sweated to convert his friend the agnostic . And evenings , there was Eirwen , sensuous , beautiful , alluring . Reuben 's quick passions were aroused and tormented , but another self damned them as unholy . Meanwhile his gift of oratory won him the leadership of a sect of fanatics who confessed , screamed , rolled in mystic joy . In a country-wide revival his converts rivalled Elmer Gantry 's in emotional displays , but his own motive and reaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in bitter propaganda . Author Davies has crudities , of technique , but not of sympathy . A difficult undertaking , this analysis of the tortures of a sensitive man , harassed by women , consumed by religious mania , ends wretchedly when Reuben finds both lacking .
