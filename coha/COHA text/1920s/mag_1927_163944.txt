Lies in their more delicate shadings were considered last week by the Bishop of Southwell , addressing teachers at Nottingham , England . " I should be prepared , " said he , " to exonerate a person who tells a lie to save an innocent life . . . just as I should uphold a starving man who stole food to keep himself alive . " Commentators listed in the Bishop 's support Victor Hugo , whose nun in Les Miserable- ; told with the author 's approval her first lie , for hounded Jean Valjean . Otherside supporters recalled famed Presbyterian evangelist Robert Elliott Speer 's sermon The Margin of Safety , in which , admitting that the dividing line between Evil and Good is often hard to determine , he held that therefore good Christians would keep well on the side of good .
