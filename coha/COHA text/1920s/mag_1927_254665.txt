A MAN COULD STAND UP-Ford Madox Ford-A . &; C. Boni ( $2.50 ) . Author Ford 's three-volume metaphor for what the War did to the presumable core of England is herewith completed . There are deep scars , wrought by much cleaving to duty . The scene is littered with social and personal wreckage . But the core survives . <P> It is for an oldtime , blundering , self-crucifying British individualism ; for an egotism whose one sinew is self-respect , that Author Ford 's central figure stands . When the War came , Christopher Tietjens of Groby , ponderous , gentle , clumsy , omniscient , was already under the triply complicated strain of an abnormally faithless wife , financial difficulties and his love for Valentine Wannop , a young person of much head and spirit . In Some Do Not ( 1924 ) he resisted his need for Valentine as his mistress despite the facts that divorce from his Catholic wife was impossible ; that Valentine was his perfect complement , and knew it ; and that he was off for the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very special and ingenious kind of hell in a base camp , where his wife , Sylvia , and scandal about himself and Valentine , turned up to torment him and to hamper his official conduct as not even red tape and a thousand childish soldiers could have done . His maddening integrity , that alone , was the factor that saved a bad local situation and led indirectly to the establishment of a Single Command . <P> This final book of the trilogy shows the triumph of the Single Command , the end of the War . Tietjens is in it to the finish , in very real and dismal front trenches where a man can not stand up . When it is over he stands up , physically and spiritually . He foregoes revenge upon unjust superior officers , lays aside the battered taboos of the civilization he has helped preserve , returns to London , poverty and Valentine . <P> The Significance of Author Ford 's work , aside from its having established him as never before in the forefront of contemporary writers , is its relentless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more than hinted at by lesser men . The chronicle unfolds itself , chiefly through the disordered thought currents and abrupt conversations of the characters , with all the perplexing yet inevitable indirection of actual life . The versatility and incessant activity of Tietjen 's mind-he is a mathematician , linguist and poet as well as a husband , lover , officer , sociologist and human being - do not contribute immediate lucidity to events which the reader must follow subjectively , by the impressionist method . A crucial telephone talk may last several chapters , the words actually spoken falling pages apart while numerous causes , consequences and chunks of mental and emotional background are tracked down in hurried asides . Yet such episodes , and much apparently meaningless detail-such as a sonnet composed on a challenge in two and one-half minutes - come into focus sooner or later . The total effect is vivid , clear and all the stronger for its slow fusing .
