Twelve tired-eyed jurors , taut and nervous , filed solemnly into the District of Columbia Supreme Court room one morning last week after a day and a night 's deliberation . A young bank teller , as foreman , cleared his throat huskily , read from a blue paper in his shaky hand : " Guilty , with a recommendation to the mercy of the court . " <P> That statement convicted Albert Bacon Fall , onetime ( 1921-23 ) Secretary of the Interior , of bribery . It branded him as the first felon in a President 's Cabinet in U. S. history . It made him liable to a three-year prison sentence , a $300,000 fine. * It changed the $100,000 in cash sent Fall in a little black bag by Oilman Edward Laurence Doheny from an innocent " loan " between old friends to a corrupt and criminal payment to influence the Secretary of the Interior to lease U. S. Naval Oil Reserve No. 1 at Elk Hills . Cal. , to Doheny 's Pan-American Petroleum Co . It insured the trial of Doheny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first conviction to be obtained by the U. S. on direct evidence of the naval oil scandals ( 1921-23 ) , produced a strange courtroom scene . Defendant Fall , seriously ill with bronchial pneumonia , sat in a green Morris chair , wrapped in an automobile robe , his black New Mexican sombrero in his lap . His eyes were stunned , blankly staring at the verdict . Down his white , sunken cheek rolled a teardrop , to be kissed away by his sobbing wife . Other women present moaned and groaned hysterically . Robust cowpunchers and ranchers bent their heads in sorrow for their friend . Oilman Doheny , crimson with rage and chagrin , shook his fist at the bench and screamed : " That damned court- . " Mark Thompson , Fall attorney , went white and limp , slumped to the floor , lay there unconscious for ten minutes before physicians could revive him . Bending over him was Frank Hogan , chief defense counsel , ashy white with disappointment . Cried Lawyer Hogan : " Tell that damned jury to come back here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the jurors had followed the case as a Fall sympathizer . After the verdict she chased violently after her husband to a public park where he was being photographed . " You miserable rat ! " she screamed . <P> <P> " Come here where I can get my hands on you ! " <P> The facts on which Fall was tried were agreed on both sides . Fall and Doheny , gold prospectors together in the old West , had been friends for 43 years . Doheny had approached Fall , as Secretary of the Interior , for an oil lease . At the peak of negotiations-Nov. 30 , 1921-he had sent Fall $100,000 in cash by his son . Four months later Doheny 's oil company had the Elk Hills lease from which it expected to make $100,000,000 . Two years ago a jury tried Fall and Doheny on practically the same evidence for conspiracy to defraud the U. S. That jury acquitted them . This time the jury had to judge , independent of Doheny , Fall 's intent in receiving this cash . It found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a fortnight the jury of eight men and four women had heard evidence , listened to argument . Fall had collapsed at the beginning of the trial , had been pronounced a dangerously ill man by impartial doctors but , at his insistence , the trial had gone on ( TIME , Oct. 21 ) .
