AGREAT many rather hopeful things have been happening lately . Tunney is hack  --  which gives a kind of stability to the country again ; Ford has raised wages to seven di-41am a day , which somehow adds to the prestige of motoring ; science has perfected the telephone so it is possible to speak with somebody on the Leviathan provided the deck steward can locate your party and you can think of anything to say ; 1Vall Street has cot its Christmas bonuses sharply , alleviating a tense condition in other industries whose employees were getting more and more jealous every Yuletide ; the city has been through one really good snowfall , in which thousands of people experienced , for a brief hour or two , the hallowed feeling of peace that comes from white roofs and blurry towers ; President Hoover has taken hold of the nation 's business , so that all that remains is for the people to figure out a way to recuperate their individual losses ; and Jeritza , at the Metropolitan , has been struck by at wooden knife so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addict ) , mia California , " which temporarily , at least , revitalized grand opera and gave it a new burst of speed . All in all , the country is in pretty good shape to lace the most trying period of the whole calendar year , Christmas , when just the mere business of living gracefully and courageously takes all a man 's time and part of his wife 's . WHATEWHATEVER else we skip during VER the week , we never fail to read the classified ads in the Nation . Across that page walk the twin shadowy forms , life and love , arm in arm , from fireside apartment that needs another cultured occupant to health farm that combines ski-jumping with hook criticism and fresh country vegetables . Last week we were particularly captured by the ad of " two intelligent but not studious young college men . " They were , they confessed , attractive and athletic , but not desirous of pursuing the ordinary means of livelihood . They wanted adventure  --  wanted it so badly they were willing to advertise for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps we 're wrong , but it seems to us that a great change has come over adventure recently : many of the paths of adventurous living have been surfaced with concrete , and mapped . No matter where a young man might turn , he would find fresh tracks in the dust  --  the marks of Richard Halliburton 's hoots ; and he would find signposts pointing down side-roads to publishing houses . The paths of glory still lead but to the grave , but they lead first to the Savoy-Plaza ; there one finds Halliburton , the snows of Popocateperl still clinging to his coatsleeve , the waters of the Panama Canal still gathered in little beads on his eyelashes , a young adventurer home on schedule , surrounded by his memories , his little sandwiches , and his book-chat ladies .

" Almost in tears , he went on to say that he realized what pain he was causing persons who were within earshot of his rivets ? " a most unwelcome distraction , " he deftly put it . Such politeness , Corning from the president of a bank , gives us , even more than rivets , a headache . Furthermore , it fails to inspire our confidence , which is the duty of every bank president in writing even the shortest note . If we were working in the noisy financial district , we 'd want a completely forthright letter from Mr. Ward , approximately as follows : " Dear Neighbor  --  Maybe you 've heard the noise we 're making over here . If you do n't like it , you know what you can stuff in your ears !

Love and Marriage AFEW nights ago Janssen 's Hofbrau Orchestra broadcast a " musical love story . " It told , in songs , the courtship and marriage of a young couple . Thus it began with " A Boy , a Girl , and the Moon " and continued through " You 're My One Girl " and a lot of other love numbers . In the fear that the vast radio audience might not get the idea , the announcer now and again clarified the situation with a few remarks such as " and after the passing of time , the boy is ready for ' congratulations . ' " This was followed by the " Wedding March " and " I Love You More Than Anyone Else , " or something of the sort . At the end of the program , still thinking that the musical interpretation of the boy and girl 's life might need a little clearing up , the announcer said , " You have just heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now three  --  assisted by Frank Cornwall and his orchestra .

He used to he in the furniture business in Brooklyn . He sold this out , and for a few years dealt in real estate , mortgages , and silver polish . He then retired from business , although under forty , and removed to Flushing , where he spent most of his time at golf . One day , while on the links , he pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and found all his smokes broken . He decided then and there to invent a device to prevent this . For many evenings during the following months he worked in a mechanic 's shop near his home , and eventually ht emerged with an invention which , being taken up by the big cigar-store chains , paid him more in royalties in the month of November than he ever made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITEM for the Subway Sun : On the last visit of Mr. Calvin Coolidge to the city , or the last we have heard about , he had lunch with Mr. Hearst at the latter 's place in Riverside Drive . Another guest was Mr. Ray Long , Mr. Coolidge 's publisher . After the repast Mr. Long , who had his limousine with him , offered to take Mr. Coolidge to wherever he was going . " No thanks , " said the ex-President . " I think I 'll make better time in the subway . " And off he went to the subway . DECEMBER I 4 , 19 2 9 Speaking of Mr. Hearst , we have heard another story about his great estate at San Simeon , California  --  the one with twenty miles or so of ocean front , where something big is always going on . ( It is said , by the way , that the publisher does not intend to have work on it completed , being superstitious on that point  --  feels that if the work stopped , he would stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built and Mr. Hearst learned that , to make way for this , a fine old oak tree must come down . He demurred . He was sentimental about the oak  --  his father 's favorite seat had been under its shade . Tree surgeons were called in . They probed around and reported that the roots had spread so far that the tree could never be moved . Mr. Hearst insisted . The tree surgeons finally said they would try it if they could have the help of some construction engineers . The best engineers available were called in . It was an enormous operation that followed ; trenches were dug , the tree was enclosed in a wide circle of cement and finally , with derricks and cranes , the entire mass  --  tree , roots , soil , and cement ; the whole weighing tons was moved to the top of a hill . At the end , the tree surgeons presented , fearfully , their bill . It was for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars . Mr. Hearst glanced at it and smiled .

In the end , he invariably dismisses the pressmen with the benediction " God Hess you , " and they walk away in a mild fervor . The only time the ritual ever lacked this solemn spiritual touch was when Mr. Morgan came back on the Olympic recently after the bears had the situation in hand down in Wall Street . There was no blessing . Bonded T " president of a large building corporation received a most welcome visitor one day lately , the former cashier of the firm , who had absconded four years ago with seven thousand dollars of the company 's money . He had been under bond , of course . The bonding company had paid the loss , and had immediately started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him until now  --  and here he was back of his own accord , to pay the money he had stolen ! The president was pleased at the return of the money . He was also , naturally , curious to learn how his ex-cashier had managed to elude the pursuit of the bonding company so long . It then came out that the man had been working all thetime in the fraud department of the bonding company , and under his own name , too . This Year 's Prodigy DGGIERO Ricci , the latest child violinist , did not spring full-blown into a family of carpenters or leatherbelting makers . His father has taught music and is a wizard on the trombone . Ruggiero has five or six brothers and sisters and they all play some instrument o r other . Several years ago the Riccis formed a family orchestra , for their own pleasure , to which Ruggiero w a s admitted when he was six . He soon became the leader . His father could tell genius when he heard it , so he rushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco . The boy calmly , but with the right ardor , played " The Bluebells of Scotland " for Mr. Persinger , and his career began right there . Now he lives with Persinger 's assistant , Beth Lackey , in 227th Street . She teaches him , under Persinger 's supervision , and is his legal guardian also . The rest of the family , except a younger brother , Giorgio , who is with him , are still in California . Ruggiero does n't get lonesome ; he has Giorgio to argue with , go bicycling with ( his favorite fun ) , and attend concerts with . Giorgio is a gifted violinist himself  --  won a gold m c dal in San Francisco j us t before he came here . The two boys never talk music , but Ruggiero will tell you , if he knows you well enough , that he admires Beethoven and hates jazz . He would rather talk about history , or algebra , which he looks fondly forward to studying , although he does n't know what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy has never been permitted to read the resounding praises of his talent , but is only shown unfavorable reviews , which are rare . He has his own ideas about musical interpretation , and is not impressed by criticism , however . Once Persinger , during a lesson prior to a recital , told young Ricci that he played a certain passage too slowly . That evening , at the ... concert , the lad played it with such incredible rapidity that Persinger , who was accompanying him , could n't keep tip . Ricci has come over pretty much the same path as Yehudi They made their debut in the same hall in San Francisco . Ricci won a memorial scholarship out there in a Christmas Eve contest against a score or more musicians of all ages . This was in 1926 ; he also won it the next year . Four or five years ago Yehudi won the same medal  --  and got it again the following year. - Ricci has an accent peculiarly his own  --  it is n't Italian , because he started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Californian , although he was born and raised there ; it 's just his own . He clips his words . He has been called a chubby-checked , normal , romping boy , but he really is n't that simple . His eyes , deep-set and black , have a maturity of expression unusual in a child . His vocabulary is about what you would expect from it child of nine . Dernier Cr ; A MALE shopper in one of the de- partment stores came upon a large display of green paper meant for doing up Christmas bundles and decorated with trios of silver-tinted angels  --  one picking at a banjo , another just curling up for a nap , the third looking a bit cock-eyed . " Funny-looking angels , are n't they ? " he ventured to the salesgirl with a laugh . Her reply was in a tone of pitying disdain . " These a r e French angels , " she said , " imported .

We tried it last week , but what with Christmas coming on , we simply could n't give it the time required . The Kipling dinner plates are a rare item , and there is a story about them . Years ago , when Rudyard Kipling first visited America , he stopped at the house of some friends whose daughter had a hobby , pottery-making . During his visit the girl made a set of six plates , and on each the famous author inscribed a stanza of verse . One was to an apple , another to a pear , another to a peach , and so nn . On the back of each plate he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then glazed the plates and kept them until recently , when she sold them . She swore everybody to secrecy about her identity , and the gentleman who bought the plates promised never to tell that he has them . One man in on the secret is Ronald MacDonald , the bookbinder . He bound the six plates  --  made a book of them  --  and he considers it the most difficult commission he ever undertook . The unknown owner wanted them bound , as a precaution against breakage and also because he felt that anything by Kipling , even a dish , should he between covers . Mr. MacDonald worked out his problem by building up layers of paper to a thickness greater than that of the plate , then hollowing nut the centre and setting the plate in . Each plate made a leaf , and the thickness of the volume , including foreword , is four inches . It cost twenty-five hundred dollars , which is as nothing compared to the value of the plates themselves . All we know is that the volume belongs to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean Mr. William B. Osgood Field , of this city , or Mr. E. A. Ballard , of Philadelphia , or Captain Chandler , of Washington  --  probably the three most eminent Kiplingers . Mr. MacDonald , incidentally , recently had another interesting task  --  making a tight little leather case to protect the manuscript of " Alice in Wonderland " for which Mr. Eldridge Johnson paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . Its novelty is that it is lined with asbestos . Defeat A CERTAIN lady who lives in Park Avenue ( and if the Park Avenue Association does n't think this happened we are prepared with name , address , and date ) never lets expense matter in her entertainments . She has had expensive bands , troupes of Arabs , a whole theatrical chorus , trained seals , and a lot of other organizations in for the amusement of her guests at various times . This season someone told her of a string quartet that had become pretty popular . She liked the sound of the group 's name , or something , and determined to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had her secretary telephone about it , learned that the quartet was available for a thousand dollars , and retained it .

" she exclaimed , " there arc only four of you !

It lists , and proudly ton , the names of some of Mr. Suesskind 's loyal and constant patrons .

These places , like other theatres of their day , had personality , character , something you could n't put your finger on . That kind of showhouse held on fairly well into the decade before the war , but the chain-store system of ownership has done it in now .
