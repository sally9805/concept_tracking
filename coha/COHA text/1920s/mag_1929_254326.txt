Insistent has been the rumor of a merger between Radio Corp . of America and Western Union Telegraph Co . Presidents of both companies have admitted " conversations . " denied merger plans . Last week it became apparent that at least one current merger denial was supported by the facts . Abruptly , R.C.A. threw down the gage of battle to Western Union and announced the birth of R.C.A. Communications , Inc. , to compete directly with U.S. telegraph companies . <P> As everyone knows , Western Union and Postal Telegraph ( I.T . &; T. subsidiary ) are the two giants in the field . As President of the super-giant Western Union , Newcomb Carlton took up R.C.A. 's gage . Unimpressed by the wireless threat , he snapped : " The Radio Corporation has nothing we now wish to use , and if we ever need anything they have , we can get it from other sources . For the time being , at least , we will view the disposal of the Radio Corporation as an interesting scientific development . " <P> If war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the whip hand . R.C.A. radio circuits terminate at New York on the East Coast and San Francisco on the West Coast . Blank of its stations is the whole interior . Not only can it transmit no domestic messages , but all messages from the interior for radio transmission abroad must be relayed to the coast over Western Union wires . Tentative , temporary are R.C.A. 's " agree ments " with these companies . Therefore , to escape this bondage , R.C.A. Communications has applied to the Federal Radio Commission for 67 wave lengths to be used in domestic service . It will mean extending to 31 inland centres radio service by R.C.A. Communications . <P> Two radio rivals to the newborn company have already appeared . Earliest of all in the field was Universal Wireless Communications Co , of Buffalo , which obtained late last year ( TIME , Jan. 7 ) from the Federal Radio Commission a generous helping of wave lengths . This is still a dark horse ; no steps have been taken to establish its proposed radio network between no U.S. cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also applied to the Commission for domestic wave lengths . If radiotelephonic hookups , now a possibility , become a reality , the remaining great communications company , American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , will be drawn into the fight . <P> Apart from telegraphy , Newcomb Carlton has two hobbies . As the largest employer of boys in the world ( 15,000 youths in forest green deliver telegrams for Western Union ) , he is interested in boys . Ship models , his other hobby , overflow his summer home at Wood 's Hole , Mass . His only son , Winslow Carlton , is a Senior at Harvard . Since 1914 Mr. Carlton has been President of Western Union . Recently The Daily Princetonian pulled a publicity stunt . It telegraphed many a prominent man asking : If you had only 24 more hours to live , what would you do with the time ? Prepaid , the telegraphic query came to Mr. Carlton . Immediately he wired back : " I would spend it in prayer for Princeton. "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
