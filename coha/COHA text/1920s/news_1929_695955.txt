The influence of President Elect Herbert Hoover seemed Lpparent in the ' showing made by those favoring postponement . Mr. Hoover is on record as favoring repeal of the national origins quota system on the ground it is impossible to determine satisfactorily the exact mixture of the blood of different nations in the present population of the United State . In effect the national origins system requires an aggregate annual importation of 150,000 to be divided according to the proportions of this mixture among the different immigrant groups . This scheme is intended for the preyent C11104a system , which restricts immigration from each European nation to 2 per cent of the number of na tionals of that nation resident in the illnited States under the census of 1840 . Back of the fight for postponement of the national origins system are the Irish , the Germans and the Scandinavians , all of which groups are sub1ected to sharp reductions in quotas . For the other side of the controversy are so-called patriotic societies which cast reflections upon the loyalty in the war of the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed . These societies approve the increased quotas which would be applied to England , Northern Ireland and certain other countries . Wilt Eliminate Problem . If congress approves the postpone , meat resolution it will relieve ' Mr. ' Hoover of one of his immediate problems . Under the law he must issue proclamation by April 1 , making the ' national origins quotas effective on July . L The new quotas have already been certified by a commission composed ' of the secretaries of state , commerce ! and labor based on importations by census bureau experts . Outside of the national origins row congress cleared the decks of most of its pressing business . All the appropriation bills are out of the way except the conference report on the first deficiency bill , which remains to be approved by the house tomorrow .
