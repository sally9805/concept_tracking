A traveling court set up on an automobile is now visiting markets in Berlin to punish profiteers . Plain clothes policemen patrol the market place , and on finding that an excessive price has been charged , or on hearing any complaint they immediately arrest the offending dealer and take him before the court . Justice is meted out on the spot , and the result is that prices have been considerably reduced . The city officials hope that these courts will end the food riots which have resulted from the exorbitant demands made by the merchants .
