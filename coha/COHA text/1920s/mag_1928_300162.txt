The famed Hindu doctrine that thou shalt not kill even a bug-much less a human-was sensationally reinterpreted last week , by the potent ascetic , sage and saint , Mahatma Gandhi . <P> Quoth the Mahatma : <P> ' ' Just as a surgeon does not commit himsa ( killing ) , but practices the purest ahimsa ( non-killing ) when he wields his knife on his patient 's body for the latter 's benefit , similarly one may find it necessary ... to go a step further and sever life from the body in the interest of the sufferer . <P> " It may be objected that whereas the surgeon performs his operation to save the life of the patient , in the other case we do just the reverse . But on a deeper analysis it will be found that the ultimate object sought to be served in both cases is the same , viz. , to relieve the suffering soul within from pain . In the one case you do it by severing the diseased portion from the body . In the other you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an instrument of torture to it . . . . Suppose , for instance , that I find my daughter-whose wish at the moment I have no means of ascertaining-is threatened with violation and there is no way by which I can save her . Then it would be the purest form of ahimsa on my part to put an end to her life and surrender myself to the fury of the incensed ruffian . " <P> Puzzled Hindus pondered whether it is now safe to tread upon a ladybug-whose wish at the moment one has no means of ascertaining-would she seem menaced with assault .
