THE RISE OF THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD-Count Egon Caesar Corti-Cosmopolitan ( $5 ) . <P> The Family . " Remain faithful to the law of Moses . Remain united to the end . Consult your mother . Intermarry . " <P> Thus an old Jew , to his five sons . The House of Rothschild , born in the Frankfurt Ghetto " between the city wall and a ditch , " was governed by rules as strict as those of a military academy . <P> All the sons were faithful , and became in time the chief strength and support of the descendants of Moses . All the sons were united though they scattered to the ends of Europe for the first international banking concern . Probably they came from their magnificent palaces to see Amschel the Younger , head of the House , and to consult the aged Gudula , Die Uralte , an illiterate Sibyl who had vowed never to quit her chair by the window " save only for the tomb . " Finally , although Count Corti does not note it , 46 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century was out , in a burst of shocking eugenics and sound economics . <P> As the family was fitted and welded , smoothed and polished , so was the Fortune . Little by little , Meyer Amschel wormed his way into the financial counsels of William IV , Elector of Hesse , until at length he held the strings of that ruler 's considerable money bags . The needs of princes first , and later the needs of governments , were the opportunities of the Rothschilds . The wars of the Allies against Napoleon , the collection of the French indemnity , the efforts of Metternich to crush every outbreak of liberal ideas-all these required money . The Rothschilds provided it , at a profit . <P> This book , with its careful tracing of the Fortune 's growth in each successive European crisis , is answer enough to the Waterloo legend . For years Europe believed that Nathan himself posted from Waterloo to London , took his accustomed place by a pillar on the Exchange and stood there , a picture of dejection and despair , while his agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune in a single morning . Count Corti does not trouble to disprove the story ; the Fortune was established long before Waterloo , and weathered the Napoleonic cyclone with its turbulent aftermath . <P> Not that the incident would have been impossible . The House was never troubled by ethical problems except when integrity was obviously the best policy . Metternich made the brothers Barons ; they bought and fawned their way into the society of five capitals . But they remained shrewd moneylenders , with the noses and eyes of hawks , speaking and writing an uncouth jargon of many dialects of French , German , Yiddish . Count Corti quotes one contemporary comment upon a Rothschild : " King of Jews and Jew of Kings . " Another , better , he omits : " Princes in the parlor and pawnbrokers in the kitchen . " <P> Parlor and kitchen together , the financing of wars and the support of the bastard sons of kings , made the House of Rothschild master of a chaotic Europe for half a century .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
