Huge advertisements of Mr. Hearst 's Cosmopolitan for May feature an allegedly true story entitled Mercy . " One day a chilling shadow fell , " says the blurb . " While Mrs. Wills , with her two small sons , was away on a visit to her parents , the Reverend Robert N. Wills disappeared-and with him the pretty dark-eyed organist ! " Then the ad takes on bolder type : " A story of a once prominent minister and his life expiation for a moment 's madness . " " A story that never got into the newspapers because a whole city held its secret in- violate . " Ray Long edits the Cosmopolitan for Mr. Hearst . He says he is printing the story for the good of humanity . It is based on religion . In newspaper , circles the remark is passed that the city which kept the secret inviolate is not New York , nor Chicago , nor Boston , nor Detroit , nor Los Angeles , nor Atlanta , nor Washington , nor Rochester , nor Syracuse , nor Milwaukee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor Baltimore . Where there is a Hearst paper , no scandal lacks either prophet or historian .
