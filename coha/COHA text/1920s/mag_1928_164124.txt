He cast flies on the Brule River at all hours and put the largest fishes which unsuccessfully tried to eat the flies into the Cedar Lodge " live box , " so that he could display them to visitors or eat them at pleasure . He kept his semiweekly office hours in the high school library at Superior , and made one unscheduled trip on which Mrs. Coolidge accompanied him .
