txt In order to Just to make sure that our hard-working Keep legislators wo n't Their Hand In. get out of practice , Sneaker and Senator KNIGIIT have named fourteen committees to conduct various investigations during the Summer . Winter is a pretty hard and thankless grind for members of legislative committees , whether at Albany or Washington . In the Summer they prefer to take their ease . Congress must be advised as to colonial affairs and fisheries , and a junket to the Philippines or Alaska is always in order . For the stay-athomes there is the excitement of investigating oil or slush funds . Save when there is some real scandal afoot , the State offers the legislator a narrower field for his extracurriculum activities . A glance over the list of the current inquiries reveals the dullness of the times . To recodify the laws relating to towns , to explore the possibilities of extending the field for savings bank investments , to find cut why the courts of the Second Judicial District are so congested  --  these are all most praiseworthy undertakings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Investigate Conditions- in Almshouses and the Committee on the Tercentennial of the Discovery of Oil should find entirely laudable outlet for their energies in the work assigned to them . These various activities are hardly calculated to stir the blood . Perhaps it is better so . Was n't it MONTESQU/EU who dwelt on the happiness of peoples whose annals are uninteresting ? The disconsolate lady Headgear who feels that perhaps Comes she did pay too much for her new Easter bonHigh. net , and is loath to ' present a May Day bill to her husband . may take courage from reading that an American has just purchased in London a piece of headgear , and old at that . for ? 3,500 . But the buyer was one of those " wealthy Americans " who seem to abound in England , and the headpiece was a Spanish helmet dating from 1470 or so and regarded as one of the finest of its class .

Collectors as well as ladies can be extravagant in a matter of headgear . A Spanish helmet which would bring a still higher price if it could be found and identified is the " yelmo " that figures in " Don Quixote . " Though it started out as only a barber 's basin . and has no standing in official- collections of historic armor , its association with that noble knight would make it a priceless find . Perhaps in the course of a few centuries the clumsy tin hats which our own soldiers wore , and which are to be had almost for the asking now , will command high prices and figure 2. s museum pieces of extreme rarity .

Students of prote*ve coloring in nature have had a ? theory ttiat cats . curled up on sunny open spaces , could sleep in comfortable safety because the eagle or other birds of prey would mistake them for snakes . Their stripes are supposed to have given them the smooth coiled look of a dangerous reptile , and young kittens were safe from attack in prehistoric days because of their menacing appearance when asleep . It was an amusing notion and may have some foundation , but it was never carried so far as to intimate that a modern . fluffy kitten 's voice sounded like a snake 's hiss .

" Marvelous faith in the Art botanical accuracy of and artists was recently expressed by a man living Botany . on the Island of Cyprus . Something that he had seen in an English art gallery troubled him . It concerned the late P. H. CAMERON 'S painting " Ruth and Naomi , " now in the Liverpool Gallery . The Cyprus man had vainly tried to identify a plant depicted in the foreground of the canvas : At first glance one would soy It is a prickly pear ; hut this . of course , is not possible , as that species did not make its appearance in the Mediterranean region until some .

It is quite possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that cpuntias were not established in that region until many centuries later . If he did not know , it was excusable . Most great painters know more of art than of botany , and me ny mall c mistakes in introducing impossible plants even into their landscapes . Artists have always , to a greater or less degree , used their own powers of selection and imagination . MANET might never have given us his " Christ with the Angels " ( " What painting ? what wonderful hepasto ! " RENOIR said of it ) , had he taken too seriously the accusatory question of a fellow-artist , CouRBM . " Have you ever seen an angel ? " COURBET demanded .
