As a fireman bounds out of bed and rushes to a fire , so Crown Prince Pierre de Polignac of Monaco bounded into a sleeping car berth at Paris and rushed off to Monte Carlo . <P> In the Principality , embers of revolution were a-glowing . The first alarm was sounded when the Parliament of Monaco - called the National Council-resigned en masse . The second alarm was figuratively turned in by Monaco 's one Minister of State , florid , flustered M. Louis Eugene Maurice Piette , after the Communal Council of Monaco . Like delighted children at a fire , the tourists and gamblers of Monte Carlo shrilled questions : " Is it really a revolution ? What 's it all about ? What will the Prince do when he gets here ? " <P> In the morning , when Le Train Bleu glided into Monte Carlo Station , His Highness Prince Pierre Marie Xavier Raphal Antoine Melchior de Polignac , Due de Valentinois , and Comte de Polignac , stepped forth before suspicious , hostile eyes . Proud , race-conscious Mongasques ( Monaco natives ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a black-hearted Frenchman under his skin . They sneer at the means by which he became Crown Prince-married into it , faugh ! <P> Through angry muttering crowds of Mongasques , Prince Pierre proceeded resolutely to confer with members of the resigned National Council , and especially with soft-voiced , steel-eyed M. Lon , the young manager of Monte 's famed Casino . <P> Salons of the National Council gruffly voiced their grievances , charging that : <P> 1 ) Prince Louis has " abandoned his people " and now dwells exclusively in France . <P> 2 ) The Casino Syndicate is corruptly concealing profits and nefariously neglecting public works which it has contracted to perform . Item : the electric plant frequently breaks down . Item : so do the waterworks . Item : ditto the telephones . <P> 3 ) The Casino Syndicate has used its monopoly power to the detriment of all other " enterprises " in Monaco , suppressing cinema theatres and discontinuing fetes which used to fill even the small hotels with tourists . 4 ) The authority of the Crown and the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice the Prince-and in his name the Casino Syndicate-has frequently acted in a manner arbitrary , unjust , scandalous . Finally the resigned and angry councilors made formal demand upon Prince Pierre that he summon his father-in-law Prince Louis from Paris and set up a commission to investigate and right the wrongs of the 22,153 Mongasques . <P> Experienced Prince Pierre de Polignac temporized , seemed to yield . By all means let there be a commission ! Affably His Highness named three each of the resigned National and Communal councilmen to compose the Commission . Also the smart son-in-law had a proclamation from Prince Louis to read-a paternal , gently reproving proclamation : <P> " Citizens , your Sovereign remains tranquil and confident that recent events have been greatly exaggerated abroad . On the eve of the season most essential to Monaco 's prosperity , Prince Louis calls the people of Monaco , in the name of and by the affection they hold for their country to an appreciation of their sane and essential duties .
