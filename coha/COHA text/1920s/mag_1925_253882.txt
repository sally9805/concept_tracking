Almost alone among the states , Florida has practised encouraging rather than penalizing capitalists through her tax laws . State income and inheritance taxes there have been forbidden by the Florida Constitution . Gloomy critics prophesied that the loss to the state from these sources of revenue would have to be made up by heavy taxes in other directions . <P> But just the opposite tendency has actually been experienced . Instead of corporation taxes being raised , they have been slashed to the low level of the Delaware corporate imposts . The public utilities have been left alone . Instead of harrying the railroads in the state , legislation was actually passed to help them issue preferred stock . The rails are responding by undertaking new branch lines through the state which will have a great bearing on real-estate values in interior localities . <P> Only one cloud dimmed this otherwise clear sky , and this soon blew over . Owners of shorefront property are permitted to acquire title to lowlands in front of their holdings . Some of the interior representatives contended that such title should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state . Shorefront property holders have benefitted by millions through the present law , and for once they shivered slightly when the proposal was made to halt the present practise . But the proposed repeal was soon put into the discard by the triumphant clan of realtors ; and Florida 's record as a 100% Utopia for the wealthy has been preserved intact .
