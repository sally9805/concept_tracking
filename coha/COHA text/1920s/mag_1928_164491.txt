" Full of fear of Jehovah , despair of stricken souls , anguished groping for light , the music was illustrated upon the vast stage by figures in tan and black flowing robes . Men of the priestly order ( among them Dancer Michio Ito ) , mourning women bearing lighted candles , suppliants in prayer shawls , a pilgrim , the Ba'al Tokea , moved against the austere background of the enormous Wailing Wall of Jerusalem , achieved the spirit of Isaiah crying : <P> " For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light . . . . And I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity . " <P> Each figure expressed an individual passionate sorrow , yet there was swaying and swooning in groups . It was extraordinarily well done . Responsible for the dramatic composition and the stage direction was Miss Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestral sounds . The Rembrandt-like picture on the stage was but one more instrument . Conductor Nikolai Sokoloff was at his best ; connoisseurs called him great . <P> * Irene &; Alice Lewisohn , founders of the Neighborhood Playhouse , are nieces of Adolph Lewisohn ( copper ) , donor of the famed Lewisohn Stadium , collector of Degas and Bellows pictures .
