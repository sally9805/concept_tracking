txt // tinguish two meanings of the word . On the one hand , reference is had not to a type of behavior but to the neural mechanism involved in the production of certain simple movements . In this sense the reflex is a sort of functional unit of the nervous system , the smallest working or operating unit . Almost all of our present discussion , however , has to do with the reflex as the simplest type of response found in animals possessing a nervous system . The tropism and , as we shall find , the instinct , involve an orientation of the whole organism . The reflex , on the other hand , never involves the whole organism . A definite tract in the nervous system is set into function for a fairly limited period of time by a specific stimulus and some local muscular movement runs its course . The reflex has been a special object of study on the part of neurologists and physiologists and , although we can not give a complete account of the studies that have been made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in common use . Two reflexes are of special interest in psychology , viz. , the scratch reflex in the dog and the salivary reflex . The former in the hands of Sherrington has yielded a great deal of information about the mode of operation of the nervous system . It has been found possible to keep alive and well a " spinal dog " whose brain stem and cerebrum have been separated from the spinal cord . A great variety of experiments can then be performed on the integration of reflexes . A single stimulus of moderate intensity in the region of the thorax will bring about a scratching movement . The movement is definite and lends itself readily to measurement . Variations in the intensity of the stimulus and its location ( on one side , on both sides , over an area , etc. ) , cause variations in the movement of the hind limbs which , taken with facts of neurology , brings out the precise mode of operation of the lower nerve centers . Combined reflexes , antagonistic reflexes , delayed responses , discharge into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind are ways of describing neural operation . We have already seen how these facts can be put to work in understanding the operation of higher centers ( see p. 157 ) . // Psychological interest was first attached to the salivary reflex by Pawlow , a Russian physiologist , who distinguished after a series of clever experiments between conditioned and unconditioned reflexes . It is well known that some stimuli will , without previous training , arouse definite and rather specific responses . The taste or sight of food , for example , usually excites an increased flow of saliva , or a sudden increase in the intensity of light will cause a contraction of the pupil in the eye . Such reflexes are known as unconditioned reflexes . Now Pawlow discovered that if some other stimulus is presented to a dog along with the stimulus adequate to an increased flow of saliva and if the simultaneous presentation of these stimuli is repeated , there finally comes a time when the secondary stimulus alone is sufficient to arouse the flow of saliva . That is to say , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifying the reflex . Such reflexes he called conditioned reflexes . The possibility of conditioning a reflex has placed a valuable method in the hands of the comparative psychologist for determining the ability of animals to discriminate between objects . Suppose , for example , that the adequate stimulus to withdrawing the foot is an electric shock . Now the ringing of an electric bell will not excite such a reflex movement of the foot ; but if the bell is rung and the foot is at the same moment excited by an electric current , and if these two conjoined events are repeated , it turns out that the bell alone will finally induce reflex movements of withdrawal . There has evidently been a substitution of one stimulus for another . If now , a bell of a slightly different pitch is used , the reflex movements may not appear . Obviously the animal used in this experiment can distinguish pitch differences of certain demonstrable magnitudes . The method here applied to sound is probably useful in any sense department . Instinct. ? The word instinct has come to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place , to a kind of impulse having dynamic power enough to drive an organism into action in racially predetermined ways . Thus we // have the phrases " instinctive drive , " " instinctive urge , " etc . The word refers , in the second place , to a distinctive behavior pattern . This is the meaning we shall put into the word in what follows . An instinct is not the alleged ability of animals consciously to forecast and to prepare for a coming event in a way that is beyond the range of reason . Neither is instinct the ability to act telepathically , ? that is , to act with reference to or to have knowledge about , objects or persons far away . Popular literature is so full of trash about the " intuitive " knowledge of animals , especially of dogs , that in the popular mind the whole scientific issue has been befogged and distorted . Novelists like to make a good story , and owners of pets are fond of picking out the more obvious and striking types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In physiology the word instinct stands for a kind of inherited neural organization . That is to say , the physiologist places emphasis upon the fact of inherited tendencies to behavior rather than upon the behavior itself or upon the end gained by the behavior . It will be recalled , from our survey of the principles of nervous function , that many behavior patterns are guided in their temporal course by a determining tendency , or by an organization in the nervous system which directs the action or emotion consciousness toward a definite goal . The instinctive organizations in the nervous system are probably the most deeply rooted determining tendencies the body possesses . They serve to guide the temporal organization of behavior patterns over relatively long periods of time . After the following formidable definition we shall give an illustration of a typical instinct and then relate the illustration to the definition . An instinct is an inherited and a specific though complex type of behavior which is aroused by a definite situation and which , at appropriate intervals in the life history of the organism , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat is brought , for the first time , near a cage containing white rats , the rats will become frightened , retreat // to a corner of the cage , huddle together in a rather tense heap , and remain in that position for an hour or more after the cat has been removed . They will not behave in this manner before an object in the form of a cat nor to the cat if it is within a glass jar . They will respond indifferently to a cloth that has been rubbed over the cat 's fur , but they will not respond to any detached portion of the cat , save possibly the nose and mouth . They will not so respond to a large variety of odors or chemical substances , nor to other animals such as the dog or the rabbit . They may move in a similar manner to very loud sounds . The behavior of the rats is fairly constant from individual to individual . The body is frequently tense or at least very quiet ; there may be trembling and a peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound organic changes and marked changes in respiration and heartbeat are easily observed . ' Here , then , is an instinctive performance . How does it exemplify the definition ? In the first place , the instinct is an inherited mode of response . It can be shown that white rats which have never been near a cat will act in the manner we have described . The tendency issuing in the performance is no doubt firmly laid in the nervous system . In the second place , the instinct is a specific type of behavior . In other words , the pattern is always about the same from individual to individual . Neither sex nor age seem materially to modify it . It is , moreover , a dominating sort of response . Rats which are mothering young will leave their nests and retreat in fear ; and the response stands prior to feeding , to mating , to sleeping , and to exploratory movements . In the third place , the instinct is a complex type of behavior . It involved , in this case , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cross section , for the fear reaction is accompanied by respiratory and cardiac and general systemic changes . These changes persist over a long period of time . In the fourth place , the instinct is aroused by a specific situation . In our illustration , the Griffith , C. R. , " The Behavior of White Rats in the Presence of Cats , " footnote 1'aychobiol. , 1920 , Vol. 2 , pp. 19-28. // odor of a living cat seemed to be the exciting agent . Vision and audition were not involved . In the fifth place , there is no evidence of conscious direction in the animal 's movements . It seems to be under the spell of the odor and the response is so immediate and so striking as to indicate that its roots lie deep in the neural organization of the animal . When we take instincts in the large , certain other characteristics appear . They can , for example , be modified . That is to say , the stimulus exciting them can be changed , and some of the responses can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well fixed . Many instincts are timed . They run their course only at certain intervals in the life history of the individual . They are , moreover , cyclic . Mating seasons come in the early spring , to be followed by nest building , brooding , and feeding . A great many attempts have been made to classify the instincts but none is adequate . Published classifications make use either of the end the instincts subserve , of the movements that accompany them , or of the kind of conscious experience they condition . The classifications are inadequate , perhaps , but the general features of a typical instinct are , it is hoped , fairly clear . Acquired Modes of Behavior. ? No animal runs through its life history without having had even its instincts modified in the running . " An insect that lays her eggs in a place where she never sees them hatched must always do so blindly ' ; but a hen who has already hatched a brood can hardly be assumed to sit with perfect blindness ' on her second nest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a hard matter . If the phrase is made liberal in its meaning the very lowest animals can learn . But in such cases profit is due primarily to temporary changes in the body . For example , the second reaction to a stimulus may be more violent because the first has just taken place . The first seems to have left the body of the animal in a state of heightened tonus . There is no footnote James , W. , Psychology , 1390 , Vol. 2 , p. 390. // reason to believe that this effect is permanent , but it does show , in a large sense of the phrase , that present behavior may be modified by previous behavior . Again , the second stimulus or a repeated stimulus may come finally to have no influence upon an animal . It has been shown experimentally that this sort of change does not depend upon fatigue but upon sensory adaptation ( in lower animals ) or upon lapse of attention ( higher animals ) . Changes due to past experience must ordinarily be more permanent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place more rapidly than the growth of muscles or of other tissues if they are to fall under " learning . " In other words , true " profit from past experience " must represent a functional change in the nervous system , a change which rests presumably upon variations in the resistance at the synapses . Types of Learning. ? Repetition is the most direct means of effecting these changes . Under repetition two things may happen : ( a ) useless movements may drop out ; ( b ) discrete movements may be linked together to form a series . In learning the maze , for example , the rat on the first turn runs into every blind alley and retraces its pathway many times . Gradually the useless movements are dropped and the animal learns to run so that each step takes it by the shortest route to the food box . In escaping from a puzzle-box many random movements are made . Unsuccessful movements are rapidly dropped while the correct movement is stamped in and shortly the animal does only the necessary things to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , punishment , etc. ) are still a matter of speculation . If the conditions of the experiment are changed repetition leads to the formation of a series of movements . The maze illustrates this type of learning as well . There are experimental reasons to believe that the rat does not see , hear , feel , or smell its way through the maze . On the contrary , a certain number of movements are made and some of these get themselves put together in a chain or a series . " All the evidence indicates // that when a rat has thoroughly learned the maze , its movements have become organized into a system such that the sole requisite stimulus for the performance of one movement is the kinaesthetic excitation resulting from the preceding movement . " ' Two other forms of profit from past experience have been described . Bees , ants , and homing birds are thought to be guided by familiar landmarks . Wasps are said to recognize visual objects near their nests . Ducks and geese are known to follow certain pathways year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in recognition of this sort , but the behavior of all homing animals is an argument for profit of a certain kind . " Memory Images . " ? Learning among animals approaches nearer the human level when we come to signs of a " memory idea . " There can be no doubt that animals do possess the power of learning in the sense of reacting differently to an immediate stimulus because of their past experience with it . But this ability is not , in and of itself , evidence of the existence of the use of a memory idea ? of images referring to a past object . It is alleged that animals do not use such images because of the trial and error method of learning . Errors are dropped out gradually , while in the human subject the elimination is immediate or very rapid . It is also urged that animals are not able to imitate one another during the absence of the one to be imitated . Furthermore , most animals must react immediately to a stimulus , if they react at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are made , and the dependence of the organism upon instinctive performances , lead to the conclusion that memory images are fairly rare in the animal kingdom . Experimental evidence is more conclusive . Let us suppose that a white rat has learned to discriminate between lights of different intensity so that it always goes to one box of four for its food . The food box is brightly illuminated and its position with reference to the others is constantly changed . Let footnote1 Washburn , M. , The Animal Mind , 2d ed. , 1917 , p. 280. // us suppose further that the animal is held behind a wire screen while the boxes are properly illuminated for one minute . All the lights are then turned out and after ten seconds the rat is released . If , now , the rat can use memory images it ought still to locate the food box in a majority of the trials . It fails to do so . That is to say , the white rat can not or at least does not show evidence of the persistence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten seconds . This method , which is known as the delayed reaction method , has been applied to many animals without final but with suggestive results . Experiments show that the maximal interval which may separate the stimulus from the response is , in rats , one to five seconds , racoons , ten to twenty-five seconds , cats , sixteen to eighteen seconds , dogs , one to three minutes , a child ( 14 yrs. ) , twenty seconds , ( 2% yrs. ) , fifty seconds , ( 5 yrs. ) , probably as much as twenty minutes , apes ( Kohler ) , twelve or more hours . Learning Tricks. ? A word should be said about the learning of complicated tricks . It is usually the vaudeville performances of animals which strengthen the common belief that they are possessed of complex and even mysterious powers . The method ordinarily used in training animals involves the same factors as does their laboratory treatment . Advantage is taken of some instinctive tendency in the animal , often the movements made in searching for food . By repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its food . Suppose now that the course of the maze is gradually complicated and that in addition to running the maze the rat must climb a wall , then jump a certain distance , and so on through many variations . It thus lies within the power of the experimenter or of the trainer , either to make the rats go through the whole series of movements before food is reached , or gradually to eliminate the earlier performances and finally , through a series of accretions , to arrive at an achievement quite distinct from the original behavior . This is the process ordinarily used I ) y trainers . A great deal of time is saved by punishing wrong behavior in addition to rewarding right behavior . A given // situation is gradually made more and more complex and , as the early stages drop out , the performance seems to represent real ingenuity on the part of the animal . DEVELOPMENT OF PREVISION Learning and memory are , as we have found , ways of extending the effective environment of an animal backward in time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of what the organism has already accomplished or experienced at some previous time . But the effective environment of a creature may be extended into the future as well as into the past and this is what we have elected to call prevision ( rather than imagination ) . Prevision means making preparations now or assuming attitudes now in preparation for an event that is yet to come . This talent is probably an elaboration of that simple form of expectancy which is found in so many of the higher animals by virtue of which a perceived object points toward a " next " event . The dog , for example , that awaits with a certain eagerness or expectancy the moment when we shall pick up the gun illustrates the type of behavior which we mean to emphasize . It is said that this question of prevision waits upon the question as to whether animals can make use of what are called " free memory images . " Precise experiments upon the matter are wanting . It will not do to appeal to those forms of " instinct " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , a cold snap , or favorable conditions for the hatching of eggs . Students who are tempted by the field of animal psychology would do well to make this group of problems their first choice for it has been a neglected field . DEVELOPMENT OF ATTENTION No creature responds , as we have seen , to the whole of its effective environment with the whole of its motor mechanism . There is always selection either because of the nature of the stimulus or because of conditions internal to the organism . // That is , there are conditions which determine the prepotency of a stimulus . Here , too , there are a very large number of studies and these seem to point to the generalization that growing intelligence means a growing ability to release oneself from the prepotency values of the environment and to make use of tendencies toward prepotency which are built up within the organism itself . Prepotent Stimuli Among the Lower Animals. ? Intensity of stimulus in and of itself appears to be a factor determining prepotency among all animals at almost any time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( a ) The influential stimulus is often the stimulus that is first upon the field . Paramecium resting upon a vegetable or a piece of paper will not respond to a slight blow as it ordinarily would . That is , the intensity of the blow must be greater if it is to overcome the reaction pattern already present . Thigmotactic subjects will not respond to heat until a higher temperature is reached than that necessary to cause movement when the creature is freely swimming . Earthworms will not react negatively to light while mating . Here , however , the prepotency of mating may be determined not only by the priority of the light stimulus , but by the biological significance of the mating situation . Earthworms will not ordinarily begin mating , however , when the light stimulus is first upon the field . ( b ) A summation of stimuli will often become prepotent when a single stimulus is not enough to bring about response . It takes repeated taps upon the walls of the sea anemone to cause it to detach itself and move away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of stimulus and not merely stimulus itself that becomes prepotent . Worms may be gradually heated and some may even die without perceptible reaction , but when the temperature is suddenly changed the reaction may be extremely violent . Prepotency Determined by Internal Factors. ? Evolution of the power of attention has meant an expansion of the internal conditions for insuring prepotency rather than any notable changes in the external conditions ( except such as we have al210 GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY ready described as expansion of the environment and refinement of discriminatory power within the environment ) . We have space for only a few of the many conditions under which internal factors favor prepotency . First and foremost one must mention prepotency that is guaranteed by the innate preferences of the nervous system . We do not have to call these innate preferences instincts . We remark only the fact that nature has endowed animals with certain preferences and these preferences favor the prepotency of some objects rather than others . In the next chapter we shall see how some objects have gained an habitual attention value through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual , have come to mean something for the individual , achieve prepotency . Attention or prepotency gains its highest significance for the organism when incipient or covert movement systems acquire ascendancy and maintain themselves until effective action can result . Here we touch upon memory and upon all of the neural patternings that may accompany thinking . Miss Washburn describes the facts as follows : " The highest grade of attention , the final triumph of vital importance over mere intensity of stimulation , is to be found where the focus of attention is occupied by an idea or train of ideas . When a process purely centrally excited holds the field and makes the individual deaf and blind to powerful external stimuli pouring in upon his sense organs , then he is superior to the immediate environment at least . This form of attention occurs , probably , only when the vital importance of the idea attended to has been learned through that most rapid form of individual acquisition of experience which involves the revival of the past in idea . " I PROBLEM-SOLVING Genuine problem-solving is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearest evidence which we have takes this talent footnote 1 Washburn , M. F. , The Animal Mind , pp. 346-347. // back only to our nearest biological relatives , viz. , the apes . Psychology is indebted to two men for information in this field , to Kohler and to Yerkes . We have space for a bare outline only of the experiments and of the facts . At a simple level , problem-solving means a more or less sudden and unique resolution of a difficulty , independent of trial and error . Rats do solve the problem of the maze in the sense that after a large number of futile wanderings the correct path is discovered . It may be , however , that the maze problem is a human problem and not a rat problem . The starting point of current research upon the problem-solving talents of animals has been the selection of problems which are upon the level of the animal concerned , that is , problems that can be comprehended by the subject . Suppose that a bit of fruit is beyond the reach of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futilely at the bars of its cage , as a dog would do , or will it find a way to get the fruit ? Both the dog and the ape might seek to escape through a back doorway and thus get around the bars , but only the ape is able to see a stick in the cage as an instrument or a tool for reaching out to the food . Experiments in Problem-Solving. ? Some of Kohler 's experiments run as follows : Food is placed outside of the cage within arm 's reach , but a box stands on the inside of the cage and in the way of the ape . The ape moves the box and thus gains the fruit . Fruit is hung from the ceiling at a height too great to reach by jumping . Within the cage are two or three boxes . The ape solves the problem by piling the boxes one upon another thus gaining his reward . One of Kohler 's subjects had the happy thought one day of fitting two rods together in order to make a longer stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . In one case , the solution of the problem meant that the ape must push the fruit away , that is , toward another grating on the opposite side of the cage , in order that it . could be reached after the ape had passed around the cage . footnote ' Read , Kohler , W. , The Mentality of Apes , 1925 . Yerkes , It . M. , Almost Human , 1925. // Kohler has explained these achievements in terms of what may be called " insight . " There is no trial and error in these experiments . There were , as a matter of fact , some facial expressions and some bodily postures which appeared to betray doubt , perplexity , and reflection . There were also sudden behavior patterns which seemed to mean " Ah ! now I have it ! " If , in the process of further discussion and experimentation , it should be decided that these experiments actually reflect insight or thinking , we shall have added an important chapter to psychology . Our curiosity will then push us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greatest uncertainty surrounds the experiments that have already been performed . In some of Thorndike 's experiments with cats it has been shown that cats , too , made sudden escapes from the puzzle box . Sudden drops in a learning curve which otherwise represents the results of trial and error learning have been explained as the result of chance ; but there is now a disposition to examine some of these curves and the problems out of which they come a little more critically with the hope of defining the limits of this particular moment of intelligent behavior . EMOTION Inferences concerning the tonus of bodily reactions and concerning the fundamental attitudes of animals toward objects come almost entirely from the expressive movements which accompany their emotional life . Of these expressive movements there is no lack . Darwin was so impressed by them that he devoted a special book to their discussion . ' Attitudes of attack , of fear , of sexual pursuit , of pleasure are common enough in our chief household pet , the dog . But similar attitudes are found in almost all living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely favorable or unfavorable stimuli carry a quality which might be called emotional . That is , the intensity of the reaction is so out of proportion to the intensity of the stimulus that one may be justified in inferring footnote i Darwin , C. , The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , 1890. // an emotional attitude on the part of the creature . It has been suggested , for example , that the swarming of bees is an expressive way of manifesting " joy . " Studies on the minute behavior of these creatures during swarming suggests that the behavior patterns owe their form and intensity to more than ordinary conditions of bodily tonus . Experiments in Emotional Reaction. ? Our best information concerning the emotional life of animals comes from Kohler . ' This investigator found and was able to describe , among other moods and emotions , anxiety , sadness , anger , rage , disillusionment , discomfort , moody depression , joy , jealousy , and envy in the daily life of his subjects . One creature expressed its displeasure by the waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking its hand against the ground . The deception of another subject issued in violent tramping upon the ground and striking the ground with the fists . Joyful expectation was expressed not only in the face but by a posture of the head and of the whole body . Even some of the finer attitudes which we call sentiments were observed tin tong these creatures . Such sketches of isolated animal groups are not , of course , a developmental account of the origin and growth of the mechanisms involved . This is a chapter of animal psychology , however , which is gaining in attention . DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL PERSONALITY We know practically nothing of those attitudes and total behavior patterns which would mark personality differences among animals . That there are such differences no one will doubt who has had any dealings with household pets , farm animals , or r.ui ) logical gardens . We speak of surly and of kind animals , we speak of devoted and of untrustworthy animals . Thus we pay homage to the fact of personality differences in the creatures below us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be that personality or character is a trait footnote 1 Kuhler , W. , The Mentality of Apes , 1925. // which becomes defined only when the environment of a creature is highly socialized , as in man . The surliness or devotion of an animal would , then , be a product , in part , of our tendency to humanize the animal and , in part , of its normal emotional and moody attitudes . But these attitudes may become habitualized and stabilized just as they do among human beings , and in this sense we may be justified in searching more diligently for character and personality traits of the lower forms of life . Do ANIMALS HAVE MINDS ? In spite of the obstinate attempts that are now being made in psychology to account for the whole range of animal behavior in terms of stimulus and situation , on the one hand , and behavior patterns , on the other , our fancy wanders every now and then , to the question : " Do animals have a Mind ? " It is not unreasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental life commensurate with their position in the scale of life , the conditions of their sense organs and brains , and the number and range of their behavior patterns . But suppose we assume that human beings possess a Mind which is an effective and more or less independent agency in the creation of behavior patterns and in the formulation of thoughts . What , then , would be the line of argument and the limits of speculation as to the Mind of the lower animals ? The Argument from Analogy. ? It is a commonplace that we can not directly perceive the mental life of our neighbor or the mental life of animals . Prior to reflection we are usually willing to affirm animal mentality on the same grounds as we affirm human mentality . When pushed for a critical answer we fall back upon an argument from analogy which runs something like this : " Why of course my neighbor has a mind ; he reads the same books as I ; he talks with me and I understand him and he understands me ; he acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is foolish . ' Of course all people have minds . " If we were more critical we might refer to the similarity in structure between different human nervous systems and to the // literature , art , and science which seems to depend upon or presuppose the existence of other minds . The argument from analogy , then , is the authority men have for postulating Mind in animals . The process is always one of inference . We can not see our neighbor 's Mind , but we can see what he does . So with animals ; we can not see their Minds , but we can infer Mind from their behavior and from certain other materials . The animal , we say , appears to behave intelligently , i.e. , its movements are either adaptive or are modified under previous experience . An animal is said to respond adaptively when it seems to be particularly fortunate in getting out of a difficult situation . It is obvious that a machine or a brick or a telephone pole can not approach an obstacle and then devise a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing . They are constantly overcoming obstacles ; they are repeatedly adapting themselves to new situations . 1Ve humans , being past masters in the art of " adaptation , " make much of this behavior on the part of lower organisms and sometimes interpret it too liberally . Learning as Evidence of an Animal Mind. ? The ability of animals to learn has done much to convince men of the existence of an animal Mind , but this fact is not without antagonists who say that inanimate objects may profit by past experience in the same manner . For their chief illustration they relate how an iron bar " profits by experience " when it tends to bend in the - Name place under repeated stresses . There are , however , certain distinctions to be drawn in this case . In the first place , we are dealing with two fundamentally different orders of existence . Life manifests properties that do not fall to lifeless objects . In the second place , the profit accruing to the living organism , especially in the higher species , is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod . Most psychologists , therefore , are inclined to attach considerable importance to this criterion of the existence of an animal Mind , but inferences must always be drawn with care . It has come a law in animal psychology that an event must not be // explained by a more elaborate hypothesis or by more assumptions than are actually adequate to the facts . This principle we have already come to know as " Lloyd Morgan 's Canon . " It reads as follows : " In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale . " This principle is , as we have suggested , a special case of a general scientific doctrine known as the " principle of parsimony . " It enjoins upon any investigator the desirability of using as simple an explanation as will actually cover the facts . At any rate there is probably less danger of misusing such a principle by explaining too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts . Many of the facts of animal psychology can be explained without appealing to any sort of mental life , to say nothing of a Mind , but the virtues of the principle must not lead to its ruin . The animal psychologist has proceeded with care and , for the most part , his explanations and inferences are probably close to the truth . At least he avoids anecdotes ; he trusts , first of all , in experiments . The Comparative Equation. ? Proceeding in the manner we have indicated , some psychologists have become fairly confident that animals have Minds . They are , furthermore , fairly sure of the " size " and talents of the Mind which animals enjoy . This assurance comes through the application of the comparative equation which states that the Mind of any animal is a function of the complexity of its general physiological structure , but principally of its nervous system . If we let M represent the Mind , B the behavior , and NS the nervous system of the human organism , and if m stands for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ns its nervous system , the equation will read : figure The only unknown factor in the equation is m , the Mind of the animal . The equation ought to be solvable for the single // unknown . When properly reduced , it states that the Mind of any animal is a function of its nervous system and behavior in particular and of its gross bodily structure in general . The equation gets its value from two principles we have already discussed , viz. , the principle of genetic continuity and the principle of psychophysical conjunction . It will be recalled that the former owes its origin to Darwinism or to the belief that all life is related . The principle would suggest that , since Mind appears as very complex at this end of a developmental series , it must have begun at the other end as simply as have the body and the nervous system . It is thought inconceivable by many that a thing so qualitatively unique as Mind should have made a sudden appearance at any point in the line of continuous bodily evolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always appear together . We have already reviewed the facts upon which the assertion is based . The principle can now be extended to the nervous systems of lower animals where the fact has been established that nerve structures of essentially the same sort appear in all animal forms save the very lowest in the scale ; but even among these , certain tissues fulfill the same offices . It is obvious , of course , that speculations about the mental life and The Mind of the lower animals is a psychological game rather than a mode of research . One may say , " If this animal has mind , it must be composed of such and such processes which ap . pear in organizations of such and such complexity , " but the whole game rests upon the " if . " Such speculations help little in understanding the behavior of living creatures and if the doctrine of p+ychophysical parallelism is a thoroughgoing doctrine there IN little to be gained from puzzling out a mental life which can not , be rendered by or translated into verbal terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Introduction. ? The human infant has been so immortalized in poetry and in romance and its capacities so distorted in description that sound knowledge concerning the origin of its intellectual life was long delayed . We have already seen how it came to be taken for granted , especially among religiously minded people who were forever identifying the intellectual traits of animals with metaphysical beliefs about the existence of souls , that the mind of the infant was but a small edition of the mind of the adult . Such a supposition led to distressing arguments concerning the precise moment at which the child was endowed with its mental life . On the one hand , there were those who believed that the precious gift came precisely at birth , while others supposed that conception or the first-felt movements of the embryo marked the incoming of the soul . As a matter of fact , we shall find that all such arguments are meaningless . If we were to believe poets we would not only have to admit that the intellectual talents of the child are in some sense a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child has certain talents and experiences which are foreign to the adult . Many have believed , for example , that the child comes to earth harboring reminiscences of the world it has just left , and that traces of these memories are to he seen in the depths of eyes that , prosaically enough , are not yet possessed of a functionally active iris reflex . The facts which we are about to review make it clear that the infant is not a small edition of the adult . They show , moreover , that the mental life of the child is not the mental life of an 218 // advanced animal . The logic of evolution might suggest that , because of the developmental relations between man and the lower animals , the intellectual talents of the child must represent a little higher stage of development than is to be found in subhuman forms , ? this and nothing else . We shall find that this is not the case . The intellectual talents of the child have their own history and are not to be conceived as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which child psychologists place upon the unique qualities of the infant intellect is not to be taken as a denial of individual and racial parallels . The parallels stand , but uniqueness also stands . The social factor in child development is only one of the things that makes the process unique . The Functional Development of the Embryo. ? An adequate account of the physiological and , in particular , of the neurological development of the embryo would take us too far from our immediate task . We mention only such facts as will give a broad perspective and such as we may need later . Like other animals , the human being begins his existence as a distinct individual subsequent to the conjunction of a male and female germinal cell . The cell resulting from this conjunction divides rapidly into two , into four , - into eight cells , and so on , until all count is lost , for the number runs upward of 2.65 x 1013 The mass begins shortly ( two weeks ) to take shape and under - t lie microscope one may see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their appearance . The muscles declare their functional independence by movements which the mother may experience as early as the fifth month . ' I'lie receptors are practically complete long before birth , the eye , for example , by the end of the fifth month and the ear by the end of the sixth month . Muscular movements which begin during the fifth month lead one to believe that parts at least of the great central adjustor are functionally complete . Certain facts suggest that although the brain , under ordinary inspection , appears to be fairly complete at birth , large parts // of it , nevertheless and especially of the new brain , are not functionally ready . For example , large parts of the cortex are not medullated , that is , they have not been covered with a fatty sheath which is thought to furnish insulation as well as nourishment . This process of insulation is carried to completion during the first few months after birth . The old brain is probably well developed at birth . Edinger and Fischer have described the behavior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent therefore upon more ancient nervous structures . ' The child , which lived for nearly four years , remained almost motionless during its entire life , for its behavior was limited to a few simple physiological reflexes . The new brain , a structure acquired relatively late in the history of life , appears to be the special organ of intellectual life . The Meaning of Intellectual Growth. ? When we say that intellect grows or develops we mean to say that we can pass an increasingly favorable judgment upon the average child as he traverses the path from physiological infancy to physiological adulthood . We are passing judgment upon his ability to get on in the environment which he creates . Intelligence is thus a broad term , and it would be convenient if individual development could be described in simpler terms . Apparently it can . We have found it possible to describe getting-on from several points of view and these moments of intelligent behavior offer a way of marking progress in partial talents before we attempt to mark progress in general talent . We shall indicate briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon perception , attention , learning and memory , emotion , imagination , thinking , and personality . Our method here , then , is the same as was adopted in considering the development of the intellectual talents of the lower animals . ' footnote I Edinger , L. , and Fischer , B. , Arch . f. d. yes .

L. , Mental Growth and Decline , 1927 ; Gesell , A. , The Mental Growth of the PreSchool Child , 1925 ; Stern , W. , Psychology of Early Childhood ( tr . Harwell ) , 1924. // DEVELOPMENT OF PERCEPTION Sensory Discrimination in the Infant. ? The movements of the embryo have been explained as having reference to the growing functional activity of the brain . It is barely possible also that some of them , especially toward the end of intrauterine life , are called forth by gross changes in illumination which may penetrate the body of the mother , by the conduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are exerted upon the embryo . Save for the sudden invitation to make far greater differential responses subsequent to the sudden changes of environment coincident with birth , there is no reason to suppose that the infant is instantaneously and miraculously endowed at that time with intellectual talents of higher orders . The perceptual talents of the newborn infant are of a very low order . Only after several weeks can it discriminate between variations in light intensity . The discrimination of colors has not been confirmed as appearing earlier than the third month ( gray vs. not-gray ) and many observers put color discrimination as an achievement appearing as late as the sixth month ( discriminations within the not-gray , i.e. , the color series ) . Reactions to noises and to tones of moderate intensities appear between the fourth and tenth days , although accurate discrimination between different pitches does not appear until some time later . Auditory reactions are probably delayed by a fluid which remains in the ears for several days . Accurate localization of sounds does not appear before the second month and for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taste and smell have been confirmed by many observers as taking place the first day . All forms of pressure produce discriminable reactions within the first hour . Certain types of painful stimuli are not effective until later . It thus appears that the infant creates its environment at a fairly rapid rate . That is to say , it creates the general boundaries of what is going to be its effective environment . The process of acquiring fine discriminations within these boundary limits goes on much more slowly . By the third year , however , // excellence in this trait is reached and future intellectual development must be found in some of the other phases of intelligence . It will be instructive to ask how experiments upon the powers of discrimination of small infants are carried out . In one such experiment , the experimenter used milk bottles blown out of milked glass and differing in shape from one another but equalling one another in area . One bottle was circular , another square , another in the form of a diamond , and still another in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles , say the round one , and all four are placed in front of a six-months ' - old infant . The infant reaches for successive bottles until the milk is found . On the next occasion the position of the round bottle with respect to the others is changed and again the infant must search for its food . It is obvious that if a six-months ' - old infant can not discriminate between these several forms it will never learn to find its milk except by trial and error . The experiments show , however , that infants of this age can make such discriminations and can thus learn to select the right bottle at the first trial . This experiment illustrates how one goes about it to perform experiments of this type upon very small children . LEARNING AND MEMORY The child moves onward from infancy to adulthood partly because of a normal process of maturation . That is , along with the simple maturing of bodily organs and perhaps of the nervous system ( at least of the new brain ) , there goes a simple maturing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not born with certain precise instincts it is certainly true that more elementary modes of behavior lend themselves to incorporation in certain behavior patterns rather than to others . In many of the early performances of the child it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the innate , the maturing , and the acquired components of the whole . We say , for example , that the child learns to walk , but there is also some evidence to show // that if a child at the walking stage were not permitted to walk there would still be some learning due to the maturation of the muscles involved , and perhaps also to the maturation of the neural patterns concerned in the innervation of the muscles . At any rate , learning is the most important factor in bringing the child to adult levels of intellect , and all learning is based upon or begins with original nature plus maturation . Original Motor Equipment. ? One of the clearest indices of inherited motor equipment is a simple performance called the grasping reflex . Any sort of object placed upon the palm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reflex is suggested by the fact that all newborn infants , save about two per cent , can hold their own weight for an appreciable period of time . The neural tendencies issuing in this simple performance seem to persist in the child about one hundred and twenty-four days , after which time they disappear and the subsequent behavior of the child is such that there is no indication that a grasping reflex had ever been present . Reaching activities begin about the hundredth day . With a little practice they readily become modified into performances more serviceable to the child ; and by the one hundred and fiftieth day the child may be actively using its arms in conveying substances or objects from a reachable distance to its lips . Curiously enough , the infant will not often reach for an object much over twenty inches away , although the object may he fixated and followed as it is moved about the room . Right and Left-Handedness. ? Right or left-handedness is an acquisition that has seriously concerned the psychologist for a good many decades . Anatomical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same conditions that produced speech . At any rate , the use of the hand , like the use of the vocal cords , has played an important part in the history of intellect and the description of the ontogenetic development of handedness has become an important question . On the one side , it is urged that dextrality or sinistrality are hereditary and , upon the other , they are alleged to be acquired // ( Watson ) . The facts are complicated by the observation that children " normally " left-handed but who have been made to write with the other hand frequently pay for the change by a tendency to stammer or by other vocal disturbances , and by a certain emotional instability . Several other theories to explain the origin of right and left-handedness have been advanced . Successively , dextrality has been laid to natural inheritance , to the left-handed position of the heart , to a greater supply of nerve force because of the earlier development of the brain upon one side , to variable blood supply due to the position of the aorta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficacy of muscles on the right side , and to the center of gravity of the body . So far as the facts appear at present dextrality is probably hereditary . The definite appearance of right-handedness or left-handedness may fall anywhere between the seventh to the fifteenth month . Ambidexterity , or the ability to use both hands with equal ease , has been noted as early as the first year . Eye-Movements. ? The eye-movements of a child are exceedingly important for they , too , bear a close relation to its subsequent mental achievement and development . During the earliest days of life the eye-movements are slow and much like the tropic responses to light of many lower organisms . Soon , however , this sluggish movement gives way to a more definite mode of fixation . After a short time objects are focused accurately , showing that the ocular muscles are slowly maturing . Complete ability to fixate objects appears about the one hundredth day . Prior to this time the eyes move preferably in a lateral direction , but afterward they will follow a complete circle . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Babinski reflex , for example , consists of the downward fanlike movement in the small toes and the upward movement in the large toe excited by touching the sole of the foot . This reflex is said to have a certain relation to the functional integrity of the central nervous system and is frequently used // as a means of diagnosing pathological conditions of the pyramidal tract in the brain ( lack of medullation ? ) . The Babinski reflex appears very early , but disappears at about the sixth month except in pathological cases . It is , however , very irregular in its appearance and disappearance . The general development of the nervous system and the progressive organization of muscular movements are indicated by ( a ) the ability of children to sit alone , and ( b ) by the completion of walking habits . Sitting alone for a few moments may occur as early as the one hundred and fortieth day ; and after that time the muscular coordinations necessary for such an achievement develop rapidly ; but in many cases sitting does not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk matures between the twelfth and the eighteenth months . Many other motor capacities of this kind are being studied in the laboratory and they prepare the way , as it were , for a serious study of the rate of development of more complex motor accomplishments in individuals and , by analogy , for an account of the rate of development of behavior patterns at large . Language Habits. ? As we have seen , the most important of nil the habit problems is the problem of language . Behaviorism has made the most suggestive attempts to discover how it is that of all the movements which the organism makes , those conditioned by the vocal cords become the most significant . Birth , of course , gives the infant a vocal apparatus , a muscular and tendinous structure specific in form but fundamentally like any other response mechanism . Early in life the vocal habits begin to appear . Out of the babblings of infancy certain vocal sounds get established just as successful movements are established elsewhere in the body . The process of transfer from vocal habits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conditioning discovered among the emotions . The ess has been described by Watson as follows : " We will suppose that for some reason or other a child 's ys are laid away and covered up . What does he do in such // a situation ? Essentially what the animal does when it is hungry . The child begins general restless movements among which are movements of the language structures as shown by its making aimless ' vocal sounds . His throat formation at that stage of growth is of such a character that a particular sound is uttered frequently ( let us say tata ' for illustrative purposes ) . He begins to utter this sound as he roams about . The attendant , knowing the child 's range of toys and the frequency with which he plays with a certain one , predicts that an old rag doll is sought . She finds it , hands it to him and says , Here 's your tata . ' Repeat this process long enough and tata ' will be always used for rag doll and will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of course , repeated again and again in the course of a day . The word gets tied up with the act of seeking the doll . In this way baby words grow up as the first genuine form of true language organization . " A stimulus to which a child often responds by opening and closing and putting objects into it is the box in which his toys are kept . The nurse , observing that the child reacts with his hands and fingers to the box , begins at a suitable age to say box ' when the child is handed the box , open box ' when the child opens it , and close box ' when he closes it and put blocks in box ' when that act is executed . This is repeated over and over again until the conditioned reflexes are thoroughly established . In the course of time the box in front of him , which originally called out only bodily habits , now begins to call out word habits . He says box ' when it is handed to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the box now becomes a stimulus capable of releasing either the bodily acts or the word acts , or both . A series of functional connections is established between vision and throat and laryngeal muscles , which exists alongside of the already earlier established connections which run from the same receptor to the arm and leg muscles . When the box is presented now which act will take place ? Manual action or laryngeal action ? It is at this point that the influence of the environment upon the shaping and forcing of the language habits comes clearly to the front . There comes an occasion when the box can be seen but not reached . Action in the hand is blocked . He speaks box ' and may speak it persistently all over the house . The attendant , hearing the word box , hastens to put it in his hands . In view of the fact that this situation is repeated day in and day out , not only with respect to this object but to hundreds of others , the child learns that the uttered // word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the objects he names without actually having to execute bodily movements with respect to them . There has been a substitution of the language habit for a bodily habit ? now by a word he can cause objects to move ? his grunt or growl or infant toy word is law . " 1 Along toward the end of the second year the child makes what Stern calls one of the most important discoveries of his life , viz. , the fact that everything has a name . To his everlasting questions , " What is that ? " comes the answer , " That is . " Thus words or vocal reactions come to stand for or represent objects and events . Even the first stages in the development of symbolical language spring from this simple substitution . This is illustrated by the child that could not tell how many fingers the father had because it could count only the fingers on its own hand . Counting and " fiveness " did not belong to anything but its own fingers . The use of words abstractly is a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is " five . " " Fiveness " belongs to fingers in a sense wholly different from the ' way in which " Daddy " belongs to the object that walks around the room , brings home presents , and the like . As the illustration ' given above shows , even after one object acquires the additional designation of five this " fiveness " may not be carried over to any other object . But gradually the linguistic activity of the child becomes more and more symbolical and abstract , and by the time it is four or five years of age most of its reactions are verbal or involve verbal components . Preliminary experimental studies and an actual counting of the number of words pillow that a one-year-old infant may use on the average about ten specific words . At the end of the second year the number of words averages about five hundred , ' although some individuals have presented as many as a thousand words at this age . With cavil successive year the number of words increases so that a MR-year-old child may have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. , Psychology from the Standpoint of the Behaviorist , 1919 , pp . Jt1J 3 ' 21. // thousand words . Over half of the total number of words used by a child are nouns . This per cent decreases as the child grows older ; but the number of verbs and adjectives increases with respect to the total number of words used . The linguistic activity of a child during a single day is tremendous . Although a two-year-old possesses a vocabulary of about five hundred words it has been determined that these words may be used five or six thousand times a day . By the time the child is three or three and a half years old its common words are used from twelve to fifteen thousand times a day . The Development of Drawing. ? It has been said that drawing , more than any other activity of childhood , reveals the inner mental life of the child , that an accurate history of a child 's efforts to draw can be made a reliable objective index of the rate of development of its mental life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this account , children 's drawings have attracted a great many experimenters . Thousands of drawings have been collected and studied with great care , first with an eye to age and sex differences among the finished products , and secondly with an eye to the actual process of drawing itself . Just as language is preceded by a stage in which the child plays by means of its vocal cords , so drawing is preceded by crude scribbling and penciling which is brought about , in part , by aimless playful handling of any object that will make a mark and , in part , through imitation of the movements of other persons as they draw or write . The child imitates the movement , the performance , not the thing accomplished . The child of this age probably enjoys some memory images , but there is no evidence to suggest that its scribblings are in any way related to these memory images . They begin , according to one investigator , with movements of the whole arm , but as the child approaches the stage of genuine drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers are used . The crude , impulsive , aimless markings of the two-year-old change , at length , into more definite pencilings which appear to be of interest to the child for their own sake . Different drawings // are given different names in contrast to the preceding period where the same markings may excite many different words . Furthermore , the pencilings come to resemble objects , not objects that the child sees , but objects that the child remembers . The drawings come to represent something in the mental life of the child , and thereby they attain value as signs of or reports of the growing inner life of the child . Not for some years does the child attempt voluntarily to draw objects which are immediately given in perception . Finally , however , as the range of his own perceptual knowledge and the accuracy of his memorial life is increased , he begins to find discrepancies between his drawings and actual objects , and it is thought that this discovery leads to a state of self-consciousness in which budding artistic talent may go into decadence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind , the soul , breath , God , and similar impossible objects are attempted as readily as more real physical objects . An enumeration of the predominant motives in children 's drawings indicates that younger children have decided preferences for human and for certain animal forms , then come houses , locomotives , plants and flowers , and other still-life objects , and finally conventional designs and ornaments . Nearly three-fourths of the spontaneous drawings of six-year-olds either are of or contain the human figure . After the rebirth of artistic ability in the fourteenth to fifteenth years the above order of preference for objects is just reversed . Development of Memory. ? We may consider the developDiient of memory independently of learning , subject to what was said on pp. 21ff. concerning memory and learning problems . ' The memory problem is indicated by Koffka in the following words : " If one brings an infant into a strange room before the completion of the first half-year , its behavior alters noticeably . The infant looks around the room with a wide-eyed astonishment , ' which disappears as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The effect of the memory of its usual surroundings is indicated by an impression of strangeness , but // the basis for this impression must already have existed , because its memory would have been the same had it never been taken into a strange room . . . . Within the first six months of a child 's life one can also observe signs of smiling when the infant sees its mother or some other familiar person , and , on the other hand , signs of avoidance and displeasure when the infant is brought in contact with strangers . " 1 But modifications of behavior have been observed earlier than the sixth month . Gesell has reported a case in which a newborn infant cried when picked up , but within two weeks it had learned to cease crying when picked up and to begin crying when laid down . Although it is not probable that conditioning of this type occurs very often in the first few days of babyhood there is every reason to believe that the process begins rather early and increases enormously in importance after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show how memory and learning are studied in young children . Very early , that is , before language develops , one must wait until the child has laid away a plaything and then , seizing the opportunity , ask the child where the plaything is . By waiting for five , ten , fifteen or more minutes one can carry through a very pretty experiment upon the child 's ability to recall and recover the object named . Another method which is dependent upon language is known as the " Aussage " method . A picture is shown to the child and the child asked to give , either at once or after an interval , a description of the picture . A variation of the method is to take away from the child an object that has been in its environment for a considerable period of time ( say a picture upon the wall ) and note the child 's reactions upon the discovery or list the number of items which the child is able to describe as belonging to the picture . In one experiment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two minutes and was then able to report thirty-five items of which five were wrong . Three footnote 1 Koffka , K. , The Growth of the Mind , 1924 , pp. 241-242. // days later without having seen the picture in the meantime this same child was able to report thirty-seven items of which number eight were wrong . Physiological Memory. ? Psychologists commonly distinguish between physiological memory and memory which makes use of what are called " free images . " It is alleged that physiological memory modifies the behavior of the child for perhaps the first two years ( and also most of the higher animals up to the ape ) and that at approximately the second year the child begins to remember objects and events in the same way that adults remember them , i.e. , with the aid of memory images . In physiological memory there is only a functionally disposed nervous system ; in memory proper the revived experience makes a definite reference to the past . We do not know as yet ( see p. 24 ) whether memory and learning are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in measure very rapidly after the second year and by the third year the memory impressions are being made so firmly and are so closely integrated the one with the other that they persist over into later adulthood . It is not often that adults are able to recall childhood experiences that antedate their third year . It is said that the memory talents increase until late in adolescence when the individual will have acquired his maturity so far as t his phase of intellectual talent is concerned . It is to be hoped that we shall sometime be able to draw a curve showing these rates of increase in talent . One phase of childhood memory has recently received a great amount of attention . Jaensch and some of his students have shown that many children have a remarkable ability to reprouce with full perceptual clearness some picture which they have just viewed . This imagery was called eidetic in order to distinguish it from ordinary memory images and from what are called memory " afterimages . " These vivid recollections of objects seen and heard can be described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original perceptual materials . These studies have opened up a new group of // problems in psychology , for they bear upon the relation between perceptions and their subsequent recall , the confusion in the minds of children between what they have seen and what they have imagined , the possibility of preserving this visualizing tendency and putting it to use later in the educational program . IMAGINATION OR PREVISION Foresight. ? The development of imagination still lies in obscurity , for the facts are so often confused with the child 's use of his memories and with fantasies ( as in fairy stories , etc. ) that we can not say when the child actually begins to previse the future . The reader is warned again that " previse " is not used here in the sense of divination . It is used for that specific talent by which an animal may extend the temporal boundaries of its environment to include what is yet to happen just as memory includes that which has already happened . To remember that it rained on the last cloudy day is one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another , and it is this second type of behavior which we call previsory . When a five-months ' - old child puts out its lips as the spoon is brought into sight we have not only a mode of reaction which is learned , but a mode of reaction which dips into the future . Many , if not all , learned reactions and all memorial materials may be used in this way . But as time goes on the use becomes more and more apt and more and more unique . To acquire foresight means to acquire a better regard for that which is to come . As has been intimated , foresight may not be a distinct phase of intellectual talent . It may be either the temporal extension of the environment which learning and remembering afford or it may be a type of problem-solving . Let us turn to this mode of behavior . PROBLEM-SOLVING The study of thinking occupies , as we have found , a curious place in psychology for the whole topic has been so loaded // down with logic and with theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic ends and psychology begins . This is particularly true in child study . There are altogether too few experiments of the problem type such as we present to animals and too many of the type which are alleged to concern judgment , the formation of concepts , the development of abstractions , the arrangement of categories , and the like . One of the commoner ways of administering experiments in this field is to place before a child two collections of objects which are alike in some respects and unlike in others and ask the child to pick out the objects in the two groups which seem alike . Suppose , for example , we lay before a child three red triangles and three green circles . Now we present an object which resembles the one group in color and the other in form ( red circle ) and ask the child to pick out from the objects before him one that looks exactly like the one held in the experimenter 's hand . If the same type of selection is made from trial to trial the experimenter may assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each attempt . That is , it abstracts either color or form and makes it the determining factor in its selections . In these experiments color was the determining factor and the experiment was successful with children as young as two years , nine months . Other experiments have shown that color is not always the determining factor but the method has been successful in all other ways . Another favorite way of handling problems in this field makes use of numbers . A child is asked to select from a group of identical objects , two , or three , or four ; or of two groups containing two and three objects , respectively , the experimenter May ask , " Is this two or that ? " Again , one may fill a chart With groups of dots and ask the child to pick out all the groups containing four dots . The first task mentioned above is easiest for small children , but two-year-olds , at least , can not handle numbers above five . It is only five and six-year-old children that ran find and name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of this kind it has been concluded that a use of the number 2 is ordinarily gained by three-year-olds , the use of number 3 by four-year-olds , and the use of 4 by five-year-olds . A large part of our knowledge about problem-solving in children derives from reports made by parents and relatives on questions which they have put to their children . This material is informing but the whole problem needs more careful formulation and cleansing . The psychological problem does not have to do with the way in which children handle the syllogism but the way in which they learn to overcome difficulties . It would be a wholesome thing for this phase of research if someone could devise a group of problems at child level instead of at adult level and then find out how the child solves these problems when it uses its own devices . This program of research is actually under way and the results ought to be illuminating not only for child psychology but for genetic psychology as well . THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATTENTION Factors Governing Selection. ? William James described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzing confusion . " It was implied that intellectual growth meant the ordering of this confusion , and order is aided no doubt by the fact that some objects become successively prepotent over others . The gestalt-psychology describes the same facts in a little different way . " We find the newborn child capable of movement whenever external stimuli come in contact with his senses , that is , whenever the equilibrium of his condition is disturbed . For instance , a bright object appears in the field of vision and the eyes move ; a contact is made with a certain place on the hand and the fingers close , etc . In every case a state of rest is interrupted ; into the already existing world wherein the child was at rest a new factor has been introduced which disturbs his quiescence . If we wish to reconstruct the phenomenal counterpart of this objective behavior we must consider the child 's // state as a whole . Consequently , we ought not to say that the child sees a luminous point , but rather that the child sees a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of touch , that pressure is felt upon the hand , otherwise untouched . Generally stated , from an unlimited and ill-defined background there has arisen a limited and somewhat definite phenomenon , a quality . " That is , in the effective environment of the child , some objects acquire prepotency over the rest and they acquire it , as we have learned , either because of factors intrinsic to the environment ( energy of stimulus , etc. ) , or because of factors intrinsic to the organism ( innate or acquired preferences , attitudes , and dispositions ) . Of the facts , there can be no doubt . Dismemberment of the environment , ordering of the members , the erection of figures on grounds , successions of events and objects which have acquired for the moment a prepotency , attention , however we may describe it , the process does proceed . But how fast it proceeds we do not know . We assume that primary attention I ' appears first . That is , attention to or the selection of objects during the first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity of the stimulus and the intensity of the factors we call interest . How long this condition persists is uncertain . Educational procedures are based upon the assumption that it endures well into the upper grades . But in the meantime selection that is based upon acquired interests , based upon learned habits of attending , becomes more and more significant in the life of the child . In well-trained adulthood , habitualized attention is one of man 's most valued acquisitions . EMOTIONALLY TONED REACTIONS Native Emotional Patterns. ? It has been discovered that at least three emotional patterns are fundamental in the behavior repertory of the infant . Others may be found , but the disvery of these three has set the problems and furnished a mightily suggestive method for all further studies on emotion 1 ( 1 instinct . // The three original or native emotional patterns which have been distinguished thus far are fear , rage , and love . ' The principal situations which arouse the fear attitude and responses ( catching the breath , clutching , crying , etc. ) are ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) loud sounds , and ( c ) a sudden shake or pull . These situations arouse the fear attitude and the fear responses at birth . They are the situations which invite the organism to dispose of its energies in more than normal amounts to meet the new situation . The original situation which produces the rage attitude and the rage responses is a hampering of the infant 's movements . The responses are crying or screaming , a stiffening of the body , random movements of the limbs , and holding the breath . Here , too , we see how the organism is hereditarily disposed to adapt its energies to certain types of stimuli . Love ( the word is used in a very wide , Freudian sense ) is excited originally by stroking or manipulating various portions of the body , by tickling , shaking , gently rocking , patting , and the like . The responses are smiling , gurgling , and cooing . Ordinarily , crying will cease under such stimulation . Conditioned and Unconditioned Responses. ? One of the processes by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been described ( p. 201 ) . The mechanics of the process as applied to humans may be illustrated in the following manner : " If a subject sits with the palm of his hand upon a metal plate and his middle finger upon a metal bar and an electrical current is sent through the circuit thus completed by the hand , the finger will fly upward from the metal bar the moment the electric shock is given . This painful stimulus is thus the native or fundamental stimulus which calls out the defensive reflex of the finger . The sight of an apple or the sound of a bell will naturally not produce this upward jerk of the finger . On the other hand , if the bell is sounded or the colored object is shown the moment the electric current is completed through the hand , and this routine is repeated several times , the situation becomes footnote ' Watson , J. B. , Behaviorism , 1925 , Chaps . VII , VIII . // wholly different . The finger begins to jerk up reflexly now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the electrical current is not sent through the hand . After a longer or shorter period of training the colored object will cause the jump of the finger just as inevitably as does the current . This we call a conditioned motor response and we have shown that these conditioned responses persist for long periods of time , in some cases possibly throughout the life of the individual . There is no reasoning ' or association of ideas ' involved , because we can produce conditioned reflexes in very low forms of animals . The same thing occurs in our glands . If one attaches a small apparatus to the parotid gland ? one of the salivary glands in the cheek ? in such a way that the saliva flows out drop by drop , it can be shown that the direct stimulus of the gland is actual contact with some edible or drinkable substance , for example , weak hydrochloric acid , vinegar , etc . The moment such an acid touches the tongue the gland begins to flow profusely . Ordinarily the sight of objects does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined stimulations are given , the object being shown at the same time the acid is given , the sight of the object finally will produce an increased flow of the gland . This is of course what happens every time food or drink is brought to the mouth . Thus the youngster 's mouth has every reason to water ' when a stick of candy is held in front of him or our own when we are hungry and a toothsome morsel is held before our eyes . It is probable that all of our glands , even the so-called ductless ones such as the thyroid or the adrenals , become conditioned by means of such environmental factors throughout our life . " 1 This principle of conditioning a reflex has been applied to much complex forms of behavior as emotions and instincts . In infants , as we now know , the most adequate original stimulus to fear is a loud noise . Fear is induced by no other objects spite of the common assumption that animals , furry objects , moving objects , and darkness instinctively arouse fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear response . For this purpose there was presented simultaneously to an infont a white rat and a loud sound . The rat alone had previously footnote Watson , J. B. , and R. R. , " Studies in Infant Psychology , " Sci . Mo. , 1921 , Vol. 1. i , pp. 510-511. // been reached for ; but the sound alone induced the normal fear reaction . The laboratory notes in this experiment illustrate the facts . " Eleven months , 3 days old . ( 1 ) White rat suddenly taken from the basket and presented to Albert . He began to reach for rat with left hand . Just as his hand touched the animal the bar was struck immediately behind his head . The infant jumped violently and fell forward , burying his face in the mattress . He did not cry , however . " ( 2 ) Just as his right hand touched the rat the bar was again struck . Again the infant jumped violently , fell forward and began to whimper . " In order not to disturb the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eleven months , ten days old . ( 1 ) Rat presented suddenly without sound . There was steady fixation but no tendency at first to reach for it . The rat was then placed nearer , whereupon tentative reaching movements began with the right hand . When the rat nosed the infant 's left hand the hand was immediately withdrawn . He started to reach for the head of the animal with the forefinger of his left hand but withdrew it suddenly before contact . It is thus seen that the two joint stimulations given last week were not without effect . He was tested with his blocks immediately afterwards to see if they shared in the process of conditioning . He began immediately to pick them up , dropping them and pounding them , etc . In the remainder of the tests the blocks were given frequently to quiet him and to test his general emotional state . They were always removed from sight when the process of conditioning was under way . " ( 3 ) Combined stimulation with rat and sound . Startled , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 4 ) Combined stimulation . Fell to right side and rested on hands with head turned from rat . No crying . " ( 5 ) Combined stimulation . Same reaction . " ( 6 ) Rat suddenly presented alone . Puckered face , whimpered , and withdrew body sharply to left . " ( 7 ) Combined stimulation . Fell over immediately to right side and began to whimper. " ( 8 ) Combined stimulation . Started violently and cried , but did not fall over . " ( 9 ) Rat alone . The instant the rat was shown the baby began // to cry . Almost instantly he turned sharply to the left , fell over , raised himself on all fours and began to crawl away so rapidly that he was caught with difficulty before he reached the edge of the table . " This was as convincing a case of a completely conditioned fear response as could have been theoretically pictured . It is not unlikely had the sound been of greater intensity and the child more delicately organized that one or two combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thus see how easily such conditioned fears may grow up in the home . A child that has gone to bed for years without a light with no fears may , through the loud slamming of doors or through a sudden clap of thunder , become conditioned to darkness . We can easily explain how it is that a sudden flash of lightning finds you all set and tense , oftentimes with the hands over the ears , before the clap of thunder , which is the true stimulus to such action , appears . " 1 Further trials brought forth the fact that after the infant had been conditioned to a white rat , it was afraid also of a rabbit , a dog , a fur coat , and cotton wool . Previous to the conditioning all of these objects were freely played with and handled . Here , then , is a mechanism by means of which a relatively simple original response may be made to serve the interests of the organism in a large way . No one knows at present how far the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that original nature is soon weighted down with a load of conditioned stimuli and modified responses so as to conceal completely the original behavior itself . T1IE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY I n marking the progress of the infant toward adulthood and , therefore , toward individuality it is frequently valuable to point out certain periods or stages in the acquisition of selfhood . That is to say , because of the continuous enrichment of mental life throughout childhood and youth , the child becomes increasingly able to sustain certain stable relations with the world and with other human individuals . Although these ba- footnote t Op. cit. , pp. 511-512. // creasing social capacities and obligations are not sudden acquisitions , nevertheless , there is pedagogical value in pointing out periods of development and we shall , accordingly , describe the growth of selfhood in this manner . The process is rendered more unique in the child than among animals , for the social part of the environment ( see Chapter IX ) is of tremendous importance in fixing the personality of the child . Periods in the Progress toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods : 1 figure The first period , the pre-social period , we have already discussed under a paragraph treating of the talents of the infant at birth . It is obvious that during the first year the infant is neither social nor anti-social . It is , on the contrary , unsocial . It is probable that its own mental life has no organization and its habits with respect to all save a few objects are highly unstable . The second period is not set off from the first by any unique intellectual acquisitions or by any sudden new behavior patterns ; but it does represent a rapid building up of mental life upon the foundations we have described as having been laid in the body and in the nervous system . Up to this time the most of the child 's experiences have been for the purpose of getting his bodily needs satisfied ; but now the world and the objects in it become interesting for their own sake . His muscular coordinations ripen rapidly and he begins to manipulate objects about him . Soon he is able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The perceptual life of the child increases with amazing rapidity and there begin to appear certain indices that he will soon use imaginal stuff in the acquisition of mean- footnote See Kirkpatrick , E. A. , The Individual in the Making , 1911 , pp. 55-63. // ings and in the control of his conduct . His affective and emotional life becomes quite specific as it is reflected in his face , voice , and general behavior . It has been said that the child consciously imitates other persons about him during this period ; and , although he certainly does do things identical to those done by an adult and often immediately after the example is set , it is by no means clear that imitation is taking place in the simple manner the statement suggests . We have already pointed out the fact that language is acquired early in this period and that a vocabulary accumulates at a fairly rapid rate . The items in this vocabulary are , however , quite specific in their meaning . That is to say , words are for some time tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period the words begin to increase in meaning and are sometimes used without specific attachment to physical objects ; they come to be used in making general references . Habits are easily and rapidly formed during this period . The nervous system is , presumably , as " plastic " as it will ever be and neural pathways are easily laid down . Toward the end of the period the child begins to recall and relate little stories of events that may have happened days or even weeks before . Marston has shown that between the ages of one to three , a great many children learn those social attitudes or emotionally toned attitudes which we call introversion and extroversion . ' One hundred children were studied as they adapted themselves socially to a stranger , complied with the request to perform a difficult task , adjusted themselves to a varied and novel environment , and asserted themselves when wishes and requests were denied . It was shown that long before the normal age of school entrance , children as young as two or three years had developed characteristic social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third period , running from three to six , may be described in social terms as the period of individualization . Social footnote Marston , L. The Emotions of Young Children , 1925 . ( Univ . of Iowa Studios in child welfare , No. 2. ) // influences are prominent , but the child begins to develop a larger longitudinal organization of his own behavior patterns and out of this organization and its organic background comes the realization of a self as distinct from other selves and from inanimate objects . The child becomes a more active and unified participant in the acquisition of knowledge , in manipulating objects , and in attending , in general , to his own pleasures and satisfactions . The rapid development of language coupled with a freedom of words from physical objects ( words become symbols or substitutes ) give the child a world of his own to deal with . Within this world of ideal objects he becomes a central figure . His self-assertion in it is carried over to his activity in the perceptual world . His imaginal world is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in a manner that astonishes his adult observers . In it memories of actual objects are correlated with his dream pictures and with the products of his own imagination in such a manner that for months the child may live quite apart in a world of ideas . His dream objects may seem just as real as the objects of waking life . He has , apparently , no ability to set a memory problem for himself until well along toward the end of the period . Later in the period the process of abstracting perceptual and ideational stuff may have gone far enough to allow him to use words or phrases with a general meaning or , as we say , in abstract form . He learns to count and " twoness " or " threeness " may come to have a meaning apart from specific references to objects . The fourth period , from six to twelve , Kirkpatrick calls the period of competitive socialization . During this period the child assumes still more self-direction with reference to his neighbors . He begins to play and competition becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , of reasoning ability , and of mental organization . His interest in his perceptual life is shown by his attempts to become a naturalist or a stamp collector or a mechanical engineer ; his memory ability is surprising ; his vocabulary grows // amazingly ; " abstract ideas " enter more specifically than ever into his life . The fifth period , the period of adolescence , has probably had more study than all the other periods together . On the other hand , a relatively small part of the literature about adolescence is scientifically reliable . The period is marked , it will be recalled , by a great rejuvenation in the physical and mental life of the individual . Although the rapid growth of the body and the development of new organs may bring about a change in perceptual processes , the greatest changes appear in the affective life and in the development of the elaborative functions . The period is full of violent emotional experiences . Many of the sentiments are born during the period . Toward the end the child has become the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is now being done on the development of different intellectual traits and talents is simply prodigious . Psychology is almost in a position to draw curves of development for different traits where the abscissas mark the passing of time and the ordinates the increase in talent . As a matter of fact , segments of many of these curves have already been drawn and it is instructive to note that a large portion of them resemble the typical learning curve . We shall give two illustrations of the facts illustrated by these curves . The aim of the ordinary association tests is to measure rates of association and distinguish between what are called " common responses " from those known as " individual responses . " The number of common responses in a four-year-old is about forty per cent . At six , the number has risen to sixty-five per cent , by eleven to ninety per cent , but at fifteen the curve is Mtill on about the same level . An eight-year-old child can tap with its right hand at a rate of approximately 145 times per second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per second , that of a thirteen-yearold to 180 , that of a fifteen-year-old to 190 , at which point the // curve appears to level off showing that further notable increases in speed of tapping are not to be expected . In addition to measures of specific aptitude like the foregoing , there is an increasing number of measures based upon alertness tests and intelligence tests . These are , of course , less satisfactory than the measures of specific aptitude , but many of them show unmistakably the trend of intellectual development . Most of the curves show tremendous positive acceleration of development in the early years and a negative acceleration as the child approaches adolescence . It is not yet clear what adolescence does to the rate of improvement in talent . It is commonly believed that some talents , at least , enjoy a second stage of positive acceleration , especially those talents which have to do with the attitudes and with the higher intellectual functions . The Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Tests. ? Mental testing proceeds upon the assumption that a mental level can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intelligence testing may be likened to the task in geology of prospecting for oil , coal , gold , copper , or other natural products . It is not necessary to uncover the whole vein in order to show that the vein is present and that it is eight feet thick in one part and only five feet thick in another . In an analogous way , small samples of psychophysical capacity are secured and they are taken as representative of the general mental level . Under the Stanford Revision of the original Binet-Simon tests , a three-year-old child ought to be able to point to the commoner parts of its body , name a few familiar objects , enumerate some of the items in a picture , tell its own sex , give its name and perhaps the name of the family , repeat six or seven syllables after they have been spoken by the experimenter , and repeat three digits . ' A four-year-old child ought to be able to discriminate the length of two lines , discriminate geometrical forms such as a cross , a circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a row by pointing to each in turn , footnote 1 See Terman , L. M. , The Measurement of Intelligence , 1916. // copy a square drawn in heavy black lines upon a card , repeat four digits after they have been spoken by the experimenter , repeat twelve or thirteen syllables , and show some comprehension by answering such questions as , " What must you do when you are sleepy ? " " What ought you to do when you are cold ? " A five-year-old child ought to discriminate between two equallooking but actually different weights ( 3 and 15 grams ) , name the colors red , yellow , blue , and green , show some degree of aesthetic comprehension by choosing the better of two pictures , give a definition in terms of use of such words as chair , horse , fork , doll , pencil and table , take a cut rectangle and arrange the two pieces so that they are like an uncut model , execute three commands that have been given in a single sentence , and give its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to distinguish the right from the left hand , pick out defects in pictures which have an eye , a hand , or some other part missing , count by pointing to each , thirteen pennies , show a little higher order of comprehension by answering such questions as " What would you do if you should find that your house was on fire ? " name four coins ? a nickel , dime , quarter , and half dollar ? repeat sixteen to eighteen syllables , and tell the differences between iuorning and afternoon . A seven-year-old ought to be able to count the fingers on one hand , describe in some detail the objects in a picture , repeat five digits , tie a bowknot , state from memory the difference between common objects ( a fly and a butterfly , a stone and an egg ) , copy such a geometrical form as a diamond , name the days in the week , and repeat three digits reversed . An eight-year-old child ought to show some plus or purpose in pointing out to the experimenter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper ) in search of a bnseball he had lost . He ought also to count backwards from twenty to one , comprehend still more difficult questions than was the case for earlier years , point out the similarities between ch objects as an apple and a peach or a ship and an autobile , give definitions ( more than their mere use ) of such // words as balloon , tiger , football , and soldier , have a vocabulary ( words that he can define ) of about 3,600 words , name six coins , and write a short sentence from dictation . The average vocabulary of individuals at different ages is shown in the following table : ' figure The nine-year-old ought to be able to give in turn the day of the week , the month , the day of the month , and the year , he ought to arrange in a series five weights which resemble one another in appearance , make simple monetary changes as if purchasing articles at a store , incorporate three words into a single sentence , find a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the months of the year , and count the value of five or six stamps laid side by side . At ten years of age the child ought to detect simple absurdities in sentences , draw designs from memory , read a short paragraph and then retell the substance of the paragraph , exhibit an increasing amount of comprehension , name approximately sixty words in three minutes , repeat six digits , repeat about twenty-two syllables , and put blocks correctly into a frame prepared for them ( Healy form board ) . As the child grows older he ought to be able , in succession , to define such abstract words as pity , revenge , charity , envy , and justice , straighten out sentences whose words have been jumbled or dissected , interpret fables , repeat five digits reversed , interpret a picture , point out the similarities between three different objects , show some signs of ability to formulate a rule or a principle , solve problems of conduct or of action , do simple arithmetical problems , tell the time by footnote ' Modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 , p. 511. // reversing the hands of the clock so that the minute hand becomes the hour hand and the hour hand the minute hand , repeat seven digits , point out differences in such abstract terms as laziness and idleness , or evolution and revolution , repeat six digits reversed , use a simple code , repeat twenty-eight syllables , point out some simple relations between physical objects , and solve simple puzzles as a test of ingenuity . Conclusion. ? Child psychology marks , probably , the most active of the current fields of research . A large part of this research is avowedly for the sake of education , both parental and formal ; but a large part , too , is motivated by the desire to trace the origins of and mark the progress made in , all of the phases of intelligent behavior . It looked for a time as though child research was to be limited to the compilation of tests ; but the test movement has merely whetted the appetites of men for facts that run deeper than those that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as though the department of research which began with Preyer 's Mind of the Child would shortly become , not only a material portion of the whole science , but , taken in conjunction with animal psychology , a determinative factor in the whole outlook of the science . CHAPTER VIII THE INHERITANCE OF INTELLECTUAL TALENT Introduction. ? All that has been said in the last three chapters could almost equally as well have been said under one chapter heading , viz. , Comparative Psychology . That is , one could take all forms of behavior in animals and play the game of comparing one animal with another , one child with another , and children with animals . Nothing need be said about development or evolution . One might make out a ledger , enter the intellectual liabilities and the assets of all living creatures , and then publish a Bradstreet 's . But the bookkeepers dream over their work . They look into the future and wonder where life is going . They wonder how the intellectual assets of the children may be increased . The theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows us , instead of a Bradstreet 's , a flowing river , a dynamic onward-moving , upward-moving , striving nature . The fact seems indubitable . Life is under way and in many philosophies ( not all ) it is on the way upward . The stages we have roughly outlined . Creatures have become more and more intelligent . But we want to know why ! What conditions make for progress and which for retrogression ? Is it possible to do a little toward guaranteeing the future by knowing the forces that have made for betterment in the past ? There are plenty of theories as to the relation of natural selection to the intellectual progress of the race , the part which intellect itself may have played , and the part which a dynamic mental stuff may have played , but most of the energy of the biologist is expended upon the problem of finding an adequate mechanism of inheritance , that is , a mechanism or a physiological process that will explain not only the continuity of 248 // life but the onward and upward march of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed through a long series of developmental changes rests upon the discovery of a physiological process which will explain ( a ) how it comes about that life forever re-creates itself from one generation to another , and ( b ) how it has happened that changes have appeared in each succeeding generation which have enabled life to move forward , to " improve " itself . There could be no evolution if inheritance meant photography . Life would forever duplicate itself . This , we see , is the view of those who hold to creationism . CAUSAL FACTORS IN EVOLUTION Natural Selection. ? Darwin 's doctrine of natural selection assumed ( i ) an increase in any given animal population by geometric ratio , ( ii ) slight variations in the form or in the talents of individuals , ( iii ) lack of room and food for all the offspring of all species , ( iv ) a competition for food and for place , ( v ) an advantage which accrued to individuals fortunate enough to have come by useful variations in form or talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of these assumptions may be said to hold true of intellectual talent as well as of bodily trait . It is obvious that the creature which made the most rapid progress in widening its effective environment or refining its powers of discriminating reactions would have a better chance for survival . The same line of argument holds for the other moments of intelligence . The problem-solving animal certainly had an advantage over the animal that could not get itself out of difficulties . Thus e evolution of intelligence was explained . The great weakness of this doctrine was that it failed to explain the most important matter , viz. , from whence come the variations of which some are so useful ? Mind in Evolution. ? It has , in the past , been fashionable fuming philosophers and among some psychologists to make ptind an effective agency in the progress of life . We have alIvndy found a hint of this procedure in that type of psychologiz250 GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY ing called functionalism ( see p. 113 ) . The functionalist urged that mind was an agent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby favoring the process . Other modes of thinking , however , have gone far ahead of this in that mind has been translated into a " will to live " or into some other equally dynamic agency . The doctrine of natural selection and theories of the efficacy of mind in evolution have not been convincing and , as was intimated above , biologists have turned away from the speculative issues and have begun to devote themselves more and more to a study of the actual mechanics of heredity with a view to discovering in these studies the causal agencies which have eluded speculation . We shall ask , first , what the problem of inheritance is , in so far as it touches intellectual talents and then we shall review a few of the facts of genetics that appear to have a bearing upon the problem . THE PROBLEM OF MENTAL INHERITANCE The prejudices and convictions of men concerning the inheritance of intellectual talent have never been very clear . There was a time when many writers , influenced by a theological or religious bias , would not admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , would not even admit that intellectual talent follows any laws of inheritance . Intellectual talent was alleged to be a gift at the pleasure of Deity . On the other hand , there has always been a widespread belief in the transmission of talent . " The child , we maintain , inherits its father 's bad temper just as it inherits its mother 's good looks . We consider twice before we adopt the foundling , which may be of dull or vicious parentage . We shake our heads over the wayward son , remembering that his father sowed his wild oats , ' and we observe like father like son , ' or blood will tell . ' We expect to find talent in the children of the gifted , thrift or dwarfed intellect or high purpose , according as these qualities are bred in the bone . ' The folk tale of paupered prince or stolen princess who never , though reared as // swineherd or scullion , loses regal bearing and courtly demeanor , the wide respect for royal blood , and the lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common and venerable persuasion that minds , and even morals , are subject to hereditary transmission . " 1 The phrase , " mental inheritance , " when taken strictly , is , of course , meaningless . If this is not obvious to the reader now , it will be after we have stated some of the facts that are known about the mechanics of inheritance . The phrase , " inheritance of mental life , " is also meaningless . We speak loosely of eye color being inherited ; but what we really mean to say is that some factor or agency in the germ cells disposes the growing organism toward blue rather than toward brown eyes . I t is only in this sense that we may speak of the inheritance of any form of intellectual talent . We inherit nervous systems and it is not unreasonable to suppose that they may have certain traits or talents just as digestive systems have them . We say , for example , that an instinct is an inherited behavior pattern . What we mean to say is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mode of behavior we call nesting in the springtime . It is doubtful whether such an anology can be carried very far but it is unreasonable to suppose that an organ so large and so important as the nervous system should not have its variable talents appear in variable measure in different individuals . Along with the biologist , then , the psychologist may inquire about the conditions for the inheritance of intellectual talent , about the conditions under which intellectual talent may be improved , about the part which such life has played in the iatory of evolution . Biometry. ? Before we go to a study of the mechanisms of Inheritance it will be enlightening to ask just how similar or Just how different one animal may be with respect to another . It is an obvious fact that living creatures do have a certain measure of success in photographing themselves . Every normal Bentley , M. , " Mental Inheritance , " Pop . Sci .
