THE SAILOR 'S RETURN-David Garnett-Knopf ( $2.00 ) . <P> There is an indefinable quality in David Garnett 's genius . No one explained the charm of Lady into Fox ; no one will quite explain The Sailor 's <P> Return . The story is simple enough . In the late ' 50 's a plain and hearty British sailor returns to England with his wife-the daughter of an African king-and their baby . They establish themselves in a village pub . The sailor tends bar ; the alien princess is his cheerful helpmate . The village reaction results in tragedy . The baby is consigned , through friendly sailor hands , to Africa , perhaps to become a prince again-his mother never knows . The new proprietors of the pub permit her to become the drudge-of-all-work in her old home . Just that . But as David Garnett tells it your laughter and , almost , your tears are tribute .
