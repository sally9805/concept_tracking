Exacting , sometimes exhausting , is the job of editing a national magazine . Editor Merle Crowell , head of the American Magazine since 1923 , last week decided to obey long-disobeyed doctor 's orders . He resigned his editorship , planned a long rest . <P> Editor Crowell had been faithful to his post . Man and boy , writer and editor , he had labored for the American since he was 27 . He is now 40 . The War , temporarily interrupting his journalistic orbit , took him as a second lieutenant , left him a major . Carroty-haired down-Easter ( from North Newport , Me. ) , no dilettante , no pedant , he admired teamwork , organization bankers . <P> Last week Crowell publications claimed the world 's biggest ( aggregate circulation : 8,000,000 ) group of magazines , in which the American stands second largest. * <P> The American , once noted as a pedestrian , commercially-minded " success-story " magazine , under Editor Crowell had been growing somewhat more sprightly , less reflective of the Alger-like business careers of button kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Mrs. Calvin Coolidge , Biographer Emil Ludwig , Funnyman George McManus , Authors Ellis Parker Butler , Alice Duer Miller , Will Irwin . In circulation , too , has the American grown . When Editor Crowell first grasped the pencil-scepter , the American claimed a paltry 1,900,000 readers . When his weary fingers relinquished their grip , 350,000 had been added . <P> As Editor Crowell left the American , in came Editor Sumner Newton Blossom , onetime managing editor of the New York Daily News , editor of Popular Science Monthly . But he came not as chief editor . Said President Lee W. Maxwell of Crowell Co. : " The American will have no chief editor for the time being . The editor will doubtless emerge .
