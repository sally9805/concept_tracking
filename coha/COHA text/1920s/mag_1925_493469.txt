August Florida in November Retrospect AM filled with warmth and the promise of snap and vigor in tomorrow 's day as I walk down a purple and old rose New York canyon toward the sun . The gray sea beating against the Long Island shore sings a grander symphony for me than the  --  golden waves curling over the most desirable beach property on Florida 's East Coast . I love the chaste , shorn limbs of the elms and maples and willows as they stand out simply and gracefully against the expanse of the Hudson across from Tarrytown . I would not trade them for all the palms in Florida . All this sounds like the grossest heresy in the light of the literature flooding the most remote hamlets of these United States on the Eden awaiting pioneer in our new tropical Klondike . I was in Florida in August . The day after I arrived I sought sanctuary from the pitiless noonday glare at the counter of an ice cream parlor . My mouth watered for a long cool drink in a tinkling glass . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sign confronted us : " No ice today . " As we stood there and discussed real estate with that touch of Midas that makes the whole world kin , one burly realtor swallowed his lukewarm limeade in one gulp , thumped his fist on the counter and shouted in an inspired tone , " I tell you , there 's nothing like it . Florida has the most remarkable all-the-year-round climate in the world . " " Nothing like it in the world , " the crowd responded with the volume of a Metropolitan Opera House chorus . Not one of them felt the humor of the situation . The basso realtor was vigorously wiping his wilting bulk with a towel ? no handkerchief could have risen to the emergency . I was in the heart of the boom country in a town not many miles from Miami . Am I disparaging to call it a town ? The stanch pillars of society ? old residents of four months ? were already regarding it as the metropolis of one hundred and fifty thousand they claimed it would be ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values that would have done credit to Times Square . Enterprising citizens were subdividing " suburbs " ten minutes from the post-office as if they already had the commuting population of Westchester County to draw upon . But town it was and town I shall continue to call it , in spite of the fact that it had grown from two thousand to twelve thousand in less than two years . On the main street were the two leading hotels , an imposing hardware store anticipating the agricultural development of the Everglades to the hinterland , two or three ice cream parlors , a drugstore , four jewelry stores holding out glittering possibilities for the " paper " millionaires , two banks , an apology for a dry goods emporium and all the intervening spaces occupied with real estate offices as strategically placed as pawns on a chessboard . They were everywhere , those real estate offices , stretching out to infinity , even elbowing barbecue stands to attract the passing tourists to the sidewalkless wastes . Nothing daunted them . Across from the hardware store an aggressive realtor , impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal table , some blue-prints and a kitchen chair on a cement floor hardly dry . The masons were still plastering the walls and the roof was a thing of the future . One day I was foolhardy enough to linger in front of a real estate office . I was attracted by a map spread across two wide plate glass windows to advertise a new development not far from Palm Beach . It was . a lovely map with trees and parks and fountains and Venetian- canals and Spanish courtyards and Italian villas , and all the glories of a place that was not yet but soon to be . The whimsical legendary quality of it delighted me like that map of The Heart of Britain 's Empire that hangs over my shelf of the Wisdom of the East series between a marble Chinese Buddha and a brass menorah . But one did not dream long on the streets of that town so close to Miami . A bronzed athlete in white knickers and a soft silk shirt sprang out from behind one of the eight flat top mahogany desks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested in our new development . " " I was just looking , " I protested feebly in my best department store manner . " I see you are interested , " he ignored me severely . " It shows you have imagination and real business sense . Now that 's the biggest thing on the East Coast . Four New York millionaires are back of it and are going to build their winter homes here . " He pointed a finger at a stretch by the sea . " We are going to have two big hotels , arched bridges across the canals , the biggest dance pavilion and the biggest swimming pool in Florida . Almost everything is sold , but here is one beautiful lot for you , " and his pencil hovered temptingly over the magic figure 223 . " But that must be at least two miles from the ocean , and I would n't consider anything but ocean property , " I parried , trying to find a fly in the ointment . " You do n't understand values . This is a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next payment of five thousand in three weeks . Why , you can sell it before the first of December for a hundred thousand dollars . Most exclusive property on the East Coast . You 'll be making a fatal mistake if you do n't take it . I wo n't have any left by the end of the week . " " I 'll think about it over night and let you know in the morning , " I finally extricated myself . I walked toward Broadway , a narrow road between the two principal business streets . On one corner a man 's outfitting store did a rushing business in collars and shirts . Next door a ladies ? toggery shop boasted an equal popularity , for no feminine wardrobe could long withstand the ravages of Florida heat in August . Across the street a grocery displayed wilted lettuce and undersized bananas and occasional peaches , but for the most part the stock consisted of canned goods . An indifferent motion picture house , a lunch room heavy with the smell of frying lard , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Broadway was the telegraph office . From early in the morning until midnight its hospitable doors were open and its patrons oozed into the road . The telegrams ; addressed to relatives and friends in the home town , were more or less of a laconic pattern : Send ten thousand at once . Will triple in four weeks . The post-office was even busier than the telegraph station . Long , wistful queues trailed from all its windows around the corner past the bank . The post-office department still assumed that there were only two thousand people in the town , but anyone who passed the General Delivery window at nine-thirty in the morning was convinced of the twelve thousand . Mail was often delayed several days . One ingenious person with true capitalistic spirit hired a carpenter to build him two thousand pigeon holes with proper fronts and keys . He made some arrangement with the post-office to collect the mail , and he rented out his little boxes for a dollar a month . They were all snapped up in two days . The hotel where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be spending the night in the big leather armchairs in the lobby ? but the taciturn , solemn manager did not raise his prices . Summer rates were summer rates , but one accepted with them summer service . The manager refused to serve meals and he scathingly rebuked three innocent newcomers who attempted to use one of the darkened parlors . Two freckled youngsters from North Carolina ran the elevator . But usually the elevator was out of order , or the two boys were across the street eating ice cream sundaes or carrying ice water ( only there never was any ice ) to someone 's room . The harassed chambermaid struggled to provide . towels , but there never were enough towels to go around . She was a tall , rawboned , overworked woman from the mountains of Tennessee , and at the end of the day after she had finished her two floors she was only too glad to take home your laundry , because she was trying to put her daughter through business college that she might get a job in a real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been poured at her toil worn feet . Everyone ate at Carter 's ? Carter 's , the old-time place that dated back to the days before the boom ? with covered portico over the sidewalk . One might conjure up a picture of fried chicken and waffle dinners served by beaming Negroes in spotless linen , but those dinners have all moved Lip to New York . Besides , one saw very few Negroes in the town . The waitresses were white , and I became well acquainted with them in the month I ate at Carter 's . Their amusing apologies made more endurable the dirty tablecloths and the interminable lunches of red snapper , succotash and bitter iced tea , and the breakfasts of warm prunes and cereal moistened with condensed milk . The cream was always gone or the milk train had not arrived . I am convinced that there are not more than four cows in southern Florida . Min was from Boston and had already bought four lots and had " binders " on two more and was planning to build a house for speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she adopted the motherly-interest attitude and let them all know she was married . Sally just loved to dance , and as she skipped from table to table you forgot that the steak was tough . The proprietor of Carter 's and his roly-poly wife were much more interested in real estate than the restaurant , so they imported a man from Mississippi to run the place . In three days he was interested in real estate , too , and he pencilled fantastic profits on the backs of menus when he should have been ringing up the cash register . He was a little scornful of Florida , though , and explained that back where he came from there was a boom on , too , but one had to put real greenbacks on the table ? no paper profits in Mississippi . On the hotel porch one learned quickly the real estate jargon ? binders , developments , subdivisions , abstracts , titles , escrow . A glib tongue , a leather wallet and a connection with one of the big development companies soon flung another graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pessimists with the withering rebuke , " You have no vision . " The new arrivals from the North were called snowbirds because they kept their coats on , but the second day the coats were off , and usually by the third day the collars were , too . They came from everywhere , from Georgia , Kentucky , Indiana , Ohio , from Nebraska and Wyoming ? all bent on the same quest . For the most part it was a town of men . A New York cartoonist had abandoned art temporarily , hoping to make his pile and clear out quickly . A youth of twenty had left college in the middle of his course because his father thought the experience would be worth two college degrees . A young engineer from Boston had come with aspirations of laying out subdivisions like dream cities , with gardens and streets fragrant with fruit trees , but he had to abandon his utopian ideas to build three-room houses , put up almost overnight and finished with some gay stucco , " Spanish style . " They were not homey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but few people expected to live in them . They served their purpose if they were bought for ten thousand dollars and changed owners for fifteen thousand the following week . A few men were planning to send for their families later when they could buy one of the little stucco houses " Spanish style . " The more ambitious " paper " millionaires were dreaming of Mediterranean cruises and pearl necklaces for the little wife . No one read any books in that town . The news of the world did not break through . The papers carried only real estate new ) , which was avidly devoured . No one talked about anything but real estate . At five in the morning when one went swimming the conversation began with " binders " ; in the cool of the evening when one motored along the shore with the moon shining silver through the fronds of the palm trees , the moon was useful only to point the way to particularly desirable lots that could still be had for a song and turned over at an amazing profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dentist in Miami who owned a one-story building between two hotels , with the hotels bidding against each other for the property . But the wife of the dentist refused $700,000 . She was holding out for three million . All day long and half the night the cars shot through the main artery of the town , old broken-down flivvers with tents and bundles tied grotesquely to the sides , limousines of more aristocratic lineage , cars from Kentucky , Idaho , California , New Jersey , Illinois , from everywhere . There was hope , enthusiasm , and perhaps underneath it all a spirit of adventure that had nothing to do with money . Like the Oregon settlers who left the seekers for California gold at the crossroads , there were some home-builders among them , no doubt , men who wished to turn the Everglades into a tropical paradise of fruit and vegetables for all America . But most of them were seeking fortunes , not homes . The contractor who chartered a freighter to carry to Miami " knock-down " houses of the most approved mail-order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Florida " pioneers as well as the exigencies of the building trade . But I throw another log on the fire and I would not change the thought of skating down the bend , of the Hudson with the wind whipping against my face for a whole winter of golf in Florida . I prefer the home my friends are building with their own hands , stone by stone , across from Tarrytown ? building love and permanence and beauty into it ? to all the Spanish patios in Florida .
