THE Vanderbilt House , beautiful as foam , wasteful , wealthy , incredibly carved , is being tramped through this week by a cross section of the nation to the tune of radios and entertainers . Curiosity knows no caste . The scene by the stairway was a little like Paris tramping through the Tuilleries in ' 92 . Farewell forever , most exquisite of exteriors . WE have lately been receiving let- ters from the Oranges , complaining that THE NEW YORKER has laughed three times at Montclair , but never at the Oranges . Excuse us please . We thought we had laughed at them . We laughed at Newark , and we thought the Oranges were a kind of suburb of Newark . THE Class A Squash season started last week with inter-club matches , and as usual the sporting page features Jay Gould because he almost always defaults .

IT is encouraging to note that one of probably many fields of hashish has been discovered on Long Island and destroyed . As a citizen of the greatest bootlegging nation in history , we have been feeling that the hashish growers have been loafing . Now it appears that they have been busy all along . WHILE in the city , Mrs. Coolidge visited the American Wing of the Metropolitan , occasioning , said the papers , great surprise to the guards . Evidently the guards are cynics .

HARRY SINCLAIR , the eminent worker in crude oils , had occasion lately to call upon the banking house of Brown Brothers , and to interview Mr. James Brown , the dignified senior partner in that conservative establishment . " Morning , Mr. Brown , " said Mr. Sinclair . " I dropped in to say ' hello ' and to get one and one-half millions of dollars . " " How do you do , Mr. Sinclair , " Mr. Brown countered , in great dignity . " And would you mind telling me for what purpose you wish the million and one-half ? " Mr. Sinclair looked at the ceiling ; a puzzled expression settled on his face . " Hanged if I know , " he admitted . " Just a second and I 'll telephone my office and find out . " Clienteles THE George Bellows exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum , which ended last Sunday , was a great success in its way . People went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people and artists , for the most part , say the authorities . And they say it pleasantly , for they feel that exhibits are far just those kinds of people . There is probably something to be learned about George Bellows from this . Those who will go to see the Sargent exhibition in January will be wearing darker clothes and an air more quiet , perhaps less imaginative ; but Bellows was young , that is , young in American art , and the young like him best  --  action , experiment , refusal to accept authority . Unfortunately the machinery of prolonging an exhibition is too complicated for the Museum to face . They would have to write for permission to all the various owners , who are scattered all over the globe , and creating conflicts with the plans of other museums to which some of the pictures are scheduled to go . Certainly if they prolonged it , everybody would be pleased . It has been one of the distinguished occasions this Fall . IT appears that the Sargent exhibi- tion , which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict with a Sargent exhibition in the Royal Academy , which is too bad . It means that a number of paintings that ordinarily could have been sent over , will have to stay in London . There are , of course , enough pictures in this country to make up the deficit , but some important canvases are sure to be lacking . The people of Boston , they say , are the greatest owners of Sar gents in America , and will do their part . ? ISEE by the papers , " said this de-partment 's Exchange Editor , which was considerable of an overstatement , as the only thing he was reading was the Boston Post , " that an ' exclusive night club ' has just opened at Number One Rowe 's Wharf , Boston . And that ' membership is to be confined solely to those whose names are in the Social Register , or prominent in the business and professional world . ' Also one reads , " confided the Exchange Editor , " that the decorative scheme and finishings are to be along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and china imported from Holland , are to figure in the decorations . Oh , yes . And in the ladies ' retiring room , as a background , a life-size statue of the Virgin Mary has been placed in an alcove . Around the dance hall also are several religious statues . And all I know , " concluded the Exchange Editor , " is  --  with best wishes to Will Rogers  --  what I read in the papers . " Mr. Brackett THERE is a little book on the bookstands that apparently has done a service , if service it be , similar to that accredited to the Methodist Council . It is " Week End " by Charles Brackett , ne in Saratoga in " Young man , just what is the difference between alligator and lizard ? " the home of his father , the late Senator Brackett . Not that " Week End " in any way resembles the Methodist Council . But New York has talked about both of them , and both of them have revealed the pleasing fact that Manhattan Islanders and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably is growth . Here comes Mr. Brackett , no less , with his little piece of sophisticated froth , which the New York reading public seizes upon with avidity , and which the hinterlands refuse to take up at all . The open spaces , it seems , can stand Carl Van Vechten , but not Charles Brackett . MR . BRACKETT has come up from obscurity like the rest of us , but through the channel of the Saturday Evening Post . He is said by his intimates to be just like his book , which means that he is slim , sophisticated , young , and sensible to aesthetics , both healthy and faintly off color . He lives alternately in Saratoga and Europe ; with him lives a witty and charming wife who keeps in order a dainty but completely mid-Victorian house . He is quoted as having said that he has not scrapped the old furniture with the antimacassars , because its fustiness helps him think up naughty things to say . But more likely it is mistaken sentiment that keeps them there . Mrs. Brackett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sent a baby cap to Gloria Swanson when the famous baby was horn , and received it hack from Gloria 's secretary with a note to the effect that Gloria had decided not to accept any more baby caps . Gloria softened the rebuff , however , by putting her crest on the note paper . THERE are other books beside " Week End " which enjoy a lively circulation in New York without having to appear on the official lists of best sellers . Among them are Mr. Bodenheim 's " Replenishing Jessica " ( bootleg ) , Aldous Huxley 's translation of Remy de Gourmont 's " Virgin Heart " , Cyril Hume 's " Cruel Fellowship " , and Alec ' Waugh 's " Kept " ; not any of which are books for children . A bookseller tells us all this . We have read all but one of them at some time or other and were either interested or amused . There are odd things about localities OHTsEERS shown up by hooks . For example , Sherwood Anderson derives his support chiefly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , with secondary support from Birmingham , Alabama , a mining town . Mr. Arlen 's well advertised book , " The Green Hat " , having scaled Parnassus , has dropped to twenty-fifth on the fiction list , but is going stronger than ever in Lancaster and Wilkes-Barre , Pennsylvania . " Glorious Apollo " , the bookseller says , is liked everywhere . Cross Purpose THE United Artists ' offices in town , whence pour the negatives of our greater screen luminaries , were in furor lately . The cause was the receipt of a telegram from Sir Charles Chaplin 's Eighth Assistant Chamberlain , bearing this command : SEE MARK CROSS AT ONCE STOP TELL HIM COME TO HOLLYWOOD FIRST TRAIN STOP To Mr. Charles Moyer , Sir Chaplin 's representative , this did not seem wholly logical . What Mark Cross ? The leather merchant of Fifth Avenue ? Mr. Moyer wired hack for enlightenment . " The Mark Cross , " he was answered in phrasing which plainly added " Do What You 're Told ! " But investigation only deepened the mystery , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street informed the movie emissaries that there was no Mr. Mark Cross , that he had founded a shop in 1845 in England , that his memory was lost in the company 's archives . There was , however , Mr. Patrick Francis Murphy . No , said the movie emissaries , he would not do . The telegram specified Mr. Mark Cross . It was a full week before the great minds called into consultation in the United Artists ' office were able to deduce that the person urgently required in Hollywood was Mr. Milt Gross , whose quaint interpretations of our local patois have almost won for the Sunday World forgiveness for printing Mutt and Jeff and the Red Magic section . SIR CHARLES CHAPLIN was attracted to Mr. Milt Gross during his last visit to town . The Grossian accounts of dumbwaiter conversations proved highly amusing to Chariot and he moved to arrange a meeting with their author . An enduring friendship was cemented during that very first meeting , for Sir Charles and Mr. Gross held forth nearly twenty-four hours in discussions of what might he humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his new acquaintance had the most original mind he had ever encountered . Come to Hollywood and supply me with ideas , he invited . I 'll teach you what I know about movies ; and in a year , or so , you can become the best director on the Coast . Thus , and with such minor items as salary agreed upon , they parted . It was when he was settled on the Pacific Coast again that Sir Charles issued instructions to his retainers to summon the most original mind he had yet encountered . The name escaped him ; was it Mr. Addison Sims ? no ; not that . It was Mr. Mark Cross , said Sir Charles . And so Mr. Milt Gross has gone to Hollywood . Spontaneous A spontaneous gaiety as New York has to offer is hard upon us in the celebration associated with the Army-Navy game . There was nothing quite so pathetic , to my sentimental mind , as the sight , a few weeks ago , of the Cadets marching into the Yale Bowl in formation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose , still in formation . The stark austerity of too oft swept barrack rooms is a gaunt suggestion which hovers over them ; their mad young enthusiasm 4 THE NEWYORKEII over those eleven of them free enough to be out on the field battling , is enough to bring tears . This Saturday both cheering sections will be packed with convicts , on their brief parole . And the city will shudder under the released energy , the frantic gulping of the cup of joy , the frenzied wrestling for it , spilling precious drops in the struggle . For a few hours this week-end there will be , undoubtedly , genuine gaiety in our cabarets , hoarse , joyous singing in our taxi cabs , Wine , women , and song will be live pleasures , not symbols . There is talk of price raising , disavowal of it , wrangle among procurers . And it matters not . These boys from the prison camps once a year can squeeze joy out of the pounding of cobble stones , desperately trying to keep out of step . ? MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his writings , has not dismissed humor wholly from his life . He was travelling on a Long Island train lately , which stopped at the Port Washington station . Looking out of the window , he saw a goat , of the Billy persuasion , standing about  --  but , surprisingly , it had no beard . Near the goat was an elder of the village , liberally be-whiskered . The situation was too much for the gay Don . He opened the window near his seat and shouted : " Give that goat back his beard ! " The bewhiskered elder started at this gruff command . Then , as titters among the people around grew to guffaws , he became indignant . " Say , who are you ! " he riposted . " A friend of the goat , " said Mr. Marquis , calmly . Hobby PERHAPS the perfect combination of idealism and practability in riding a hobby has been achieved by Mr. Louis Comfort Tiffany , who , as might be expected , has a kindly feeling for young artists not yet on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to mind by the current show at the Art Center , which is the sixth in the annual series of exhibits of the work of the Tiffany students . Mr. Tiffany 's plan is simplicity itself , He merely encourages promising youngsters to paint , or to sculp , lending them aid in this manner : Each Spring a committee of artists selects a dozen works from those submitted by students the country over . The twelve youths who did the chosen pieces are thereupon invited to become Mr. Tiffany 's guests in his spacious Oyster Bay home . They are free , then , to do what they like ; paint , loaf , study . But every month a weeding-out process is put into action . The mere triflers are dropped and others , if vacancies are made , invited instead . Thus , some years , the entire dozen survive the Summer and , in other years , only two , or three of the original group remain until October . In November the students pack up their traps and return to their garrets . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at the annual show thereafter . Only one criticism of the workings of the plan ever has been voiced ; and this concerns the conservatism of the artists who select the successful stu dents . It is said that a tendency towards modernism is not kindly regarded  --  but , then , wherever has there been unanimity among artists about art ? Audience MR . FRITZ KREISLER is not one of those ardent souls who devote vacation times to expending three times as much physical effort as they ever would endure under the guise of work . When he rests , he rests ; and last Summer , spent in a camp in the Maine woods , was no exception to the virtuoso 's general rule . This odd conception of rest did not appeal , however , to the personal guide attached to Mr. Kreisler by the management of the camp . " He no fish ; he no hunt , " the guide complained . " Pay me $4.50 a day , and all I got to do is sit around and listen to him play damn fiddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts once more wrung at the spectacle of Fate playing that indomitable actress a scurvy trick . Once again a good play has slipped through fingers which have not enjoyed a clutch on many good plays since Mr. Frohman died . It will be remembered that the leading rile of " The Swan " was offered to Miss Burke , but that , on the advice of her consort , Mr. Ziegfeld , she declined it . On the opening night of that enchanting comedy ( which ran for two seasons ) , her face was a study in scarlet and next morning at five the dejected Ziegfeld was found still aimlessly prowling the oblivious city , reluctant to go home . Now Ina Claire is enjoying a prodigious success in " The Last of Mrs. Cheyney " , which was written or at least started as a play for Billie Burke . Indeed , the faithless Lonsdale wrote the first act while he was a pampered guest at Burkeleigh-on-Hudson . But his notion of what its title role would require must have undergone a sea change , for , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after a loophole was discovered in the contract and he was assured that its producer in America would have a free rein in casting it . Miss Burke 's lawyers wrote letters at once ominous and crushing to Mr. Dillingham , but that jaunty impresario , who rushed off to Hot Springs last week after a flagrantly successful Autumn , seemed unperturbed . This time Mr. Ziegfeld must he aglow with the consciousness that none of Mr. Lonsdale 's inexplicable recalcitrance could possibly be laid on his doorstep . Indeed , he made a bold , striking gesture to rescue the comedy from the younger actress . For , after Mr. Dillingham had sent the script to Miss Claire , but before she had agreed to play it , Mr. Ziegfeld stepped in with a handsome offer to star her in musical comedy , with ten per cent of the gross for herself , a guarantee of $2,500 a week and other sweet perquisites . Miss Claire saw fit to decline but at least , if she is now playing in " The Last of Mrs. Cheyney " , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Insfice ON the sidewalks of Copley Square , amid the throngs there assembled for the Harvard-Yale football game , moved a small , squat man . " Tickets for th ' game , gents ; tickets for th ' game , " thus he whispered . The swarth person waxed rich as game time approached . That is the preliminary ; the aftermath took place on one of the special trains , wherein , thundering back from Boston after the game was held a large crap game . And among those most heatedly at work with the tumbling ivories , was our swarth fried , the ticket speculator of Copley Square , making wagers against some of those who had been his victims earlier in the day . The train shunted into Grand Central . The swarth personage held in one fist a lone twenty dollar bill . " I lose twenty-four hun'red , gentlemen , " he announced , glumly . " Th ' day 's profits an ' four hun'red more . " And the scurrying company of redcaps running along the station platform wondered why such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. David H.
