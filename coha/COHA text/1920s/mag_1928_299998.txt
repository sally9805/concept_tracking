Charles Wakefield Cadman considered , George Gershwin dickered , Irving Berlin contracted last week to write musical themes for the new sound-pictures , the audible cinema . The field offers each composer good opportunity to apply his peculiar virtuosity . Each will certainly receive rich fees . The movies can afford to pay . A single picture house , the Roxy Theatre , in Manhattan , rarely receives less than $110,000 a week from admissions . Its income for four weeks of Street Angel ( with Movietone ) was $479,000 . That , however , was a record run . <P> Irving Berlin 's deal was with United Artists Corp. , to write a musical revue based on " Say it with Music , " popular song of his first Music Box Revue ( 1921 ) . Associate producer is to be George White ( Scandals ) , who last week declared that he was quitting the stage for sound-pictures . So the genre of the proposed Berlin work is obvious , quite like the music of The Cocoanuts , which he composed for the four Marx brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florenz Ziegfeld . How much Composer Berlin will get for this work neither he nor President Joseph M. Schenck of United Artists last week would say . <P> Fox Case Corp . ( makers of Movietone ) three weeks ago offered George Gershwin tens of thousands to let them use his tiresomely admired " Rhapsody in Blue " and to write incidental cinema music for them . He was cagey about terms and coy about the picture work . Although he publicly declared that he would not write music for the cinema , last week he was still considering Fox offers . <P> That Charles Wakefield Cadman was considering the cinemas came as surprising news . He writes orthodox music ; the Metropolitan Opera produced his Shanewis . His principal resemblance to Composers Berlin and Gershwin is in his face : the three men have aqueline , bony faces , high foreheads , strong jaws . Musically , the three are scattered . The two Jews write so that people sing their songs . Cadman , although by no means profound , writes for listeners . The Gershwins and Berlin are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parlor and concert hall . Berlin is admittedly no musician . But Gershwin is . And both are nimble tumblejacks with chords . Cadman , people find , who have followed his 25 years of music from organ compositions to Indian songs and finally operas , is rigid in his style . They ask : Can he adapt himself to popular sound-pictures ; will he debase himself to commercialism ? Few of them know that he lives in Hollywood .
