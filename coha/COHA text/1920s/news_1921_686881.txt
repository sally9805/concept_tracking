txt There are approximately 6,000,060 unemployed in the country today.6 For these men and women and to their dependents there Is one paramount issue . It is work . But Mr. Samuel Gompers , Mr. William Sen. nings Bryan , and other Democratic politicians In house and senate have begun a beating of the tom-toms , and the tune Is an old one . The copsmon people are being betrayed again , and the obvious inference is that they must turn to Mr. Bryan , Mr. Gompers , Mr. Kitchln , and the Democratic leaders to save them . If It Is good sense to trust the same guides who got you into a bog to get you out , the Democrats . including , of course , Mr. Bryan , Mr. Gompers , and Mr. Kitchin , should be called back at once . Mr. Gompers ' organization prejudges the proposed tax revision , which Is characteristic of Mr. Gompers ' Democratio parttsanism . It demands on behalf of the idle workers " something real , something constructive , something that will not ddd - to their burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to mean the retention of the excess profits tax and the present-scale of higher Income surtaxes . The federation views the raising of exemptions affecting the small taxpayer as " a sop thrown to the people . " Mr. Gompers wants 613 retention of the excess profits tax . He pretends that to repeal it Is to relieve the " war millionaires and great corporations . " , We think Mr. Gompers knows better . If ho does not , he ought to make an b ? nest inquiry into the facts , If he will do that , not as a member of the Democratic party machine but as a real friend of the idle workers , lie will find that the excess profits tax does not work as be thinks or pretends to think it does . Fair students of , taxation , who are as sincerely anxious for a just distribution of taxes as Mr. Gompers or Mr. Bryan . and we think a good deal sincerer , hold that the li tax is worse than Ineffective , since it resulted in the pyramiding of prices as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Mr. Gompers knows it has been failure , and perhaps Mr. Kitchin does , too . But the temptation to make polifIcal capital of the fallacy on which the tax was built Is too great to be resisted . There is no respect for the facts shown in the A. F. of L. pronouncement nor in most of the attacks made on the tax revision program in congress . The Democrats are responsible for the present taxation . It is human that they should try to ignore Its faults , but they ought to have enough concern for the country , now in a serious condition of business stagnation and unemployment , to drop demagogy and try to_the work out a revision which will relieve constructive business and stimulate it to go forward . Mr. Gompers is talking nobly about the 8,000,000 idle workers , but he is acting like a small bore unscrupulous politician . His appeal Is not to facts or to reason but to class prejudice and Ignorance . The country In the present situation deserves better from him and from the other Democratic leaders who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to block the measures which by stimulating business confidence and enterprise should presently bring relict . Six million Americans want . jobs . They are not going to get them under the guidance of Messrs . Bryan , Gompers , and Kitchin.
