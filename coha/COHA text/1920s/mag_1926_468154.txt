THE Greeks , who seem , in the enchantment of distance , to have progressed more rapidly than any other people in history , have left us hardly any discussion of progress in all their varied literature . There is a fine passage in Xschylus where Prometheus tells how his discovery of fire brought civilization to mankind , and where in fifty lines he gives such a summary of the stages in cultural development as would be considered immorally modern in Tennessee . And there is a fleeting reference to progress in a fragment of Euripides ' ( The Suppliants . ) But there is no mention of the idea in Xenophon 's recollections of Socrates or in Plato ; and Aristotle 's cold conservatism puts the notion implicitly out of court . The Greeks conceived history for the most part as a vicious circle ; and the conclusion of Lucretius , that " all things are always the same " strikes tl- note of classic opinion on the subject from Zeno to Aurelius . The Stoics counselled men to expect nothing of the future . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the late Mr. Bradley , that this is " the best of all possible worlds , and everything in it is a necessary evil . " Hegesias , the Cyrenaic , pronounced life worthless , and advocated suicide ; doubtless he lived as long as Schopenhauer . Pessimism was to be expected in an Athens that had lost its freedom ; but the same despair sounds in Roman letters at every stage of Roman history . Horace is a praiser of times past ; Tacitus and Juvenal deplore the degeneracy of their age ; and Virgil turns from his fancies of a new Saturnian glory to phrase with his melodious felicity the gloomy notion of an Eternal Recurrence , a perpetual cycle and aimless repetition of events : " There will again be a Tiphys and another Argo to carry beloved heroes ; there will be also other wars , and great Achilles will again be sent to Troy . " The hourglass of aeons will turn itself around and pour out the unaltered past into an empty and delusively novel present . There is nothing new under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . What were the causes of the hostility or apathy of the Greeks to the idea of progress ? Was it due , as Bury thinks , to the brevity of their historical experience , the very rapidity with which their civilization reached its apex and sank again ? Or was it due to their comparative poverty in written records of the past , and a consequent absence of the perspective which might have made them realize the marvel of their own advances ? They too had had a Middle Age , and had climbed for a thousand years from barbarism to philosophy ; but only towards the end of that ascent had writing graduated from bills of lading to the forms of literature . Parchment was too costly to be wasted on mere history . Or again , was this unconcern with progress due to the arrested development of Greek industry , the failure of the Greeks to move appreciably beyond the technology of Crete , or to produce in quantity those physical comforts which are at the base of the modern belief in progress ? In our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the notion of progress in abeyance , while the hope of heaven became the center of existence . Belief in another world seems to vary directly with poverty in this one , whether in the individual or in the group . When wealth grows , heaven falls out of the focus , and becomes thin and meaningless . But for a thousand years the thought of it dominated the minds of men . Wealth came to Western Europe with the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution ; and as it multiplied it displaced the hope of heaven with the lure of progress . That greatest event in modern history ? the Copernican revelation of the astronomic unimportance " of the earth made many tender souls unhappy ; but its reduction of heaven to mere sky and space compelled the resilient spirit of man to form for itself a compensatory faith in an earthly paradise . Campanella , More , and Bacon wrote Utopias , and announced the coming of universal happiness . Europe , nouveau riche , imported luxuries and exported its asceticism and its saints . Trade made cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , and industry made progress . Gargantua writes to Pantagruel , " All the world is full of savants , learned teachers , vast libraries . " " In one century " ( the fifteenth ) , says Pierre de La Ramee , " we have seen a greater progress in men and works of learning than our ancestors had seen in the whole course of the previous fourteen centuries . " This has an uncomfortably contemporary sound ; what century has not heard some spacious self-estimate of this kind ? But it was the keynote of the Renaissance ; we hear it as an organ point in every line of Francis Bacon ; it strikes the dominant chord of the modern soul ; and the idea of progress is for modern Europe what the hope of heaven was for medieval Christendom . If man does not really progress , then the last prop of our faith is fallen , and we stand frustrate andridiculous in the sight of the smiling stars . This dearest dogma of the modern mind found its most confident expression in the exuberant optimism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preferred America 's savages , whom he had not met , to the cruel Parisians who had rasped his nerves ; he thought that thinking was a form of degeneracy , and preached a Golden Age of the past that was obviously a N achschein , as Teufelsdroeck would say , of the Garden of Eden and the Fall of Man . But when we come to the irrepressible Voltaire we catch at first breath the exhilarating air of the Enlightenment . This " Grand Seigneur of the mind " had no delusions about the Indians ; he knew that man was better off under civilization than under savagery ; he was grateful for the slow and imperfect taming of the human brute ; and he preferred Paris to the Garden of Eden . It was his disciples Turgot and Condorcet who made the idea of progress the moving spirit of our day . Condorcet , escaping in 1793 from that consistently savage Rousseauian , Robespierre , wrote , far from his books and his friends , one of the most optimistic books ever penned by man ? Sketch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having finished this magnanimous prophecy of the coming glory of mankind , Condorcet fled from Paris , was captured at a village inn , and confined in the village jail . The next morning lie was found dead on the floor of his cell . He had always carried about with him a phial of poison to cheat the guillotine . To read Condorcet is to realize to what a bitterly disillusioned and skeptical generation we belong . What eloquence he pours forth on the subject of print ! ? lie is sure it will redeem and liberate mankind ; he has no premonition of the modern press . " Nature has indissolubly united the advancement of knowledge with the progress of liberty , virtue , and respect for the natural rights of man . " Prosperity will " naturally dispose men to humanity , to benevolence , and to justice . " And then he formulates one of the most famous and characteristic doctrines of the Enlightment : " No bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties ; the perfectibility of man is absolutely indefinite ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every power that would impede it , has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us . " In his final chapter Condorcet draws a tempting picture of the future ( by which he means our time ) . As knowledge spreads , slavery will decrease among classes and among nations ; " then will come the moment in which the sun will observe free nations only , acknowledging no other master than their reason ; in which tyrants and slaves , priests and their stupid or hypocritical instruments , will no longer exist but in history and upon the stage . " Woman will be emancipated from man , the worker from the employer , the subject from the king ; perhaps , even , mankind will unlearn war . And Condorcet concludes passionately : " How admirably calculated is this view of the human race to console the philosopher lamenting the errors , the flagrant acts of injustice , the crimes with which the earth is still polluted ! It is the contemplation of this prospect that rewards him for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishmeal of ll-Te dares to regard these &on:,; a. , , e eternal chain of the destiuy of mankind ; and in this persuasion he finds the true delight of , lying performed a no vicissitude wig , - sentiment is the asylum into which he retires , and to which the memory of his persecutors can not follow him ; he unites himself in imagination with man restored to his rights , delivered from oppression , and proceeding with rapid strides in the path of happiness ; he forgets his own misfortunes ; . . . he lives no longer to adversity , calumny , and malice , but becomes the associate of these wiser and more fortunate beings whose enviable condition he so earnestly contributed to produce . " ? What courageous optimism ! what idealism ! what a noble passion for humanity , and for truth ! Shall we scorn more the na ? ve enthusiasm of Condorcet or that intellectual sloth and moral cowardice which have held us back from realizing his prophecies ? Behind these splendid philosophies lay the Commercial and Industrial Revolutions . Here were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some of the luxuries of life at an unprecedented speed , and in undreamed-of quantity ; it was only a matter of time when all vital needs would be met , and poverty would disappear . Bentham and the elder Mill thought , about 1830 , that England could now afford universal education for its people , and that with universal education all serious social problems would be solved by the end of the century . Buckle 's History of Civilization ( 1857 ) stimulated the hope that the spread of knowledge would mitigate human ills . Two years later Darwin spoke ; the secularization of the modern mind was enormously advanced , and the idea of a coming Utopia replaced not merely the geographical heaven , but the legendary golden past . Spencer identified progress with evolution , and looked upon it , to a certain point , as an inevitable thing . Meanwhile inventions poured from a thousand alert minds ; riches visibly grew ; nothing seemed hard or impossible to science ; the stars were weighed , and men accepted bravely the age-long challenge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we not believe of him , in those happy days before the War ? II Of course there had been some philosophic doubts of progress long before the Great Madness came . Fontenelle , in his Dialogues of the Dead ( 1683 ) , had pictured Socrates and Montaigne discussing the question ? presumably in hell , where all philosophers go . Socrates is anxious to hear of the advances that mankind has made since his fatal cup ; he is astounded to learn that men are still brutes , incapable of dying without metaphysics . Montaigne assures him that the world has degenerated ; there are no longer such powerful types as Pericles , Aristides , or Socrates himself . The old philosopher shrugs his shoulders . " In our days , " be says , " we esteemed our ancestors more than they deserved ; and now our posterity esteems us more than we deserve . There is really no difference between our ancestors , ourselves , and our posterity . C'est toujours la meets chose . " And Fontenelle 's summary is judicious : " The heart always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues , vices unaltered ; knowledge increasing . " " The development of humanity , " said Eckermann , " seems to be a matter of thousands of years . " " Who knows ? " replied Goethe , " perhaps of millions . But let humanity last as long as it will , there will always be hindrances in its way , and all kinds of distress , to make it develop its powers . Men will become cleverer and more intelligent , but not better , nor happier , nor more effective in action , at least except for a limited period . I see the time coming when God will take no pleasure in the race , and must again proceed to a rejuvenated creation . " " The motto of history , " says Schopenhauer , " should run : Eadem , sed aliter " ? the same theme , but with variations . Mankind does not progress , said Nietzsche , it does not even exist ; or it is a vast physiological laboratory where a ruthless Nature forever makes experiments ; where some things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concludes Romantic Germany . About 1890 Arthur Balfour suggested , in his genially devastating way , that human behavior and social organization are founded not on thought , which progresses , but on feeling and instinct , which remain almost unchanged ; so he explained the apparent failure of our increased knowledge to give us greater happiness or more lasting peace . " He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow . " In all the world , " said Anatole France ( if we may believe Brousson ) , " the unhappiest creature is man . It is said , ' Man is the lord of creation . ' My friend , man is the lord of suffering . " The socialist critique of modern industry did some damage to our faith in human progress . The endeavor to Make people vividly realize the injustices of the present took the form of idealizing the content and peacefulness of the forgotten past . Ruskin , Carlyle , Morris , Kropotkin , and Carpenter painted pictures of the Middle Ages that made one long to be a serf attached to the soil and owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's wife . Meanwhile the liberal critique of modern politics , exposing corruption and incapacity in almost every office , made us doubt the divinity of democracy , which had been for a century our sacred cow . The development of printing and the Hoe press resulted rather in the debasement of the better minds than in the elevation of the worse ; mediocrity triumphed in politics , in religion , in literature , even in science ( Nordic anthropology , barn-yard eugenics , Viennese psychology , pragmatist philosophy ) . The " art " of the moving picture replaced the drama ; photography drove painting from realism to cubism , futurism , pointillisme and other symptoms of cultured neurosis ; in Rodin sculpture ceased to carve and tried to paint ; in Strauss and Ravel and Scriabine music began to rival the delicate melodies of Chinese pots and pans . And finally came the War . We discovered then how precariously thin our coat of civilization was , how insecure our security , and how frail our liberties . War had decreased in frequency and had increased in extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , became the angel of death , killing with a precision and a rapidity that reduced the wars of the Middle Ages to the level of college athletics . Brave aviators dropped bombs upon women and children , and learned chemists described the virtues of poison gas . All the international amity built up by a century of translated literatures , cooperating scientists , educational exchanges , commercial relationships , and financial interdependence melted away , and Europe fell apart into a hundred hostile nationalities . When it was all over it appeared that the victors as well as the fallen had lost the things for which they had fought ; that a greedy imperialism had merely passed from Potsdam to Paris ; that violent dictatorships were replacing orderly and constitutional rule ; that democracy was dying , or dead . Hope faded away ; the generation which had lived through the War could no longer believe in anything ; a wave of apathy and cynicism engulfed all but the youngest and least experienced souls . The idea of progress seemed now to be one of the shallowest delusions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a vain idealism and a monstrous futility . III Perhaps , nevertheless , progress is real ? " If you wish to converse with me , " said Voltaire , " define your terms . " What shall we mean by " progress " ? Subjective definitions will not do ; we must not conceive progress in terms of the spread of any one religion , or any one nation , or any one code of morals ; an increase of kindness , for example , might scandalize our young Nietzscheans . Is an objective definition possible ? one that would hold for any individual , any group , even for any species ? Let us provisionally define progress as increasing control of the environment ; and let us mean by environment all the circumstances , external and internal , that condition the realization of desire . Progress is the domination of matter by form , of chaos by mind and purpose . Spencer was right and Huxley was wrong ; evolution and progress are one ; they are both of them the conquest of the environment by life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in man is simplified almost to a platitude . By common consent , human knowledge is increasing ; and by common consent knowledge is power ; the power of man over his environment grows visibly year by year . What shall we say of this argument ? We must guard against loose thinking . We may not compare the worst ( or the best ) of our age with the selected best ( or worst ) of all the past . If we find that our philosophers are slighter than Plato , our sculptors less than Angelo , our painters inferior to Raphael , our poets and composers a little short of Shakespeare and Bach , we need not despair ; these stars did not all shine on the same night . Our problem is whether the total and average level of human ability has increased , and is increasing . That it has increased since the earliest known state of man is hardly to be doubted . Under the complex strains of city life we take imaginative refuge in the quiet simplicity of savage days ; but in our sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our actual tasks ; like so many of our youthful opinions , this idolatry of barbarism is merely an impatient expression of our adolescent maladaptation . A study of such savage tribes as survive on our sophisticated planet shows their high rate of infantile mortality , their short tenure of life , their inferior speed , their inferior stamina , their inferior will , and their superior plagues . The friendly and flowing savage is like Nature ? delightful except for the insects . But the savage might turn the argument around and inquire how we enjoy our wars and our polities , and whether we think ourselves happier than the tribes whose names resound in the text-books of anthropology . The believer in progress will have to admit that we have made too much progress in the art of war ; and that our politicians would have adorned the Roman Forum in the days of Milo and Clodius , ? though we may consider Mr. Coolidge an appreciable improvement upon Nero . As to happiness , no man can say ; it is too elusively subjective to lend itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon wealth . We are making sufficient progress in wealth . Our thousand fads of diet and drugs predispose us to the belief that we must be ridden with disease as compared with the men of simpler days ; but this is an illusion . There is one test of health ? and , therefore , in part of happiness ? which is objective and reliable , we find it in the mortality statistics of insurance companies , where inaccuracy is ruinous . In some cases these figures extend over three hundred years ; in Geneva , for example , they show an average length of life of twenty years in 1600 , and of forty years in 1000 . In the United States , in 1920 , if we may believe Professor Irving Fisher , the tenure of life averaged fifty-three . This is incredible , if true . Taking the figures for granted , we may conclude that if life is a boon at all , we are unquestionably progressing in the quantity of it which we manage to maintain . Having made these admissions and modifications , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total perspective which is philosophy . When we look at history in the large we see it as a graph of rising and falling cultures ? nations and civilizations appearing and disappearing as on some gigantic film . But in that irregular movement of countries and that chaos of men certain great moments stand out as the peaks and essence of human history , as the stairway of the progress of mankind . Step by step man has climbed from the savage to the scientist ; and these are the stages in his growth . First , speech . Think of it not as a sudden achievement , nor as a gift of thegods , but as the slow development of articulate expression , through centuries of effort , from the mate-calls of animals to the lyric flights of poetry . Without words , generalization would have been stopped in its beginnings , and thought would have stayed where we find it in the brute . The infinite subtlety of the modern mind , as in an Einstein or an Anatole France , was made possible by the development of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate , gave him a greater compass on the earth , and offered him as food a thousand things inedible before . But above all it made him master of the night ; it shed an animating brilliance over the hours of evening and the dawn . Picture the dark before man conquered it : even now the terrors of that primitive blackness survive in our traditions and perhaps in our blood . Our overspreading of the night with a million man-made stars has brightened the human spirit , and made for a vivacious jollity in modern life . We can not be too grateful for the light . Third , agriculture . Civilization was impossible in the hunting stage ; it needed a permanent habitat , a settled way of life . It came with the home and the school ; and these could not be till the products of the field replaced the animals of the forest or the herd as the food of man . The hunter found his quarry with increasing difficulty , while the women whom he left at home tended an ever more fruitful soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her independent of the male ; and for his own lordship 's sake he forced himself at last to bend his back to the prosaic tasks of tillage . So woman domesticated man , as she domesticated the cow and the pig . His domestication , his taming , still goes on , and is far enough from being complete : he is born for hunting rather than for agriculture or industry ; hence his cruelty , his orgies of violence , his restlessness , and his occasional relish for war . But woman and civilization are winning ; the hunting propensities are weaker ; the male is becoming a pacifist and a vegetarian , and discovers the pleasures of the home at the very time when his wife has exhausted them . Fourth , the conquest of animals . Our memories are too forgetful and our imaginations too unimaginative to let us realize the boon we have in our security from the larger and sub-human beasts of prey . Animals are now our playthings and our helpless food ; but there was a time when every step from but or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth was still undecided between beast and man . Fifth , social organization . Here too is a gift unfelt , because we arc born within the charmed circle of its protection , and never understand its value till we wander into the disordered or solitary regions of the earth . God knows that our congresses and parliaments are dubious inventions , the distilled mediocrity of the land ; but despite them we manage to enjoy a security of life and property which we shall appreciate more warmly when war or revolution shall have reduced us to primitive " liberty . " After all , we must not excite ourselves too much about political corruption or democratic mismanagement ; politics is not life , but only a graft upon life ; under its vulgar melodrama the traditional order of society gently persists in the family , in the school , in the thousand subtle forces that change our native anarchism into some measure of co-operation and good-will . Without consciousness of it , we partake of a luxurious patrimony of social order built up for us by a hundred generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transmitted wealth . What ingrates we mortals are ! Sixth , ? morality . Only a disordered mind can suppose that there is an excess of morality in this world ; despite the songs of Zarathustra we see no immediate need of men becoming " more evil . " Let us congratulate ourselves on any moral improvement that appears in our race . We are a slightly gentler speciesthan we were ; capable of greater kindness , and of generosity even to distant peoples whom we have never seen , or who have been our recent enemies . We still kill criminals ; but we are more uneasy about it , and the number of crimes for which we mete out the ultimate punishment has rapidly decreased . We still exploit our immigrant labor , but we must soothe our consciences with " welfare work . " Our prevailing mode of marriage , chaotic as it is , represents a pleasant refinement on marriage by capture or purchase , and le droit de seigneur . The emancipation of women , despite the biological problems which it entails , indicates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was unknown to primitive man , ur was only a hunger of the flesh , has flowered into a magnificent garden of song and sentiment , in which the passion of a man for a maid , though vigorously rooted in physical need , rises like a fragrance into the realm of living poetry . Seventh , tools . In the face of the romantics , the machine-wreckers of li terature , the pleaders for a return to the primitive soil ( dirt , chores , snakes , cobwebs , bugs ) , we sing the song of the tools , the engines , the machines that are liberating man . These multiplying inventions are the new organs with which we control our environment ; we do not need to grow them on our bodies , as animals must ; we make them and use them and lay them aside till we need them again . We grow gigantic arms that build in a day the pyramids that once enslaved a million men ; we make for ourselves great eyes that search out the invisible stars of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life ; we speak , if we wish , with quiet voices that reach across continents and seas ; and we move over the land and the air with the freedom of timeless gods . What more astounding romance could there be than the story of Icarus ' dream and Leonardo 's patient diagrams , and then that triumphant leap into the air by the modest and undiseourageable Wrights ? Granted that mere speed is worthless : it is as a symbol of persistent human will that the airplane has its highest meaning for us ; long chained , like Prometheus , to the earth , we have freed ourselves at last , and now we can look the skylark in the face .. . . No , these tools will not conquer us . Our present defeat by the machinery around us is a transient thing , a plateau in our progress to a slaveless world . The menial labor that degraded both master and man is lifted from human shoulders and harnessed to the tireless muscles of iron and steel ; power becomes cheaper than brute brawn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy into factories and homes , and man will be freed for the tasks of the mind . The slave will be emancipated not by revolution but by growth . The proletariat will not dictate , it will disappear . Eighth , science . In a large degree Buckle was right we progress only in knowledge , and these other gifts are rooted in the slow enlightenment of the mind . Here in the modest nobility of research and the silent battles of the laboratory is a story fit to balance the chicanery of politics and the futile barbarism of war . Here man is at his best , and through darkness and persecution mounts steadily towards the light . Behold him standing on a little planet , measuring , weighing , analyzing invisible constellations ; predicting the vicissitudes of earth and sun and moon and witnessing the birth and death of worlds . Or here is a seemingly unpractical mathematician tracking new formulas through laborious labyrinths , clearing the way for an endless chain of inventions that will multiply the power of his race . Here is a bridge : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel flung bravely from shore to distant shore and bearing the passage of countless men ; here is poetry if your soul is not dead ! Or this eitylike building mounting audaciously into the sky , guarded against every strain by thecourage of our calculations , and shining like diamond-studded granite in the night . Here shall you find new dimensions , and new elements , and new atoms , and new powers . Here in the rocks is the autobiography of evolving life . Here in the laboratories biology prepares to remake living organisms as physics has remade the face of the earth . Everywhere you come upon them studying , these unpretentious , unrewarded men ; you hardly understand where their devotion finds its source and nourishment ; they will die before the trees they plant will bear fruit for mankind . But they go on . Yes , it is true that this victory of man over matter has not been matched with any kindred victory of man over himself . The argument for progress falters here . Psychology has hardly begun to understand , much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stand at the cradle of this new and hazardous science ; we sec it passing through psychoanalysis , behaviorism , glandular mythology , and other diseases of adolescence ; and we might well despair of anything so harassed and muddled at its birth . But psychology will survive these storms and ills ; it will be matured by the responsibilities which it audaciously undertakes . Three hundred years ago Francis Bacon , standing at the infancy of modern physics , predicted a thousand marvels to be found and formed by physical research . How moderate those predictions seem beside their multiple fulfilment ! And what if psychology were entering now upon a like development ; what if another Bacon should map its territory , point out the objectives of its attack , and the " fruits and powers " to be won : which of us , knowing the surprises of history and the courage of man , would dare to set a limit to the achievements that will come from our growing knowledge of the mind ? Perhaps man , having remade his environment , will turn round at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More and more completely we pass on to the next generation the gathered wisdom of the past . It is almost a contemporary innovation , this tremendous expenditure of wealth and labor in the equipment of schools and the provision of instruction for all ; perhaps it is the most significant feature of our time . Only a child would complain that the world has not yet been totally remade by our spreading schools , our free colleges , and our teeming universities ; in the perspective of history this great experiment but begins . It has not had time to prove itself ; it can not in a generation undo the ignorance and superstition of a thousand years . But already the results appear , like the first green shoots of April 's soil . Why is it that , broadly speaking , tolerance and freedom of the mind flourish more easily in the North than in South , if not because the South has not yet won enough wealth to build enough schools ? Who knows how much of our preference for mediocrity in office , and narrowness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impoverished foreign lands , or too occupied with a primitive environment to spare time for the plowing and sowing of the mind ? What will the full fruitage be when every one of us knows the happiness of sehoohdays , and finds an equal access to the intellectual treasures of our race ? Consider the instinct of parental love , the profound impulse of every normal parent to raise his children beyond himself ; here is the biological leverage of human progress , a force more to be trusted than any legislation , tenoned and mortised in the very nature of man . Adolescence lengthens now with every generation ; parental care increases as blind fertility disappears . We begin more helplessly , and we grow more completely towards that higher man who struggles to be born out of our imperfect and half-darkened souls . " The young are fortunate ; they will see great things . " Tenth , writing and print . Again our imagination is too weak-winged to lift us to a full perspective ; we can not vision or recall the long ages of ignorance , impotence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through those numberless generations men could transmit their hard-won lore only by word of mouth from parent to child ; if one generation forgot , or misunderstood , the weary ladder of knowledge had to be climbed anew . Writing gave a new permanence to the achievements of the mind ; it preserved for thousands of years , and through a millenium of poverty and superstition , the wisdom found by philosophy and the beauty carved out in drama and poetry . It bound the generations together with a common heritage ; it created that Country of the Mind in which , because of writing , genius need not die . And now as writing united the generations , print , despite the thousand prostitutions of it , can bind the civilizations . It is not necessary any more that civilization should disappear . It will change its habitat : doubtless the soil of every nation will refuse at last to yield its fruit to improvident tillage and careless tenancy ; inevitably new regions will lure with virgin soil the lustier strains of every race . But a civilization is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serf , to a given spot of the earth ; it is an accumulation of technical knowledge and cultural creation ; if these can be passed on to the new seat of economic power the civilization does not die , it merely makes for itself a new home . Nothing but beauty and wisdom deserve immortality . To a philosopher it is not indispensable that his native city should last forever ; he will be content if its achievements shall be passed on , to form part of the permanent possessions of mankind . Already it is possible to transmit imperfectly a body of culture from one civilization to another , as once it was transmitted from age to age . Australia and New Zealand need not begin at the bottom ; they can share in the civilization of the motherland to a degree utterly impossible before the telegraph and the printing press . We are witnessing a new species of parental care cxercised by one civilization over another . But it was by parental care that man outgrew the ape ; perhaps by a similar solicitude a civilization can enshrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it decays in the place of its birth . Now that dancing wires and leaping waves bind all the world electrically into an intellectual community , it will be a little harder for the accidents of time to destroy the cultural inheritance of the human race . We need not worry , then , about the future . We are weary with too much war , and in our lassitude of mind we listen readily to a Spengler announcing the downfall of the Western world . But this arrangement of the birth and deathof civilizations in cycles of 1800 years is a trifle too exact ; we may be sure that the future will play wild pranks with this mathematical despair . There have been wars before , and wars far worse than our Great one . Man and civilization survived them ; within fifteen years after Waterloo , defeated France was producing so many geniuses that every attic in Paris was occupied . Never was our heritage of civilization and culture so secure , and never was it half so rich . Let us do our little share to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confident that time will wear away chiefly the dross of it , and that what is finally fair and noble in it will escape mortality , to illuminate and gladden many generations .
