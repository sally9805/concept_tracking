txt THE WORST WOOL TARIFF . To the Editor of The New York Times : On reading in your issue of the 14th inst . George E. Robert 's warning re " Danger in Tariff , " it called to mind Daniel Doyce 's words relative to his invention blocked by the Circumlocution Office , " It 's as true as ever it was . " I am looking at this proposed tariff from the view of a wool buyer and manufacturer of ' carpet yarns , who , as is Well known , does not use the ' class of wool now grown in this country . Any penalty a tariff imposes on such wool as is used for floor covering must perforce be passed on to the consumer and can not help the farmer or wool grower , but will and must affect him adversely , for he 's got to pay the duty when he buys the goods ; there 's no way of blinking or getting around this fact . If it had been proposed as a means to produce some revenue to lessen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ood . A moderate duty of 20 per cent , on all classes of wool alike , with a higher rate on tops , foils and yarn , could . be passed on without the consumer being punished , but a 15 cents a pound duty being put , as proposed , on wool worth today 18 cents , less 2 per cent . is to say the least , under present world conditions . criminal . Having worked under the various tariffs since 1881 , I have no hesitation in classing the proposed measure as the least sensible yet ; the only consolation is that It will wreck tire party enacting it , but that I regret:to. inly will not offset the harm it will halve done to our reputation abroad and the consumer here .
