U. S. publishing reached the acme of specialization last week when the first issue of Divorce appeared . It was printed on cheap paper , eight pages , tabloid newspaper size . It contained few advertisements , only one photograph . Newsstands hawked it for 10 a copy . But it had a purpose . Its leading editorial said so : " The purpose of Divorce a weekly is not to pander to the seeker for the sensational , but to serve , in such measure as it can , to preserve the sanctity of the American home . Divorce may be seemingly sensational in title , appearance and the character of its news , but it serves a real purpose in giving emphasis to the details which flow through the divorce court . Roosevelt once said that the way to obtain the repeal of an unpopular law was to enforce it . . . . If your wife is discontented , let her read Divorce and realize that it is something more than a simple and convenient easement of the bonds . If your husband seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery , the heartaches , the legal dangers , to the end that his sanity may return to him . . . . It will be by no means dry reading for the public . These are human documents . . . by no means without their humorous side . " <P> A typical case reported by Divorce was that of Mrs. Celia Firestone who saw her husband enter the apartment of another woman in the Bronx . Such items , so common in divorce cases , are dull reading . But Divorce also told how a husband complained in court that his wife had not taken a bath in two years ; how a wife complained that her husband had made her sleep in the chicken-coop and sell the hens ' eggs to provide herself with necessities ; how a husband complained that his wife had been attending strip poker parties when he was away at work , etc. , etc . Most of the news in the first issue of Divorce was confined to New York State , but it will cover other states as it grows .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
