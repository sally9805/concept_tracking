This , Mr. shearer sale . supportea nu , conclusion that Instead of the ratio of 15-5-3 provided for by the Washington agreement , with Great Britain and United States on a par , it is actually 5.31 , America being one . In a report submitted to congress on April 19 last by Representative Butler . chairman of the committee on natal affairs , congress was asked for S110.560.00 for the modernization of six of America 's eighteen battleships and for the construction of eight scout eminent and six river gunboats , For modernization of the battleships alone , 518,360,000 was asked .

" Not only have we neglected the navy , so that the 5.5-3 treaty ratio Is actually ! 5-3-1 , with America one , " Mr. Shearer said , " but we have failed to modernize the fleet as well . That Is In marked contrast with the British and the Japanese . They learned the lessons of the war . We paid no attenflan to them . Torpedo Comm tie Front .

Within a month after the outbreak of hostilities , however . the torpedo had become one of the chief weapons of naval warfare . That came about when three British cruisers , the Hogue , the Cressey. and the Aboukir were sunk in the North sea . " It was net long before the torpedo had made the seas unsafe for capital shine and the British turned around for some method of protection for their battleships . They decided to ' blister ' them . " Now a blister is. roughly speaking . an outside hull , put on both skies of the vessel below the water line , for It is below the water line the torpedo strikes . They blistered such of their ships as they could during the war . They have blistered them all since the war . Utilize Space for Oil . " They have done more than live protection to the ship , however , in this Process of blistering . They have utilized that space inside the blister to carry reserve oil .

The navy wants it done but what the navy wants and what congress gives it are two different things . " We have not only failed to modernize dtir ships by blistering them , but we have piled to learn the lesson of deck armor as well . Nowadays the angle of fire is so high and bombing so feasible that the vitals of a ship are unduly expoSed to attack . These vitals are the machinery , fuel and ammunition . To protect thorn , the Banish have built as many as three armored decks . The Japanese . too , have modernized their ships in this respect , . We , however , have only one deck armored as protection against the long range guns and rho aerial bomb . Ahead of U.

We could bo blown out of the water his the British without hitting the target . They could stand off out of range and do it . " It is true that we have five ships of equal range with the British . They have a range of 30,000 yards and they would have to do all the fighting because every other ship in the British navy  --  nineteen of them  --  outranges every other ship in the Amer ! nun navy . And that is not all . While the five United States ships have the same range as the Hood and the two Rodneys , those ships could nail tircles around ours , for the Rood makes thirty-Ono knots and the two Rodneys make thirty .
