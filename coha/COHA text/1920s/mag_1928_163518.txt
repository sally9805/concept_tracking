The British Minister to China , Sir Miles Wedderburn Lampson , was " censured " last week as a result of sensational investigations at the Foreign Office which crescendoed in the dismissal of Assistant Under Secretary John Duncan Gregory . <P> No more was alleged by the investigating Civil Service Commission than that the officials implicated had speculated privately in French Francs . The Commission even went so far as to deny positively that Foreign Office information had been made the basis of these speculations . What appeared to be the culprits ' real crime was that they had transgressed the unwritten code of honor &; respectability of the Civil Service . Mr. Gregory , with a salary of 1,200 per year had mysteriously transgressed to the extent of making speculative moves in the aggregate amount of 1,000,000 . Sir Miles Lampson , the Minister to China , had barely dabbled . Intermediate between these twain were three Foreign Office officials who were disciplined , last week , according to the gravity of their indiscretions. * <P> British interest was especially roused at the dismissal of Assistant Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious " Zinoviev Letter " which hastened the fall of James Ramsay MacDonald 's Labor Cabinet ( TIME , Nov. 17 , 1924 ) . Secretary Gregory , without informing Prime Minister &; Foreign Secretary MacDonald , despatched a protest against the Zinoviev letter to Moscow . When news of this move reached the British public it was accepted as proof of the genuineness of the Zinoviev letter ( now generally considered a forgery ) and materially helped to sway the country away from Laborite MacDonald . <P> <P> * 1 ) St. Clair O'Malley , Counsellor of the Foreign Office was " permitted to resign " ; 2 ) Lieutenant Commander H. F. B. Maxe of the Foreign Office Staff was " severely reprimanded " and deprived of three years seniority ; Gerald H. Villiers , lesser official , was " censured. "
