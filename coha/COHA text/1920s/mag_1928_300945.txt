The Carnegie Institute 's annual international exhibition at Pittsburgh is one of the world 's most important affairs . Yet at this year 's opening last week , with 253 European and 128 U. S. paintings shown , little brilliancy , little power appeared . <P> First prize ( $1,500 &; gold medal ) went to Andr Derain , a French modernist . His picture was a still-life of two dead game birds on a table , with a rifle beside them . Composition and brush work are sure ; technique is deft . <P> Another still-life won the second prize ( $1,000 ) . Painter is Pedro Pruna , Spaniard .
