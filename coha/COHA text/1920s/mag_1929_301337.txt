Ambassadors and Ministers accredited at Berlin received , last week , an aide memoire from the Foreign Office , reminding them that Germany 's greatest statesman Foreign Minister Dr. Gustav Stresemann , " can no longer accept evening invitations . " <P> Presumably this circular reminder meant that some Ambassadors or Ministers have recently been so obtuse as to bid plump and pudgy Dr. Stresemann to their 9 o'clock banquets , forgetting entirely that his once bibulous and night-owlish habits have completely altered since he barely escaped Death ( TIME , May 28 ) from a prolonged and acute kidney attack . <P> Today the round face of the " German Lloyd George " is not ruddy with noontime beer and midnight champagne , but pale . He may eat only sparingly of dietetic food prepared by a special cook ; and every evening he is bundled off to early bed by an efficient , uncompromising trained nurse . Recently it has even been noticed that Dr. Stresemann 's personal physician is always closeted with him privily for five or ten minutes before he makes a public appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stresemann profess to know that the doctor spends these five-minute periods in reminding the statesman that he must curb his temper , eschew his favorite fiery oratory , conserve his strength . <P> Similar was the famed function of those ancient Roman slaves assigned to crouch in the chariot of each Conquering Proconsul as he enjoyed his Triumph . " Remember , " the slave would whisper , " Remember thou art mortal ! " Thus were swelled heads and rash , prideful deeds averted by an art now all but lost .
