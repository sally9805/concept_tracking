DeHart* Hubbard , famed Negro athlete , is endowed with a pair of great black legs ( TIME , June 15 ) . <P> For four years , these legs have won fame for Hubbard , protruding from a pair of tiny trunks striped with the colors of the University of Michigan . Last week , in Chicago , Hubbard bent to survey them . Competing in the National Collegiate Track and Field Championships , he had already proved himself the best collegiate sprinter in the U. S. by winning the 100-yd. dash in 9 8/10 sec. from a sparkling field , the most notable performance of the afternoon , though it had been a notable afternoon , with a national collegiate record and six records for the meet broken . Now Hubbard was about to make his last effort as a college athlete , felt tired , ill-prepared for it . His lifelong ambition to break the world 's record for the running broad-jump-had little prospect of being realized , for already he had jumped several times , not surpassingly , He took off his sweater , pawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who watched , it did not seem that his body shot any farther through the air than in its other leaps-nor did it , by much ; but it exceeded by 4 ? % in. the world 's record of 25 ft. 6 in. , established by Robert Le Gendre of Georgetown at the Olympic Games last summer . Satisfied , Hubbard ran off to cool his great legs in a shower . <P> <P> * His parents christened him DeHart . His schoolmates dubbeb him " Old Mother " - after the famed nursery rhyme character who went to the cupboard .
