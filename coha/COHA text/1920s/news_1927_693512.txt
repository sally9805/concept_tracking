txt The most extreme measure in restraint of teaching science in public schools and in colleges receiving aid from the State has been introduced in the Legislature of North Carolina . A day this week has been set for a hearin ; on the bill . It not only makes unlawful the teaching of any doctrine or theory of evolution " which contra " diets or denies the divine origin of " man or of the universe , as taught " in the Holy Bible , " but prohibits the teaching of the useful arts and sciences in such a manner as to " con " tradict the fundamental truth of the " Holy Bible . " The enactment of this bill ( which is hardly conceivable in a State as forward as North Carolina is in the useful arts and sciences and in higher education ) would make the Scriptures the ultimate authority in the realm of science , for all truth partakes of the " fundamental . " It is only the fool who says in his searchings of nature that there is no GOD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not thereby disclaim or disprove a divine origin . Some chemists have I traced all crganic life back to the sea , but the sea declares that , the secret of life is " ? ot with me . " The further man has searched , the more in awe of the Source of All Life he must become , even if he can not , ' without discrediting his own God-given senses . accept as a textbook in astronomy , physics , chemistry and biology what was meant for man 's spiritual elevation and moral guidance . Only last week it was announced that an astronomer , Dr. EDWIN HUBBLE , had , with the aid ' of the largest reflector yet made , found that there are " island universes " five quintillions of miles away , hundreds of thousands of light-years beyond the bounds of our own stellar universe , which means that light traveling at the speed of 186,000 miles a ; second would have to spend somewhere near a million lightyears in finding its way from one of those nebulae to our infinitesimal earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , North Carolina if this bill were enacted , for it would seem to controvert the narrative of creation in which our ' earth bad begun to grow grassend herbs and fruit trees before thenghts were set in the firmament of heaven . It is difficult to Imagine an earth without the sun yet full of herbage and foliage . Even more difficult is it to accept the Copernican theory of our universe if the sun was hung in the sky after *Ilea ereatious rod U alto otgai also " were later added . The poetic story of Genesis must be read in the light of science 's revelations . When the heavens are stretched out to such prodigious distance 's , and when terrestrial time is carried back through periods measured by hundreds . of millions of years . not only is the perspective of the past life of mankind corrected , but his mind is put under the compulsion of " formulating laws " which cover also what we call the " future . " If the significance of this long mindfulness of man on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would shift from the fate of the individual to that of mankind . Man 's existence under the stars whose light has been ages in reaching the earth and beneath skies where deeps are ever calling to greater deeps , is one that should stir in him a new sense of the dignity of the life that has such a background and a deeper solicitude for the further evolution of the race .
