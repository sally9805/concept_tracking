ONE of our ablest lawyers , Mr. James Coolidge Carter , some years ago raised the question , What is Law ? and called attention to its immense difficulty . Mr. Brand Whit- lock , then mayor of Toledo , brought it up again about twenty years ago in a little monograph that never got half the attention it deserved , called , The Ad ? ministration of Law in Cities . Both these eminent men gave the question up as unanswerable , and their discussion of the problems involved in it is one of our neglected classics . Perhaps the most useful thing that a publisher could do to-day , when the subject of law and lawlessness is so much in the public mind , would be to reprint Mr. Carter 's lecture and Mr. Whitlock 's essay together in a small volume and circulate it . For when Mr. Hoover , Mr. Taft , Senator Capper , and others of our repre ? sentative men undertake to reprove us for lawbreaking , their complaints logi ? cally run back to this question . The average man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really means statute-breaking . Anyone can tell offhand what a statute is . It is anything that certain elected persons have written down on a piece of paper , and another elected person has signed . But is a statute per se a law ? I remem ? ber a statute passed in one of our Middle States , I believe , to the effect that two trains approaching an intersection must both come to a full stop , and neither may start again until the other has passed ! Is that a law ? The instinct of the average man promptly says it is not , and the judgment of instinct is borne out in the fact that no such statute is obeyed , can be obeyed , or has any power to get itself obeyed . But the moment this is acknowledged , the moment it is ad ? mitted that private judgment has any play whatever in the premises , that moment there is introduced the whole vast question , What is law ? Golden Rule Jones , Mr. Whitlock 's predecessor as mayor of Toledo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baffling problem of defining law when he said that " law in the United States is anything that the people will hack up . " Emerson also observed to the same effect that " The law is only a memorandum . " The Constitution is officially , as Mr. Justice Harlan was given so often to declaring it , " the fundamental law of the land . " But are the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments actually law ? Obviously they are not , and no one would be as much embarrassed by a serious appeal to them as those whose sworn duty it is to enforce them . From the Constitution down to the municipal ordinances of one-horse towns , we have a mass of enactments , many of them practicable enough and some of them rather sensible , that somehow fail of being actual laws ; they are not obeyed or enforced or even ever heard of , and they apparently have no power to rescue themselves from this extreme desuetude . Whichever way one looks at it , there seems a most important essential differ ? ence between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ordinance ; even between a law and a Consti ? tutional provision . Average human instinct , however , without being able to define this differ ? ence , is fully aware that it exists ; and that is the reason why Mr. Hoover 's recent admonitions fell so largely on deaf ears . Mr. Hoover implied that anything good , bad or indifferent , practicable or impracticable that a legislature enacts and that an executive signs is a law ; whereas we all know that it may be , and very often is , nothing of the kind . Thomas Jefferson spoke straight from the average man 's instinct when he said that the legislative enact ? ments known as the Alien and Sedition Acts had no more effective force of law , and should have no more , " than if Congress had commanded us all to fall down and worship a golden image . " We all know furthermore that this instinct , though we may not be able to make a satisfactory intellectual inter ? pretation of it , is logically sound . Once admit Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one is led straight to the acme of absurdity . One need not veer off into any abstract questions concerning the rights of man and the . corresponding limitations which those rights put upon lawmaking bodies . It is enough to observe with Jefferson that carrying Mr. Hoover 's idea of the nature of law by a short step towards its logical extreme shows it to be utterly preposterous . Mr. Hoover 's pronouncement also , I regret to say , causes him to raise other implications which , while not more culpable than the foregoing , are more directly offensive to large numbers of our citizenry . Those who assume with Mr. Hoover that a statute and a law are one and the same are prone , in their public utterances , to lump all " law ? breakers " together under a general and indiscriminate reprehension , and to re ? gard them as beings who not only ought to be , but who in their hearts really are , ashamed of themselves . Nothing is farther from the truth ; and this mis ? apprehension shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error of the first magnitude . If those who thus lecture us for our disregard of law would look into the question of what law is and what it is not , and would study the operation of fundamental human instinct on that question , they would save themselves from doing their fellow-citizens considerable injustice . In the exercise of private judgment against Mr. Hoover 's theory of law , average human instinct is conscious not only of its own intellectual integrity but of its moral integrity as well ; and no amount of expostulation or abuse ? I can call it by no fairer word ? will alter its con ? sciousness . The testimony of instinct comes out negatively , in the degree of respect paid to public servants according as their duties lie mainly with enactments that the common conscience of mankind does not support . Thus the police of Lon ? don , who are very little occupied with the mere malum prohibitum , are more highly respected than those of our cities . Before prohibition everyone thought well of our Coast Guard , but respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The feeling towards agents of the prohibition service amounts to repugnance . One is struck by the way most people take the news that a prohibition agent has been killed in action . They behave at best with in ? difference ; often as if they thought he were well out of the way . Yet when a policeman dies trying to vindicate the law against homicide or burglary the same people admire his heroism . Human nature can neither be preached nor bullied out of assent to this testimony of instinct , and self-respecting human nature resents the attempt to do either . I confess I can not understand what has happened to the American people 's sense of dignity , that they permit their public servants to address them in the tone that many of these latter have lately chosen to employ . It would seem to me most competent to remind our officials in no uncertain terms that in raising implications against all statute-breakers they are committing an intolerable impertinence . We are all statute-breakers , every man , woman , and child in the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards enactments which do not com ? mand the common conscience of man ? kind , or concerning which the common conscience is neutral , is not attended by the slightest consciousness of wrong ? doing . On the contrary we know that fundamental human instincts are sound and trustworthy , as Thomas Jefferson declared them to be , and that no one has the right to arraign our allegiance to them as immoral . Does anyone actually presume to intimate that anywhere in the United States a man who walks two miles for pleasure on Sunday , or plays tennis , or buys a newspaper , or kisses his wife is acting from a defective moral sense ? If not , just where in the category of prohibited things dues the moral sense begin to show defect ? One may always use oneself for purposes of illustration in cases where such service might be dis ? agreeable , so I may say I am a statute-breaker and have been one all my life . I have bought cigarettes in Kansas ? very bad ones ? and in other States where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am no drinker , I dare say I should be evading the inconven ? ience of prohibition . My path through life is strewn with the wreckage of enactments contemplating not only triv ? ial matters like these but also some that are more serious . But I can not recall an instance of this kind where my moral sense puts in any testimony against me or where the offense is one that I should hesitate about repeating . In all this I believe I stand with every man-jack of my fellow-citizens . Their offenses may not be the same as mine , but they are of the same order ; they are offenses that concern some form of the mere ma/um prohibiturn , about which the normal moral sense is silent . Moreover , if allthe courts in the country , and all the executives from President to pound-master , should undertake to tell me that my moral sense is defective , their word would make no more impression on me than water on a duck 's back ; and in this , too , I believe I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con ? ceivable that even a prohibitionist might be as sincerely impenitent about Sunday golf or ice cream , or failing to declare an extra box of cigars , or about crowding the tax regulations a little as I should be about buying a drink if I wanted one . Somewhere or other we all depart from the strict letter of the law , and so far are we from any sense of crime or sin that in some instances , perhaps , we secretly glory in our shame , and would glory in it openly but for certain practical in ? conveniences that might ensue . Such is the force of man 's private judgment , and whenever a statute has been set up in opposition to it , the statute has always gone by the board . This sort of thing has been tried for hundreds of years , and never yet has it succeeded . Those who think it should succeed now in the case of prohibition have simply no idea of what it is that they antagonize . Have our official monitors ever asked themselves where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to call lawbreakers ? What would become of the individual who is trying to live peaceably and decently under a bureau ? cracy if he were not a lawbreaker ? He simply could not get on at all . The average man 's instinct prompts him to a just sense of proportion in this matter ; the trouble with our monitors is that they speak from the point of view of the doctrinaire or the job holder instead of that of the man in the street who has something to do that is worth doing and wants to get it done . One might say that a bureaucracy exists chiefly for the purpose of impeding a citizen in his deleted material law amounts to . And yet the average man , confirmed and inveterate statute-buster though he be , is law-abiding ; he is well-meaning and decent , though from the tone adopted by our moral monitors one might not suspect it . Show him a law that is really a law , something that measurably reflects the common con ? science of mankind , and he is quite likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public half way . Officialism , as Her ? bert Spencer pointed out years ago , is interested chiefly in strengthening itself , digging itself farther and farther in , and multiplying its encroachments on the rights , liberties , and consciences of the individual citizen . Anything like taking the public into its confidence is obviously inconsistent with this , and can not be done . Therefore , in their comment on our lawlessness our official servants do not define , do not explain , do not reason : they merely tell us . The instinct which warns us against this tendency of officialism is wholly sound . It testifies that this tend ? ency should be resisted . A bureaucracy should be put in its place and kept there . The individual , acting alone , can not do this . All he can do is to ward off from himself the evil incidence of officialism as best and as often as he may ; and the only way he can do this is through an occasional discriminating exercise of " lawlessness . " So much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? stand progressive incursions of official ? ism and keep a bureaucracy in its place . We are told , rightly enough , that the first thing , the indispensable thing , is strict attention . Without this nothing can be done . When Thomas Jefferson was representing our Government in Paris , he wrote Edward Carrington that " if once the people become inattentive to the public affairs , you and I and Congress and Assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves . Itseems to be the law of our general nature , in spite of individual exceptions . " We have a saying which has degenerated into a kind of cliche , but is none the less true , that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . The mass of our public is supposed to fail in this vigilance and to have become extremely " inattentive to the public affairs , " except around elec ? tion time when the general interest bears something of a sporting character , hard ? ly to be called very serious . This count against our people is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I mention this commonplace only to bring in a question to which it gives rise . Mere vigilance is worth very little unless the way is open for immediate and appropriate action upon the delin ? quency that vigilance discovers . What , then , is the use of vigilance against the encroachments of officialism under a political system which by its fundamen ? tal organization makes such action im ? possible ? Here again the average man 's instinct which prompts . him to abstain from any political interest , unless for purposes of profit , seems to me a sound one . The utmost that our federal sys ? tem permits is to sack a handful of job holders at the end of four years or seven years ; under the system in other coun ? tries they can be turned out at any time and without notice . Some of our worst habitual offenders against the liberty and sovereignty of the people , indeed , are to all intents and purposes irre ? movable . They may be impeached , but as far back as Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was " not even a scarecrow " ; and we all know it is no more than that now . But turning a few job holders out at the end of a fixed term does nothing against bureaucracy and officialism or against their tend ? encies ; these go on under the next regime of job holders just as they did under the last . Meanwhile , too , there is no com ? petent mode of reprehension that society can collectively apply to a job holder for any insult to the people 's dignity or any injury to their sovereignty . That is to say , there is none unless society , like the individual , has recourse to lawlessness . Collective lawlessness interested Mr. Jefferson and gained his calm and rather naive approval . " 1 like a little rebel ? lion now and then , " he wrote one cor ? respondent , and on the occasion of Shays 's Rebellion he expressed his hope that the country would never go twenty years without one like it . Shays and his malcontents were not altogether wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion was probably a good thing on general principles . It showed that the people were alive to public con ? cerns , and it also kept the ear of the job holder open to his master 's voice . It is no disparagement to the Founding Fathers to say that being human , they were not omniscient in their foresight . Whatever their intentions may have been , they did actually construct a political system that puts officialism be ? yond the reach of any remedial or puni ? tive collective action except violence ; and Jefferson was thoroughly aware of it . While I am entirely of Jefferson 's mind in this matter , I am not now counselling a rebellion on any particular issue , or even counselling rebellion at all . When the official hue and cry about " lawlessness " started , it led me to contemplate the cancer of officialism in our body politic , and to wonder what could be done about it , first by the individual , and second , by society col ? lectively ; and I can not set but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that will check its inroads . I do not intend to speak particularly about the general issues arising out of prohibition , but one special issue serves very well just here for purposes of illus ? tration . I remember my indignation and sense of outrage twenty years ago , in the time of State option , when some officers of a prohibition State boarded a train and cut open the suit-case of an innocent through-passenger , to search it for liquor . It seemed to me then that officialism had reached its limit of affront to the integrity and dignity of the public . Federal agents now , however , seem em ? barked on the policy ? under instruc ? tions , mind you , set forth by officialism ? of first shooting the suspect out of hand and searching his property after ? wards . In a newspaper to-day I see an estimate that these murders run to an average of one every three days . Now , under these circumstances , what recourse has the community ? These assassinations are an immediate concern of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no innocent person can kaiow when and under what circum ? stances he or she will be a victim . The community is as much concerned as it would be with any other mode of brig ? andage . But , in the premises , just what can it do ? The immediate agents can be indicted and tried ; but , in the first place , this hardly suits the average sense of justice . These men are acting under orders and are responsible to their superiors . In the second place , officialism is all on their side , and the trial results in a for ? mal vindication of officialism and not in actual justice . As for implicating their superiors in the issue , the thing is clearly impossible ; the attempt would result only in a more spectacular vindication of officialism . What then ? Well , it is possible that the community thus outraged might spread the contagion of its dissent largely through the country . In that case it is again possible that at the end of a term of years we might retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camorra of senators , congressmen , and such . But this measure seems almost ludicrously inadequate and superficial when compared with the amount of effort and expense involved in bringing it about . When it is done , what has the country got ? What has it ever got from this procedure ? Besides , four years or seven years is a long time to wait for the popular will to become operative . Whether regarded as a measure of re ? tributive justice or as a rebuke to official ? ism , this procedure seems alike incompe tent , and I believe that the natural instinct of the people regards it with extreme dissatisfaction . Yet I know of no other that can be either conceived or applied within the limits of a strict legality . Although an American citizen , I live much abroad among a people who have their own faults and shortcomings , like the rest of us , and some considerable virtues . One of their virtues is an amazingly quick , passionate , almost vindictive resentment and resistance against the incursions of officialism . Individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them ; otherwise in all their private relations , they are the most tolerant people that I ever had the good fortune to be among . Both these traits seem largely to have been born in them , and the course of their national history has accidentally been such as to foster both of them very powerfully . For years I have watched the continuous come-out of these traits with a fascinated interest . Officialism , in a word , is restricted to a degree inconceivable by an American ; and it is restricted by the one thing I know of that can restrict it , which is fear . Not fear of losing a job , but fear of losing continuity of the spinal column . Every official from the highest to the lowest , carries on under just that whole ? some apprehension . He knows what he may do and may not do ; bureaucracy knows how far it may go , and what will happen if it goes farther ; and any mo ? tion , even the slightest , towards over ? stepping the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had had large experience in municipal gov ? ernment in America , once told the mayor of the European city I live in that he ought to turn a certain crowded thor ? oughfare into a one-way street . The mayor threw up his hands and said , " If I did that there would be a revolu ? tion ! " He was right . That street is a one-way street now , but making it sowas a matter of twelve years . The progress of a general traffic-control has been very slow and circumspect , almost block by block , with the people watching every move to decide whether it meant something really for their convenience or was a mere bureaucratic gesture . Whatever failings a critic might observe in this people 's type of civilization , it has certainly realized all the advantages that come from never being " inattentive to the public affairs . " Consequently the outrages committed by officialism in America against the dignity and liberties of the public could no more take place here than they could take place in heaven . Supposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot here under circumstances like those of the prohibitionist raid on a private domicile in Illinois a few months ago . What would happen is that the political equivalents of Mr. Mellon and Mr. Lowman would be immediately eliminated . The people would waste no time on the actual raiders ; their sound political instinct would lead them straight to the persons responsible . But nothing like this is ever necessary , because the people watch their job holders like cats and are always ready with some practical application of the principle obata principiis in small matters as well as great . Nothing seems too small and trivial for them to resent , and on occasion the concern of the individual instantly becomes the concern of the community . Some months ago , for instance , the Communists had been annoying the Socialists by organizing a series of petty strikes ; and the mayor of the city that I live in put out a proclamation one morning prohibiting all public meetings and street-processions . The Socialists are politically very strong here , and the Mayor evidently had counted on this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? lamation so manifestly aimed at the weak Communist faction . But the prohibition lasted just four days . On the morning of the fifth day there was another proclamation posted on the dead-walls , saying it was all off . Mean ? while there seemed to be as many pa ? rades and assemblages as usual , with the police maintaining a benevolent neutral ? ity . Undoubtedly what happened was that about the second day , people of every political stripe began to drop into the Mayor 's office to tell him that while he was all right as far as he went , they were noticing that the boys seemed to he getting sort of restless , and they were afraid the future looked a little dark for him unless he brisked up and did something . Some time ago I watched a street f ? te in the poorest quarter of town until long after midnight , when two men started at fisticuffs in the middle of a side street . A couple of policemen happened along , and for some reason one of them tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set on the policeman , sent him spinning on his head ten feet away , and then at once resumed business . They were quite within their rights , and they knew it . They were not blocking traffic , for there was none ; not disturbing anyone , for they were not noisy ; not discommoding or injuring anyone , for what few people were around were on the sidewalk . These men were very pour and shabby ; in America they would have had no chance at all . They would have been clubbed half to death and then probably " run in " on a charge of resisting an officer ; and the bystanders would have let it go at that . Here , however , the incident ended when the policeman got up , brushed himself off , and rejoined his companion , who meanwhile had not stirred . If he had made an issue of it , he would have had to take on the whole population of the district , because , as I say , by every rule of reason and sense , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand he had been in any way justified by reason and sense , the populace would have been just as strongly on his side , as I have often seen it happen . So it is not only in municipal or local affairs , but in national affairs ; this spirit predominates everywhere . About two years ago there was a great demonstra ? tion in a northeastern province of the country ; thousands of people marched all day , with brass bands , and speech ? making of a most inflammatory type . The manifestation was headed by two canons of the cathedral and six univer ? sity professors . They marched under a foreign flag , advocating the annexation of the province by a neighboring coun ? try . Well , by modern American stand ? ards , this was sedition of the most flagrant type , but nothing happened . The military were not called out , the ringleaders were not railroaded to At ? lanta or maimed on the spot by the police ; nothing at all was done about it . After all , if those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak up about it . If they could get enough people in the province to feel the same way , and the neighboring country was content they had every right to obtain annexa ? tion . The right of secession is inalien ? able . " When in the course of human events it becomes necessary , etc. " ? how many times we have heard those noble words ! But over here they really believe it and are ready to back up their belief , not only with their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor , but with the leg of a chair or whatever first comes handy . In this instance the demonstra ? tors could not make enough people feel their way to carry the issue ; but they had absolute and unlimited freedom to try , and so they were satisfied . The general doctrine that I am de ? scribing may be disparaged as terrorism ; indeed , it may be very fairly called terrorism , provided one very important condition be kept in mind . It is as true , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way the incursions of officialism can be withstood is by keeping the officials in a state of constant fear ? not fear for their jobs , but for their skins . I say , constant fear , not intermittent or occasional fear . If this be done , as it is in the country where I live , there are never any terroristic consequences , for things simply never get that far . The people among whom I live keep themselves continually framed up to hang somebody , no matter whom , from the head of the general government to the policeman on the beat . Officialism is constantly aware of this , and consequently no one is ever hanged . I never witnessed or heard of a single incident where a few well-chosen words did not immediately and satis ? factorily produce results . The officials know the disposition of the people , know it is not to be trifled with , and never trifle with it . Only where the disposition of a people is either com ? plaisant or " inattentive , " or both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the thing stands to reason as well as to such experience as is furnished by the country where I live . Suppose Mr. Whalen knew to an absolute cer ? tainty that within twenty-four hours after his police had confiscated private medical records the citizenry would descend upon his office , would that peculiarly odious and outrageous raid on Mrs. Sanger 's clinic have taken place ? Never . Would a single prohibitionist assassination ever take place if Mr. Mellon and Mr. Lowman knew to a certainty that the day when it happened would be their official last ? Never . Matters would never come within a thousand miles of such a thing . I am not contemplating occasional and spo ? radic outbursts of mob-rage caused by some exceptionally flagrant dinutrche of a bureaucracy . Officialism has no fear of those , for it can deal with them . I am speaking of a steady , considered and highly sensitive spirit of repression , which by coming out with promptness and force against the feeblest beginnings of officialism 's attempts against the public 's welfare and dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more daring and flagitious enterprises . I see no conclusion but that Jeffer ? sonian " lawlessness " affords communal rights and dignity , as well as the rights and dignity of the individual , their only recourse against officialism . Jefferson seems to have thought so , and I see no way whereby one can think otherwise . Moreover , for the community as well as the individual , the determination and delimitation of " lawlessness " runs straight back to the fundamental ques ? tion , What is law ? Americans , searching for available recourse in what seems to me a most trying and humiliating situation , might well broach this fundamental question and demand a plain and thorough dis ? cussion of it ; and demand especially that it he discussed by those who now so lightly undertake to reprehend them for their lawlessness.
