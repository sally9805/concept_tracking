NEW BOOK <P> BEHIND THE SCENES IN **25;6302;TOOLONG ( $2.50 ) . It is always pleasing to meet a man who is a vivid personality . When that personality has something to say not only interesting , but frequently penetrating in judgment , he is a real treat . Such a man is Anonymous . <P> Anonymous is too often cheated of his laurels . He writes a good book on politics and in a short time Edward G. Lowry or Clinton W. Gilbert conies forward to claim it . <P> Anonymous is not an " Insider . " He is a " Behinder . " <P> Of the " Insiders " he says : " I detest those who advertise themselves as insiders . The crop of them on the Roosevelt and Wilson soil was tremendous . The sense of importance is tempting . The best of men succumb to it . I remember Colonel House sending for me one day and how I speeded my taxi to hear the fate of the world . He said to me : ' Here is something between you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never one like this . ' <P> " I said : ' I know . I have just been in Wall Street lunching at the Midday Club . They told me there . I have stopped at the Union Club on my way uptown . They told me there . There is a good chance of an armistice being signed soon and you are sailing tomorrow very secretly for Europe . ' " <P> Of President Makers : " I have always found it more difficult to find one hundred per cent partisans of a candidate before he is selected than it is after the nomination . Harding knew this as well as any man . To a stranger who had explained to him that he had been against his nomination Harding exclaimed : ' I am glad to see you ! I always knew that some day I would find the man who had nothing to do with making me President . ' " <P> Of Independents : " One of the greatest exhibitions of an instinct to be good divorced completely from the obligation to be intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worship mere independence . I confess that I have found that independence is a bad way to get joint action of any kind in real motion . Usually when two independents rally around the banner of independence it results in two banners of independence and then four and then eight . No man or woman in the world is so independent as an independent . As political workers they are usually fanatically unselfish for six months and then as temperamental as prima donnas forever after . " <P> Of Mud Slinging : " Cleveland was the object of much underground accusation . Roosevelt , without any cause , was called a drunkard . Wilson , as much as any man , suffered from stories grotesquely fabricated and of peculiarly unrestrained venom . Harding went through these filthy attacks before election . To the best of my knowledge , for every vote lost because of a whispering campaign directed against him , the candidate gained a little more than one vote . <P> " It is an extraordinary fact that the silk-stocking element is often the greatest offender in whispering campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with orchids , and it is the young broker seeking to justify his political prejudices , who lend themselves to being carriers of these scandal stories .
