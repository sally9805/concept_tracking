Unrocked by revolution the northwest corner of Mexico celebrated the Sabbath and St. Patrick 's Day with horseracing . The animals raced from mid-morning until after sundown at varying distances for assorted purses and Golden Prince , could he talk , might have told reporters he was the happiest horse in the world . Golden Prince earned $110,000 , the largest annual turf stake in the world , by winning the tenth running of the Coffroth Handicap at Tiajuana ( Aunt Jane ) . Mexico . Golden Prince is a sleepy-looking Kentucky chestnut , a five-year-old gelding from the stables of the Sunshot Stock Farm owned by one Abe Bartelstein . He has won seven out of eight starts this season . Last week , with Jockey Jack Parmelee up , he won by a neck over Naishapur , and equalled the course record . Genie , son of famed Man o ' War , was the favorite . He finished sixteenth . <P> Tiajuana dozes in dusty sunshine a couple of rifle shots across the U. S. border . The track , where each spring more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California that tourists park Fords and Cadillacs on the U. S. side to avoid the nuisance of search ( for liquor ) when race day is done . A signpost says AL HIPPODROMO and a long bar under the grandstand dispenses beer and spirits . Otherwise the racetrack and its patrons are markedly Americano . <P> The Coffroth Handicap climaxes 100 days of racing , attracting horses from famed Eastern and Southern stables , but odd things happen to horses , and many prime jockies do not ride there . Touts peddling tips are numerous and all offer the gambling tourist a sure thing on every race . Yet even touts in their surpassing wisdom disappear mysteriously toward the paddock between races to find " which ones are trying . " <P> The Coffroth yields profits to make jockeys try .

One silver dollar purchases two cocktails ; two whiskies ; two tots of rum . Beer is 10 or 15 cents per glass , depending on the glitter of the dispensary . <P> Behind the bars of Tiajuana stand the remnants of a disappearing race-the U.S. bartender . Many a man among them will tell heart-breaking tales of better days when he served drinks at the Waldorf in Manhattan , at Boston 's Parker House or at Coffee Dan 's in San Francisco . Their skill confirms their stories and strong men weep gently into their old-fashioned whiskey cocktails to think such souls are passing . <P> These bartenders comprise the ranking industry . For Tiajuana , exotic as it may sound to the dry and fevered U.S. fancy , is nothing but a couple of dirty streets of barrooms . It is almost epic in its drabness . One bar stretches an entire block and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " * Some have mechanical music ; some musicians . Most places have small clearings for dancing . All smell .
