txt SPIRITUAL HEALING belief expressed in the metaphor that the creation is not merely a mirror of God but is a manifestation of the Son of God . Everyone , we can see , would rather have a son who might succeed , and might fail , in reproducing his father 's ideals than a photographic reproduction of himself , incapable , by the law of his being , of doing anything else beyond reproducing automatically his own thoughts and actions . This is what we mean by saying that not only is fatherhood a Divine thing but sonship also ; the Father is God and the Son is God . We believe that the long , difficult , painful process of reproducing perfection through struggle and opposition is as Divine as the original perfection itself . We believe also that there is an infallible instinct in man which makes him aware of those archetypal forms of Goodness , Truth , and Beauty , and that these ideals are not merely personal to himself , his own idiosyncrasies , but that the same judgments are true for everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality and objectivity of our values which we mean when we say that the Holy Spirit is God . It means that we believe that we are capable of dis-4o GOD AND THE MATERIAL WORLD tinguishing truth from error , goodness from wickedness , and beauty from ugliness . It is because we believe that we have this power that poets are always striving after more and more accuracy and beauty in expression , that inventors are constantly trying to subdue the material world with more assured accuracy of touch , and that philosophers and theologians are constantly trying to bring their idea of God more closely in accord with their vision of reality . All this we feel to be worth while doing because we believe that , at all events at certain moments , and to certain people , true and objective knowledge of reality is given ; we believe in the Holy Spirit . This belief should therefore underlie all our efforts , that matter is intended to manifest spirit and is capable of doing so through the co-operation of the human and Divine mind . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now , is by any means what it is intended to be by God . It would seem certain that , if we were all possessed by the Divine mind , the world as we now know it would be so transformed that we might hardly recognise it at all . Our duty is to be so continually gazing at the Divine ideals // and using our power of conscious and deliberate co-operation with them that we are able to transmute the forms which we at present know into those forms which will perfectly represent the Divine intention . By what process is this transmutation to be brought about ? In former days people imagined that there were certain people who had an entirely incomprehensible power of reversing natural laws . Moses could throw down his rod and it would become a serpent ; Elijah could make an iron axe-head to swim , and because they were believed able to do these things , people were expected to believe their opinions about politics and religion . Such a mode of reasoning seems impossible to us to-day . If we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of a deputation of the unemployed and that it had become a serpent , we should not therefore believe that his views were necessarily correct as to the solution of the social problem , and we should either say that the report of the occurrence was obviously incorrect or we should put the serpent in the Zoological Gardens , and put our biologists to work with the certainty that if this phenomenon had been produced // once , and by one person , it ought to be capable of being produced again , under similar conditions , by all people . In the Middle Ages it was generally considered that the doctrine of Transubstantiation had been once for all proved , when at Bolsena the Host had been observed to sweat human blood . We should now merely think that this was an interesting instance of the credulity of mediaval observers . We do not now really believe that God ever acts in such a way that we are not able eventually to give an intelligible account of the laws by which this action is carried out ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action occurs which appears to transcend the limits of natural law , we shall ultimately discover that it is an exemplification of some law which we do not at present understand , and that in the long run we are intended to do the same things ? not here and there capriciously ? but by a scientific co-operation with intelligible law . There are some people who feel that their whole religion is bound up in the belief that some parts , at all events , of life are wholly unintelligible , and the more unintelligible they are , the more they are // felt to be divine . Dr. Aubrey Moore pointed out a generation ago in Lux Mundi the unhappy condition in which such religious people live : " They are the people who stake all upon what reason can not do . They have no interest in the progress of knowledge . The present gaps in science are their stronghold , and they naturally resist every forward step in knowledge so long as they can , because each new discovery limits the area in which alone , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , according to this theory , becomes a loss , not a gain , to religion . The very existence of God is bound up with that part of His work which we can not understand , and , as a consequence , we reach the paradox that the more we know of His working , the less proof we have that He exists . It is the devout form of the worship of the unknowable . Yet it is no wonder that people who take refuge in gaps find themselves awkwardly placed when the gaps begin to close . " I have quoted this passage from Dr. Aubrey Moore especially because I think it concerns the present movement in regard to " Spiritual Healing . " I know that , there // are some people who chiefly value Spiritual Healing because they regard it as a phenomenon entirely outside the range of natural law . They can not bear to hear it being in any way related to psychology or to material science . It distresses them to hear that the same kind of effects which are experienced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely physical results are concerned , reproduced by purely mental healers , who perhaps do not believe in religion at all . I am sure that we must face this position boldly because it is bound to become increasingly evident as time goes on . If we are only , or mainly , concerned with physical health , we shall probably get quite as good results from auto-suggestion as from " spiritual healing , " and some of the events which have seemed most miraculous , and have been to many people the clearest proof of their Divine origin , will be shown to be exemplifications of natural law . For instance , in India one of the difficulties with which missionaries are faced is that the devotees of peculiarly obscene idols , when worked up into a condition of religious frenzy , are able to walk on red-hot iron bars without any apparent injury to their feet . Now , if // the missionary has grounded the claims of Christ merely upon His having walked upon the water or fed the five thousand , his opponents will point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern magic . If our faith rests on these gaps in knowledge , it will continually be suffering rude shocks which may ultimately be fatal to it . It is far better to realise that Our Lord demonstrated for us the existence of laws which He desired that we should discover for ourselves , and that He confidently hoped and expected that we should do the works that He did and even greater works than these . People will come to find that if they are only concerned with physical healing , they may get this more cheaply through non-religious suggestion than through that entire re-education of the moral and emotional nature which is demanded in spiritual healing . It is just because we believe that the re-education of the spirit is so far more important than the cure of the body that we press the claims of spiritual healing as against mere " magical " healing . To us physical healing is only a by-product of the far more important process of spiritual regeneration . // We believe that in the religion of Jesus Christ we are given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the human soul . We believe that as we cultivate the mind of Christ , we are able to disentangle our true spiritual nature from those false growths which disguise its beauty and impede its power . We see the soul now , as Plato says in the Republic , " in a state like that of the Sea-god Glaucus : Whose original nature can no longer be readily discerned by the eye because the old members of his body have been either broken off or crushed and in every way marred by the action of the waves , and because extraneous substances like shellfish and seaweed and stones have grown to him so that he bears a closer resemblance to any wild beast than to his natural self . " The soul , as we are contemplating it , has been reduced to a similar state by a thousand evils . As we see our own lives according to the mind of Christ , fixing our attention far more upon conformity to the divine ideal than upon the lesser good of physical health , we shall ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not by merely fixing our minds on physical health or material prosperity that we are // likely to attain it , according to the law " he that loveth his life shall lose it ; he that loseth his life for my sake shall save it . " This physical body , through which the soul expresses itself under these temporary conditions , can not in its nature last for ever ; if our nature were as much in conformity with the Divine ideal as was the nature of Jesus Christ , it seems possible that these physical bodies might quite naturally be transmuted into some more perfect expression of spirit into which we might grow without passing through death , but it does not seem as though this consummation is likely to be attained while the present average level of humanity remains what it is . Our present hope now is that the body may be preserved in health for so long as it is able to subserve the purposes of spirit , and may then decay and pass away without undue pain and distress to ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things put under His feet , and though death is the last enemy which shall be destroyed , yet we hold steadfastly to our belief that this material world is no hostile or unreal thing , but that beneath these humble and sometimes distorted forms the divine beauty // can still be discerned , and contact can truly be made with divine love , and that it is not by the destruction , or the contemptuous rejection , of the material world that the kingdom of heaven is to be sought and found , but by the patient investigation of material processes , by the intimate love and understanding of material phenomena , by the unconquerable belief that the human mind is meant to understand God , and the human body is capable of expressing His beauty . CHAPTER V MAN IN our thoughts about God we saw that we must not call that power God which is strongest to crush and destroy , but that which makes the deepest appeal to our consciences , even though conceivably it were to turn out that by trying to model our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of worship ? we were to suffer eternal damnation . But when we try to find out what are those qualities and virtues which are most admirable , we see that they are always human qualities . We can not otherwise express them , but in terms of human virtues . We can not worship an elephant , though it is stronger than we are ? or a volcano , though it can easily destroy us in a few seconds , nor the sun , which can produce effects which are totally beyond our powers : we must always return to Love , human love 5o MAN at its best , and own that in no shrine but in this can we bow down and adore . But are we , then , just worshipping our selves ? and , after imagining some power possessing just our own vices and virtues , making God in our own image and like ness ? Surely not . We are not proposing to make an image of the average man , and , having made it , to bow down ourselves before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to achieve his own ideals to do that . We have within that which , so far as we know , no other creature on earth possesses , a sense of shortcoming and failure to achieve our true end . One of the most profoundly significant traits of human nature is this deep , ineradicable sense of sin , of being less than we are meant to be , of having erred and strayed , of being off the true track of our development . Certainly we could not worship the average man . But we do feel that human nature at its highest would be the best picture that we could form of the Divine . Nothing that we know points the way so truly to what we conceive as perfection , as human nature does . And we are certain that in this it is not partiality which blinds us . It is not ' merely // because we are human beings that we feel that a perfect Man would be higher than a perfect cat , or a perfect elephant . It is , we are sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ideal of per fection . St. John constantly teaches us this . He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ? " Everyone that loveth is begotten of God and knoweth God . " " He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is Love . " And in the same way Jesus con stantly teaches us that they only know God and will be acknowledged by Him who have practised simple , natural human virtues , which mankind knows to be good every where ? feeding hungry people , clothing naked people , visiting the sick and the captive . So Blake preaches the same truth : For Mercy has a human heart ; Pity , a human face ; And Love the human form divine , And Peace the human dress . Then every man in every clime , That prays in his distress , Prays to the human form divine : Love , Mercy , Pity , Peace . 52 MAN And all must love the human form , In heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Pity dwell , There God is dwelling too . We believe , then , that there is in mankind the innate capacity to manifest God , and in every individual man , woman , and child , this Divine Being can be discovered . And it is this Divine quality which constitutes them human beings . Thus we believe that God ( who is Love ) is always expressing Himself . And He expresses Himself most in perfect Man , and Man , if he could perfectly succeed in expressing himself , would express God ; but the Love in the former case would be most nearly expressed by that which we call Fatherly Love , in the latter by that which we call Filial Love . This truth has been expressed by a great Christian teacher in the phrase " Homo capax Dei " ? Man has the capacity of being Divine . This must be at the root of our whole belief in Spiritual Healing ? that there is this Divine being in everyone , waiting to be liberated and expressed , and that the Divine can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues , and can best express itself so . // And , if we are Christians , we do n't only believe that this could be true , or that it tends to be true , or that it is true more or less , or here and there , but it has been demonstrated as true in a life actually lived , which showed once and for all that the divine is most divine when it is also most human . Jesus has lived , and has actually shown us what all Men are meant to be , and it is through Him that we all come to be what we are capable of being . He is that which we are all trying to be , and as we grow up into Him in all things , we also achieve our own highest development of originality and individuality . He does not absorb us , but individualises us , in proportion as we partake of His Spirit . He is to us the channel whereby Divine life flows into us , as He is also the one Man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unique Man . He is not a hybrid of God and Man , but perfect God because He is perfect man , and not in spite of it ; and our Saviour , not because He is alien from us , but because He embodies all our ideals and capacities in Himself . It is eminently true that if we want to 54 MAN be whole it is necessary for us to know God in Christ , and Christ in Man . We may indeed be healthy in the sense that a prizefighter or an ox is healthy , and know nothing of Christ , but to be whole ( salvus ) we must know Man as Christ showed him to be , and the process of getting well is the process of developing Christ 's Life within us ; and Christ 's Life is the life of the simple , universal human virtues . Our lives seem to us to be all separate , and we think we are each one of us " ploughing a lonely furrow , " and having an experience that none can share . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peaks of a great continent which is submerged underneath our ordinary consciousness . If we could see below our normal consciousness , we should see that there is one universal nature which unites us together , and which is the universal " Christ life , " the expression of God 's eternal purpose . We are seldom or never conscious of this life of complete union with God , with Nature , and with one another : Jesus was seldom without it . He felt this oneness of life with God and man ; and His words and deeds were the product of this deep con- // sciousness . He did not possess this " cosmic " or universal consciousness easily or automatically : He gained it , as we have to gain it , by faith : it sometimes , as in Gethsemane , was only achieved by agony : sometimes , as on the Cross , it departed altogether for a while . Yet He won for us this knowledge that we all share in one universal human life , by which we are all united to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , of God as Son , gaining by faith and struggle the consciousness of union with the Fatherhood in God . So Jesus , realising His union with the Father , gains for us the same knowledge of our union with God , as we become united by faith and love to His life and His outlook upon the world and upon God . CHAPTER VI WHY WE CALL JESUS GOD THERE is a widespread desire that the Church would give up speaking about the Divinity of Christ . It is not only that people are indifferent to this idea of Jesus being God . Many good people have a passionate dislike of it , a dislike arising from their very loyalty and devotion to Jesus . For they regard God and man as being contradictory terms . They want to keep Jesus for humanity just because their reverence for Him is so great ; but in their hearts they really dislike what they imagine to be the character of God , and they want to keep their idea of Jesus , the good man , distinct from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is doing any honour to Him to call Him God . Their idea of God is that of an inscrutable Being , of infinite power , who deals out good things to His favourites , and incredibly terrible punishments to those whom He dislikes . And it // can not well be denied that those who found their religion upon the Old Testament , or the ordinary teaching provided by the Church in elementary and Sunday schools , have very great reason for dislike of God . They feel that His character does not come up to the level of the best human lives we know . We may be obliged to put up with His character . It may be that the world is so constituted that we can not do otherwise than submit to this savage , even if just , central force of Nature . But we want to keep Jesus separate in our minds from the terrible world which we have been taught to identify with the will of God . Thus many people passionately deny the Divinity of Jesus just because they reverence His character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . But if they look candidly at the life of Jesus , they can not but allow that He felt Himself to be very specially related to the life of God ? a God , it is true , who is very different from the God whom we find in much of the Old Testament writings , a God who makes the sun to shine on the evil and on the good , and sends rain on the just and the unjust , a God who does not express His favour by // sending thousands and ten thousands of sheep to those who love Him , and punishing His enemies with plagues of caterpillars and cankerworms , but still a God who is a sublimation , if we may use the term , of the Jewish Jehovah . Jesus feels Himself to be of the same nature as this God , an idea which He expresses by calling Himself the Son of this Father , i.e. a son having the same nature as God , and yet manifesting that nature through a filial correspondence of will , and an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not evade the impression that this idea was integral to the whole character of Jesus , and that His life and teaching are in a very real sense a manifestation of the true life of God as well as of the true life of ideal man . He would seem to say to us , " Look at me and you will see and understand God in His true nature , in so far as it is possible for you to understand Him . " And this God whom He proclaims is , as St. John sees , nothing else but Love . Love is God , " and he that dwelleth in Love , dwelleth in God . " There is not , and never has been in reality , any God or any creative power // except Love . I believe that in reality the greatest difficulty which men find in believing in the Divinity of Jesus arises from their low estimate of the meaning of Divinity . If we could see ( as Jesus saw so clearly ) that no permanent structure or life ever has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of Love , which is God , we should then cease to find it difficult to assert that Jesus is God manifested in human life . It is this low estimate of the meaning of God which is , I am persuaded , the real difficulty which good men feel in asserting Christ 's Divinity . People feel that the world is , as a matter of fact , not created in love , but is in part the product of extraordinary carelessness and futility , and in part the product of cruelty and fear . But we must remember that Jesus never denied that it was possible to create some kind of structure upon another basis than the character of God . You can , He freely allowed , build a house upon the sand which will offer a tolerable appearance of permanency , only to effect the greater ruin of those who resort to it for shelter . It did not trouble Jesus that the Jewish Church or the Roman Empire or the Temple of Herod had so 6o WHY WE CALL JESUS GOD remarkable an appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believe in this deceptive show of life . He saw them all crumbling to the dust because He realised with absolute clearness the sort of foundation on which they were built . " Every tree which my Father hath not planted shall be rooted up . " He bids us not believe in any institution or person as having any permanent validity or value unless it or he is founded on goodness . On the other hand , wherever we find goodness and love , there we are to worship God . " He that hath seen me hath seen the Father , " and that , not because of His marvellous or abnormal works , but because the words which He speaks are spirit and are life , recognisable by all men of good will , as coming from the same source which creates all that is beautiful in human life . But it is not so much in the human personality of Jesus that He says men are to find God , but in the character which is revealed through it . It is possible ( He teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is alone the true object of worship , the character of God . " Not everyone that saith unto Me , Lord , Lord , ' 6i SPIRITUAL HEALING shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven . " " Why call ye me Lord , Lord , ' and do not the things which I say ? " All who receive little children and poor people in the spirit of love have received Him , while to those who think they know Him , and yet do not love their fellowmen , He says , " I never knew you . " All who do the will of God are His brothers and sisters . On the other hand , it appears to be certain that He rejected the title of " good " as applied to I-Iim personally , and where this impulsive piety was made a substitute for the worship of God through the keeping of His law . " Why callest thou me good ? There is none good but One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep the commandments . " It is indeed true , He teaches , that all who really love God will receive Him as the Son of God , but it is a greater sin to blaspheme against goodness than to blaspheme against Him . It is conceivable for a person never to have known Jesus , or even , through a misunderstanding , to reject Him , and yet to know and be in communion with God , but it is not possible for a person to reject 6z WHY WE CALL JESUS GOD Love and Goodness and yet to be in communion with God . Many have known God who have never known Jesus , but no one has really known God who has not followed goodness and love . I can not but feel that the Church has made this doctrine of the Divinity of Christ much harder of acceptance than it need have been , from having failed to realise that Jesus regarded Himself as incarnating the spirit of real humanity as a whole , so that He felt Himself to be not merely one man amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life which is manifested in all good men and women . This , of course , in some measure is true of the life and teaching of all great creative geniuses . We see God , not directly , but through the eyes and through the actions of the great leaders of mankind who incarnated , sometimes in their works , sometimes in their characters , great sections of the life of God . For do n't you mark , we 're made so that we love First when we see them painted , things we have passed Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see ; And so they are better , painted . . . better to us , Which is the same thing . Art was given for that , God uses us to help each other so , Lending our minds out . // The great artist knows that , at some moments or in some moods , he speaks not with his own voice but with the voice of God , and he can not but say , " He that rejecteth me , rejecteth Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general mere arro-gance ; but the artist is bound to bear witness to the truth which he has received . He knows that his art is from God , and that those who reject him , reject God . He may indeed be mistaken . Only the Spirit can bear witness to the truth of what he said . Jesus teaches , " If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . " It is the Spirit in man which must bear witness to the truth or untruth of the teaching of Jesus about Himself . So we find Socrates apologising for the claim to supreme wisdom : " I will bring the God of Delphi to be the witness of the fact of my wisdom and its nature . You remember Chaerephon . Once I went to Delphi and ventured to put the question to the oracle . . . . I entreat you again , my friends , not to cry out . . He asked if there was any man wiser than I , and the priestess answered there was no man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any of these other great // leaders of mankind . He claimed to be the only begotten , " that is to say , " unique Son of God . He claimed that His teaching rendered obsolete all previous revelations of God by fulfilling all in them that had any permanent value ; He seems to have claimed to be in closest touch with the mind of God , not only fitfully , and here and there , but always , and over the whole ground of human experience . Yet He does not claim to have a knowledge and authority co-equal with that of God . God alone is good : God alone can assign places in heaven : God alone knows when the end of this age will come . He quite expressly disclaims these attributes of God . Nor does He claim that His own will is at all times perfectly con-formed to that of God . Only through great agony was He able to bring His own will into conformity with the will of God . " He grew in favour with God , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things which He suffered , " says another writer who was perhaps a con-temporary . If we are to call Him God , that is , Love , it is not Love transcendent , enthroned , seeing the fulfilment of His purpose with triumphant eyes , but Love // learning , suffering , evolving , gaining in strength through continual battling with temptation and adversity . What the Church asserts , when it speaks of the Divinity of Jesus , is that love of this kind , filial love as distinguished from paternal love , is as true and real a part of what we mean by God as that transcendent love which sees and rejoices in the completion of the whole world process while its triumph is still afar off . It is not in reality orthodox to speak of the Divinity of Jesus , but of the Divinity of Christ . There is a real distinction . Jesus is reported to have said of Himself that He was the vine of which we are the branches . St. Paul said of Him that He was the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to say , the projection of God 's character and purpose into time and space , the manifestation of the Infinite and the finite , was not begun at Bethlehem and ended at the Ascension . It is a process which began before the world began , and is still in process of completion . The development of God in us is part of the Incarnation . " He is the firstborn among many brethren . " That which is true of // Him is true of us in so far as we are partakers of His character and outlook . We can not approach God apart from Him , but the completion of His life is not apart from the completion of ours . Apart from Him we can do nothing . But He , apart from us , can be grievously hindered in His purpose . The Christ is eternal Love focussed in the life of Jesus , but manifested also in all those who have the outlook and faith of Jesus both before and after His coming . It seems so clearly written upon the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title and no power which can not be made available , through union with His Spirit , for all mankind , that it seems incredible that Christians generally should not have grasped that Jesus did not only claim to be the greatest among the sons of men , but that He is also the revealer and manifester of a true humanity of which all partake . St. Paul had grasped this truth in a way which must seem to us most remarkable when we consider the Jewish prejudices against which he had to contend . Jesus has become to him already something far more than an individual . He is the ground and // basis of the life of all men , the spirit of Liberty into which the children of Israel were baptised , the water which sustained them , flowing from the hard rock , in the wilderness , the Word which inspired the Prophets , the object of the faith of Abraham and the Patriarchs . So the early Christian apologists believed that it was Christ who inspired the Greek philosophers . St. Paul seems even to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ; he quotes no parable or miracle ; even if he had known Him after the flesh , he desires to know Him so no more . The Jesus of history becomes for the Church the symbol of God 's selfmanifestation throughout the whole history of mankind . The idea of Jesus of Nazareth , the Son of Mary , while it is never lost , falls into the background as the majestic conception of Eternal Love and Wisdom , manifesting itself through history and focussed in the intense and dazzling light of the life of Jesus , comes into view . Henceforward , the details of the life of Jesus become more and more to he treated as symbols of the great cosmic process whereby God incarnates Himself in the life of flesh . The birth of Jesus is a symbol of the new birth ( which is // not of flesh and blood , nor of the will of man ) whereby all men come to partake of the Divine Word . The crucifixion of Jesus becomes the symbol of all innocent suffering by which mankind is redeemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uprising . It is in this sense that the Church will continue to speak of Jesus as Divine . Not as though His experience excluded the experiences of other men , or His sacrifices detracted from the value of other sacrifices . We speak of Him as Divine because He symbolises for us all the best experiences of all good men and women , and not only symbolises them , but is for most people the door through which they enter into those experiences . We do not indeed deny that many people in the world 's history have come to God and been saved without having known or heard of Jesus of Nazareth . This is what He Himself asserted ; but we believe that it is the Spirit which ruled Him which is the means of their salvation , and His life is the mould in which perfect humanity is being fashioned . If it is urged that it would be far simpler and more intelligible if we simply said that // Jesus was the best of men , our reply must be that such a view of Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great truth which we desire to express when we speak of the Divinity of Christ is that Sonship is as true an element in the life of the Godhead as Fatherhood , and that goodness , imminent in Man 's true nature , is as truly Divine as goodness transcendent . It might be urged that we should better express this view by saying that humanity is God , instead of saying that 7esus is God . But we do not wish to say that humanity , as we now know it , or that human life , as it is lived by the majority of men , is Divine ; we want rather to say that a certain type of human goodness expresses the imminent goodness of God , and that not all that passes as human nature is Divine , but only certain qualities which are being painfully evolved in the race and which are , as a matter of fact , only expressed in the life of Jesus . Here , then , are two important principles which we want to express . The first is that Goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adored not only as invisible sources of life , but also in all their manifestations in this world of time and space . // We want to express our belief that , although the Divine Life must always transcend the highest reach of human understanding and grasp , yet it is possible to say truly , " We have seen God with these eyes of ours , we have heard Him with these ears , we have touched Him with these hands . " We want to express our belief that , within the limits of time and space , we can really and effectually come into fellowship with the Divine . As St. John says , " Everyone that loveth is begotten of God and knoweth God , " and again , " No man hath beheld God at any time : if we love one another , God abideth in us , and His love is perfected in us . " It is this doctrine of the reality of our knowledge of God through the things of this world , which we try to express when we say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " Son is God as well as the Father . " But if we merely said that humanity is God , or this world is God , we should be landing ourselves in that Pantheism which makes it possible for a Hindu to say , " I worship God in His manifestation as a drunkard , as a prostitute , or a monkey , or an elephant . " That is not what we mean . We do not believe that all types of life , or // even of human life , equally express those great ultimate values which we recognise as being the manifestation to us of God . We see that there are many different levels of such manifestations , and that there are some forms of life which are definitely pathological , and can not be said to manifest God at all . It is only the life of the " Good Man " which we feel to be the complete and satisfactory manifestation of God and , as a matter of fact , there is no character known to us in history except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would indeed be true to say that " Perfected Humanity " is a manifestation of God as the Son , but , as a matter of fact , we do not find perfected humanity elsewhere than in Jesus . Indeed , our whole idea of what perfected humanity means is derived , in far greater measure than we generally realise , from the actual historical life of Jesus . When we say that " Jesus is God , " it is not then so that we may exclude those manifestations of Divine goodness which we find in other men , but it is because we do , as a matter of fact , find that all these lives of partial goodness are focussed in His // life . We allow that the expression , " Jesus is God , " is not a strictly scientific phrase . It would be more true and more orthodox to say , " The Word , or the Eternal Son , is God , who came into the world from the beginning and was the inspiration of all the Holy Prophets which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became flesh through the birth of Mary 's Son . " Through this birth and life is uniquely revealed that which in many other lives , both before and since , has been partially revealed . As Origen said , " We say that Logos was united and made one with the soul of Jesus in a far higher degree than any other soul , seeing that He alone was able completely to receive the highest participation in the true Word and the true wisdom and the true Righteousness . " " They see that from Him the Divine and J the human nature began to be united ( lit. woven together ) , so that human nature might become Divine by participation in the more Divine , not in Jesus alone , but also in all those who not only believe but also take up the life which He lived , even all who , like Him , loved righteousness and hated iniquity. " // We claim , then , that Jesus is God not as though this were equivalent to saying that He is the Father ( a claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as heretical ) , not as denying the Divine attributes which are being constantly manifested in good men and women , concerning whom St. John says , " To as many as received Him ( that is the Word ) to them He gave authority to become the Sons of God , which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . " In Jesus the Divine capacity of expressing Deity in terms of manhood has been uniquely demonstrated and achieved , and this characteristic of humanity of being able to express in itself the Divine nature , is made available for all mankind who are willing to grasp the character of Jesus and make it their own , until through His help and inspiration there is formed in them the mind of Christ , and they are able to say with St. Paul , " It is no more I that live , but Christ that liveth in me . " O world invisible , we view thee . O world intangible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee . Inapprehensible , we clutch thee . // " That which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we beheld , and our hands handled . . . that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us ; yea , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with His Son , Jesus Christ . " // THE SPIRIT WE have seen that the Divine nature is manifested to us as the Father or living cause of all manifested things . We are told in the New Testament that in regard to this aspect of God " No man bath seen God at any time , " and He is called " the invisible God . " This unseen cause of all life we believe may be identified with Love . All things , we believe , that have any permanence are created in love , which is God . We have seen also that God is manifested in the aspect of Sonship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles , growing in knowledge , organising itself through a painful evolution until in the lapse of ages , limited by time and space , with an infinite struggle , it reaches the level of organised life , it shows itself as man , and finally in the fullness of time it becomes incarnate in the man Jesus . Now of this aspect of God , we are taught to believe , // that we can see it , touch it , hear it , handle it . In its greatest and most unique manifestation , in Jesus , we find that the Son lives through entire obedience to the command of the Father , His words are God 's words , His acts are God 's acts . But there is a third manifestation of God which is revealed to us as the Spirit . And this is where the Son , through communion with the Father , becomes in His turn a new source of creative life , not merely a replica or imitation of the life of the Father , but consciously and deliberately initiating life ; designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw material of life in which He finds Himself . This is a manifestation of God which we call the Holy Spirit , in which the Son becomes conscious through His communion with the Father . Now this eternal and Divine life of God , existing in three categories , is repeated in the life of all human beings . We ourselves proceed from a unique , unknown cause . We find that our right relation to this unknown cause is a filial relation . We grow , through struggle and through contemplation , through happiness and also through sorrow , sometimes through satis- // faction , and sometimes through disappointment . We are continually exercising choice and putting forth will . But we are separated from all other forms of life by the fact that we are not merely sons , but we are conscious of being sons . We do not merely imitate any example , however great it may be . We do not live by imitation . Our business is not merely to reproduce that which we see around us , however good it may be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we are creators of beauty . We are able to discriminate between beauty and ugliness , between truth and falsehood , between goodness and badness . We are constantly exercising a judgment , and we have a constant feeling ? which is most prominent in those whom we call good and great people ? that there is a very real , though not yet realised , standard by which all acts and judgments must be tried . We feel that we are responsible for judging rightly about the great ultimate values of life ? goodness , truth , and beauty . It is not enough for a person to say , " I am following my conscience . " If a person assures us that he thinks a sixpenny oleograph of the king is the most beautiful work of art he // has ever seen , we do not feel it is any excuse for him to say that his judgment is a really conscientious judgment . If a person were to drown his baby and say that in so doing he felt sure that he was acting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imbecile , it was no excuse for him to say that he was following his conscience . We demand that people should learn to exercise and discipline their consciences by a standard which , however hard it may be to define , we believe to be a great objective reality ? indeed , the greatest of all realities . We believe that all judgments , whether they are aesthetic or intellectual or moral judgments , must in the long run depend for their value and sanction upon a positive , objective , exterior ideal which we believe does really exist . It is , I think , this fact which really in the long run differentiates spiritual healing from merely mental healing . Spiritual healing rests on the belief that all men are intended to develop towards a standard of perfection which is ultimately attainable , and that they can not be said to be in perfect health until they have attained that standard . It is not enough that they should be following // their consciences , or that they should be happy and at ease in their present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average ideal of their class or nation . We believe that there is an unseen standard of perfection by which we must all be judged , which we ourselves have the power to evolve through co-operation with God as Spirit . Now it is this assurance of the reality of our ultimate values which is the characteristic work of the Holy Spirit . A person who does not believe in the Holy Spirit will be a person whose religion con sists of imitating with slavish exactitude an exterior standard . Now , however ex alted that standard may he , he will remain an uninteresting and uncreative and un healthy person if he is merely engaged in making himself a copy of some already existing standard . But the person who be lieves in the Holy Spirit believes that he has the power of judging and discriminating . He believes that he is himself able to create new values in life . He is essentially an explorer , an originator , a creator . In the New Testament we notice how there are certain points in the life of Jesus when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPIRIT original manifestation of the Divine life ? at His baptism , at His temptation , and in the resurrection appearances after death . These are all connected in the New Testament with the Holy Spirit . They are occasions on which the Son realises Himself as an originator of new life . But Jesus taught that His presence with the Church would not be of the same kind as His presence before His death . He would not be merely an object of imitation . He would become a creative Spirit , a leaven , which would work no longer from outside but from inside the hearts of believers . So that after His death He would be the Spirit of Life becom ing indistinguishable from the life of those who receive Him . So that our work now is not merely the imitation of Christ , but to possess His Spirit , and in that Spirit to become ourselves new centres of creative life . In ordinary natural life adolescence is the period in which this Divine life as Spirit is most clearly marked . At adolescence people cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of original life . And it is a wise and beautiful thought which has con nected the service of Confirmation with the SPIRITUAL HEALING advent of adolescence , signifying that , for those who have reached that age , the special will of God is that they shall live no longer by imitation , nor by a spirit which is merely selfish and individual , but by the possession of the Spirit of God , creating new beauty and interests in life , and sharing in the universal life of God . But it has been believed by many of the mystics that this essence of life which is continually setting itself free from the life from which it appears to have sprung , is in itself an eternal emanation of the life of God , existing from all eternity , and never really enclosed or included in the human mind or body . William Law , the great English mystic , says characteristically about this subject : " The essences of our souls can never cease to be because they never began to be , and nothing can live eternally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essences of our souls were a breath in God before they became a living soul ; they lived in God before they lived in the created soul , and therefore the soul is a partaker in God of the eternity of God and can never cease to be . Here , 0 man , behold the great original and the high state of thy birth . Here let all that is within thee // praise thy God who has brought thee into so high a state of being , who has given thee powers as eternal and boundless as His own attributes , that there might be no end or limit of thy happiness in Him . Thou begannest as time began , but as time was in eternity , before it became days and years , so thou wast in God before thou wast brought into the creation . And as time is neither a part of eternity nor broken off from it , yet has come out of it , so thou art not a part of God nor broken off from Him , yet born out of Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only love that which He loveth , co-operate and unite with Him in the whole form of thy life , because all that thou art , all that thou hast is only a spark of His own life and Spirit derived into thee . If thou desirest , inclinest , and turnest to God as the flowers of the field desire and turn towards the sun , all the blessings of the Deity will spring up in thee ; Father , Son , and Holy Spirit will make their abode with thee . If thou turnest in towards thyself to live to thyself , to be happy in the workings of an own will , to be rich in the sharpness and acuteness of thy own reason , thou choosest to be a weed // and carest only for such a life , spirit , and blessing from God as a thistle has from the sun . " It may seem that belief in the Spirit has very little to do with spiritual healing . But it is very important to observe that there are many people whose idea of perfec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly to a particular tradition . This is very commonly found to be the highest ideal that a man has . The tradition may sometimes be a bad one , as , for example , the suburban tradition of trying to do what everybody else in the street does . It may be a very noble tradition , as , for example , trying to follow the example of medieval saints , or to live exactly as the early Christians lived . But this idea of life as a process of copying somebody else is an idea which takes away all joy and originality out of life . It is essentially a denial of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit . It is the cause of no end of illness , mental and physical . It is really a living death . Yet it would be necessary to challenge such people with the demand that they shall believe that God gives the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him , and that the Holy Spirit brings with it wisdom // and courage and discernment and , above all , common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists in copying the architecture , even the very best architecture , of some former age . We know well the people who can not enjoy any music or art or literature unless they are perfectly certain that it is approved by the best authorities . So we know the difference between a religion which is merely external , which is accepted merely on authority and has never become a living force of inspiration within the person , and a religion which is a constant growth in co-operation with the creative inward light of the Spirit . Belief in the Spirit , then , is one of the requisites of spiritual healing . We must learn to trust our own judgment when it is directed by all those aids which religion and science can provide . We must " take the Holy Spirit . " We must learn to take risks in life , learn that it is better to put out our talents and to risk them rather than to lay them up in a napkin , that passions and emotions used to the full and refined , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like the life of God than passions // and emotions repressed and ashamed . This is a very real part of the healing of the Spirit . If we have this confidence that God gives the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him , a spirit not of fear , but of confidence , not an imitative but a creative spirit , then , indeed , the article of the Creed " I believe in the Holy Ghost , the Lord , and Giver of Life , " is a very real part of true spiritual health , and will have a profound influence upon our lives . // MIND AND BODY WE are apt to suppose that nothing is real in this world but the things which can be discovered by our ordinary physical senses ? the things we can see , and hear , and touch , and taste , and smell . Other things seem to us by comparison far away and unreal . Yet we know that the things which are really worth living for , and the pursuit of which makes men great , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses . What are the things really worth living for ? Love , Justice , Wisdom , Temperance , and such like virtues . The man who lives for these , and who , for love of these , is content to forego the things which are seen , the man who loves his fellow-men , not primarily for the things which the senses easily grasp , but for those qualities which the senses often miss , and often misinterpret , and who , rather than give these up , is ready to embrace // death , is the man we really think great . Thus to live for the things we can not see is nobler than to live only in the faith of the reality of the things which are seen . But while we have to learn that the unseen world is the most real and abiding world , we are not called to despise the things we see , or to count them unreal . The Spiritual is only made known to us through the Material , and each speck of matter is full of the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spirit , but is the way in which Spirit manifests itself to us in our present condition . When we admire the beauty of a great river , it is true that the little particles of water which come from it are constantly changing , and it is not the particular drops that are there to-day and gone to-morrow which we admire , but the form and curve and flow of the river , which is never for two minutes formed of the same particles of matter . Yet it is through , and by means of , the continual passing of those particles of matter that we are moved to wonder and joy at the beauty of the river . So it is with the human form . The particles of our : body // are never the same ; they are changing continually . Our love for the form is not dependent upon the identity of the materials which make up the form : they may change ; but the fashion and beauty of the form remains . Yet it is through the material of which the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present state , to know the beauty of the form . Thus Spirit and Matter are not opposite and contradictory things : the one real and the other unreal : one good and the other evil . Matter is God 's creation , whereby , in our present condition , we are made aware of Spirit , To stop short at what we know by our senses alone is death : to rise through the perception of material things to the contemplation of Spiritual things is Life and Peace . We can not tell why we should have to undergo this painful and slow discipline of learning to see spirit " through a glass darkly " by means of matter . The Christian Scientists and others believe that it was never God 's intention at all that we should be thus placed under limitation . We are taught to believe that this discipline is a necessary stage in our education , and while // it is not God 's will that we should remain in this condition , it is His will that we should pass through it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right relation between mind and body . That right relation does not come easily or automatically . It is the result of right thinking , right understanding , right acting . The right relation between our material body and our mind is when the material expresses readily and promptly the desires of the mind , and is its ready and obedient servant . We are only learning very slowly and painfully how close and intimate that relationship might be . As it is , we find too often that the body will not respond to our best desires and thoughts , and all too often insists on following instead some lower set of ideas , which our " best self , " as we call it , repudiates and abhors . We often say at these times that these are " the desires of the body " ; but the body apart from mind has in itself no desires or intelligence . Apart from some intelligence or other the body is merely a dead shell , a corpse . We must not blame the body when we do wrong . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet perfectly under // control of the higher part . If we had learnt as a race perfectly to control the desires of the mind , the body would act with perfect precision and beauty . The fault lies then , not in the material part of us , but in the mental region . We must think differently , and right thinking will sooner or later bring the material part of us under control . And it is not always our conscious thoughts which have to be controlled . Very often it is our unconscious thoughts , the thoughts which lie so deep that we do not know about them , those which come to us because of our race , or our bringing up , or our family , or our school , which need to be set right . We must not forget that the part of our minds of which we are generally aware is a very small part of the whole . The greater part of our mind , and , in some sense , the most important part , is usually hidden from us altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden from us is generally called our subliminal or subconscious mind . It seems probable that this part of our mind has a perfect memory , and never forgets anything which has happened to us , even in our remote infancy . It never sleeps , // and can wake us , when our conscious mind has given the order . It can , in certain cases , see things happening at any distance , and hear and even smell things , at any distance , read the thoughts of other people , and calculate difficult problems without any of the usual processes of our ordinary mind . This is not , of course , true of everybody , but it is true of certain people , in certain states , and probably many more people could cultivate these powers than those who now possess them . It is probably a habit which we could all cultivate if we knew how to do so . This hidden or subconscious part of our mind has within it deep long buried memories of the race , when men lived wild barbaric lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful . It has within it too the control of all our natural bodily functions ; by its aid we digest our food , and breathe , repair the physical frame , and eliminate the rubbish from our bodies . If we had to think of all these things , we should never have time to think of anything else . It is good for us that all our purely natural functions are carried on without our conscious co-operation . The // subconscious part of our mind is like a trustworthy but quite unintelligent servant . It goes on doing what it has been told to do , but it can not reason , and if it has been given a strong order , it goes on carrying it out , regardless of any change in the situation . It keeps on repeating the old order , when the time has come for a change . It is like Casabianca , who stayed on the burning deck , because , while perfectly loyal to his orders , he was too foolish to realise that his orders did not apply to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus there is a level of our mind which still makes us want to run away from strangers , or attack them as enemies , to prey on one another and steal our neighbours ' goods , to desire many husbands or wives , without regard to their spiritual worth or the rights of others , to eat and drink ravenously when we see food we like , all which acts were once useful to our remote ancestors . Then there are events in our dim forgotten childhood which we have long since forgotten , which our subconscious mind has not yet forgotten . Some smell or colour , or noise , or speech , which terrified us once when we were small , which we can not now remember at all , may // have impressed upon our subconscious mind a fear which shows itself in curious , eccentric behaviour , or some causeless pain , or disability , which may seem to us utterly unreasonable , but which depends really upon the fact that our subconscious mind has never learnt to overcome its old dim memories of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they express it , " two selves , " a higher self , which sees what is reasonable and loves what is right , and a lower self , full of lusts and terrors , and unreasonable hatreds and prejudices , which they can neither understand nor control . This subconscious level of the mind needs to be brought under the definite control of reason and understanding . This may possibly , though not necessarily , involve the opening up and recollection of the memories and misunderstandings of the past . It certainly involves the deliberate control of the subconscious by the conscious part of us , which can be carried out by spending time and thought upon impressing upon our minds the ideas which we know to be reasonable and right . This may take time , and it will certainly mean care and thought . After a long drought , it takes several showers of // rain to reach the roots of the trees : one shower , even though it be a heavy one , will do no more than wet the surface . It is patient continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mind . Very often the quiet going over our past experiences , either alone , or with some experienced , spiritually minded , and wise friend will in itself free the subconscious mind : sometimes a long and regular course of suggestion , either given by ourselves ( auto-suggestion ) or by others ( hetero-suggestion ) , will free us from the tyranny of past fears and delusions ; sometimes a deep , long , and patient analysis of the past is absolutely necessary , and in such cases it is peculiarly important that it should be carried out by someone who has not only skill and experience , but who has the power to put together again the mind that he has dissected and laid bare , and can build it up again on the foundation of a Christian ideal . // SIN ONE of the most remarkable features of humanity is our sense of sin . We have within ourselves an acute feeling of incom pleteness . We could be other than we are . We feel we must go forward , and that not to go forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , to fail in our aim . It may be that we are not responsible for this failure ; it may be due wholly to the society in which we find ourselves : or we may recog nise that it is " our fault , our own fault " : in both cases it is sin , that is , a failure to attain the goal . The Greek word for " sin " means the failure to hit the mark . Every normal person feels this failure to achieve . We all feel that we have fallen short of that to which we are meant to attain . Sin can be thus divided into two classes . There are the sins that we do deliberately by our own wrong choice , and those which we commit because we are members of a 96 SIN corrupted community . Our deliberate sins we feel to be most burdensome to our own conscience , and we are rightly most ashamed of them , but very often our ignorances , the sins which the race , or the nation , or the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are far more destructive both to us and to society than our own personal sins . Many great thinkers , who have noticed this , have felt that it is more to be desired that we should be set free from " original " or race sin than from our own deliberate sins . So Dr. Donne cries out : " Truly , if at this time , God would vouchsafe me my choice , whether He would pardon all those actual and habitual sins , which I have committed in my life , or extinguish Original sin in me , I should choose to be delivered from Original sin .. . for though I have no guiltiness of any former sin upon me at the present , yet I have a sense of a root of sin , that is not grub 'd up , of Original sin , that will cast me back again . Scarce any man considers the weight , the oppression of Original sin . " We are thus confronted with two great truths , the one which we saw in an earlier chapter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect and holy nature of God which is in us , and this other truth that we also partake in an irrational animal nature , which is constantly dragging us down below our true ideals . We want to realise both these truths . We want to face the fact that we are , as the Bible says , " in Adam , " that is , we have a deep , innate tendency to behave , and to enjoy behaving , like the primitive , bestial man . The Church has always recognised this , and spoken , much to the scandal of the ordinary man , of the seriousness and terrible power of Original sin , peccatum originis . The ordinary man in the street ( and this expression has to include the ordinary writer in the newspaper office ) takes it for granted that the Bible teaches that Adam was a man of superlative attainments , which by far exceeded those of any man or woman of to-day , and that he was deprived of all these mental and physical advantages by his unfortunate failure to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach this . Adam is represented as a simple , happy , primitive being , without clothing , without arts , without the self-consciousness of sex . He is 98 SIN without conscious sin in the same sense as an animal is sinless . He is not yet sufficiently evolved for moral choice to emerge . That which we call " the Fall , " is the emergence of the faculty of moral choice , and the act of choice leading to a sense of sin , of failure to evolve ; the life of sex , the relation to the Divine mind , and to other creatures , becomes explicit , where before it had been mechanical . There begins a struggle between the desire to live the newly-evolved self-conscious life and the desire to go on slumbering in the comfortable womb of the unconscious . Original sin is the desire of the race not to evolve : to remain where it was . It is this continual backwash , this dragging back , which is responsible for more harm than the actual deliberate sins of individuals . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make such fierce war upon sex , upon combativeness , upon the acquisitive instinct , upon the desire for artistic expression . Men are ready not only to pluck out one eye , but both eyes , lest by seeing they should revert to animal pleasures . Yet this is the wrong way of dealing with the animal . We have to bring the animal with us into heaven . The lion within us has to // learn to eat straw like the ox , and the wild beast in our hearts must learn to lie down with the lamb ; he must not be cast out . The " beasts " or living creatures must be brought into heaven : we can not get into heaven until we have tamed them , and taught them to serve us : for they are indeed part of our life , and stand round God 's throne . To-day the ordinary man is coming to see what the Church has always said , without always knowing what it meant . Psychology is teaching us to recognise this very same truth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lusts of sex , the tendency to be swept away by the crude emotions of the crowd , the tendency to hide ourselves from stern realities by clinging to our parents and sheltering ourselves from stress behind them , the tendency to avoid material , moral , or physical risk by pretending it is n't there , the avoiding painful choices by driving them out of our consciousness , the tendency to deck ourselves out in mediocre virtues and graces and strut about in self-admiration ? all these are part of our " original " or race consciousness . But we should not be troubled by these tendencies , and they would not harm our bodily health I00 SIN if it were not that there is something infinitely more fundamental about us than our animal lusts and fears , and that is , that we are " in Christ , " that we all of us have a deep , innate tendency and desire to develop the life of Christ . The animal has not this , and therefore can go on being an animal , and not be troubled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say to a man ( as Mr. Chesterton reminds us ) : " Do be a man , " that is , do act as the ideal man , which you ought to be , and are not ; but you can not say to a crocodile : " Oh ! do be a crocodile 1 " We can not sink to being animals without longing to be Christlike . We can not be Christlike without feeling the desire to be animals . We are now being taught that it is possible to transmute all those animal desires into energy which can be used for the highest spiritual purposes . No animal instinct is in itself bad , because it is only part of the raw material of the perfect spiritual man . No man can be perfectly spiritual unless he has the desires and emotions which in an imperfect state are the raw material of lusts . We have not got to extirpate or hide away , but to transmute IOI SPIRITUAL HEALING and spiritualise , those emotions which , in their unevolved or " natural " state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " repent " of sin ; but " repenting " does not mean merely being grieved : it means changing our point of view . We must learn not merely to blame ourselves for sinning , but to try to gain an understanding of the reasons of our sinning , to see what is the wrong mark at which we are aiming , or the cause of our failing to hit the true mark . Christ was not shocked or angry at sin , except when He saw that people were deliberately loving the darkness and not trying to realise their blindness . In other cases , He showed people the light , and had confidence that people would learn to love it when once they saw it . Sin becomes guilt only when we will not turn to the light , and when we " love darkness rather than light . " Does man ever deliberately choose evil ? It seems probable that pure evil could not exist . It is the opposite of life . To love evil is to " abide in death . " Pure evil could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We always find it bound up with much that is good and therefore IO2 SIN attractive . A band of robbers , as St. Augus tine remarks , could not keep together if it were not for the loyalty to one another which is itself a good , and keeps them in being . So no one would ever wish for war if it did not seem ( though we believe it to be an error ) that in no other way could love of country , love of religion , love of adventure , be satisfied . If we could learn to analyse out the good in any situation which we feel to be predominantly evil , we should find that the evil , unconnected with good , had no satisfaction or claim upon us . Does God will evil ? No , we feel sure He can not . Yet He wills the possibility of evil , and prefers it to an automatic innocence , which is not the same as good . Dr. Inge , in his Paddock Lectures , says : " That problem ( evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Augustine : Either God is unwilling to abolish evil , or He is unable : if He is not willing , He is not good ; if He is unable , He is not omnipotent . ' No Chris tian can consent to impale himself on either horn of this dilemma . If God is not per fectly good and also perfectly powerful , He is not God . . . . The only other alterna tive , if we refuse St. Augustine 's dilemma , // is to deny , to some degree , the absolute existence of evil , regarding it as an appear ance incidental to the actualisation of moral purpose as vital activity . And in spite of the powerful objections which have been brought against this view , in spite of the real risk of seeming to attenuate , in theory , the malignant potency of sin , I believe that this is the theory which presents the fewest difficulties . " 1 This same view of the negative character of evil is held by Christian Scientists , and by such mystics as Julian of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , in that it might appear to lose sight of the devastating character of sin . But if sin is , like death , the opposite of life , if it is " naughtiness , " nothingness , it is not on that account less terrible . Yet it is a help if we can realise that in itself it is always feebleness , dulness , inactivity , a reversion to not-being , a refusal to live , a being in love with the life of the embryo instead of the life of the full man . The " fast " man is not really " fast " ; he is terribly slow . He is a man generally who has a great deal of primitive vitality SIN within him , which somehow has been repressed . He is like the healthy boy of fourteen , who is quite naturally and rightly interested in the performances of the county cricketer , or footballer . If this boy is well educated , and enjoys a normal development , his interest in the football league gives place gradually to his interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and his family . But the " fast " man remains a child , though he has the body of a man . He remains stuck , perhaps in the silly idea of betting on the doings of horses , perhaps in the equally silly idea that crude sexual experiences constitute the greatest conceivable pleasure of life . He remains on the level of the farmyard . This is not because he is a marvellous fast-moving or vital person , but because his vitality has got fastened on to a miserably dull and mechanical conception of life . The man who thinks that a great multiplicity of sexual acts , or a continual absorption in contemplating the performances of horses , constitutes a happy life is like poor George III , who could only be kept sane by continually signing his name . It is I05 SPIRITUAL HEALING a terrible slowness of perception : a gradual coming on of death . It seems " fast , " perhaps , if compared with the life of the suburban citizen who lives in perpetual terror that his way of eating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may not come up to the required standard of his suburb . It is a choice between trying to be a fierce and active animal , or an imitative parrot but neither ideal is really human . No human being can be happy who either tries to live the life of a bull or the life of a parrot . It is at once horrible and pathetic . We can not revert to animalism , and be happy as animals are happy : we can not spend our time in imitating our neighbours , and be good by copying them . We must " go on unto perfection ; forgetting those things that are behind , and reaching further unto those things that are before . " Sin is always the reverting to a life which was once in the history of the race healthy and normal , but can never be healthy for us who have gone further . It is for us " an abiding in death . " To be spiritually healthy , we need to analyse our character and actions , to learn to see when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal , this refusal to go forward , this satisfaction with death , is spreading within us . We need repentance , that is , the change of outlook ( metanoia ) , whereby we may see our true life , and see the emptiness and vanity of evil , and forsake it , not feeling all the time that it is a terribly potent and attractive activity , but because we see it plainly to be nothingness and eternal death . // SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE How should we set about dealing with a person who comes desiring spiritual healing ? This is a most practical question and one which must be very important for the Church to answer now that such hosts of people are inclined to forsake both the Church and medical science in the pursuit of wholeness of life , which they believe to be better attainable without either . If anyone , then , comes to us and asks for spiritual healing , we should first of all remember what we have already said , that spiritual healing is not opposed to material healing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of one part only , by any kind of remedy which is proved by experience to be the most appropriate for the particular difficulty from which the patient is suffering . You have to find , in the first place , then , what it is which the patient Io8 SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE believes to be his difficulty , and you must have sufficient knowledge to be able to judge whether the patient 's diagnosis of his illness is likely to be true or not . You may find that it is believed to be purely physical . It is some pain or growth , which would appear to have a physical basis . I feel no doubt at all that it is the duty of the spiritual healer ( who is presumably a person not medically qualified ) , to take steps to find out that the patient is getting proper skilled medical advice . Of course it is very possible , and does , as a matter of fact , very often happen , that the skilled medical advice which the person gets proves to be mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in consequence . But , on the whole , the medical practitioner is a man likely to know and to be able to deal with the purely physical factor in disease more skilfully than anyone else . As St. Paul says in regard to kings that they are God 's ministers attending continually to that very thing " ( that is , the exercise of political justice ) , so qualified medical men , whatever mistakes they may make , are , in regard to the physical factor in illness , God 's ministers attending continually upon that very thing , and there- // fore are to be honoured , and their advice is to be sought . It is very common nowadays to find many earnest Christians who feel that this resort to medical skill shows a want of faith in Christ . I do not myself believe that this is true . The Church in the Middle Ages attempted to stem plagues and pestilences by purely religious treatment . The attempt was a great failure . We must believe that the failure points to a want of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science ( in conjunction with political action based upon it ) has , as a matter of fact , done what no purely religious system of healing has ever accomplished . It has absolutely banished many of the greatest scourges which have ever afflicted mankind , so that all civilised nations now are practically freed from leprosy , cholera , typhus , and bubonic plague . If we find that medical science and sanitation have accomplished this , and we remember that no amount of purely religious healing has ever been able to do this , it is surely a rash thing to talk as though it were blasphemy for religious people to acknowledge the value of medical science . The healer will then insist that if the 1 Io SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE patient is suffering from physical symptoms , ' he shall see the best obtainable medical man , and , among other qualifications , the best available man will be one who believes in the value of ethical and mental healing as well as physical healing . A medical man who does not believe in these things may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , to amputate your arm , or to remove your appendix , just as it is quite possible that the best baker or grocer may happen to be an atheist . But , as a general rule , the patient will be far safer if he is getting help from a medical man who believes in the reality of the mind and of the spirit . Then the spiritual healer will remind the patient that , though physical remedies such as food , fresh air , water , warmth , drugs , and operations may be very important , and a real part of a complete spiritual healing , it is very important also SPIRITUAL HEALING that the mind and the spirit should be treated directly . And so he will be anxious to find out whether the patient is happy in his relation to his surroundings , to his work , his pursuits , his wife , his children , his friends , and his employers . If the patient is not very ill , the healer will take some time in finding out the conditions of his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of psychological experience . If he has no knowledge of psychology , his powers as a healer will be very much restricted , and may even be completely nullified . He will then be wise to seek for the help of some qualified psychologist if the case be at all a serious one . And here again it must be noted that it is very difficult for even the most skilled psychologist to do his work if he has no physiological know-ledge . For it requires a knowledge both of physiology and of psychology to know when people who are suffering severely from their minds are suffering through definite physical lesion or from the want of mental adjust-ment . I am purposely not dealing with the whole question of psycho-analysis , not be-cause I do not think it to be very important , II2 SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE but because there are already so many treatises on the subject , some of which are written by men who have a very full understanding of , and belief in , the necessity of religion to any full analysis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the patient should have a full analysis of the mind , a spiritual healer , if he has to give advice on this subject , and is not competent himself to undertake the analysis , should be very certain , if he is called upon to recommend an analyst , that he is one who is not only able to pull the person to pieces , but is able to put him together again after he has been pulled to bits . It is not at all uncommon to find people analysed until they have lost all initiative and self-respect , and left to pull themselves together as best they can , because the analyst has himself no adequate synthesis of life which he can pass on to the patient . But the spiritual healer also has to remember that there is a definitely religious factor in illness . There are , of course , some illnesses in which the religious factor would seem to come in very little , if at all . One would hardly think it necessary to give a person any kind of religious treat  - -  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his teeth extracted , though , even in such a case , it is not uncommon to find people putting off the purely physical treatment which they need simply because they have not got the courage and sincerity to face the treatment which they know they ought to undergo . And even in such a purely physical case as an amputation or the extraction of a tooth , there is a very real , if subordinate , place for the building up of character through religion . But though there may be some cases in which the religious factor may seem to be of comparatively minor importance , in the great majority of cases of illnesses the religious factor is of the utmost importance , and numberless people are to-day ill , and numberless people are receiving medical attention , and with little result , for no other reason than that there is no one who is able to give them adequate religious help , and many people are leaving the organised Churches because there seems to be no hope of such treatment being given to them within their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It will be of various kinds . It should include in the first place some real I14 SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE analysis of the patient 's state in the sight of God undertaken by the patient himself , if he is able to do it , or with the help of the spiritual healer if he is not . This , in religion , is called confession . But it is here very important to note that the spiritual evils from which a person supposes himself to be suffering are not necessarily by any means the same as those from which he really is suffering . A grown-up woman may , for example , feel that her greatest sin is that she is not obedient enough to her parents or to her husband . If her spiritual adviser tells her that in that case she must try for the future to be more obedient ( and this is the advice constantly given ) , he may in that case be giving the very worst advice which it is possible for him to give . Again , if some young person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suffering from an abnormal kind of sexual self-expression , the very worst advice which a spiritual adviser might give is that the man or woman should promise , to the best of their ability , never to think of such a subject again , or to punish themselves whenever their thoughts turn to such a subject . And yet advice of this kind is being very frequently given II5 SPIRITUAL HEALING to-day . Now some people would say , " This just shows the danger of the religious adviser being anyone except a qualified priest . " But unfortunately there is no reason to suppose that advice of this kind , based on ignorance of psychology , is mainly given by unordained persons . Although , I believe , very often there is no better and sounder advice than that which is constantly being given by priests who have a real knowledge and love of souls , yet it is also true that an immense amount of harm is being done by religious advisers and directors who are ordained , and yet have no knowledge of psychology ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a physical manifestation , are really religious or moral in origin , are turned away from clerical advisers because they get more skilful and enlightened advice from practitioners in psychology who are not hampered by an unfortunate ecclesiastical tradition . Confession , and the assurance of absolution , whatever form this may take , is a very real requisite in many cases for a complete spiritual healing , and it needs to be followed by skilled spiritual direction . There is no reason why we should not // realise the value of this analysis of character and at the same time realise also the great importance of that special kind of suggestion which religion can offer . Those who really believe that God knows all their needs , and that , as they were created in love , so their ultimate purpose and destiny is to be united to the eternal love of God , have in that belief a tremendous and powerful basis for the practice of suggestion . In giving this suggestive treatment , we can place those who come to us in a position in which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the case in those attitudes which are usually recommended for devotion ) , and when the sufferer is in a position thus receptive , uncritical , and peaceful , we may quietly recall to him in a series of affirma tions ( drawn probably from the Bible ? which is the best source of all suggestion ) those truths in which he himself believes , and which are familiar to him through a religious education . The quiet affirmation of these beliefs drawn either from the words of our Lord or from such a source as the twenty-third Psalm , quietly repeated while the patient is thus receptive , have very great healing value . I have known them to reduce II7 SPIRITUAL HEALING temperature , to bring about peaceful sleep , to do away with delirium , more quickly than any physical process . ' There are other people to whom this kind of suggestion is not helpful , who find far greater help through the rites and sacraments of the Church ; and many people who desire both . The Anoint-ing of the sick , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Communion used especially with the intention of bodily and mental wholeness , or the laying on of hands , are very valuable means especially for those persons to whom sacramental acts are more real than affirma-tions and acts of faith . ' I have known im-mediate physical results of an astonishing kind follow upon this use of the Sacraments , where all other means had failed . The patient will gradually be taught , if the illness is a long one , to use the affirmations and acts of faith for himself . But , beyond all this treatment , directed to the special end in view , the healer will often find that the people who come SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE to him are suffering from a completely wrong view of God and of human nature . God is perhaps conceived as a tyrant , or a benevolent despot , or a detective , or an unjust judge , or sometimes the worship of the soul is directed , in an extremely sentimental and emotional way , towards Jesus conceived of as a lover or passionate friend . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as a means whereby we can escape out of the realities of life . When life is stormy , instead of facing the storm , the patient has been taught that he should try to repose on the bosom of the Saviour , and so pretend that there is no storm , and no fight to be waged . He has been taught , too , that if his own character has made him so unpleasant that other people can not easily put up with him , then God loves him more than anyone else , and that , without trying to alter his own character , he may expect to find in God the appreciation he certainly will not find from his fellow-men . The person who never can make himself happy or contented in any situation in life has been taught that he need not make any effort to be happy and contented here , I19 SPIRITUAL HEALING because crowns and thrones await him in the near future after death . He may have been also taught that his illness is a special dispensation which shows him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which is a special sign of his being uniquely admired and loved by God . It is impossible to deal at length with these faulty conceptions of a religious truth . A whole book could easily be written on the subject . But no adequate religious healing can be given except by the building up of character to face reality , which is not generally an easy or pleasant process . The real object in view is the formation of the mind of Christ , that is , the outlook upon God , upon man , upon the world , upon ourselves , which Christ had ; to have within us the spirit of Christ , and to build up our life upon the basis of that same perfect confidence in God , that immense courage in the face of temptation , that discriminating and patient love of all men which was manifested to us in the life of Christ . This work of spiritual healing , which generally begins by people coming with some purely physical ailment , and ends , in so many cases , by a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely one of the great works which the Church is called upon to undertake . The Church in its corporate capacity is called upon to make the work of the individual helper or healer as efficient as possible . This it can do in the first place by removing from its formularies all those phrases and sentiments which have a thoroughly bad suggestive value . Take , for example , such a phrase as " Neither take thou vengeance upon our sins . Spare us , good Lord , and be not angry with us for ever . " This phrase , repeated every Sunday , even though probably the bulk of those who hear it do not consciously take it in , is full of evil suggestion in so far as it makes people think that it is necessary to implore God not to destroy us , or to take vengeance upon our faults , nor to be angry with us for ever . We must remember that Christ taught us to think of God in accordance with our thought about the best earthly fathers and mothers . Now no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mother not to take vengeance upon his sins or to spare him , or not to be angry with him for ever . Just in proportion as he trusted // his father , he would know that it would be a good thing for him that his father should carry out any punishment which the father knew to be necessary , and he would not ever dream that his father would be angry with him for ever . And any father who found his son speaking to him in that language would feel that he had indeed failed in establishing that confidence which any child ought to have in a good father . The form which many of our public prayers now take was natural enough when people thought of the autocrat as the natural source of law and peace and justice . But we do not now think of the autocrat who issues mandates to his subjects as the best type of authority , nor did our Lord so teach us . He thought of Him as the loving and just parent . And the Church is verily rresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it allows little children to grow up with these terrifying and dishonouring notions about God , and especially so long as it emphasises this point of view in the Office for the Visitation of the Sick . The Church remains responsible so long as it trains clergy with no sort of I22 SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE knowledge as to how to take their part ' , in the healing of the sick . Some time ago , when the Church of England was preaching a mission of repentance and hope , I asked a very sympathetic Bishop if I might be allowed to give this special message about healing in his diocese . And his reply was that at some future time he would be delighted for me to come , but that as they were now concentrating upon the preaching of the Gospel , he thought perhaps the moment was inopportune . He evidently felt that the healing of the sick , however much it might be an integral part of the good news which Christ came to bring , was not a part of the Gospel as understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at all events religion should not add to the many existing causes of repression and complexes . It ought , on the other hand , to be the great deliverer from repression . There is no reason whatever why this should not be the case . There can , I think , be no doubt whatever that at present Christianity , as generally and popularly understood , is not on the whole a religion of liberation , but of repression . In so far as this charge is true , it is a very I23 SPIRITUAL HEALING serious charge . During the twenty years that I have myself been connected with this movement , it has happened to me , I should think nearly every week , that , after preaching the very simple truths which I have tried to outline in this chapter , people have come up to me and have told me that they had never heard any sermon or address on this subject during the whole of their life , though they had actually been attending Church every Sunday . It is still extremely common to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly in sending famines , pestilences , accidents , and bereavements , and that people who find themselves continually subjected to these disasters are shown on that account to be specially under God 's protection and enjoying His special favour . There are , I know , many people who would like to see the Church license special healers . I think on the whole that , at all events at the present time , this would be a disaster . If , however , the Church were to decide to do so , it would be necessary to include among the healers a large number of medical men and women who are indeed doing spiritual healing in all its branches I24 SPIRITUAL HEALING IN PRACTICE with admirable effect . And it would be a very great disaster if the Church were contemplating the licensing of spiritual healers merely on the ground that , in addition to being religious people , they appeared to have some quasi-magnetic power in the tips of their fingers . This is what religious people generally think constitutes spiritual healing . And I believe that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that , however valuable this curious , and little understood , power of removing pain by touch may ultimately prove to be , it is not itself one of the most important healing agencies . And if the Church at all tried to exalt it as being more religious or spiritual than the re-education of the mind or the skilled physical care of the body , it would be a means of bringing religion into contempt more quickly than by almost any other method which could be devised . The Church has once before tried , in the Middle Ages , the experiment of risking the whole reputation of Christianity upon this kind of healing by touch , or by belief in holy places and things , or the intercession of departed Saints , and never has the cause of religion been so greatly discredited as by this pro-I25 SPIRITUAL HEALING cedure . There are some signs that the Church may fall into the same error again . No greater disaster could happen , in my belief , to the cause of religion than for us so to misconceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCIENCE " IT would be an impossible thing to try to deal with the question of spiritual healing without taking any notice of the wonderful , and , on the whole , beneficent , activity of " Christian Science . " It is impossible to doubt that a very large number of people all over the English-speaking world , many of whom have suffered greatly at the hands of ordinary medical treatment , have been restored to perfect health through the ministry of " Christian Science . " There are many truths which have been brought back from obscurity , and which certainly belong to that good news which Christ preached , for which we owe " Christian Science " a debt . It is , I suppose , by far the largest movement of psychotherapy existing to-day . I am told that there are six thousand official practitioners in the " Christian Science " Church , and probably another six thousand whose names are not advertised . In England there are one hundred and twelve towns // where practitioners engage in the work of " Christian Science " healing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand in all . It is not , I think , necessary that we should suppose that the " Christian Science " religion is either free from error or itself original , because it has healed a great many people . In spite of the fact that Mrs. Eddy so strenuously denied her obligation to any other teacher , and claimed for herself the discovery of the system known as " Christian Science , " anyone who has studied the Quimby Letters would agree that Mrs. Eddy borrowed all the essential truths in her teaching from Phineas Quimby , who taught her , and healed her , and supplied her with her peculiar vocabulary , and was held by her as a teacher unique , and almost Divine . But though Mrs. Eddy got almost the whole of her teaching from a careful study of Quimby and the reading of the New Testament , she certainly provided the very remarkable and successful basis of the organisation which has turned the " Christian Science " movement into one of the most practically managed and successful business institutions in the world . I28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas in " Christian Science " which have the greatest part in making it a great healing agency ? The element which is most important is the emphasis on the goodness and love of God . To far more people than we should ordinarily suppose the idea of God being synonymous with Love and Goodness is a strange and revolutionary idea . For the great majority of the population in England and the United States , religious teaching comes not from the universities , nor even from the pulpit , but from the Sunday school . In the majority of Sunday schools God is still taught in the character of an oriental Sultan , benign and merciful on the whole , but roused at times to paroxysms of ungoverned fury in which He lays about Him right and left , and destroys the innocent with the guilty . He is regarded as the author of pestilences , wars , and famines . So much is this true that a judge has declared the legal meaning of the phrase , " An act of God , " to be any calamity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of people speak about the " will of God , " they always assume that we shall understand that they are speaking about a calamity . It would SPIRITUAL HEALING seem to them strange to say " God 's will be done " unless they were speaking of something unnatural , inexplicable , and malign . To this very large number of people the idea of God as synonymous with love and goodness is so great a piece of good news that in itself it revolutionises the whole of their religion . These people have also been brought up to have an idea of Man as composed partly of good elements and partly of elements that are bad . The idea that Man is made in God 's image , and that all which is not good in him is merely , as it were , a parasitic growth , having no real part to play in his life , is totally strange . When these people are taught for the first time that God is Love , and that they are the children and offspring of Love , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This teaching is , of course , in itself entirely orthodox , and the fact that it is to so many people strange and new is a very sad reflection on the teaching given by the Church . But unfortunately " Christian Science " teaching falls short of doing justice to the whole truth about God . It was supposed by Mrs. Eddy , and it is accepted by her followers , that if God is wholly good , it is impossible 130 " CHRISTIAN SCIENCE " that He should know anything that is evil . They are accustomed to say that , as light is incompatible with darkness , so God is totally unable to realise or understand sin , disease , or death . God , being infinite , has had no part in the creation of the finite world , and does , in fact , know nothing about it . God 's goodness is of that kind which is purely automatic , since it knows nothing about the opposite of goodness . God indeed appears to be like some very old man who , having become very deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , since he is himself unable to hear them ; or like a woman who has been carefully cloistered all her life , and who is unable even to understand when she hears an account of sexual passion . God is proclaimed indeed to be almighty , but His almightiness really consists in having no power to understand evil , and no knowledge that there is anything evil to understand . God is not understood as the begetter of children who are made in His image and likeness , according to the metaphor used in the Bible , but God is merely a principle which causes ideas , and God is not in His ideas . Men are not the sons of God , they are merely reflections . But these reflections of // God are the spiritual man , who also knows nothing about sin , disease , and death . Yet somehow men and women are found to be so deceived as to be suffering from the delusion that they sin , as well as from the delusion that they are diseased . But these , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are only counterfeit images of the true man . Yet when these counterfeit images of man come to be healed , it is necessary for the practitioner to enquire first , what is the disease from which they are supposed to be suffering . We can not but ask the " Christian Scientist " " who it is who is suffering from disease . " If it is really no one who is suffering , it seems foolish to waste any more time on healing them . If , on the other hand , it is a real person and a child of God who is suffering , we can not but ask how they came to suffer when they are merely a reflection of a God who can not know there is such a thing as suffering in the world . The " Christian Science " idea of God does in reality seem to make God the least interesting being in the world . It would be difficult to hold a rational conversation with any person who was unable to realise 132 " CHRISTIAN SCIENCE " that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant by murder or divorce , and had never heard of a slum . How , then , could one hold any rational converse with the God imagined by Mrs. Eddy , who can only be called good in the sense in which a locomotive engine or geometrical proposition can be called good , a sense in which we do not feel that our gratitude or our love is called into action at all ? There is , I think , no doubt that regarding God merely as philosophical principle has been a natural reaction from an equally bad idea of God as the Oriental potentate constantly subject to fits of anger and emotion . But there is no excuse for religious movements being permanently carried away by reaction . And to eliminate the personal element in our idea of God is to eliminate that which is the noblest source of inspiration in human life . And we can not conceive of personality apart from moral choice and knowledge of evil . It is indeed perfectly true that every symbol which we use about God , including that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supplemented by other symbols . But however inadequate // even the best symbolism may be to bring home to us the being of God , it is better to follow the teaching of Christ in thinking of God as being like the best fathers and mothers that we know , rather than to think of God as devoid of all human virtues and characteristics . I remember reading the account of a speech by a " Christian Science " lecturer in which he raised much laughter by speaking of a simple-minded clergyman who said that he hoped in the next world to be able to go up and shake hands with God . The lecturer proceeded to make it clear that God had no hands , and that you could no more shake hands with God than with a mathematical proposition . But , however crude the symbolism of the clergyman may have been , we can not help feeling that his idea of God , however inadequate , was at once nearer to the teaching which Christ gave about God and more worthy of the admiration of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is good because He does not know sin , who is happy because He does not know the causes of human sorrow , who is altogether lovely because He has never known the intense desire which human beings have , to escape 134 " CHRISTIAN SCIENCE " from the miseries of ugliness into the con-tetnplation of beauty . To say that God is infinite when we believe that there is no meaning in the finite is merely to say that God is unintelligible . The " Christian Scientist " will often reply to this that , after all , the proof of the pudding is in the eating , and that patients who are persuaded of this do , as a matter of fact , get well . By getting well they mean that the physical part of them ? itself believed to be a delusion ? is a rather happier kind of delusion than it was before . But , as a matter of fact , a great many emotional and philosophic suggestions of the most contradictory kinds do cure people if they are received by the subcon scious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex repression must be true because so many people have been cured by acknowledging it to be the cause of disease . Many Roman Catholics believe that the virtue of our Lady is proved by the cures that are wrought through her invoca tion at Lourdes . I remember hearing of a man , for some time a patient in a hospital for nervous diseases , who for some months had been unable to speak , and who was // almost instantaneously cured by being reminded that he was a Yorkshireman , and that no Yorkshireman had ever been beaten by adverse circumstances . It does not follow that any of these suggestions were necessarily true . They all had about them , however , some element of truth which specially appealed to the emotional needs of the patient . Now to a great many people it is extremely helpful to be assured that their illness has no element of reality about it , and therefore that God is unable to know it . It enables them to dissociate themselves entirely from the pain and the disease . This will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery . And recovery often takes place : but it takes place at a very great cost . The person has been made to believe that the material world has in it no reality , that matter never manifests spirit . There is a very real danger of a pernicious dissociation of personality in such a case . If matter can never manifest spirit , if it has no reality in it at all , we may go on to say that it really does not matter what the body does . The body may get drunk , but it is not the real person who gets drunk . It is only the material body I36 " CHRISTIAN SCIENCE " which has in it , according to " Christian Science , " no intelligence or feeling or reality . So the adulterer may assure himself that his act , being a physical one , is not in the domain of reality at all . This danger lies in wait for all movements which deny the reality of the judgment of the senses , and the reality of the world of phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord cured people by refusing to see their illness , and by teaching them not to acknowledge it to be there . , But there is no proof whatever that this is the case . When the blind man came to Him and He asked him , " What wouldest thou that I should do unto thee ? " and the blind man answered , " Lord , that I might receive my sight , " He did not say to him , " Realise that you have got your sight , " but " Receive thy sight . " And when St. Paul urges upon people the importance of sexual purity , he does not say to them , " Remember that your body does not exist , " but " Know ye not that your bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost , " which is a very different teaching . The " Christian Science " religion teaches people to believe that there is no reality in matter , It is difficult to see how if people x37 SPIRITUAL HEALING came to believe this , there could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should people ever desire to express beauty in terms of matter if they really believed that they were vainly working out a delusion ? The Chris-tian belief is that matter is in itself an expres-sion of mind . No doubt at the present point of human existence the kind of mind which matter expresses is very largely bad . But as the mind alters , and becomes more like the mind of God , so matter becomes more and more able to express spirit . There is no reason to suppose that the life after death is devoid of matter . It is , no doubt , as St. Paul says , devoid of flesh and blood as we now know them . " Flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of heaven . " But there is no reason to think that matter is composed of small hard particles of substance , which would , we must suppose , be incom-patible with the developed life of the spirit , All that we know about matter tends towards making us believe that it is full of intelli-gence , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its expression in matter , but that matter will become a more and more adequate and satisfactory medium for the expression of spirit . 138 Dr. Pringle-Pattison in his book , The Idea of God , shows us how we must inevitably think of God in such a way that His being contains for us all which is of value in human life . And that must surely include a real knowledge of sin , of imperfection , and of compassion which follows upon that knowledge . " Theories , " he says , " of the sheer transcendence of the Divine defeat their own object , because the very exaltation of the Divine into an inaccessible Beyond confers a spurious independence or self-existence upon the finite . It is treated as existing in its own right . But as soon as we begin to treat God and man as two independent facts , we lose our hold upon the experienced fact , which is the existence of the one in the other and through the other . Most people would probably be willing to admit this mediated existence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to sacrilege to make the same assertion of God . And yet , if our metaphysic is , as it professes to be , an analysis of experience , the imperfection is strictly reciprocal . God has no meaning to us out of relation to our own lives or to spirits resembling ourselves in their finite grasp and 139 " CHRISTIAN SCIENCE "
