Royal coachman , black gnat , grizzly king , professor ! If Calvin Coolidge never again has sport he will at least remember the summer of 1928 as the time when he learned his fly-book by heart , casting on the brown Brule stream . As July petered out and the level of the waters dropped a little in the dry weather , the Brule 's inhabitants grew hungrier and hungrier . There came an evening when the President canoed home to Cedar Island Lodge with no less than 26 trout . This was one more than Wisconsin 's legal limit but Wisconsin took no action . From trout-fishing , the President , one evening , turned to " plugging " for black bass . Guide John Laroque piloted him over the glassy sunset surface of Island Lake , 20 miles from the Lodge . Mrs. Coolidge and the secret-service men watched and applauded . The President caught ten . Another new sport was clay-pigeon shooting . The President was presented with some handsome shotguns and a set of traps for whirring out the dark four-inch discs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how to stand at the butt , get set , cry " pull ! " and blow the sailing " pigeons " to dusty smithereens . There was also baseball-the opening game of the annual tournament of the Head-of-the-Lakes semiprofessional baseball association . The field was beside the railroad yards in Superior . Long freight and ore trains trundled by constantly . President Coolidge threw in the first ball and the first battery knocked it out-of-the-lot. * Mrs. Coolidge munched chocolates and watched vivaciously . John Coolidge , though there were many hits , errors , wild throws , etc. , looked badly bored . The President left after the third inning-his baseball custom .
