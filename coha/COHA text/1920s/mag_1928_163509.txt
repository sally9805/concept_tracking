I desire to show the world that having out-Neroed Nero in persecuting and denouncing that hated sect of Roman Catholics , I can also equal if not surpass him as a fiddler . Very truly yours , J. Thomas Heflin . " <P> The ninety-sixth senator had , at the same time , received a package and a document from " The Kleagles of the Hooded Knight , Central Falls , R. I.

He then answered a question that had puzzled many people-why he is allowed to live . <P> " The day that I am murdered , " he said , " 100 priests in the South will be marked for death . Al Smith will be dead within 24 hours of my death . The Catholics know this . That is why they hesitate to murder me. "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
