Nominee Robinson was notified of his honor , at Hot Springs , Ark. , by Keynoter Claude Gernade Bowers . In his acceptance speech , the Nominee began by speaking of " the personal characteristics of the candidates , " how interesting they were , and of " the poisons of slander and libel " to be " counteracted . " He said : <P> " Numerous political serpents are hissing in the dark and striking from cover , and with venomous malice seek to poison the thoughts and arouse the prejudice of those who will decide issues of far reaching importance . . . . <P> " No end aimed at by an individual or a political organization can justify the secret or open employment of corrupt or otherwise dishonorable means . The spokesman of a party has the duty to tell the whole truth , and is justified in urging conclusions which his conscience approves , however distasteful or harmful they may be to the opposition . He proves himself unworthy if he knowingly accepts advantage from falsehood , even though not uttered or inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . He mentioned that , in 1921 , the Republican Secretary of Agriculture ( Henry Cantwell Wallace ) recommended the first of the fiercely-disputed McNary-Haugen Bills and that President Coolidge vetoed the two McNary-Haugen Bills which Congress passed . He contended Herbert Hoover favored U. S. agricultural production for Home Demand , as opposed to World Demand . He said : <P> " Mr. Hoover , as the President 's trusted adviser , is perhaps more directly responsible for the failure of farm relief legislation during the eight years referred to than any other single political leader . . . . " <P> In later parts of his speech he said : <P> " President Wilson vetoed the Volstead Act . " ( Nominee Robinson voted for it . ) " . . . The Prohibition Bureau has been under the Treasury Department , whose head , prior to national prohibition , was largely interested in the liquor business . "
