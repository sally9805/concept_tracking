Having just administered a mild rebuke to the Germanic cult of Nudism ( TIME , July 1 ) , long-faced William Ralph Inge , Very Reverend " Gloomy " Dean of St. Paul 's , appeared last week as leader of a men 's dress reform movement-a group of churchmen , actors and professional men militating for less and more beautiful clothes for men . <P> Dr. Alfred C. Jordan , acting secretary of the movement , explained the purpose of the organization as follows : <P> " We want to make men 's clothes less ugly , less unhealthy , and less cumbersome . The less clothing we wear , the better it is for us . Men wear far too much clothing . <P> " We must not move too hastily . Perhaps the first thing to abolish is the collar stud . We really must get rid of that . You know , men have far too many buttons to trouble them . " <P> More troublesome buttons than most men has Dean Inge . As a Cathedral Dean he wears four frogged buttons on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His waistcoat-apron buttons down the side . His legs must be encased in gaiters which button all the way up , ending well above the knee . <P> Interesting statistics on the overclothing of men were produced last week by Dr. Eugene L. Fisk of the Life Extension Institute in Manhattan . In the interests of science Dr. Fisk removed all the clothing from a dozen men and women , carefully weighed the respective garments , found that the average woman wore 2 Ib. of clothing , the average man 8 . Itemizing the costume of a young woman and a man , apparently conservative , picked at random , he discovered : <P> WOMAN MAN <P> Dress 8 oz . Suit 6 Ib . <P> Lingerie 4 oz . Underwear 14 oz . <P> Hose 2 oz . Hose 6 oz . <P> Shoes 8 oz . Shoes 2 Ibs. 12 oz . <P> 1 Ib. 6 oz. 10 Ibs.
