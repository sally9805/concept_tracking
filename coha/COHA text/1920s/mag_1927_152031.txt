" SCANDALOUS REPORT OP PARKER GILBERT " shrieked a Berlin headline last week , when Agent General ol Reparations Seymour Parker Gilbert released his report on the first nine months of the third year of German reparations payments . Neutral observers found the report far from " scandalous , " but instead meaty with facts , logical . They thought its measured language admirably typical of Mr. Gilbert , 34 but seasoned-a Baptist , a 1912 graduate of Rutgers College* and Harvard Law School , a U. S. Treasury " career man , " and so conservative that he maintains a residence m the town of his birth : Bloomfield , N. J. Two Theses . Agent General Gilbert put forward last week in his 131-page printed report , two main theses : 1 ) That Germany can fulfill her Dawes Plan payments after the present ( third ) Reparations year quite as scrupulously as she has heretofore ; 2 ) That the present German Finance Ministry ( under reactionary Minister of Finance Herr Dr. Heinrich Koehler ) is attempting to so juggle the German Federal Budget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Criticism . Naturally Mr. Gilbert did not mention Dr. Koehler by name , but criticized the methods of his department sharply as follows : German budget estimates are unfortunately obscure in their method of stating transactions . . . lack clearness . . . which is both unnecessary and unfortunate . . . . The effect of all this procedure is to present the financial position of the Reich in a most artificial light . . . . " Having deplored these methods of German State accountancy , Mr Gilbert proceeded to point out expenditures in the German budget where he thought there ought to have been savings . He declared : " The budget estimates for 1927-28 carry total expenditures of 9,100,000,000 marks , as compared with 7,200,000,000 marks in 1924-25 an increase of 1,900,000,000 marks . . . . " The military and naval budget expenditures rose from 458,000,000 marks four years ago to 700,000,000 marks for the current year . . . <P> The problem of checking the rising tide of government expenditures has , in fact , become acute and requires the closest attention not merely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of German economy as a whole " <P> Finally Mr. Gilbert stigmatized the German practice of transferring nearly one-third of the revenue at the Federal Treasury to the treasuries of the various German states for ultimate expenditure . These transfers , declared Agent General Gilbert , are too often made without adequate investigation of the needs of the states thus aided , and so lead to state extravagance <P> Bright Side . Mr. Gilbert , having delivered a reprimand , did not neglect to praise , wrote : <P> " Germany has made all the required payments . . . promptly when due , exactly in conformity with the agreed arrangements . . and deliveries and payments for the benefit of the creditor powers have gone forward regularly and without interfering with the stability of German exchange .
