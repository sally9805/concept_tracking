Squat and monstrous , Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum lies grimly along Fifth Avenue like the palace of some dour despot . But the men who choose its collections are not stonily infallible . Recently one blunder was exposed , many blunders alleged . <P> Alceo Dossena lives in Rome , where for years he has sculped in Classical and Renaissance styles . With the secrecy of an alchemist he produces the effect of century-long erosions on his statuary . Alceo insists that he is only a copyist . But he has a Greek Athena in the Cleveland Museum , a Renaissance tomb in the Boston Museum , a chastely draped Grecian maiden in the Metropolitan . The guardians of all these palladiums have been duped . Now they are chagrined . <P> But Copyist Alceo annoys the Metropolitan much less than Manhattan Critic Walter Pach , who recently published a book called Ananias ( Harper 's ) . Biblical Ananias lied to God . Artistic Ananias deceives himself and the public , lies to Apollo . He paints handsome , superficial canvases for popular and social success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , particularly the Metropolitan. * What rather should happen is the cultivation of public taste by impact with fresh , live modes of expression. + <P> Whether or not Critic Pach 's salvos affected Metropolitan dictators , they announced a February auction of 200 paintings of an evidently admitted stupidity . <P> <P> - Modern artists flayed as Ananiases : John W. Alexander , Alma-Tadema , Bakst , Blashfield , Bonnat , Allan Clark , Kenyon Cox , Daniel Chester French , Gerome , Laszlo , Manship , Mestrovic , Sargent , Lorado Taft , Zuloaga . <P> +Modern artists praised : A.
