Mutiny in the U. S. Army is very rare . When Secretary of War Weeks goes out of town over the weekend , he is not worried that the Army will turn coat or disobey during his absence . <P> An affair which took place recently was not really a mutiny but rather a strike . <P> One morning the 57th Regiment of the Filipino Scouts and part of the Twelfth Medical Regiment refused to turn out for drill and other martial exercises . Their white officers exhorted them ; the 600 Filipinos shook their heads . As a matter of fact , they wanted more pay . They are paid on the same scale that American soldiers are paid , but whereas the Americans are paid dollars , the Filipinos are paid pesos . Pesos are worth 50 each , and the Scouts had discovered that the arrangement worked to their disadvantage . They considered what fitting action should be taken and decided to prepare and to " warrantize " a peace able strike to obtain equal pay . <P> Their officers explained to the men that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a mutiny , that the penalties for mutiny were very severe , and that , all in all , it would be better to go to drill . To these persuasions all but some 206 yielded . The obdurate ones , believing firmly in collective bargaining , refused to budge . For the sake of ammunition and humanity they were not shot . Plans were made to court-martial those who had been active in insubordination and to discharge the rest " without honor . " <P> This is probably the first time that the U. S. Government has tried a lock out as a means of discipline for its military forces . <P> Incidentally , some reports managed to infer that Bolsheviks were at the bottom of the " mutiny . " The Chicago Tribune got a real thrill out of it with the announcement : " The naval authorities in Cavite Philippines this morning discovered a plot to blow up the arsenal in the Navy Yard . The situation is rapidly developing and may require the return of the Asiatic fleet in the opinion of some observers . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
