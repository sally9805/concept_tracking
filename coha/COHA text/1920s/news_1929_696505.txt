txt Editor Broad Street Gossip --  " One of your readers says , according to The Wall Street Journal of Monday , that ' when a blue chip stock is split up the new stock seems to lose its attraction . ' But does it ? Five years ago one could have bought General Electric for less than $200 a share . What happened ? The holder received share for share in Electric Bond &; Share Securities which since has been exchanged one share for three for Electric Bond &; Share , in other words a three for one split . Then General Electric itself was split four for one " Let us suppose your reader had bought one share of General Electric live years ago at $200 , what would he have today ? The answer is four shares of present General Electric worth . at $390 a share . $1,560 , and also three shares of Electric Bond &; Share worth at $145 a share plus $10 rights , $465 . Adding the two blocks of stock together makes $2,025 for $200 invested in 1924 or a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . This takes no account of dividends in cash or stock . ' Your reader , therefore , is a bit mixed when he says that split up stock ' seems to lose its attraction ' only to later declare that ' all the big money has been made in shares making new highs like General Electric . ' Union Carbide was split three for one and does not seem to have lost its attraction . It sold at 128 alter the split , equivalent to 384 for the old stock . a higher figure than the old stock ever reached . Aluminum Co. of America was split five ' - years ago , yet this week sold at 5391 . . Anyone is safe in betting it will be split again . Nash Motors was split ten for one a few years ago and the present shares sold this year at $118. equivalent to $1,188.75 for the old shares . " The point which your reader missed is the value behind these blue chip shares . What makes General Electric a blue chip is nothing but the management behind it- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the nature of its policies that it always will have fine management . Stock dividends rod split-ups are nothing new in General Electric history , and the end is not yet . Union Carbide 's recent split is not the last , and the expected split in Aluminum shares will not complete its ; record in that respect . It is all in the management . It is not the speculator who makes the value of these stocks  --  it is the men who direct the company . " I will wager that if your reader will buy some General Electric at this price and disre- I gard temporary fluctuations he will make mole money over the next five years or 25 years than in ten times as many shares of the low priced stocks . " It is claimed that a pool made up largely of interests who put the old stock to new high records is being formed in the new stock . Also that there will be constructive developments which will warrant bull operations . Rather An advance of 26 points in Westinghouse in two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty good when one considers that it was one of the hardest issues to move when it was in the plain seventies . A Good Barometer Operating income of 100 telephone companies for the five months ended May 31 was $115,484 , - 000 , a gain of approximately 8% . The gain from 1926 is approximately 35% . As long as telephone earnings grow , you can depend upon it that prosperity will be with us . ? Nigh and Low Prices Wednesday 32 stocks made new highs and 31 new lows for the year 1929 or longer . Heard on the Street It seems that money can go up just the same without the help of the F. R.- B. Wall Street seems to be worrying more about an advance in the Bank of England discount rate than Lombard Street . One writer says money was offered freely at 12% . Who would not offer it freely at 12% if he had it ? P. F. Cusick &; Co. have published an analysis of Nash Motors in which they point out that net income has more than tripled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the large credit balance reports that interest on this balance last month amounted to $3,850 as against net profit of $1,425 on stocks bought and sold . It was a bear market yesterday with two exceptions . U. S. Steel and American Tobacco . The remainder of the list was reactionary , and there were some substantial declines . At one time Steel common was up more than five points . American Tobacco gained five points on preparations for a split up , probably two for one , and the belief that earnings in the current year will establish a new high record . The decline in most stocks was orderly . Recent weakness is attributed to belief that the Bank of England will raise its discount rate and unsettlement of the Insult stocks . Money was easy , if Ss ; can be called easy . Strange to say the market up to a few days ago was strong on 12 ' , money and has turned weak on 5% money . Fore The annual report of the Siwanoy Country Club , of Mount Vernon . of which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000 of its cash in the call money market . A Little Peeved alsne brokers are openly criticizing the action of call money rates Tuesday . The : eiaewal rate was 12% , which meant that all call money borrowed previously was subject to that rate . Later in the day demand funds dropped to 8% on very heavy offerings , but a very small inquiry . Brokers hold that conditions at the time the renewal rate made its appearance did not warrant 12% money . Texas Gulf Sulphur Texas Gulf Sulphur has been a badly neglected stock , It is selling 15 points below the high of the year and very close to its low At 71 it yields around 6 " , . The 15-point drop from the year 's top has been in the face of the fact that the company ' has spent from earnings approximately $12,000 , - 000 in bringing its new dome to the production stage . In this new dome T. G S. has more sulphur than it had when its old dome began production . Literally Texas Gulf Sulphur has practically doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , yet the stock is off $15 a share from the high of the year . Quite Natural " They are again rumoring Mr. Mellon is about to resign . " remarlcecl one trader as the market was selling off Monday . " A decline would not scent natural in the absence of rumors that Mr. Mellon was to resign . " answered another trader Est rnings Increases Though the trend of earnings in the second quarter and the first half has been almost um- ' versally higher than in the corresponding perSods last year , the number of very large increases becomes more impressive as reports continue to come in . The percentage of companies which were able to report increases of 100% or better in net income was remarkable . As an example , Ann Arbor reported an increase of 100% , for the first six months ; United States Steel , 103% ; Skelly Oil , 580% ; Atlantic Gulf &; West Indies . 150% ; Columbia Pictures , 120% ; Long Bell Lumber , 852% , and Walworth Co. , 725Sr . Not So Poor For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been what could be termed bearish . due to overproduction . The oil stocks have not been strong , and one could easily draw the conclusion that all was not going well . But do not waste sympathy on the oil stocks , as reports for the first half of 1929 show that the oil companies combined have earned 50% more than in the corresponding period last year . U. S. Steel That there has been good buying of U. S. Steel common no one can deny . Its earnings make the stoeic look attractive , anc ' the bulls say it " can " : . ell at $250 a share . That would be equivalent 10 $350 for the old stock which . during the war period , was paying more in dividends , regular and extra , than at the present time , and was selling below par . Everyone seems agreed that U. S. Steel will declare a common stock dividend . The stock divdend , however , is not expected before the end of the year . There are some who believe there I may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue chip class at the close of the year . Corporate Financing Study the Dow-Jones statistics on corporate , financing in July and for the first seven months of the year , and you will get a good explanation for the continued new high records in brokers ' loans . Financing in July aggregated $926,000 , - 000 , and for the seven months , $6,721,000,000 . The last-named amount approximates total brokers ' loans . If the average is maintained in the last five months of the year , total for the full year 1929 will exceed $10,000,000,000 . Of the total for the first five months , 63% was stock financing .
