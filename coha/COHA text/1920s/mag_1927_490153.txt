WE HATE to praise the Plaza Hotel so much  --  but where else in New York is there a hotel with half as much grand manner , where is there so much world-sense , where else would the management be so unprovincial as to put out the Japanese flag half-mast in honor of the emperor 's death ? Unquestionably , New York needs more Plazas . The tea is excellent there , the afternoon music is all that could be desired , and , as we have pointed out before , the women know how to wear their stockings as at no place else . WHETHWHETHER or not Henry Ford ER of Detroit will change the design of his automobiles is a question upon which we will not presume to give an opinion . Mr. Ford is much too rich to entertain the ordinary motives that animate mankind , but we read that his sales have fallen off considerably . We have not heard whether Mr. Ford considers himself in a quandary or not , but we will stand ready with our advice in case things break badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful season , as anyone will realize who takes the trouble to wander through the parks . Particularly to be recommended to nature-lovers is Bryant Park , which refreshes the urbanite in the vicinity of Forty-second Street . Here can be seen a bit of real country  --  steel girders , ashcans and everything . SO MUCH has been said against the buildings which have lately sprung up along Fifth Avenue and outraged the sacred skyline , that it is a pleasure to change the subject . Our advice is to go up the Avenue as far as the new Aeolian Hall , to stand across the street from it , and to look at it . Our advice , then , is to consider it to he beautiful  --  for it is . THE NEW traffic rules which took effect on the first day of the current year have been tried out during the past week and been pronounced a success by their authors . We , in common with other laymen , are uncertain as to what the rules are ; but we are sure they are good ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to affect traffic in any way . The police deserve the highest praise . MAINTAINING their distinction for setting , daily , new styles which no one ever follows , the twenty-dollar-a-week Brummels of Nall Street appear , these zippy noons , hatless and coatless , wearing fur-lined gloves turned down at the wrist  --  frost on their brilliantined locks , nifties on their chapped lips . Adoringeyes of stenographers follow them down the street . They are the latest evidence that the younger generation is still young . N A YEAR or two we are going I- to try to have Thanksgiving transferred to December 26 , but it is not too late , it never is too late , to say a word for President George Le Boutillier of the Long Island Railroad . On the day before Christmas , President Le Boutillier , leaving the Pennsylvania Station in his private car at 9 A.M. , made a tour of the whole Long Island system , ending at 6 P.M. " In those arduous but altruistic hours , " said the evening papers , " President Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each man will receive a cigar and woman employees will get a box of candy . " " Sorry to be late , Mom , " one imagines the ticket seller at , say , Wading River , chirping on Christmas Eve , " but I heard that President Le Boutillier was coming along to shake hands with me , so I waited two hours over my time . But it was worth it , Mom . He gave inc a seegar . And that is n't all . When he shook hands with me , he said ' Merry Christmas ! ' We 'll never forget Christmas , 1926 , will we , Mom ? " Peter the Czar AN ACQUAINTANCE of ours intrigues us with legends of an imposing person by the name of Peter , who runs a " Beauty Home " on Vest Fifty-seventh Street , and who has built up a reputation of infallibility in the beautifying business by a sly and devastating insolence . He wo n't make appointments . One goes and awaits the wave of his imperious hand . One may protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next ! This is Peter 's house . If you do n't like , out you go ! " His slogan is , " Out you go , " spoken with defiance . An assistant waves a lady 's hair and the victim tells Peter it is n't being done correctly . His reassuring answer is , " I direct my girls . If you do n't like , out you go . " Our informant understands Italian and finds the proprietor 's most ensnaring habit is that of looking into a customer 's face while , with eyes glowing so she thinks his remarks bespeak a helpless captivation , he cries , " My God , nothing could help a face like this !

Another innovation is the revised method by which drivers are expected to indicate their intention of turning a corner or coming to a stop in traffic . The left arm is still to be extended in such cases , but a charming wig-wag code has now been devised in which the arm 's exact position plays an important role . There are , too , several old regulations to be found in the book which took us a little by surprise . We had n't known , for instance , that posters are forbidden on windshields , that fire apparatus , patrol wagons and ambulances must yield the right of way to United States mail trucks , and that no one riding a bicycle shall carry in his arms any child under five years of age .

That was in September . Two weeks ago the manufacturer went to bring his son borne for the holidays . He stopped in , of course , to ask the headmaster how the boy was getting on . " Dunt esk ! " came the reply . " Dunt esk ! " Horseless THE RETURN of the automobile show to the Grand Central Palace has started our elder motorists reminiscing of the first display back in 1900 , in the old Garden , when there were only ten exhibitors . The cars shown then were curiously converted carriages , some with whip-sockets still in the dashboard . There was an interior field surrounded by a track mound which the machines were driven . Sometimes they wound through lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days the electric was regarded as the practical car . Nearly everybody except W. K. Vanderbilt came to this first show in horse-drawn carriages . Vanderbilt 's noisy foreign car stampeded most of the horses . Few members of the audiences were daring enough to penetrate the central field , for fear the new contraptions would explode . Most thrilling of all was the runway built up the outside of the garden to the tower , to test the ascending and descending prowess of the vehicles , while their makers watched anxiously , Today cars arrive by train , so tenderly nursed that not an inch of the way do they travel under their own power . The thrill of convincing a skeptical public is gone . ? WE ARE DEEPLY touched in reporting that Frank E. Campbell , the mortician , was so pleased with the Profile which recently appeared m the pages of this magazine that he contracted for every available copy of the issue and has furnished our Circulation Department with a list of persons to whom he wants them sent . This tuens out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pr O THE older ears in the Lyceum audience at the recent opening of " What Never Dies , " it was all too perceptible that Mr. E. H. Sothern was never quite comfortably sure what his next line would be , if any . One old in the theatre tells us that many of our long-indulged stars  --  accustomed through the years to be above reproof ? thus approach a premiere hazily . When , for instance , " The Constant Wife " had its first performance in the world in Cleveland , Miss Barry-more could only grope her way through the part ; and , as the final curtain fell , she must needs embrace the bothered Mr. Somerset Maugham remorsefully . " Willie , Willie , " she said , " I have spoiled your beautiful play , but it will be all right . " And of course it was . Sometimes , as with Mrs. Fiske and Miss Margaret Anglin , stars are so absorbed with the progress of the play as a whole in rehearsal that they merely mumble their own parts until the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great occasion , never released the voice of Me-flees anger during any of the rehearsals ; and when , in the actual performance , it finally boomed forth , the effect on Medea 's children was so startling as to send them into hysterics of fear  --  which , as a matter of fact , helped the scene along tremendously . AN INGRAINED Shakespearean like Mr. Sothern never really feels at home in anything except iambic pentameter . Such a one was the late Louis Calvert , who , when he played with Grace George through a lamented repertory season , never had any but modern roles , and so could only fumble his way through the first nights . Miss George underwent such untold velment with this failing that when , the following season , she heard he was to play Prospero in " The Tempest " at the Century , she attended the dress rehearsal for the luxury of watching some other management suffer as she had suffered . To her dismay , the massive Calvert floated like a feather along the lovely currents of poetry . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , have noticed that , whenever at a loss for a line of Prosperes , the bland Calvert merely tossed in some gem from " Henry V " or " Cymbeline " without anyone in the audience ( except Brander Matthews ) being any the wiser . Gold - MEW YORK 'S gold specie , hav- ing had its annual outing , is now , we are informed by one of those who keep track of it , practically all back in its well-guarded home , the sub-treasury building in Wail Street . More than $15,000,000 participated in the processional and recessional this year , being brought up out of the vaults and distributed around town with much show of armored cars and armed guards . This airing is always short-lived . Two weeks be fore Christmas the banks receive the goldpieces , which they disperse to clients . Two weeks after Christmas it is all of it back in the banks again . The whole thing tends to make practical bankers cynical , and for several years some have tried to discourage it . The armored trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destined to become increasingly popular . Several companies now supply them . The Subway has armored cars . These make the rounds at 3 A. M. , stopping at each station and taking aboard the revenue of each day , carefully boxed . These cars do n't face the dangers of the surface , for a siding runs right into the basement of the Federal Bank in Liberty Street , where the nickels are counted by machinery . The Elevated collects it nickels the same way , but the pay telephones are drained without any great precaution . Such frequent calls are made that elaborate precaution is n't necessary . Story Teller IF IT WERE for nothing more than the fact that a Rotary Club once walked out on him en snasee , Dwight Fiske would be entitled to these few lines . Mr. Fiske is the moderately young man whose flair for telling stories with the aid of a piano has brought him such popularity this season that he is practically living in our best drawing-rooms these days . Be it known that Mr. Fiske , despite an alarmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from Providence . He has played the piano almost from infancy , and from the start has invented his own tunes . A trip to Europe with a tutor at seventeen crystallized his ambition to be a composer , and he returned to go in for serious things for symphony orchestras and concert soloists , studying harmony and orchestration with Howard Brockway For relaxation he continued the composition of light melodies to fit amusing little stories he told . It was n't until four years ago that he found that these stories had a definite commercial value . It was the canny Marie Dressler who pointed this fact cut to him one afternoon at Cannes . The idea so impressed him that he went to Paris and tried a program in a benefit . It worked so well that he returned to America with a slightly remolded career . Since then he has been touring the country , and has anoeared publicly al most everywhere but in New York , a situation which will be remedied soon by a concert at Chickering Hail . Here his activities have been social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarmingly droll . One glorifies Lady Diana Manners and another a lady of Harlem who believed everyone had once been black It was still another , however , that offended the Rotarians of Albuquerque when Mr. Fiske appeared before them . He sang , on this occasion , of the gentleman who came home a little tight and demanded : " Mother of five , get up and make use some coffee . " To which his wife replied : " Father of two , go to hell . " ? COME OF OUR metered voitures are varying the form of the con-ventional " Heated Taxi " sign these days by displaying neat pasters which say no more on the inside than " Mae West  --  Sex . " Those who have seen the play tell us this is enough . Manger IAPPEARS that the new Hotel k Manger at Seventh A venue and Fiftieth Street must be rhymed with " anger " rather than with " stranger . " Not that the strangers will know this or that the crop of had puns wo n't balloon depressingly . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the largest on earth , and , we are soberly assured , the key of each room also its the closet . In no sense . we suppose , is the Manger anything for New York to shout about , sinless it he that more buyers and salesmen can he housed there than any place else . Inside and out the Manger is like a hotel  --  and a very good onein Atlanta , Georgia . As you might guess , the . dining-room is Moorish  --  thoroughly , thoroughly Moorish . This is nothing against the Manger ; New York can support many such hotels without people noticing it , and , with the Roxy Theatre , it will cover the ground where the old car barns were . Family Pride THE NEWS from Long Island that Mr. Lawrence Smith Butler , patron of Smithtown , has ordered cast in France the statue of a bull to be set up in a park which he has given the village is reason enough for retelling the charming legend which the bull is to perpetuate . The story has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and relates that the founder of the Smith family there , having trouble with the Indians , accepted , perforce , the waggish proposition of the redskins ' chieftain , who offered to let him have all the land he could cover on the back of the fiercest bull the Indians owned . To the surprise of all , Mr. Smith survived the first few minutes , and subsequently covered the entire region about the present Smithtown . The chief kept his word ; the property was declared to be Mr. Smith 's , and he was ? not molested further . And Smithtown thrives today . Just AS IS well known , many indus- . trial kings take a deep interest in old age insurance , stock purchase plans , home economics for the workers and similar matters . Recently one of the more philanthropic manufacturers was entertaining a visitor in his factory with a dissertation on his own welfare work . As he reached his seventh or eighth peroration he happened to look out of the window . " Why , " he said with a glow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personally Conducted FOR THE benefit of those bewildered by new facades along Fifth Avenue we feel it necessary to print something in the way of a guide . At the southeast corner of Forty-fourth Street the Harriman National Bank has erected an impressive structure , the ground floor of which it occupies behind windows whose gilt frames give them , symbolically enough , the appearance of tellers ' cages . Across the way is the squat structure which perpetuates the name Delmonico 's . The ground-floor tenants of the latter will be the Southern Pacific Railroad , a Happiness Candy Store , the Lerner Blouse Shop , and one of those United Cigar Store premium stations where the green slips arc turned into pickle forks . BROWNING , KING &; CO. , tailors and haberdashers to our **30;191;TOOLONG , will occupy part of the ground floor of the astonishing French Building in addition to the next four floors . Further up the Avenue are a new Cammeyer shoe store , a Pedemode shoe shop and Le-bolt , the jeweler , in the new Hickson Building at Fifty-second Street , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , northeast corner , is the sedate and faintly sepulchral new Aeolian Hall , which has just been awarded a gold medal as " the best new building to be erected in the district . " The definition is the Fifth Avenue Association 's . At Fifty-fifth the St. Regis Hotel , remodelled , admits a new row of shops , including the American booking office of the French wagons-lits . The four-story Park &; Tilford Building at Fifty-seventh has for occupants Park &; Tilford , of course , and , among others , Hornblower &; Weeks , brokers . There is the new Childs ' , with red vases ( probably containing maple syrup ) above Fifty-sixth , and likewise the Savoy Plaza and Netherlands Hotels at the Plaza . The former will have no store space on the Avenue ; that in the Netherlands is not yet rented . ?
