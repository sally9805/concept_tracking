txt It is surprising to find among prorn.rcn : investment houses considerable 1 rulifference to the situi.t.on in the state of Washington loci .. 1 improvement district bond defaults : , a tendency to stress the point that there is no legs. : obligation to protect the bonds . and an intimation that it rather serves the buyers right for buying such stuff . Somethirg of the latter attitude appears to be held by Governor Hartley of Washington . who is quoted as having said , in part , to a holder of such bonds in San Francisco : " 1 am presuming that these are local improvement district bonds , and that the properties back of your bonds ha%e been sold for general taxes . This is often the case in our state , I am sorry to s-y . I agree with you that there should be something done to protect the people against their own folly . Personally , I do not hold you wholly exempt front criticism for buying such flimsy trash . If people would be a little more discriminatory in their buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily have to change . With plenty of suckers in sight willing to buy this stuff , the bond seller will see to it that the law is very generous to cover his graft . " This latter statement , said F. A. Freeman , a Portland banker , in an address to a Washington banking group , " is a terrible indictment against the banks of the State of Washington . for only through them has it been possible to carry on this wholesale swindle in pseudo municipal bonds . " Careless references are made in Wall Street to $1,500,000 defaulted bonds , as if this were the sum total of defaults , As a mutter of fact this is the amount of defaults admitted by 17 cities and towns replying to a questionnaire sent by the municipal securities committee of the Investment Bankers Association . This questionnaire was sent to 155 municipalities and 103 made no reply . Of those which did answer 51 have local improvement district bonds outstanding and : 7 admit defaults . There is no means of arriving at an estimate of how many additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known from the high yield that there was something questionable about the bonds no doubt salves the consciences of those who sold them and of their apologists . But it also raises the question whether many of the individual buyers did get the bonds at low prices . To take that for granted is to assume a lot . Also to complain that the old washerwoman who " invested " should have read the bond in full first and discovered thereby that , although signed by the mayor and clerk and bearing the gold seal of the municipality , it was not an obligation of the municipality means that those who seek to hide behind that attitude hang in a dim corner the sign " caveat emptor " and are willing to strangle the growth of the bond buying spirit which was born largely in the Liberty Loan campaigns . Because it is an unsavory mess and tends to hurt the business of bond distribution is no excuse for any one in Wall Street to endeavor to obscure the trail with aged red herrings .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
