txt New York must cease dumping its garbage at sea . A warning to this effect has ben sent to Mayor Hylan by Colonel Dwight F. Davis , Acting Secretary of War , as a result of a complaint made to the ' department by Governor Silzer of New Jerseoy . The New Jersey Governor asserts that the refuse washed up on the beaches of that State has almost destroyed the resorts for bathing purposes , and created a condition detrimental to health . His complaint suggested that the difficulty might be overcome by requiring the New York authorities to send the garbage much further out to sea , but the War Department has come , to , the con-. elusion that the sea dumping must cease altogether , " as soon as possible . " This decision was reached by tie War Department after it had also received a report on the garbage-dumping situation from Captain John C. Fremont of the navy . who is supervisor of New York Harbor . In a previous , effort to cure the situation complained ' of , the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further seaward than was at first required , and it now is twentytwo miles from Seabright , the nearest point on the Jersey coast , and fourteen miles from High Island Beach , Long Island . Captain Fremont stated in his report that he waS taking steph to minimize and obviate the nuisance , but that it would take some time . He believes the conditions complained of by Governor Silzer are caused by more than the dumping of . New York garbage at sea , and this point was emphasized by Acting Secretary Davis in a letter to Governor Silzer , when he informed the latter that " there is reason to think that the city is not wholly to blame . " Letter to the Mayor . Mr. Davis 's letter to Mayor Hylan reads : Referring to the present practice of the City of New York of disposing of garbage by dumping it at sea outside of Sandy Hook . I would inform you that the Governor of the State of New Jersey has protested to the department against the continuance of such dumping as a nuisance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , almost destroying beaches both of New York and New Jersey for bathing purposes . As you are doubtless aware , deposits of this kind are forbidden by the ' Act of Congress , approved June 29 , 1888 , as amended by Section 3 of the River and Harbor act of Aug. 18 , 1894 , excepting under authority of a permit granted by the Supervisor of the Harbor . That official gave permission for such dumping as an emergency measure soon after the destruction of Barren Island garbage reduction plant in 1917 . The action was on the understanding that the city would immediately take steps to dispense with the practice . It appears , however , that it has been continued to the prsent time , and that there has been considerable delay in the completion of other means ' of disposal . In view of the representations made to the department by the Governor of New Jersey and others concerning the objectionable Matures of such dumping , I feel constrained to advise the Supervisor that steps must be taken ? to terminate the privilege as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will urge upon the proper city officials the necessity of promptly taking ac- tion to dispose of garbage otherwise than by dumping at sea . Reply to Governor Bihar . Colonel Davis also wrote to Governor Silzer , yesterday as follows : Your letter of June 19 , 1925 , relative to the deposit of garbage at sea by the City of New York , has been under consideration . The Supervisor of New York Harbor reports that the point of dumping has been , since its last extension , placed further seaward and is now twentytwo nautical miles from the nearest place on the New Jersey shore ( Sea Bright ) and fourteen nautical miles from the nearest point on the New York shore ( High Island Beach , L. I. ) . A deputy inspector from his office accompanies each garbage tow to sea and authorizes the discharge of refuse when the assigned position is reached , submitting a full and detailed report of the voyage on his return . In addition , the patrol vessels inspect the tows en route in the lower harbor 5. nd keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Referring to your request that the dumping point be placed still further out at sea , it appears that the scows must now be towed from forty to forty-two miles from their point of departure to the present dumping grounds , requiring from twenty-four to twenty-six hours to complete the round trip , depending on tidal and weather conditions , and , during the Summer season , when removal of garbage is at its peak and scows must be kept alongside the dumping boards to receive the daily collections , all available dumpers are in service . In addition , the unseaworthy character of the scows when loaded makes it unsafe to require them to proceed still further to sea , where they would be placed in danger from sudden and violent storms . A further extension of the limits at this time might lead to the construction or purchase of more seaworthy scows , and result in requests for an extension of the dumping privilege . The objectionable features of which you speak are appreciated , and I , am urging the Mayor of the City of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of garbage disposal . In this connection , I would say , however , that there is reason to think ? that the city is not wholly to blame . Storms sometimes cause the premature dumping of scows at points where the material may possibly be washed ashore , and it is believed that there are other contributory causes of beach pollution , such , for example , as the throwing overboard of refuse by the great shipping traffic in and out of New York harbor , and from the numerous small fishing craft that anchor off the coast in the vicinity of Sandy Hook over week-ends . It should be said also in behalf of the city that considerable progress has been made in providing for disposal of its garbage otherwise . Three incinerating plants are in operation , a fourth is nearly completed and plans and specifications have been drawn for three additional plants . You will appreciate the fact how a very large and expensive inspection force would be necessary to prevent deposits of garbage from all vessels navigating in and about New York harbor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department to have the practice terminated at the earliest practicable date . The supervisor is expected to keep in close touch with the matter and with the progress being made by the city in carrying out its garbage disposal , program . Ask Shipping Lines to Cooperate . Captain Fremont reported to the War Department that , so far as New York City garbage was concerned , he had an agent on every scow ? to make certain that the dumping was done not less than twenty-two miles from shore , but he expressed the opinion that it would be better for New York to dispose of its garbage by other means . More refuse than usual is being dumped at sea because of the incapacity of the Barren Island disposal works and the delay of New York in completing the units of its new disposal system . Once the latter is in operation , Captain Fremont believes the situation will be relieved so far as New York is concerned . In the opinion of Captain Fremont , however , there are other causes for the littering of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , especially on Sundays , with several thousand persons aboard , are declared to be responsible for part of the litter . Another cause is the transatlantic liners . Coming into port , according to Captain Fremont , they dump all their garbage overboard , and in going out they also dump what has accumulated in port . This phase of the problem has been taken up by . Captain Fremont with the shipping companies in an effort to obtain an agreement to have the steamers do their dumping further at sea . DENIES CITY IS TO BLAME . Commissioner Taylor Asserts Ships ' Refuse Litters Beaches . In the absence of Mayor Hylan , who , was visiting at his old home in Greene County , Alfred A. Taylor . Commissioner of the Department of Street Cleaning , yesterday commented on the letter addressed to the Mayor by the Acting Secretary of War regarding the disposal of garbage otherwise than by dumping at sea . " There is no action we cane take at present other than that which is being taken , " said Commissioner Taylor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumping at sea , pending completion of the city 's chain of incinerating plants , we have been dumping all city garbage at a point not less than twenty marine miles to the southeast of the Scotland Lightship . That is from five to six marin. , miles further off shore than the department has ever before felt ' it necessary to go . Furthermore , it is twentytwb miles seaward from the nearest point of the New Jersey coast . " I maintain , and I can bring com petent evidence to prove it , that it is a I physical impossibility for refuse matter dumped at such a remote point seaward . to find its way back to the New Jersey or Long Island beaches . It is not New York City garbage that litters the beaches , to the discomfort and annoy , ance of bathers at these resorts . It is refuse material , as I have said before , that is cast overboard from passing transatlantic and coastwise vessels , scores of which every day lay courses much closer to the beaches than the r points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unloaded . " Commissioner Taylor was reminded of I the physical evidence produced by some of the beach critics in the form of papers , bottles , cans , crates and the Like . all bearing proof of a New York point of origin , which have been picked up at some of the populous bathing resorts along the New Jersey and Long Island shores . " Yes , I know all about that . " he deOared , " but what does that prove ? 1Ships ' galleys and storerooms are cleaned out daily . Their refuse and discarded material , including papers , envelopes , boxes , cans . bottles and crates , sweepings and all the rest of a ship 's litter , are tossed overboard . Naturally , a large proportion , of this waste material has hailed originally from New York City as the point of its manufacture , sale or distribution . Our contention , in the first place , is that the nuisance complained of is not one for which the city dumping is responsible . Could n't Alter Practice . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see what we could do to improve condition with our present facilities . To tow these scows and barges still . further out to sea ? e'ven if , there were any advantage in that expedient , which we deny ? is a physical impossibility . The department is using daily every bit of its towing and floating equipment to the limit of its capacity . Govern'meat inspectors accompany the scows to make sure that they are not emptied inside the limits I have defined . If we go further out to sea , that means a longer voyage for each trip , outbound and inbound . The additional time consumed would make it impossible , with our present marine equipment , to keep the city free from accumulating animal and vegetable , matter , because we would he ' unable to make a sufficient number of trips . And to permit the accumulation in the city of any considerable quantities of refuse material , particularly in midsummer weather , would be to invite pestilence . " All this has been pointed out to the War Department and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , " Commissioner Taylor continued . " the ultimate solution of this important municipal problem lies in the development and early completion of the city 's comprehensive and adequate chain of incinerating plants . With those plants in successful operation , the present necessity of dumping refuse material at sea will cease . And , as the Federall department has been assured- , the City Administration is bending every possible energy toward that result . Three of these modern and capacious incinerating plants already are in operation , a fourth is nearly completed , and plans and specifications have been drawn up for three more . " We are as eager for their completion as anybody else can be . But every newspaper reader is familiar with some of the difficulties and embarrassments with which we are beset at every step . No sooner is a. desirable site selected by the department for one of these reduction plants than a public hearing on the subject precipitates a storm of opposition from residents , property owners and civic organizations of the immediate section concerned . Everybody believes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot remote from his or her own particular heritage . " Recent illustrations are seen in the agitation of the residents of the University Heights section and the protests filed by the authorities of New York University and in the still more recent injunction forbidding the erection of an incinerator on the Manhattan east side waterfront. " , lampaign by Beach Residents , William B. Roulstone , President of the Parks Conservation Association , said yesterday that he had appointed a committee of the association to take action to prevent the practice of dumping New York City 's garbage so close inshore that it floats to the beaches of Long Island and New , Jersey . " I Dave three investigators at work viewing conditions on the beaches and gathering photographs and statements from citizens , " said Mr. Roulstone . " The evidence is perfectly clear that the major part of the pollution of the beaches of this city and those further down on Long Island and in New Jersey is due to the garbage of New York City . For instance , hundreds of bottles and cans that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The evidence that is being gathered will lay the basis for legal action , if necessary , to prevent this practice . We are making an appeal to residents and visitors at beaches to send photographs and other evidence of the origin of the garbage and of the extent of the beach pollution to my office at 26 Exchange Place , for use in an energetic campaign to make the city discontinue this shocking practice . " The responsibility for the beach pollution rests solely on the shoulders of one man  --  Mayor John F. Hylan . After lyears of protest and of demonstration of the evils of the wretched policy of clumping garbage close to the shore , Mayor Hylan has not raised a finger to prevent it . " There is a very simple way to handle this matter . That is to find out the distance out at sea at which garbage may be dumped without danger of causing unpleasantness to the beaches . If this distance is a hundred miles , see to it that the scows go out a hundred miles . Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky and dump their cargo off a beach , and then hurry back for another cargo . Every time the scow cuts short its journey and ' dumps inshore it increases the profits of the contractor . " Our investigation has shown already that , while the condition of pollution varies from time to time , all those within the range of New York City 's garbage are more el- less polluted . Naturally , those int , re tad in these beaches do not like to a this unpleasant condition , and the remedy is for all the ocean resorts afflicted with this evil to get together and make a joint fight for a clean ocean . " I , believe that legal action can be successfully taken to stop this nuisance , but the immediate object of the fight should be to convince Mayor Hylan that he would do well to discontinue the policy of dumping garbage where it disgusts and endangers the health of hundreds ? of thousands of the residents of his city . One word from him should be enough to put a prompt end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garbage dumping contractors would not like it . "
