Liberalism is not so plentiful in the U. S. but that three generations of it in one family are noteworthy . A white-haired lady who died suddenly last week at Dobbs Ferry , N. Y. , aged 83 , was the only daughter of William Lloyd Garrison , the Boston man by whose eloquence and persistence the Abolition movement attained national proportions before the Civil War . Today her son , Oswald Garrison Villard , is editor of the Nation , liberal weekly . <P> Small Fanny Garrison helped her father correct proofs for many an issue of The Liberator . She was with him when he conferred about freeing the slaves with John Brown , Wendell Phillips , Samuel J. May et al . <P> <P> She was a young girl when the Civil War came .

Two other grandsons , sons of Harold Garrison Villard , a onetime editor of the Nautical Gazette have already departed the usual paths of liberals . One , Henry Villard , is in the U. S. Diplomatic Corps ; the other , Vincent Villard is a white-collar man in a Manhattan bank .
