Fewer air accidents , in proportion to the number of planes flown , are happening . Last week the Department of Commerce , kindly Cerberus of U.S. aviation , issued its periodic statistics : <P> 1st Half 2nd Half Increase 1928 1928 <P> Pilots licensed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,535 4,887 92% <P> Accidents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 390 672 70% <P> Deaths . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 153 215 40% <P> Half the accidents occurred on miscellaneous pleasure flights , only 51 on scheduled commercial flights . <P> Due to the zealous work of the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce and the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics , newspapers now give no more emphasis to air accidents than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention the name of the plane and motor in the crash . The idea of this censorship is to avoid scaring prospective airplane owners and riders , to protect the public 's air-consciousness from unnecessary jars .
