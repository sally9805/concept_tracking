Louisa Miller was the name of a prize-winning Holstein cow now deceased , which once belonged to President Daniel Willard of the Baltimore &; Ohio R. R. Louisa Miller , spelled in the Italian way without the o , is the name of an early Giuseppe Verdi opera which last week was raised from a sleep seemingly as sound as the bovine Louisa 's and given performance at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House . <P> The great poet Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller conceived the character of Luisa Miller , made her the unhappy heroine of his play Kabale und Liebe . Italian Poet Salvatore Cammarano fashioned the opera libretto from the Schiller piece , aptly labeled the acts Love , Intrigue , Poison . The scene is in the Tyrol . Luisa , a beautiful peasant , loves Rodolfo who turns out to be the son of the village 's haughty overlord . He would forbid their marriage , arrest Luisa and her doting father . But Rodolfo , Hamletwise , knows of the murder which won his father his titles and his wealth , threatens him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luisa for himself , he kidnaps her father , tells her that to save his life she must sign a paper denying her love for Rodolfo . She complies . The paper reaches Rodolfo and he , grief-crazed , seeks her in her cottage . Together they drink poison from a glass of lemonade , sing loudly of their love despite most awful agony , die . <P> For all this Verdi wrote songful dramatic music which 80 years ago had great success . Last week it was stamped by most listeners as pleasant , old-fashioned stuff significant only because it gives a hundred hints of the later , greater Verdi . Distinguishing feature of the performance : the sumptuous singing of Soprano Rosa Ponselle , prevented by a severe throat affection from appearing earlier in the season .
