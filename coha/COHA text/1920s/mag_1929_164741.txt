Prime U. S. button-presser is President Hoover . But last week the President could not oblige . In his stead Vice President Curtis did some button-pressing to flash a signal from Washington to Rhode Island . There a cannon boomed salutes . An airplane dropped noisemakers . U. S. Cruiser Dallas tooted its whistle . Two little girls cut ribbons while silk-hatted notables stood by . These ceremonious alarums celebrated the opening of the new Mt . Hope suspension bridge , world 's seventh largest , connecting the two sea-severed fragments of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations . Best ceremony : initiation of Rhode Island 's Governor Norman Stanley Case and State Senator William H. Vanderbilt into the Wamapoag Indian tribe . <P> <P> A boon to Newport-bound socialites is the new bridge . Long have they had to cross to the southern peninsula on a slow , chugging ferry , instituted in 1680 , onetime carrier of Washington , Lafayette , Rochambeau.
