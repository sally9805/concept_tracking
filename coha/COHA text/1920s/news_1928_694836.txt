txt Samuel Untermyer , special counsel to the . Transit Commission , announced yesterday his completed . plan for the organization of a " board of transit control " to take over the proposed unified , rapid transit system . The proposed form of transit management has received the approval of the Transit Commission , the City Administration and the principal owners of the BrooklynManhattan Transit Corporation . Bills to permit the Transit Commission to put it into effect are to be introduced in the Legislature tonight . At an executive meeting Saturday the Transit Commission formally authorized ? the introduction of the legislation . Every effort Is to be made by those supporting the bills to obtain their passage before the Legislature adjourns on March 16 . The " Board of Transit Control " would be a public corporation owned by the city , its directors to represent both the municipality and the owners of securities in the present rapid transit companies . Control in All matters of general policy ' would be left with the Board of Estimate . ? Confer on the Bills . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is understood , invited the leaders of the Legislature for both parties to confer with him . Although Mr. Untermyer declined to discuss what took place , a member of the . Transit Commission was responsible for the information that Senator John Knight , Republican ? leader of the Senate , met with Mr. Untermyer and representatives of the B. M. T. at the Hotel Ambassador , where Mr. Untermyer has been confined to his apartment by illness , on Saturday . Yesterday Speaker Joseph A. and Minority Leader Maurice Bloch of the Assembly went over the bills with him . Senator Bernard Downing , Democratic leader of the Senate , was kept at Albany by legislation requiring his attention . It is understood Senator Knight declined to commit himself on the measures , but Speaker was said to be inclined to recommend their passage . Assemblyman Bloch , a Democrat , was , of course , in favor of the bills , and it is expected Senator Downing will be , ' too . The B M. T. representatives were 4 . M. VVilliams and Leroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all of the negotiations between Mr. Untermyer and the B. M. ' T. Transit legislation sponsored by the Board of Transportation will come up for hearings at Albany tomorrow , and it is expected Mayor Walker will go to Albany to speak in favor of the bills . Transportation Commissioner Francis X. Sullivan and Daniel Ryan are also to appear in behalf of the measures . Introduction of the legislation , with its probable adoption , marks a definite step forward in the effort to unify New York City 's transports. ; tion facilities , Mr. Untermyer said . The Interborough Rapid Transit Company 's suit for an increased fare and the threatened strike on ' the I. R. T. system can not now prevent a solution of the transit problem along lines which protect the public interest , he added . Labor Heads to See Mayor . There were no outward developments in the transit labor situation yesterday . Union leaders were in conference most of the day , prepar. ; ing their appeal to Mayor Walker today . They intend to ask the Mayor to seek the reinstatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amalga- , mated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employes , ' the American Federation of Labor union which is seeking to supplant the company-controlled Brotherhood of Interborough Employee . They , are also to apply to Supreme Court Justice Isidor Wasservogel for his aid in compelling the . Interborough to live up to the spirit of his decision holding that the employes have a right to join any union they choose to join . Speaking in behalf of James H. Coleman , organizer of the . Amalgamated , Harry R. Calkins said last night that they would both see Mayor Walker today to ask him to intervene in favor of the men . " The Interborough refuses to have anything to do with us , " Mr. Calkins said , " so we are asking the Mayor to champion the cause of the nineAF teen men . In the event that the company refuse to listen to the Mayor , then , naturally , there is no other person or organization that we can look to for action but ourSelves . " Last Summer more than 85 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that number has increased considerably since then . " He said that William D. Mahon , President , and William B. Fitzgerald , Vice President , of the Amalgamated would come here from Detroit on Wednesday . Mr. Untermyer intimated that he might take a hand in the labor situation , because of its effect on the unification plan , as he did in the 7- ' cent fare suit . He reiterated his intention to seek to recover from the Interborough for the city money spent in breaking the 1926 strike , any sums the company may spend in its present effort to prevent its men from organizing and the costs of the company's- attempt to obtain a 7-cent fare from the Federal courts . These expenses are charged to operation and would be available for a return on the city 's investment were the money not spent for these purposes , Mr. Untermyer contends . Not Worrying Over Suit . " We are not worrying about these latest attempts to increase the fare , " said Mr. Untermyer yesterday . " Our faith in the sanctity of contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Federal courts is unabated . We are satisfied that nothing will be done to interfere with the pending proceedings to put these properties together under city ownership . If these bills are passed , the negotiations for acquiring the rapid transit lines , either by purchase or recapture , will go forward rapidly from now on . The problems are so complicated and the details so numerous that it takes a vast amount of time . " Whether we shall proceed by purchase or recapture as to either or both companies will depend on the price asked and the attitude of the security holders . They will be offered a just plan , but the price must be such as to give assurance of the continuation of a five cent fare . " I have always favored taking advantage of our contract rights of recapture as the fairest and most economical plan for the city . Recent events have confirmed that conviction in the minds of many of the city officials who were of different minds . " This is especially true as to the Interborough . I consider recapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holders will sufficiently realize their peril and will put the negotiations in the hands of their bankers or of practical men . So long as their sole spokesman is a stubborn , unpractical , unbusinesslike man who has no interest in the property except to pull out his $72,000 a year and ' strike ' bonuses , knows nothing about negotiations and is wedded to lawsuits as the only means of solving business problems , we shall get nowhere . " His maladroit and ill-timed action in precipitating litigation to repudiate the company 's solemn contract obligations , and just at the most prosperous time in the company 's history , has given a great impetus to recapture which had previously been greatly misunderstood . Tronazanda Overcome , He Says . " It has not been possible until now to overcome the company 's years of propaganda so as to make the people realize that all that is meant by recapture is the right reserved to the city by its contracts with the company to take back the property for which it paid by paying to the company dollar for dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 15 per cent . That right and the five-cent fare , both of which are now being repudiated by the company , were the only advantages the city secured from its $200,000,000 investment on which it has not had a cent of return , and now there is this drive on foot to repudiate both of them . " How can the city afford . to make further contracts or bargain with a corporation with such business morals ? What assurance would there be that the next contract will not be treated in the same way ? Remember that the company is earning and paying interest and sinking fund on all its obligations and earned last year nearly $7,000,000 over and above the fixed charges on its total investment . That , too , after charging off out of the city 's pocket a loss of about $2,000,000 as a result of the foolish and aimless strike in July , 1926 , for which the city hr been made to pay as it is now being made to pay for the foolhardy labor policy of the company . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles because of their effect on our plan . The policy of the company is gratuitously and unnecessarily brutal , arrogant and foolhardy . If you want to know how brainless it is , contrast it with the labor conditions in the B. M. T. , where any worker can belong to any union he sees fit or can belong to none , and where there are no labor troubles . So long as the Interborough is permitted to waste thegity 's money ? for every dollar it is throwing away is coming out of the city 's pocket ? this hopeless condition will continue . Two million dollars would buy 100 additional cars . " Mr. Quackenbush is obsessed with the notion that a labor organization is an evil thing . It was proven at the hearings that this ' fake ' or so-called ' company ' union was organized and is financed entirely by the company . It is costing the city ? not the company , mind you , but the city  --  a small fortune every year . A labor union that has to be entirely maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . is n't it ? . Cost of Last Strike . " The last strike did not cost the company a cent . It cost the city about $2,000,000 , of which $967,000 was in the form of ' expenses ' of the most outrageous character . Whilst the company is pleading poverty in the courts , it goes on squandering money in this foolish hopeless fight against organized labor and will continue to do so until the present management is turned out and one with business brains and judgment is substituted . " The ? city should not lose another day in giving notice of . recapture and in taking this property out of the incompetent hands in which it rests . The trouble is that the stock is so scattered in the names of Wall Street brokers that nobody has been able to find out who are the owners . otherwise it would long since , have been rescued from its present selfassumed leadership . " If current events have not taught the people that immediate recapture is their only remedy , nothing ' will move them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be possible to impress upon them the fact that every dollar that is being pulled out of the till In this fight against the city for an increased fare and that every dollar that is being squandered in this needless and foolish struggle against organized labor is the city 's money and would come to the city if it were not being wasted . Not a dollar of it belongs to the company . The same was true of the $2,000,000 thrown away in the strike of 1926 to prevent the men from organizing and of the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent for propaganda for an increased fare . " Evgn the cost of the present suit ; for as Obreased fare is being pulled put of the city , but we shall try to get it back . Just think of making the city pay the legal expense of the attempt to break its contract ! " The proposed legislation which will be presented to the Legislature tonight was outlined he Mr. Untermyer in a report which he made to the Transit Commission at Saturlay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , outlining his general plan of unification . The general plan provides for the acquisition by the city of the rapid transit properties of the B. M. T. and the I. R. T. , as a whole if the companies will sell at a fair price , or in part , through recapture of the city-owned parts of the two systems , the acquired lines to be operated with the new city lines now under construction . The general plan provided for a board of control , as required by the act which charges the Transit Commission with the duty of preparing such a plan , and submitting it to the city and the companies . The manner in which the board of control would function was not fully set forth , however . Neither was it revealed until yesterday that the Walker Administration had approved the idea of a " Board of Transit Control , " as Mr. Untermyer now calls it . The B. M. T. approval was obtained by Mr. Untermyer in the course of the negotiations which have been in progress since last November , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell the B. M. T. lines to the city . Their approval of . the plan of management , however , does not commit the company to the purchase plan . A Constitutional Amendment . The first of the two bills is a concurrent resolution to initiate a Constitutional amendment which will allow the city to exempt from the debt limit bonds issued against income-producing improvements in the extent to which the projects may be self-supporting . This will exempt bonds issued to acquire the present subway lines so that the city 's credit may be used without interfering with other city needs . It will also extend the city 's credit by allowing the exemption of bonds issued to pay for the new subways if they are made self-supporting . The whole question of the rate of fare is left with the Board of Estimate under the Board of Transit Control measure . This bill is simply an amendment to the act , one section of which created the Transit Commission and empowered it to seek a solution of the transit muddle . Provides Separate Corporations . The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate corporations to hold the various properties which may be acquired . The stock of these companies will all be owned by the Board of Transit Control . In this way , however , the earnings or losses of the different lines can be kept segregated . The Board of Transit Control is allowed , however , to apply the earnings of one company to the deficits of another . Thus , the old subways , now operated at a profit , can be made to pay a share of the cost of operation of the new city subways which are being built at a cost far in excess of the old lines . If the whole system can not operate profitably at a 5-cent fare  --  and Mr. Untermyer gives it as his opinion that this can be done  --  then the Board of Estimate may determine whether to increase the fare or meet the deficit in interest on the investment through a tax levy in the budget , as is now done with the city 's investment in the present subways . At the beginning the Board of Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transit Commission . The Mayor , the Controller , the President of the Board of Aldermen and the Chairman of the Board of Transportation will become directors with the approval of the organization by the Board of Estimate . Six more directors , or fewer , are to be named by the holders of the securities to be issued in exchange for the present securities . The remainder , to make a board of nineteen ( fifteen exclusive of the city officials ) are to be named by the Mayor . The directors are to serve for ten years each . Outline of Control Plan . Mr. Untermyer 's report to Transit ' Commission outlining plan was as follows : " The negotiations for readjustment and unification between the B. M. T. and certain security holders of the I. R. T. with the undersigned ? as counsel for your commission have reached the stage at which I. am herewith submitting for your consideration and recommending for your approval the two accompanying bills , which , if approved by you , will be shortly introduced into the Legislature and urged for passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the commission . " You are aware that the session is expected to end on March 16 , so that if the bills are to have a fair chance of enactment there must be no delay . " The bills have the approval of the Corporation Counsel and city authorities , including the representatives of the Mayor , the Board of Transportation , and the representatives of the B. M. T. They have been submitted to all of them and I am authorized to say that they will have their unanimous approval . The Financing Bill . " The first bill looks to the future following readjustment or unification of the rapid transit lines , whether through purchase , recapture or through partial purchase and partial recapture . The amendment , if passed by this and the next Legislature , would be submitted to the people at the election in November , 1929 , and can not take effect until after then , but it will not be needed sooner , even If the unification is completed long before that time , which I hope and expect to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availed of . Its chief purpose is to restore Section 10 of Article VIII of the Constitution affecting the debt limit of cities t ? the condition it occupied before the amendment of 1910 , when the right to exempt city bonds issued for partly self-supporting enterprises in the proportion in which the properties earned the interest and sinking fund was so altered that proportional earnings could not be considered . " This amendment would permit the exemption of city bonds from time to time as they were proved to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court to be self-supporting and would thus release further moneys for new subway construction The Board of Control BM . " The other bill is of immediate importance You will note that in its thirty printed pages it in effect painstakingly sets up and foreshadows the chief features of the plan of readjustment , unification ' or reorganization , whether wholly or partly through purchase or recapture and the elaborate machinery for carrying it into effect . Its main features are as follows : ( 1 ) The organization of a public corporation to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share capital , to take over and operate by the city and those- ' may be the rapid transit litres 9W owned eee acquired , with authority to the ' public.corporation to , organize and control such subsidiary Companies as . it may deem advisable , with . such powers as it may delegate to them . Under this provision the public corporation may determine to place the new subways and future subways in separate companies with separate bond issues and to control them through stock ownership , so that if , as is believed , the present unified system would be more than self-supporting and would liberate the present " frozen credits , " the exemption of those bonds will not be hampered by the results of operatic of the new subways . In that event any surplus from the operation of the existing rapid transit lines by the public corporation would be available to make good deficits in the operatior of the new subways and still permit the latter to stand won their own footing . ( 2 ) The bonds to he issued by the public corporation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not city bonds and not a charge against the debt limit . They will , however , be exchangeable for city bonds at any time and from time to time , but only at the option of the city whenever this can be conveniently done by the city without interfering with other needed improvements . Meantime , and pending such exchange , the city may have to pay perhaps per cent . higher interest , but it will always be in its power to do away with that additional expense by refunding the corporation bonds . ( 3 ) The bill is predicated upon the continuance of a 5-cent fare . Subsection 2 of Section 106 in that connection reads as follows : " Any such plan of readjustment and any lease or leases entered into thereunder , unless otherwise determined by the local authority or the city ( the Board of Estimate ) , and for such period or periods as it ( the Board of Estimate ) may determine , shall provide for a 5-cent fare and for one continuous ride in the same general direction on the respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be acceptable to the present security holders of the companies and that they shall constitute a giltedged security ? as good as city bonds  --  the city is given the option , in case the revenues shall be insufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund , to include the operating deficit In the budget , as is now done , or , if the Board of Estimate so elects , the public corporaVon may provide for the deficit . if any , by an increased fare . This places the entire decision of that question in the hands of the Board of Estimate , where it properly belongs . Sees ** Fare Adequate . From the facts and figures that have been submitted I have no question that the 5-cent fare will be more than adequate for the existing unified rapid transit system and will leave a substantial surplus . ( 4 ) The Board of Transit Control that is to manage the public corporation may et the outset and for the purpose of temporary organization consist of seven persons to be named by the Transit Commission , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in Sections 106-107 , it is provided by Section 108 that the board shall have not more than fifteen directors . besides the Mayor , Controller , President of the Board of Aldermen and Chairman of the Board of Transportation , all of whom are to have equal voting and other powers with the fifteen other directors . ( 5 ) The appointment of the Board of Directors other than the four public officials is to rest with the Mayor , except that less than onethird , which means that in no event more than six of the nineteen directors , shall be named on the nomination of the transit companies and the security holders whose railroads are acquired by the board . These company directors are to remain only so long as the corporation bonds are outstanding . The first appointments are to be for not more than ten years so as to allow retirement in rotation . After that the appointments will be for a fixed term of ten years . Guard Against Politics . ( 6 ) The directors , other than those named by the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a public hearing , of inefficiency , neglect of duty or misconduct in office . When the Mayor removes a director he must file a complete statement of the charges and of his findings and a record of the proceedings . so that the public may know whether there has been adequate ground for such removal . The purpose of this is to place this board beyond the pale of political domination , control or interference . The bill goes to such limits in that respect that any removal may be reviewed not only on the law but also on the facts by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and by a further appeal to the Court of Appeals . A director nominated by the companies can only be removed by the votes of the security-holders. ( 7 ) In the preparation of the plan and the hearings to be had thereunder the present law is followed to a great extent . The Transit Commission must hold a public hearing on any plan put out by it , at which every one is entitled to be heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After adopting the plan it must call upon each of the companies to state within a given time whether it is content with it . It may unify the properties by one or several plans . Recanture Rights Preserved . ( 8 ) A prominent feature of the bill preserves all the city 's rights of recapture so as to permit of the carrying out of the plan by recapture if purchase of one or more of the roads becomes inadvisable for that reason . Sub . 12 of Sec. 105 defines recapture as follows : " The word ' recapture ' or ' recaptured ' shall mean the exercise by the city of its right to retake a railroad or railroads of the city or any part or parts thereof leased to a railroad company under lease made pursuant to the provisions of the Rapid Transit act , by terminating the lease as to such railroad oz railroads or any part or parts thereof pursuant to and in accord ante with its terms and provi ? sions . " Sub . 1 of Sec. 106 requires that the plan contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination , rehabilitation . improvement and extension of ex isting railroads , wholly or in part by purchase , lease , recapture , &c.'; The bill does not , however , re ? quire the companies thereby to confess that their properties are subject to recapture That is left open as at present so that if a purchase price can not be agreed upon they remain at liberty as at present to contest the city 's right of recapture  --  which is as it should be . City 's Powers Respected . The bill is believed to be so comprehensive and all-embracing that it will permit of any form of unification subject to the preservation of the five-cent fare , but at every point the rights of the city are carefully safeguarded by requiring that no step can be taken by the Transit Commission without the approval of the Board of Estimate . Section , 112 , entitled " Recaptured Railroads , " reads as follows : " All the provisions of this article and all powers hereby granted with reference to railroads and properties and interests therein shall likewise apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that nothing contained in this article with respect to recapture or recaptured railroads shall alter or affect any rights or remedies of the city or of any railroad company under any existing contract . " ( 9 ) ? The bonds of the public corporation are declared to be free from taxation ; they are made legal investments in which trustees , banks and all fiduciaries may invest . ( 10 ) ? Section 119 , the concluding section , is headed , " Approval of contracts to effectuate plans of readjustment , " and reads as follows : " Anything contained in this article to the contrary notwithstanding , the Transit Commission shall not execute and deliver any contract or contracts to effectuate any plan of readjustment , or any lease or leases thereunder , without obtaining the consent and approval of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment or other local authority of such city . " Approval of Bills . Mr. Untermyer also made public the minutes of the Transit Commission meeting approving the introduction of the bills , as follows : . At an adjourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission , 270 Madison Avenue , the 25th day of February , 1928 , at 12 o'clock ; Present : John F. Gilchrist , Chairman ; Leon G. Godley , Charles C. Lockwood , Commissioners . The Chairman presented a report from Samuel Untermyer , special counsel for the commission on the readjustment proceedings , with two accompanying bills for submission to the Legislature , designed to further the readjustment plan now under consideration . " Special counsel reports that the proposed legislation was prepared in cooperation with the Chairman of the Board of Transportation and counsel for the New York Rapid Transit Corporation ( B. M. T. ) and that they have been approved by the Chairman of the Board of Transportation , the Corporation Counsel and the New York Rapid Transit Corporation ( B. M. T. ) , and that Chairman Delaney of the Board of Transportation has stated that the Mayor has given him authority to approve them on behalf of the Mayor . After reading and discussing the proposed legislation , it was , on motion duly seconded , " Unanimously resolved that the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the commission , and special counsel is authorized to present same to the Legislature for consideration and passage . " the the
