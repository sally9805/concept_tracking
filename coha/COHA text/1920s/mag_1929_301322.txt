When , four months ago , William Crapo Durant , motorcar maker , announced that he would give $25,000 for the best plan submitted on Prohibition enforcement , no fewer than 23,230 competitors rushed forward with suggestions . Came a plan from a general in the Brazilian army . Came plans from African , Asiatic , Oceanic missionaries ; from Connecticut tobacco-chewers , from Pittsburgh gin-millers . Came plans from " sorrowing mother , " " drunkard 's widow , " " rum runner 's deserted wife . " Came also a plan from Major Chester Paddock Mills , onetime ( 1926-27 ) Prohibition Administrator for the New York City district . Last week the awarding committee , headed by President-Emeritus William Oxley Thompson of Ohio State , University , *finished its judging , announced its decision . The winner was Major Mills . <P> Largely ignoring smugglers and moonshiners , Major Mills maintained that 98% of bootleggers ' supplies came from the diversion of industrial alcohol . Suppose , for example , that a manufacturer of perfumes has a permit to possess large quantities of denatured alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labelled as " perfume , " to an equally dishonest wholesaler . Then the wholesaler sells the " perfume " to a bootlegger , who re-distills the alcohol and uses it , sparingly , in the making of intoxicants . Seeing in such diversion of industrial alcohol the major source of bootleggers ' supplies , Major Mills recommended closer inspection of permit holders and closer supervision of their activities . <P> Pleased with the Mills plan , pleased with additional thousands of suggestions brought forward by his contest , Mr. Durant sent his check to Major Mills with a letter of congratulation . Federal prohibition authorities , however , saw in the Mills plan no millennium . James M. Doran , chief U. S. prohibiter , disagreed with the major premise concerning diverted alcohol as the source of " 98% " of bootleggers ' supplies . He said that the chief source of illegal liquor is the distillation of corn sugar . He added that measures advocated by Major Mills are now " routine practices " in the Prohibition Bureau , described the Mills plan as " old stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Mills resigned from the Prohibition service after his transfer from New York Administrator to Eastern Zone Supervisor , and that this transfer followed charges of third-degree method used by Major Mills ' subordinates . Resigning , Major Mills complained of political interventions and described his office as " the most difficult and thankless position in the Federal service . " <P> The Durant contest also included a special School Prize of $5,000 , won by Malcolm D. Almack , Palo Alto high school student . To Hoover Townsboy Almack goes $1,000 ; to the high school $4,000 . The Almack plan dealt chiefly with the necessity for educating the U. S. public to a fuller appreciation of the Prohibition law , its terms , its meaning , its sanctity .
