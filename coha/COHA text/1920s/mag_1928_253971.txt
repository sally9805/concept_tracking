The Interstate Commerce Commission last week made two major decisions . <P> Lake Coal . To the annoyance of coal operators in Virginia , Kentucky and Tennessee , the Commission refused to let freight rates be lowered 20 cents per ton by railroads ( Chesapeake &; Ohio , Norfolk &; Western , Louisville &; Nashville , Hocking Valley , Virginian ) which carry coal from that section to the Great Lakes , for transshipment to the Northwest . <P> Reasons given : <P> 1 ) The proposed rate-cut conferred upon coal a special benefit out of scale with the rates given other commodities , notably agricultural . 2 ) It would tend to precipitate rate-cutting by railroads ( Baltimore &; Ohio , New York Central , Pennsylvania , Wheeling &; Lake Erie ) which carry coal to the same market from competing mines in West Virginia , Pennsylvania , Ohio . Rate wars are against the public interest , especially Labor 's , and are one of the evils the I. C. C. was founded to suppress . <P> The respondents promptly accused the I. C. C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalize prosperity between two competing sections of the country , i.e. to help the West Virginia , Pennsylvania and Ohio coal interests out of the bog into which their labor troubles have thrust them . This the I. C. C. has no power to do , as was sharply suggested by the Senate last month . The barb in the Senate 's pending investigation of the I. C. C. ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) is a clause directing the Commissioners to cite statutory authorities for each &; every one of their decisions during the past five years wherein " the reasonableness of any rate or rates were in any sense influenced by the competitive advantage " of the producers of one section over another . <P> Loree Merger . The I. C. C. suddenly ordered Leonor Fresnel Loree to explain why his railroad mergers proceedings in the Southwest were not a violation of the Clayton Anti-Trust law . Mr. Loree had had his Kansas City Southern R. R. buy control of the larger Missouri-Kansas-Texas ( " Katy " ) and the St. Louis Southwestern ( " Cotton Belt " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act of Congress which encouraged the railroads to unify regional systems . Railroad men realized that the I. C. C. 's present gesture towards Mergerer Loree may be an effort to rub away the conflicts between the Clayton Anti-Trust Act and the 1920 Transportation ( consolidation ) Act .
