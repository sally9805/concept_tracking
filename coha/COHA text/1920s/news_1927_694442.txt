txt When it was announced the other day that a banking group had acquired a substantial interest in the company manufacturing the typewriter upon which this is being written , and that the founder may retire , another milestone in the progressive sale to the general investing public of formerly more closely held business was prob . ably foreshadowed . Yesterday the public was offered preferred shares in a great chocolate company , built to gigantic proportions within a lifetime  --  with extensions into sugar production in Cuba and with a public educated to associate the corporate name with a variety of candy , nay , even a certain kind of taste . So marches the institutionalization and Popularization of one sort of business after another . Despite mergers and consolidations of railroads , utilities and industrials the number of corporations " Publicized " has increased so that the total of issues listed on the stock exchange has risen from 1,216 to 2,535 in 21 years and more to come . Albert H. Wiggin is one of the banking group taking part In the typewriter transfer and prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big figures in this new era of popularized ownership and ever Increasing - investment by the public it is doubtful if Mr. W1ggin is anywhere near a.3 well known to the general reading public as were some of the notable financial figures In the past when men looked bigger , because business was not so big . A glance at Mr. Wiggin 's list of directorships , like the similar list of other financial leaders , is an education in Itself as to the widespread ramifications of modern banking , with its resultant effect of an intensified Industrial point of view by bankers . That list Includes two express companies , two rapid transit companies , two hydro electric power companies , a locomotive manufacturing company , an electric znantifeaturing company , a sugar refining company , light and power companies , fire and life Insurance , safe deposit : trust companies and savings banks , a copper company , a motor company , a paper company , a telegraph company , a mining company and then some Now obviously Mr. Wiggin Is not attempting to participate in the management of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposes of the Idea that he is sitting on those boards to look out for his own money or the money of any little group of investors . There are no little groups able to own such a vast spread of interests . He Is there as a quasi public representative of a vast army who have become Investors through the operations of his own and other banks and securities cornmanagement in any effective manner ex : cept as he functions as an Investors ' guardian  --  and when he does that he acts for a great many against a very few . He has directorships covering a greater diversity of interests than the investment lists of many rich men who seek the aid of trust companies and investment trusts to manage their holdings . Such is one view of modern " banking control "  --  or " the banker on the board , " about which so much mythology has arisen . The " banker on the board " today is an inevitable consequence of the diffusion of wealth .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
