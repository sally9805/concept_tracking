T HE RHINELANDER CASE was decided exactly as it should have been . Judge Morschauser 's charge was a model ' of fairness and the jury came to the only conclusion that the facts could warrant . With every outward aspect of benevolence and dignity , Judge Mills , counsel for young Rhinelander , did his best to win the case on grounds of prejudice . He appealed to , the lowest impulses of a bourgeois , male , white jury . He attempted to make it appear that a union was " unnatural " between Rhinelander and a girl who was so nearly white that his young client was supposed to have been unable to detect her trace of color . He emphasized her family 's humble circumstances and even dragged into the courtroom an early misstep of her mother . He solemnly insisted upon the essential responsibility of the woman in the case : if she were not scheming and vicious as well as loose she would have resisted the admitted advances of the young man who , even while he made those advances , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury stood out against the seductions of all these forms of prejudice ; and the judge helped to make possible a verdict which paid no respect to wealth or social standing or even a white skin . And now , it is to be hoped , a decent separation will immediately be arranged between two people who are already divorced by bitterness and public opinion and the ' obscene exposure of their private affairs . T HE ANTHRACITE MINERS accepted Governor Pinchot 's plan for the settlement of the strike , but the operators returned to their ivory tower . Why ? Because the plan contemplated the one thing which the embattled operators will apparently die to prevent  --  the opening of their books to the light of day . Over their dead bodies must we find the true profits of the industry , its capacity to pay increased wages , its capacity to stand a reduction in prices . The Freylinghuysen legislation was designed to get publicity for the accounting records . The Coal Commission in 1923 made that its primary recommendation . Governor Pinchot 's plan rightly treats it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the monopoly is earning , what untold millions those depletion accounts are hiding , all else is wind and foam . How long , Mr. Operator , will your greed keep facts in the dark , and the public in the cold ? rr HE " HEATHEN CHINEE " turns the other cheek ! It was only a few weeks ago that the Director of Public Safety of Cleveland , Edwin D. Barry , baffled by the inability of his police force to solve a tong murder , herded an entire Chinese population to jail . When the murderer finally confessed , the Hip Sing Tong emerged lily-white and immaculate , and proceeded to hold its convention in Cleveland . The meeting was quiet , orderly , and well conducted . The climax came on November 29 , when the tong gave a banquet to policemen , judges , lawyers , and newspapermen of the city . Even Mr. Barry received an invitation . He , however , made it plain to reporters that he would not attend . Since the invitations specified " and family , " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was not room for all the guests in the King Fong restaurant , where the dinner was held . The overflow was taken to another restaurant in taxis furnished by the Hip Sing Tong . Bath Chinese and American food was served . Chinese and American orchestras played alternately . Chinese and Americans were the after-dinner speakers . The Chinese beamed with hospitality and good-will . The Americans essayed ponderous compliments and recalled instances where Chinese had surprised them by acting , oddly enough , just like anybody else ! All of them carefully avoided mention of Barry 's outrage , except to speak in guarded terms of the " late unpleasantness . " It remained for old Wong Bowe , a prominent tong leader , to state names , places , and facts . He exonerated Barry handsomely . After all , the raid had reacted to the greater glory of justice and the Hip Sing Tong . It was all for the best , said Wang Bowe . T HE SESSION OF CONGRESS has opened well so far as the Progressives are concerned . Those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into coming back to the reservation and being " good " Republicans again , and young Senator La Follette has been much too wise to fall into the trap vainly set in his sight  --  he has refused , as did his father , to enter the Republican caucus . Therefore war to the knife is on , with such dire punishment as Speaker Longworth and Senator Butler can mete out . That is exactly what we had hoped for . We want the rift in the party to continue . With the Democrats destitute of principle and leadership , this handful of Progressives constitute the only effective opposition in Congress . They can at least keep alive the spirit of revolt and the spirit of progress ; if they were not there we should hardly hear a voice of protest against the deliberate turning over of the country to big business . To further that purpose the Longworth machine in the House has reverted practically to the Cannon rules by increasing the 150 signatures necessary to take a bill from a committee and bring it before the House to 218 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the House by the dominating few who operate the steam-roller . As for Mr. Coolidge , his promised fiery denunciation of the Western farmer-radicals turns out to be a tame affair . He had the pleasure of proving to his own satisfaction how completely the tariff protects the farmer , but he made one serious slip for a protectionist . He admitted that the domestic price is raised by the tariff on imports , and thereby he gave the whole tariff graft away . M R. GREEN , president of the American Federation of Labor , has followed up his new wage policy with a speech to engineers . It is an important speech . He has told the Taylor Society and the management division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers that labor is eager to cooperate with management in eliminating waste . The sorts of waste which labor is especially interested in reducing are unemployment , wide price fluctuations , lack of standardization , unsanitary working conditions , accident hazards , lack of continuity in employment . Mr. Green does not believe that this cooperation and assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such trained seals have no initiative , no will of their own . There is no meeting of minds , and true cooperation becomes impossible . Neither does Mr. Green withdraw Labor 's opposition to the alleged elimination of waste through excessive speeding up . The piece-work program- of the early school of scientific management was a carrot in front ' of the donkey 's nose . It has had its day , and no cooperation is possible on such a basis . So far , so good . But what , made the speech important was that Mr. Green appealed not to the owners of industry but straight to the technical managers . " Financial changes have taken place , until now through the diversified ownership of corporations , management control has supplanted personal-ownership control . " He proposes an alliance between those who between them operate industry  --  the worker and the technician . W E ARE GLAD OF IT ? glad and not greatly sur- prised to learn that quadrupling the postal rate on newspapers and periodicals mailed by individuals ( meaning you , gentle reader ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source , although the purpose was , by increasing revenue , to help to meet higher salaries . It was obvious at a glance that the revised postal rates fixed at the last session of Congress were , in general , ill-considered and unjust , but sticking out like a sore thumb among the rest was the action whereby the cost of mailing periodicals , although left practically unchanged for publishers , was increased to the general public from a rateof one cent for four ounces to a charge of two cents for every two ounces . Thus a reader of The Nation who a year ago could mail an ordinary thirty-two page issue to a friend for one cent now has to pay four cents . Since this extraordinary increase has resulted in a loss of revenue , Postmaster General New has decided to recommend that the present rate be reduced by one-half . That will still leave it twice as high as before , but some increase is not unreasonable . Experience so far indicates that the recent postal increases as a whole will give added revenues of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount added to the pay roll . Congress will have to tackle the postal rates again this winter , and we hope will make a better job of it than last time . I1 AITI IS CARRYING ON . Ten years ago , while Eu- rope was engrossed in the World War , the United States took advantage of an uprising to land troops in the republic , although neither foreign lives nor property was endangered . A President of our choosing and a treaty by which Haiti surrendered much of her sovereignty were forced upon the people , and in 1917 a new constitution which Franklin D. Roosevelt , then Assistant Secretary of the Navy , has boasted he himself wrote was presented for adoption . When the Legislature refused to accept it , that body was dissolved and Haiti has since been under American military rule with a certain number of native puppets as window-dressing . Even the Roosevelt constitution provides for the election of a legislature every other year , but the American occupation , violating its own instrument , has denied the right . When the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting under some exceedingly doubtful " transitory provisions " of the Roosevelt constitution , had their hand-picked Council of State elect a successor in Louis Borno . His term expires next year and a legislature to his successor should be elected on January 10 . Puppet-President Borno has refused to call such an election , but the Patriotic Union is urging voters to go to the polls ( which are to , be open for the selection of some minor officials ) and cast ballots for a new legislature anyhow . In retaliation the representatives of American democracy have again clapped into jail Jolibois , the editor of the Courrier Haitien , and have seized his printing plant . The spirit of the Haitians is splendid . If they can keep up the fight , we of the United States will recognize some day that we have been guilty of grand larceny and will demand that the receivers of the loot disgorge . HE MATTEOTTI TRIAL will not take , place until 1 January ; meanwhile the cheerful farce continues . All but the five presumable assassins have been released , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who by their own confessions or that of others actively implicated were not without foreknowledge of the plot . At the same time a most extraordinary set of findings has just been issued by the Court of Public Prosecutions . Exonerating everyone concerned in the matter of " premeditated murder , " the court takes pains to explain why it was impossible for Matteotti 's death to have been anything but accidental . In the first place , Matteotti was not an important figure in the Socialist Party and no one would ever have thought of murdering him ; he was not murdered in order to gain possession of certain secret documents , because all witnesses have combined to testify that the documents never existed ; he was kidnapped in broad daylight under the most public circumstances , which would indubitably indicate that nothing so violent as murder was contemplated ; he was murdered a considerable distance from the scene of the kidnapping , and it would obviously have been simpler , if murder had been planned in the first place , to do away with him on the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of one of the conspirators , which of course proves that nothing like murder was ever intended . The court , therefore , is happy to release all but the five unfortunates who inadvertently did the Socialist deputy to death . Since the unlucky Matteotti had the bad taste to engage in a struggle with them in which he was killed , it is not quite possible to charge them only with the crime of kidnapping . But sufficient thought on the part of the court will doubtless discover that murder with intent to kidnap , is , after all , only a minor offense , and the case will be closed pleasantly for everyone . A COMPANY CALLED British Pictures has announced plans for the establishment of a large motion-picture studio near London , and thus offers the latest of many proposals for the development of the languishing film industry of Great Britain . For a number of years the vision of possible profits has made more acute the patriotic fear lest English audiences should be completely Americanized through the cinema , and a law requiring all theaters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered . Yet in spite of all efforts British pictures have never been either good enough or numerous enough to count for anything . Meanwhile America , far from having any similar cause for worry , is faced with the possibility of seeing the theater itself become merely an appendage to this too prosperous industry . William Fox , president of the Fox Film Company , has undertaken to finance five New York theatrical producers merely in order to secure the picture rights to such plays as attain sufficient popular success to make them promising film ventures . Since any dramatic production must be completely rewritten before it is filmed , the only advantage to be gained by having it performed as a play is the publicity and prestige which it receives . Thus Mr. Fox 's action is essentially nothing more than an attempt to reduce the New York theater to the position of an advertising medium for the movies . I N THIS ERA of Calvin Coolidge it is worth more than passing notice that the League for Industrial Democracy is getting ready to celebrate its twentieth birthday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and postwar changes in American thought and is today stronger and more active than ever before . To be sure , in the course of these twenty years the league has changed its name and somewhat altered its scope . But it has always kept the line of historic continuity . Beginning in 1905 as the Intercollegiate Socialist Society , under the auspices of such men as Jack London , Thomas Wentworth Higginson , and Upton Sinclair , it has steadily kept before itself its educational mission in our colleges . Last year its officers spoke in some 142 colleges and universities scattered all over the United States . It was the father of the recently formed American Committee on Justice to China and has set up under its auspices a working Committee on Coal and Super Power which issued the important proposals for permanent peacein the coal fields outlined in our last issue page 641 . The man more responsible than any other for these years of successful activity is Harry W. Laidler , who has been connected with the society from the start . He will preside at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social pioneering will be celebrated by the friends of the league and of the cause of industrial freedom . C OLLEGE PUBLICATIONS are usually as unsatisfactory to the students who try to read them as they are to all adult outsiders . The conservatism ' of youth is nowhere more depressing than it is on campuses where undergraduate editors never , apparently , so much as try to avoid the traditional extremes on the one hand of the sickly-aesthetics literary monthly and on the other hand of the athletic daily designed for adolescent Babbitts . Hence the distinction of a new publication at the University of Wisconsin edited by John Schindler and Carl Rakosi . The Issue will appear monthly , but it has utterly cast off the form ' of the conventional college monthly devoted , as one of the editorials in the first number puts it , " solely to the moon , stars , flowers , love , and the general frustrations of the English Department . " It looks like a daily , yet in turn it has cast off the " naughty-naughty geniality " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taboo upon such subjects as football , fraternities , and petting . The remarkable thing about the Issue , if it keeps up , will be its combination of critical seriousness and lively intelligence . This first number , being concerned in the main with university policies , really bites into its subject with articles on The Wisconsin Idea , The Wisconsin Plan , President Frank , and  --  by corollary ? Progressivism in Politics . Extraordinarily able book reviews round out a number dedicated on the whole to " something more than the ordinary run of college puns and infantile sentiments . " We wish the Issue all success ; and we sincerely hope that we do not miss its forthcoming article on Magazines One Need Not Read . I N ORDER THAT our readers may have a breath of the I bracing , intellectual air that pervades American colleges , we quote the following editorial from the Daily Maroon of the University of Chicago for October 14 : The rushing of high-school athletes for the university is now the business of the Intramural Department . .. . This committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . Its work is necessary if the university is to maintain its present position in intercollegiate athletics . Through its work , which last year was concentrated into the few days of the interscholastic meets , many promising high-school boys who would normally have gone to their State universities were induCed to come here . The new division of responsibility , coupled with the now continuous advice of the Athletic Department , will make for far greater efficiency than ever before and for a selection of high-school athletes from the whole nation . We lose many men every year who might bring credit to us through the naturally stronger appeal of the State universities . We are compelled to counteract this attraction by intensive though rigidly honorable methods . Since this is so , we must use the best tactics possible in assembling athletes from the whole country . Noble work ! Three cheers for the professional athletics which college students fondly imagine are amateur ! Long live higher education !                    @
