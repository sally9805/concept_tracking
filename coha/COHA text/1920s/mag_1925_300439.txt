When Foreign Minister Gregory Vassilievitch Tchitcherin is in Moscow it is not unusual for the windows of the Soviet Foreign Office to blaze until dawn . M. Tchitcherin is lank , indefatigable . Once an aristocrat and trained in the Tsarist diplomatic school , he has espoused the cause of the Soviets with a vehemence that drives his hard pushed subordinates to the last fringe of desperation . <P> For months and years he has been directing from Moscow the Soviet 's stupendous dream to unite with certain Western European nations and crush the rest . Until recently he has felt that Germany and Poland were diplomatically very close to Russia . Suddenly , with the coming of the Locarno Conference ( see INTERNATIONAL ) they seemed to be drawing away . <P> Last week M. Tchitcherin announced that he was suffering from an attack of diabetes which required the care of foreign specialists , climbed aboard a train for Warsaw . <P> As he whirred along he fashioned phrases which he hoped would make the might of Russia felt in Poland . Descending from his train at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole city seemingly intent upon nothing but his honor . <P> Banquet followed banquet . So many Poles rushed to make him welcome that diplomatic conversation was all but impossible . It was apparent that the Poles were intent upon drowning awkward questions about security pacts in toasts to their guest 's health . . . <P> Unsatisfied , he whirred away to Berlin , spoke as follows to correspondents : " A staunch and lasting understanding between the Soviet Union and Poland has a universal significance and repercussion . . . . On both sides a firm will was maintained to remove with the greatest energy everything disturbing our relations . " <P> In Berlin the processions of glittering nonentities who wished to shake the Soviet Minister 's hand were resumed . Prince von Bulow ( onetime Court Chamberlain ) Count Rantzau ( brother of the German Ambassador to Moscow ) , Counts Kalckrenth , Westarp , et al. , were called in by Chancellor Luther and Foreign Minister Strese-mann to have lunch with M. Tchitcherin and keep him entertained . <P> At last Tchitcherin broke away from them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all afternoon , all night , until two in the morning of the day when Stresemann was to leave for Locarno . <P> Shortly before train time , Tchitcherin again talked to Stresemann for more than an hour ; delivered a last exhortation . What he said may be judged from his public utterances : " England 's effort toward creating a security compact is simply a part of her insidious anti-Soviet activity . . . . England sees in Germany a mere pawn to be used against Russia ... Germany must not fall into the British trap . "
