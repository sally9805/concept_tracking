THE HERITAGE OF WOMEN-Alice Ames Winter-Minion , Balch ( $3 ) . A curious sexual self-consciousness has made women , proud of their " freedom , " join themselves in clubs to discuss their virtues in public . Now Alice Ames ( Mrs. Thomas Gerald ) Winter , for four years ( 1920-24 ) President of the General Federation of Women 's Clubs , writes a book-always interesting , always intelligent , sometimes no less than beautiful . The lovely , the brave , the unscrupulous , the absurd , the brilliant women that garland her narrative , from Ruth ( of the Bible ) to Susan B. Anthony , are reanimated in a prose that is always lucid , often bright with a sure artistry in words .
