txt Religion In Politics . Oscar J. Smith In THE TIMES of Dec. 3 deplores the activity of the Methodist Church In politics . I agree with him that religion In politics is a real danger when It is carried on secretly In the Interest of a sect and to place some particular faction in power . But I have no fear of religion in politics when it is open and above board , as it is with the Methodist Church . The Methodist Church comes out Into the light of day , because It has nothing to conceal . The Methodist Church ( North ) went into politics in behalf of the slave before the Civil War* and who will say that it was not right and Proper for It so do to ? Such men as Wendell Phillips , Elijah P. Lovejoy , William Lloyd Garrison , John Brown and thousands of others mixed religion with politics , and who would say that they were trying to control politics from an evil motive ? Did Mr. Smith ever hear of the saloon in politics ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with politics . Of course if crime is mixed with politics , It will not , like the Methodist Church , come out into the open . Unless religion controls a man 's politics . his business , and his private life , it is no religion . if he has the right kind of religion , he will fight for everything that is right and just in politics , he will be honest in business , and a good husband and father . Religion should regulate his everyday affairs . EDWARD J. EISELE . Chicago , Ill. , Dec. 4 , 1926.
