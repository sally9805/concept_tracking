the peak of the lecture season , we pause to wonder how a lec-turer can do it . Every available poet has been booked , every visiting novelist , and quite a handful of Indian mystics and lady Republicans . The platforms teem and seethe . The other day we noticed , in Vanity Fair , a paragraph nominating Louis Bromfield for that publication 's Hall of Fame , " because he is one of the most prominent of our younger novelists . . because his first novel gained him immediate recognition . . and finally because as the author of four bestsellers he has just started out on his first lecture tour . " If we should ever inaugurate a hall of fame , it would be reserved exclusively and hopefully for authors who , having written four bestsellers , still refrained from starting out on a lecture tour , IT would be reasonably interesting to know whether J. P. Morgan has been looking forward fo serving on the jury when he returns in Spring . Certainly we do n't look forward to the flood of news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he says , for publication , that it is a citizen 's duty and privilege to serve . We will go further  --  we will say that it is easier than working . Still , the traditional attitude of citizens is that jury duty should be avoided if possible , getting excused being a sort of test which a man makes to assure himself , his wife , and his friends that he has pull . It takes very little pull  --  probably as little as for any shirking we can think of . Nevertheless , the assumption always is that if you are serving it is because you were n't able to get out of it  --  an assumption we were compelled to own in Mr. Morgan 's case until we were informed otherwise . we the time our southbound bus reached Sixteenth Street , we were the only passenger left , the hour be-ing late , the night cold . Quite unex-pectedly the coach came to a quick stop and we saw the driver leap from his seat and dash west . It looked very much like desertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came leaping back out of the darkness , bearing under his arm a large packing box , which he clumped down on the rear platform . " What 's the idea of that ? " we asked the conductor , as we continued our dark and gloomy way . " That 's for the starter , down in the Square , " he said . " He needs firewood pretty bad these Histerin ' nights . " What really amused us about the episode was the fact that we should be amused , or surprised . In a small town , everyone would have known that the bus driver had a private life of his own  --  even two legs of his own . But here , it seemed to throw the whole scheme of the city off when he left his wheel and became , for a few dazzling moments , a person . OT all the sunshine went out of life with the suspension of the Army-Navy game . The report has come from Annapolis that golf , hence-forth , will be compulsory for midship-men . There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a satisfactory grade or he wo n't be graduated . The reason given was that the Navy produces men and not wallflowers , and that they are the sort that associate with persons who follow the pastime golf . May we not suggest , then , that the Naval Appropriation Bill be revised upward ? Two hundred and seventy-five million will cover new cruisers , possibly , but there should certainly be an item somewhere for lost halls . ' THE night life of this phantom ' TH is so improbable , so curiously stratified , as to be beyond either belief or argument One of our current obsessions is thinking about night life in daytime . Dead in the middle of things at high noon , between two villainous tides of oozing traffic , we have been visited by an awareness of the heavy day-silences of which we knew nothing , but which would become articulate when the sun dropped behind Jersey . While clear noonthings were taking place , while clogs were being aired , while vaguely uncomfortable ladies from the sombre grassy suburbs were in town confessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages from one company to another company through the loud streets , the silences were there , all around . A hundred theatre auditoriums , empty and hushed ; beer places east of Third Avenue , breathing heavily ; dance floors , darkly dreaming by the side of still drums . In a little while the whole system would reverse  --  offices go dark , clubs and bars go light . We realized that when thoughts like that come to us while standing between two traffic lanes , our days on this planet are drawing rapidly to a close . Words and Music FROM an accidental eavesdropper who was seated near by we have this story about Alma Gluck and her eight-year-old son at the Heifetz concert the other afternoon in Carnegie Hall . Between numbers the youngster ( he is , of course , Efrem Zimbalist , Jr. ) read the program and finally fell into a deep study of a testimonial from Heifetz printed in the Steinway advertisement . This read : " It the piano is in my opinion a piece of superb craftsmanship that demonstrates the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with difficulty but apparently with a growing suspicion . At length he turned to his moth er and said , " I do n't believe Jascha ever said anything like that , mother . He do n't know words like that . " Dogs APROPOS of dogs  --  their day comes here next week in the biggest of all American dog shows  --  the smart-looking wire-haired terrier appears to he again the best seller . Plucking a fact like that from'the fanciers ' talk is , however , pretty hazardous , as we have found in discussing dogs with some of them . For factions , there is nothing like a dog fancy  --  as a group devoted to one breed is called . For instance there is a fight on now in the Boston terrier fancy  --  one side wants to abandon cropping the dogs ' ears and the other is aghast at this disrespect for the fine old cruel custom . We are told that dogs ' ears were originally trimmed to help them in the fighting pit . The Boston remains the only breed that clings to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dictum is n't always obeyed ? is by resolution of the American Kennel Club , the governing body . An anti-ear-cropping proposal was but recently brought up by the club , but the Boston owners mustered enough votes to defeat it . The custom seems likely to pass , however , because the vari ous states are rapidly passing laws against it . Even now one is pending in Massachusetts . Another controversy has been tearing apart the ranks of the police dog people . This breed will not be so well represented at the coming show as in past years . This is not because the police dog is passing but because the police dog fad grew so rapidly that breeders became careless and hundreds of variants from the true standard trot the streets today on the leashes of blissfully ignorant owners . The controversy about what should be done got so hot that Mr. P. A. B. Widener voluntarily resigned as president of the fancy , that the work for the good of the breed might proceed more rapidly . The upshot was that Herr Ernest Otto of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a survey to eliminate undesirable tendencies in breeding . We were interested to hear that the record price paid for a dog is still held by Mrs. Earl Hoover , sister-in-law of Herbert Hoover , who some years ago paid ninety-five hundred dollars for a Chow . One of the highest Westminster show prices ( the show is a wonderful selling market ) was twenty-five hundred for a Boston terrier . Many of the most valuable dogs are of course owned by New Yorkers . Mrs. Harry Dodge has six police clogs worth about two thousand dollars each , and Mrs. F. S. Dickinson of Vest Seventy-second Street owns six French bulldogs whose combined value is around twenty thousand dollars . Mrs. Dickinson 's dogs live in three rooms of her nine-room apartment , in quarters that have been set aside and especially equipped for them . We have heard that at least one hotel in the city , bowing to the firm insistence of its patrons that their dogs he treated like themselves , has established a regular dog dinner , served at six , the price being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter , whom the dog is supposed to tip ten cents , and the chef is amenable to requests for specialties in diet . ? FIFTH AVENUE offered to an observant pedestrian the other afternoon this study in contrast : in a custom-wrought , green limousine a lady of patrician profile reading the Evening Graphic ; beyond the glass partition , her chauffeur , sunk in his greatcoat and the Times . Heart Throbs AS wily a piece of press agentry as we have seen perpetrated in some time was the recent news ( in all papers ) that a brunette responds to the love impulse more deeply than a blonde . We can throw some light on how this discovery was arrived at , for we attended the clinic . The news was manufactured in the Embassy Theatre , just at tea time of a Monday afternoon , in the hallowed name of science and Columbia University . ( Also in the name of a movie called " Love , " which was where the impulse came in . ) Six show girls were the subjects . One blonde and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their palpitant hearts and breasts Dr. William M. Marston , of the Columbia Department of Psychology , placed instruments which he called sphygmomanometers and pneumographs , but which the news photographers with their more practicalminds designated as speedometers . The love impulse ( which was to be supplied by fragmentary scenes showing John Gilbert kissing Greta Garbo ) was delayed for more than an hour by the press impulse , which included a full battery of cameramen shooting lights and hollering directions at the blondes and brunettes , their little emotions being in a doubtful state anyway . Then an organist played soft music , the movie began , and the recording instruments recorded heart and breath . Our unerring clinical observation was that the love impulse , having been delayed for one hour , had become strangely subordinated to the dinner impulse , the want-to-get-away impulse , and the hell-with-this impulse . Dr. Marston was so busy with love graphs , and the press agents were so busy with reporters , that we had ample time to busy ourself solely with impulses  --  and herewith submit our own report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our com-pliments : That in the first record , one of the high respiration marks credited to Miss Rose Gallagher 's love stimulus was due less to love than to a question a reporter asked . He wanted to know if 32 was her heart or her bust . That in each experiment the brunette 's emotions were apt to he more vibrant than the blonde 's because the brunette was holding hands with Dr. Marston ( masculine in sex ) while the blonde was holding hands with Dr. Marston 's assistant ( feminine in sex ) . That the entire gamut of emotions experienced by the third blonde was due to her indignation at having to wait from 4:30 till seven o'clock , after having given up a voice lesson to come , and after having told her grandmother to have supper ready at five . We did n't see her blood-pressure chart , but it must have been a riot . That the love stimulus found its tenderest expression in the words of one of the delayed blondes , who remarked to her girl friend that she was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Dr. Marston was listening to every variation of her lovesick little heart . That the two victorious press agents were brunettes . Of all the newspapers , the Times was the most generous . It solemnly admitted it was a press agent stunt , and solemnly gave it a full column . The Immortal Elsie DOWN on West Broadway not long ago there was a fire in a bindery and among the fictive people lost in the flames was Elsie Dinsmore , several thousand copies of her . To us , who thought she had died lung ago or was at least pining away , it came as a surprise when a publishing man told us that Elsie still sells steadily at the rate of fifty thousand copies a year . Last year , in fact , the sales totalled fifty-five thousand volumes . One good reason the books are purchased is that many libraries now do not carry them , either in part or in all twenty-eight volumes , on the ground that little girls nowadays do n't read them or , if they do , should n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of 1897 , done in simple red cloth binding with nice red pansies on it . Bringing out a dandy new Twentieth Century binding a few years ago , Dodd , Mead , the publishers of " Elsie Dinsmore , " found it would n't sell . Women  --  from big sister to grandmother  --  are of course the chief purchasers , believing that , for young American lasses , better twenty-eight Elsie Dinsmores than a cycle of Iris March  --  or even Pollyanna . One lady in Buffalo , whose family could n't afford the books when she was a girl , has been collecting a set since long before the war by pur chasing one volume a year direct from the publishers . She regularly mails her two dollars and a half each December and gets an Elsie book as a Christmas present to herself . Lion AT the moment of writing Count Keyserling is in Boston , but he will be in and out of town between lectures until April . He did not go out a great deal during his preliminary stay here but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have no doubt that they captured a real lion . To begin with , the American representatives of the Count were exceedingly particular in the matter of invitations . He could , for instance , go only to places where there were chefs of undoubted merit , and hostesses were advised that he must have oysters and champagne . It is said that the distinguished visitor is practically helpless without these . One of the first ladies who entertained him called in eighteen of the intelligentsia of the city . A lady especially chosen for the occasion was seated on the honored guest 's right . She confessed afterward that she had spent a week over the " Travel Diary of a Philosopher . " She began with a well-thought-out intellectual question based on that work . The Count 's discouraging response was , " Madame , I never answer ridiculous questions . " A clue to his attitude came after the ladies had left the table . He remarked to one of the gentlemen ( there was only one who seemed to know much about the Count , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I am feeble . I faint at small talk . " He then indulged in some large talk . He announced that he thinks this civilization , as started by Jesus Christ , is worn out . He remarked that he views New York as a ruin and as such finds it attractive . He considers our buildings impermanent and he abhors the fact that America does not revere nature . " America has conquered nature but has never learned to love it . " WHETHER the Count faints at small talk or not , he seems to be made frantic by it . At one gathering he was purposely seated next to a lady who is accounted brilliant . She undertook to engage him in conversation , but she might as well have been talking to Coolidge . The Count said not a word for twenty minutes , at the end of which time he departed her side . Later that evening a bold gentleman asked him to amplify one of his written statements and he exclaimed , waving his arm , " My God , the man wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imposing stature of six feet four inches , and nervously energetic gestures . He frequently slides down in his chair and gesticulates by throwing first one hand and then the other violently upward . He is reputed to sleep but two hours a night , taking his repose " not in sleep but in thought . " He takes six hours of complete repose before each lecture and a full day of solitude afterwards . He travels heavily , taking , even for a one-night visit , not only two hand bags but a trunk . At one lecture here , an informal one given at the behest of a club of aspiring women writers , he merely arose , told a story about a Scotch woman , and sat down . It was , he explained later , not one of the lectures for which he was under contract and hence he was unable to speak at length . For the first forty years of his life , Count Keyserling lived almost in seclusion on his country estate in Poland . Then he made a five-year tour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In this way , he became by turn a Buddhist , an Islamite , and so on . At the end of that time he wrote the " Travel Diary " and later set up his School of Wisdom in Darmstadt , where three or four hundred persons are being trained in his philosophy of understanding . He intended to retire to his estate again after his world tour , but the success of the hook took him into continued public activity . To this he is said to have become reconciled . Liquor 's Little Ironies THE proprietor of an illicit but elegantly appointed bar , which somehow manages to run quite openly , has recently adorned a wall with a magnificent moose head . Asked the other evening where he got it , he is reported to have explained it this way : " The cops got it in a cheap speakeasy they raided down the street and gave it to inc . " Letters a Mile Long THE men most frequently seen in the skies around here writing words with airplanes and smoke are of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America , the oldest of this type of advertising agency , and they take to the air from a hangar at Garden City . Their chief of staff is an English army captain who flew a battle plane for the Royal Flying Corps during the war . His name is Captain George A. Lingham , but he is known to his associates as Dopey . Back in 1922 he came here from England , jumped into a plane and wrote " Hello U S A " over lower Manhattan . He did the eight letters swiftly and each was exceedingly well formed . Soon after that he was made head man of the skywriters . His staff is made up of three other men who saw war service and one who was too young to fly then . We talked the other day with a man who knows them all and he explained some of the tricks of their technique . The writing is done at a height of ten thousand feet . Lower than that a word is not readable over all Manhattan . Each skywriter goes up alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and twenty-five miles an hour when they are writing . Making the letters leg-ible and keeping them in a straight line is hard to do . Luckily , flyers above New York have the straight east and west streets to use as a guide . Over Boston , for instance , a pilot must go by the shadow of the strut of his wings . Prevailing winds determine the direction in which a word must be written , since failure results if the letters blow into each other . The letters are never less than half a mile long and often they measure a mile . Each man has his special knack of forming them . Some make script letters while others print them . The letter W is the hardest of all . Chemicals which burn with a heavy white smoke are used , and only enough can be transported at one time to write thirty letters . That would make about three average inscriptions and , since six inscriptions are regarded as a day 's work , the flyer must come down once for more smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary , a bonus that averages about five dollars a letter . A cloudless day with a blue sky is essential , and such a day , it has been their experience , comes here only about twice in five . The average is less than that this time of year and the aviators now are spending much of their time in the South , where business is said to be fairly good . To make winter skywriting feasible , experts are trying to produce a colored smoke , but so far have not succeeded . The company maintains a branch in Europe , with two pilots who have just finished an advertising campaign in the skies of Germany . Security WHILE we were doing time in the lobby of the Biltmore , waiting for a late friend , we overheard two ladies discussing a voyage of exploration one of them had made . " You really went through the Holland tunnel ? " gasped the stay-at-home . " Yes , indeed , " said the traveller , rather proudly . " I think I would be frightened , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; " you do n't get frightened  --  there is a police-man every few feet all along the way . "
