Lawrence Stanley , Governor General of Canada in the early nineties , put up a cup to be held for a year by the hockey team that won the world 's championship . After each series of games the cup is filled with champagne and each player on the winning team takes a drink out of it . It is a battered cup . It has been dropped in trains and automobiles ; players have scratched their names on it with penknives . Last week in Montreal the Stanley Cup was once more filled and passed around and the team that drank out of it was the New York Rangers . <P> No one had expected the Rangers to win ; they were facing many handicaps . Light and fast , they had to play the toughest , heaviest team in hockey , the Maroons of Montreal . It was hard to see how flashy skaters like Frank Boucher , Ranger centre , or Bill Cook and his brother Bun , the wings , could stand being bumped around by checks like Siebert , Button , Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second game their goalie 's eye was cut open and Lester Patrick , manager and coach , a star defense man 20 years ago , put on the pads and got in goal himself . After this game ( TIME , April 16 ) , the president of the National Hockey league appointed a new goalie for the Rangers-Joe Miller , late of the Americans . <P> Miller has never been popular . The people who look down from the roof of Madison Square Garden at hockey games had given him a nickname- " Red Light " Miller , drawing their title from the signal that flashes when a goal-guard lets in a shot . They had given Miller what is locally known as the Bronx Cheer , a huzzah of sarcastic intention . Rattled , Miller begged to be sent back to the minor leagues " where they would n't razz him . " Now he was called to take the most important position on a team tied with the favorites for the hockey championship of the world . <P> In a situation that might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miller proved himself the Boy Who Made Good . In his first game , the third of the series , he made many brilliant saves ; in the next game he kept the Maroon team without a score . The Rangers , who had won by a single goal , carried Miller off the ice on their heads as , in Manhattan , the baseball fans had carried Cohen . <P> Twelve thousand people sat around the rink as the players skated out for the deciding game . Big French-Canadians from the east side of Montreal ( the French side ) were there to cheer the Rangers , disliking the Maroons for beating the Canadians . And in a furious game in which , when the referee disallowed a Montreal goal , the crowd threw overcoats , hats , papers , garbage , and bottles on the ice-in which Miller whirled his arms and legs like the sails of a mill , threw himself backward and forward , stopped every shot except one-a game in which 21 penalties were given , Frank Boucher stabbed twice through the Maroon defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey trophy since Seattle took the Stanley Cup title in 1917 . All the players on the Rangers are Canadians .
