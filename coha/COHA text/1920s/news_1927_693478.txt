txt I'm- one of those what  --  you-call-tt independents . Been working alnee I was 16 , eight long years ago . Never made much headway with men because one of the fatherless brood of which am the oldest was ever In-need of : - noes , school books , cough syrup or ? : omething , which kept me attending night school and later working nights well as days to try to Hli Dad ' . imes . " Looking round on my twenty . fourth birthday I happened to run across some advice to the unpopular . ' Be a good listener , ' was the crux of the article . I 'm a fairly chatty soul , myself , and playing father at home naturally made me somewhat of a die , later about other people 's moves and opinions . Well , I decided as I was getting on In years , I had better be looking ' round if that home of my own was ever to come true . ? ? ? ? " A poor , unsuspecting victim crossed my path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the evening of the day I resolved to be a good listener . " He came , brushed , shined if a bit loudly spirted and necktied . He came at quarter to nine . I listened . I listened some more until the cuckoo on the mantel , a horrible family heritage , cried out eleven In mocking tones . I listened till eleven thirty . The half hour after that I may have listened , 1 but I did n't hear anything . Twelve ten saw him out the door and If ever I felt the undignified impulse to kick a gent downstairs ! Lord , that boy never will know how a feminist foot ! can tingle ! I ai n't no lady , as you ; tall plainly see . But give me liberty of speech or give me pisen to put In the candy to serve ! " What I remember for all my listening was that ho got California on the tulle one night , how woman 's place %vas in the home , how hard It is for 0 young fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and double crossing going on , and a few personal Berns about girls he had known . , And Ihero was Willa Cather 's last book crying out loud to me upstairs . What 's the matter ? Am I a lost soul or a depraved one ? ? June . " An amusing one , June ! Now that ; % ? ou 've tried that formula out and know It not to be your road to a man 's heart , try another . Be yourself and nothing but  --  and , at least , you 'll keep that sympathetic limb In flno restraint , Quite nec uniary feature of conduct in husband-getting , I understand . You do n't need any advice . All you need , June , Is to keep on the watch for more victims , give each a hearing and discard until you draw a trump . And the best of luck , which Is coming to you !
