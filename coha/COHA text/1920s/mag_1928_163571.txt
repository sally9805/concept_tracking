Godfrey-Paolino . For a long time George Godfrey , 240-pound black man has been giving people the impression that he could knock out Dempsey and Tunney the same night if he would only try .

Only a few sharp-eyed critics have warned George Godfrey that the trouble with demanding what he deserves is that he might get it . Last week in Los Angeles George Godfrey met squatty Paolino Uzcudun , Basque , who still has to bring an interpreter to the ring so that he can understand what the referee says . Forty-four pounds lighter than the black man , Paolino lost the decision in a ten round bout made up mostly of clinches . <P> Heeney-Delaney .

Jack Delaney danced and backed up , ducked , countered , danced and backed up . He could n't get his right past Heeney 's high left shoulder . Often he clinched .

" Answered some : " Bring back that old man , Dempsey. "
