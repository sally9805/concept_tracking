txt Net income of the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1927 was $1,103,844 more than that of 1926 despite a decrease in gross revenues amounting to 51,425.406 . This largely reflects the success of operating efficiencies instituted by the present management . Since these consist chiefly of labor-saving devices , their introduction has been particularly advantageous in the face of wage scale increases early in 1927 . Among the latest improvements is the new car retarder at Allentown . This was put into use last December . AutomatiCally it retards freight cars after they have been put over a train classification bump . It does away with 42 car riders and is expected to result in an annual saving of $150,000 to $175.000 . The entire cost of installation . besides making certain necessary yard changes , was $300,000 . Except that of the New Haven railroad , this retarder is the only one in operation in the East . Freight Car Repair Costs Lower Of the 51.544,354 decrease in maintenance of equipment last year , one of the largest items was the reduction in maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1927 , a decrease of $532,687 . A large factor in this saving was the decrease in hot boxes . In 1925 the road had 17,243 freight train hot boxes . In 1926 this number was reduced to 11.910 . Jima in 1927 to 5.748 . Since the average hot box involves an expenditure of about $25. the saving last year for his decrease amounted to $154,050 . This reduction has been the result of better and closer supervision . Another factor m lowering equipment maintenance expenditures was the introduction of two Furdson tractors and 12 ... trailers at the Ashley . Pa .. repair shops . 45 -- men , besides expediting service . The results of these and similar ' onus of efficiency are more clearly seen from the fact that at the Elizabethport shops the man hours a car average was 59 in 1926 and in 1927 but 41 , although the work was heavier . At the Ashley shops average man hours a car decreased in 1927 to 35 from 47 in 1926 . That the management has succeeded in gaining its objective of " increased production at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1925 the road spent 54 cents of every dbllar of repairs to freight cars for labor costs and 46 cents for materials , while in 1927. with increaser wage costs . labor accounted for only 45 cents on the dollar expenditure , and 55 cents was put into materials . Small Economies Numerous Among the smaller economies instituted are : Automatic oil switches , which not only save a sv.itchman but speed up trains ; use in offices of labor-saving tabulating machines , which are expected to save more than $15,000 this year ; steam heating of slip switches at the Jersey City passenger terminal . affording an annual saving of $30,000 , and steam heating by the central plant at Ashley yards , which saves approximately $50,000 annually . The morale of the men in the various shops on the line is greatly improved and this in itself has led to increased production . In 1926 at the Elizabethport shops the number of men resigned was 812. while in 1927 this number was reduced to 433 . At the Ashley shops in 1926 , there were 172 men %%110 resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heavy expenditures expected in the future for grade crossing elimination , the Jersey Central is going slowly on appropriations for improvements . The Public Service Commission has ordered the road to separate grades at Elizabethport at a cost of $15,000,000 to $18,000,000 . There is a bill before the New Jersey legislature to require the state to pay half of all costs of grade crossings and the railroad half , whereas now the law requires the entire expense to be borne 113 the railroad . Although there has been no time limit set for finishing the Elizabet - port crossings , it is expected the work will be started within the next two . three years . Additions and betterments in 1928 should amount to about the same as in 1927 , $3,500,000.
