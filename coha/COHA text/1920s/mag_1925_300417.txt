The Naval Court of Inquiry investigating the wreck of the dirigible Shenandoah sat for a second week at Lakehurst , N. J. The chief testimony taken dealt with air conditions at the time of the disaster and the chief witness was Captain Anton Heinen , German Zeppelin pilot , for years employed as a pilot and tester by the Delag Co. , makers of the German Zeppelins . <P> Lieutenant Anderson , aerologist of the Shenandoah , had told that he had advised Lieutenant Commander Lansdowne to change the course of the ship shortly before the accident occurred , but that Commander Lansdowne had demanded reasons for doing so and that he was unable to point out any definite danger signs . <P> When Captain Heinen took the stand he was questioned with some asperity because he had said previously to the press : " They will appoint the usual whitewashing inquiry board to camouflage this disaster and its cause , but every man at the Air Station knows why it happened . That accounts for the tense air over there at Lakehurst . I consider the Lakehurst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that this statement was based on his personal opinion . He testified that in his opinion there were unmistakable danger signs in the air , that Commander Lansdowne made an error in judgment in not steering around the storm , and that the destruction of the ship was caused by the bursting of gas cells because a number of safety valves had been removed ( all points that the survivors of the disaster deny ) . Lieutenant Rosendahl , one of the survivors , questioned him : <P> Rosendahl : " Although you admit you have made mistakes in judgment , you do not think that in the position we were in it would have been possible for you to make a mistake ? " <P> Heinen : " No , it was not possible . The piling up of evidence of the danger was so great and so varied that it would have been on this occasion impossible for me not to have seen it . ... My opinion of Captain Lansdowne as an aerologist is not changed with this flight . It is the same now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making his observations as closely as he possibly could . I only say here that he made a mistake in judgment because he had not quite enough experience . My opinion of Captain Lansdowne as a pilot was of the highest and is of the highest . " <P> At the close of his testimony Captain Heinen said : <P> " I thank the Court for their courtesy in allowing me to go to the length that I thought it my duty and the most difficult duty of my life to go , and I am thankful that the spirit was accepted everywhere , especially in that quarter where I had to hit . . . . " <P> But Captain Heinen 's testimony was not done . Several other witnesses were called who answered him , denying his several points . One of them had testified regarding a quotation of Heinen in the newspapers ( Heinen was reported as saying that sending out the Shenandoah with some of her safety valves removed was " murder " ) that when he read that statement he said to his wife : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liar . " <P> After this Captain Heinen was recalled by the Court to verify certain points in his testimony . He said : <P> " If I understand the meaning of the English word , a liar is one who conveys false facts with intent to deceive . I did not make the statement reported and I have never attempted to deceive .
