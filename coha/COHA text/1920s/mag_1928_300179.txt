( See front cover ) <P> Supreme above every other man or woman in lineage , rank and sanctity combined is the Emperor of Japan , upon whose splendrous Enthronement world interests focused last week . <P> Certainly no President of the United States has ever known-as does the Emperor of Japan - the name of his 123rd paternal ancestor. * <P> Pope Pius XI is not held more sanctified by Roman Catholics than is the Emperor Hirohito by pious Japanese . His Holiness claims to be no more than the divinely delegated and elected viceregent of Christ . His Majesty claims to be divinely begotten descendant of Japan 's Sun Goddess , and is therefore sanctified in his own right . <P> So far as rank is concerned there is only one other reigning emperor worthy of the name , George V. He is Emperor only of India and King of the rest of his Realm . The Japanese Reigning House is purely Imperial , with no inferior title of Royalty. + <P> The Japanese title of the Emperor is Tenno , an untranslatable word which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme . " Gladly Japan poured out the equivalent of a million dollars a day for 16 days to enthrone " The Son of Heaven . " <P> There was no Coronation in Japan last week . There could be none . There is no Crown . <P> <P> The grand pageant of assumption of the Imperial Station proceeded amid ancient things and ceremonies whose very names and meanings are untranslatable . However , since the Tenno did sit upon what amounted to a chair , one may stretch a point and call the occasion his Enthronement . <P> Preparations of the most laborious and costly sort began more than a year ago . Over $4,000,000 was spent on new equipment for railways , illumination , telegraphs , telephones , telephoto and radio . Since a little rice would be offered to the Sun Goddess by the Tenno , at one point in the ceremonials , a diligent search had to be made throughout the Empire for persons sufficiently exemplary to be entrusted with growing this rice . <P> Since some of the ceremonies would take place in temporary buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be especially constructed at Kioto , ancient Capital of Japan . The hereditary families of workmen and carpenters , who from age to age erect these buildings , naturally came high-because of their unique , hereditary purity . It was easy to spend over 16 millions of dollars . <P> The 16 days began one dawn , last week , in Tokyo-dawn being the most auspicious hour for the egress of the Son of Heaven . <P> Rode forth the Tenno , clad as a Field Marshal , in his great Louis XIV enclosed carriage , emblazoned with the 16 petaled Imperial Chrysanthemum , surmounted by a great golden Phoenix-symbol of inextinguishable Radiance . <P> Rode before even the Tenno His Imperial Highness Prince Kanin , Honorary Executive of the Enthronement. * Came third the Empress , wearing an Occidental court gown of blue velvet , with large blue picture hat-her eyes cast modestly and fixedly down . The Tenno 's brother , H.I.H. Chichibu , the heir presumptive , rode in a fourth carriage beside Princess Setsu , his bride . ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) . Brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet , the Diplomatic Corps , great Admiral Togo , and hundreds of correspondents. * As the Imperial train of eleven chuffed out of Tokyo 101 guns boomed .
