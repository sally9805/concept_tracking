If caveat emptor ( let the buyer beware ) were still the U. S. rule for trading in wheat , corn , rye , barley oats and like grains , then Armour Grain Co. , or anyone , might play David Harum* to the detriment of farmers , millers or brokers . But the U. S. Department of Agriculture has long sought to keep grain transactions honest ; and so Secretary William M. Jardine was " tremendously interested " last week to learn that Banker Edward Eagle Brown of Chicago , as arbitrator , had ordered the Armour Grain Co. to pay $3,000,000 to creditors of the now dissolved Farmers ' Cooperative Grain Marketing Co . <P> The money was a penalty for dishonesty and cheating by Armour Grain Co. employes . When their stores of grain were being sampled and priced for sale to the Farmers ' company , they sneaked into their warehouses , in dead night , and altered samples of poor , bin-burnt grain to make it seem like good grain . And they falsified their books to claim more grain sold than actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The buyers had no warning to beware ; should not have needed such warning . J. Ogden Armour and his nephews Philip D. Armour and Lester Armour will have to pay over this money , for , although they knew nothing of their nefarious employes ' doings they are The Armour Grain Co . But in the present case , although they must pay over $3,000,000 to the Farmers ' Co-operative Grain Marketing Co. they will get back almost half- for they are , with Rosenbaum Bros , and Rosenbaum Grain Corp. , elevator operators , the creditors of the Farmers ' company . <P> *Fictional character ; " slick " Yankee trader .
