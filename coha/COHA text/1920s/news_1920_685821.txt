txt Where Housing Is Cheapest . To the Editor of The New York Times : Wood as a basic building material offers interesting opportunities for study . The writer has recently made a canvass of the great lumber-producing centres of this country with the object of securing cost data for a simple , ready-cut housing proposition for export . As a result he has learned that the nearer the source of supply is to the Atlantic seaboard the higher the price . It upsets all of his ideas of practical economics to find that he can have dwelling houses manufactured in Oregon and have them delivered by rail in New York for much lower prices than it is possible to obtain in any other part of the United States or Canada . Oregon is ten times the size . of Massachusetts , has a perfect climate and a population of less than eight hundred thousand . Why not recommend ' to prospective home builders that they move to the sole State where good house building materials are still cheap ? ROBERT TAPPAlsT . Forest Hills , L.
