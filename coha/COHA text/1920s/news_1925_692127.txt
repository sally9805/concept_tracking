txt One of the most constructive developments in the cigar industry in years is the decision of the House Ways and liaa.ns Committee to effect a reduction of $10,000,000 to $12,000,000 in the annual tax on cigars . Although the tax cut , tentatively named at these figures for embodiment in the general tax reduction bill , is not as great as was hoped for by cigar manufacturers , interests prominent in the industry declare it will result in larger production and lower costs , and will be reflected in better earnings by the cigar companies . The proposed tax cut will he in the neighborhood of a 25% reduction , as revenue derived by the government from cigar production in the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1925 , totaled around $45,000,000 . Cigar interests for some time have been agitating for alleviation of what they considered an excessive burden , and have been requesting cuts ranging from 33 1-3% to 50% . An important result of partial lifting of the tax burden will be the permitting of a larger margin of profit on the lower priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5-cent and 10-cent types  --  that are being pushed by the manufacturers in an effort to bring cigarsmoking back into the favor it once enjoyed before being supplanted in large part by the cigarette . The margin of profit in producing these types has been exceedingly small , and the manufacturer has had to look for his profits so'cly from large scale machine production . The lower tax , it is said , should show an immediate betterment in earnings , ' accruing from this end of the business . Notwithstanding comparatively small profits in pro- ' dnction of the lower priced cigars , the companies have been making very respectable earnings this year from their sale . Cutting of the total manufacturing cost ! through lower taxes , all paid by the makers , points to better earnings in 1926 . Combined with this factor t 's a reason to hope for a decided improvement in tho business ! is an extensive advertising campaign and the developrrent I of . a nationwide distribution of popular-priced brands . The existing tax on cigars selling for 5 cents is $4 thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - selling for not over 5 cents constitute approximately 40C- , of total production in the United States , or about 2 660 , - 000,000 of a total of around 6,600.000.000 cigars turned out in the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1925 . Cigars retailing at over 5 and not more than 8 cents pay a tax of $6 a thousand under the tax law of 1917 ; at over 8 and not more than 15 cents , $9 a thousand ; at over 15 and not more than 20 cents , $12 a thousand ; and retailing at more than 20 cents , $15 a thousand .
