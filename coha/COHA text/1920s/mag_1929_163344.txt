Three weeks ago 45 members of Boston 's Symphony Orchestra began giving experimental , free , outdoor concerts on the Charles River Basin Esplanade ( TIME , July 15 ) . Last week the experiment could no longer be considered experimental . The attendance had amazed even optimistic Conductor Arthur Fiedler . His nightly audiences , numbering between 5.000 and 8,000 are twice as large as a wintertime full-house at Symphony Hall . <P> Conductor Fiedler has been troubled by open air acoustics . On the first night , as his music proceeded from the huge , conch-like acoustic shell , queer things happened . Tubas became thunderous , reverberant . Strings quavered into curious silences . Kettledrum tones were like feeble rasps on a gourd . Although untrained listeners were unaware , sensitive Conductor Fiedler was beside himself . <P> The shell was extended . This helped somewhat , but freaks of tone were still audible to a sensitive ear . Evidently the problem was scientific , beyond a musician 's province . Conductor Fiedler might have abandoned the shell and tried electric amplification . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not please true musicians . At length he consulted Dr. W. R. Barss , professor of acoustics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . <P> Professor Barss proposed a rearrangement of the musicians . In effecting this , each of the 45 players was moved to a position unorthodox in symphonic seating plans . If he had not been adaptable , Conductor Fiedler might then have found himself pointing to the trombones when he wished to stir up the bassoons . But he soon learned where his men were . Best of all , the scheme worked . <P> Arthur Fiedler conceived and accomplished the Esplanade concerts himself . His is a new name to nationwide concertgoers , but his musical lineage is a proud one . He was born 35 years ago in Boston , the son of Boston Symphonist Emmanuel Fiedler , who played second violin in the famed Kneisel Quartet . Fiddler Fiedler named his boy after the late great violinist Artur Nikisch , onetime Boston Symphony conductor . Aged 6 , the boy studied violin with his father , piano with his mother . Later he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime accompanist to Fritz Kreisler . <P> In 1910 Fiedler Sr. retired , took his family to Europe . Since he did not wish Arthur to follow music , the boy ran errands for a Berlin publisher . After five weeks , his head full of harmonics , he rebelled . Fiedler Sr. , repentant , taught him the violin from that June into the following Fall . Then , out of 53 competitors he was accepted for one of three vacancies at the Berlin Royal Academy of Music . When War came he sailed for Boston , where the late Conductor Karl Muck hired him for the Boston Symphony . When the U. S. went to war , he went to camp , was discharged for flat feet . He has since taught , played in concerts , organized the first U. S. sinfonietta ( little symphony ) . <P> In Boston , when Conductor Agide Jacchia of the Boston Symphony 's " Pop " ( popular ) concerts suddenly resigned on the night before the season 's finale , Arthur Fiedler was given the baton . He was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Symphony .
