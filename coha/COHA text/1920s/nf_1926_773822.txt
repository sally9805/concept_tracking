Thus the young Venetian nobleman who engaged him as a teacher accused him of teaching the black art , the authorities of Venice surrendered him to the Inquisition , the Inquisition handed him over to the Governor of Rome with a request that he be punished " without shedding of blood . " Bruno knew that this meant burning at the stake . He never quailed . He turned and said : " Ye who pass . judgment over me feel , maybe , greater fear than I upon whom it is passed . " ? as . Tycho Brake , the Observer Bruno , as we have seen , ran ahead of the schedule of his time . The new astronomy of Copernicus did not justify all that he drew from it . In a word , Bruno was imaginative and in too much of a hurry . What the new science needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of time . These were supplied by Tycho Brahe , the great observer of Denmark . The contrast between him and the Italian is marked . Bruno loved the general and grandiose ; Tycho sought the particular and precise . Bruno talked about immeasurable and countless worlds ; Tycho made measurements and counted the stars . Bruno worked anywhere and spun his fancies across Europe ; Tycho worked in an observatory on an island in the Baltic and became what his successor Kepler called " the prince of the mathematicians of a century . " Tycho was the first great observer in astronomy . He became interested in the subject as a boy . In i56o , at the age of thirteen , he watched the eclipse of the sun of August 2I . When it appeared as predicted , he made up his mind to study a science which could thus foretell the marvelous . But he could not yet brush away the old cobweb of popular belief . Three years later he observed a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn . He thought that this was the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this misinterpretation his scientific interest was 141 // strong . He found that the old time tables were wrong , therefore he made up his mind to improve the astronomical tables and constructed a crude contrivance to help him out . This was simply a jointed ruler with sights for fixing the position of the planets . Science and superstition were still mingled in Tycho 's mind . In 1572 there appeared a brilliant new star . This was described correctly by Tycho in regard to its place in the heavens and its changes in color and light . But with this description came this strange interpretation : The star was at first like Venus and Jupiter , and its effects will therefore first be pleasant ; but as it then became like Mars , there will next come a period of wars , seditions , captivity , and death of princes and destruction of cities , together with dryness , and fiery meteors in the air , pestilence , and venomous snakes . Lastly the star became like Saturn and there will , therefore , finally come a time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sad things . This seems fantastic to us , but it was merely in the fashion of that day . The next important study made by Tycho concerned a comet of 1577 . Here the Danish astronomer let fancies alone , although people at that time said that comets were formed by the ascending from the earth of human sins and wickedness , formed into a kind of gas and set on fire by the anger of God . This poisonous stuff was believed to fall down again on people 's heads and cause all kinds of mischief , such as bad weather , pestilence , and sudden death . What Tycho drew from this stranger in the skies was , among other things , this , that it could not possibly be due to exhalations or gases from the earth , because it // was at least three times as far off as the moon . This disposed of the popular superstition . The second conclusion was that the comet was revolving about the sun at a greater distance than Venus and that it was not stopped or slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comet 's path might be oval ; at any rate it cut right through the so-called solid spheres . This was a body blow to the system of the Aristotelians , as the Middle Ages understood the heavens were made up of transparent solids . These last observations and studies were carried out at Tycho 's great astronomical observatory , built through the generosity of the King of Denmark on an island near Elsinore , the reputed castle of Hamlet , Prince of Jutland . This establishment was called Uranienborg , or the castle of the heavens . Besides four observatories it contained dwelling houses for the workers , shops for making instruments , and a printing press to publish results . This famous place was visited by scientists , statesmen , and kings . Its show piece was the great mural quadrant . This was a polished brass arc , graduated or marked off into degrees , minutes , and seconds . To this arc were attached two sights . As represented in Tycho 's chief book we see him pointing towards a certain star , one assistant peeping through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two dials , and a third , at a table , recording the observation . This book also shows Tycho 's chemical laboratory , rooms where his students are at work , and two balconies containing such instruments as an astrolabe or skeleton celestial globe , a sextant for measuring the angular distance between two bodies , and a quadrant for finding altitudes. // This place , the Lick Observatory of its time was a true temple of science . As Tycho designed and superintended the making of his instruments and as they had the backing of the royal treasury they were the best money could buy . But with all this equipment and with twenty years of observation Tycho could not accept the Copernican scheme . For example , he made the objection that , if the earth rotated , a stone dropped from the top of a tower would fall at a distance from the foot of the // tower . Again he declared that if the earth moved in an orbit about the sun , this yearly motion would put the sphere of the fixed stars off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth must be insignificant in comparison . Tycho saw such difficulties in the Copernican system that he made a curious compromise . He abandoned the Ptolemaic scheme where the earth was the bull 's eye in the cosmic target and where the paths of the sun , planets and stars formed the rings of that target . But he could not go so far as to discard all of this system and make the sun the center of all . Instead of having , so to speak , one circus of several rings with the sun as the central attraction , he put the sun off in a side show , and surrounded it with all the planets except the earth . That left the earth still at the center and the rest of the circus revolving around it . This was somewhat trivial . However there were compensations . Tycho 's theory did not last , but his exact observations did . Such were his tables of over seven hundred stars , and a copper globe with the positions of one thousand stars marked upon it . These were inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the calculator in the advancement of the new astronomy . ? 26 . Johann Kepler , the Calculator Tycho the Dane at his astronomical paradise in the Baltic had carried on a magnificent series of observations for over twenty years . It remained for his pupil Kepler to reduce and interpret these observations . Figures can not lie , but they also can not tell the truth by themselves . Tycho was so busy making observations and had made so many of these that he was nearly swamped in his riches . So Kepler , the patient German , devoted a quarter of a century to working out his master 's records . To patience he added genius . He had before him a mass of figures , representing a maze of motions , yet in these he at last discovered the three famous laws of motion which bear his name . These were justly famous , for they straightened out the old tangles and put law and order among the heavenly bodies . Kepler did not attain his position of command without trouble . He had been through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor . So he had to work his way up by petty jobs . Appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Gratz , where students were few and fees small , he was obliged to eke out his living by catering to the tastes of the time . This he did by getting out a yearly almanac , somewhat in the style of the old Farmers ' Almanac . This contained some facts and also much fiction , such as weather predictions and astrological tips . 147 // As he expressed it : " Mother Astronomy would surely have to suffer hunger if the daughter Astrology did not earn their bread . " Kepler 's first book was called The Cosmographic Mystery , and in spite of its fancies it was welcomed by both Tycho and Galileo . It showed that its author had geometric ability , but that his imagination needed weights and not wings . These were supplied by Tycho , who wrote to Kepler , " Come , not as a stranger , but as a very welcome friend , come and share in my observations with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved associate . " Kepler having made one attempt now made another . He took up a hard problem , that concerning the motion of Mars . The path of this planet , as it appears from the earth , is as crooked as the flight of a boomerang . Try as he would Kepler could not explain this in terms of circles . Some combinations might agree with the observations of Tycho , but the best he could make was wrong by eight minutes of the arc . Now Kepler knew that Tycho , with his great mural quadrant , would never make such a mistake as this . So he gave up the idea of uniform circular motion and tried dividing the circle up into eccentric triangles . His diagram here looks like a pie cut into pieces , not from the center but off to one side . This seemed to do for some time . But new errors arose , and the path of Mars could not be explained in this way . As he quaintly put it : While thus triumphing over Mars , and preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons and equated eccentric fetters , it is buzzed here and there that the victory is vain , and that the war is raging anew as violently as before . // For the enemy , left at home a despised captive , has burst all the chains of the equations , and broken forth from the prisons of the tables . Kepler is a true scientist . He uses the method of trial and error and is frank as to his failures . He is an explorer and explorers make mistakes . He declares that if Columbus , Magellan and the Portuguese wandered off the course , no one should blame him for doing the same . Kepler tried circles and triangles inscribed in circles to explain the path of Mars . But these would not do . Now he suddenly hits on another figure and that is the ellipse , or the curve made by cutting through a cone on the bias . This form of the oval to his great joy he finds works perfectly . Mars is conquered and more too , for this discovery , is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two laws . These are as follows : A planet describes an ellipse , the sun being in one focus , . .. and a straight line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time . The third law is more complicated and completes the work of Kepler . When he published it in his Harmony of the World he exclaimed : What sixteen years ago , I urged as a thing to be sought , that for which I joined Tycho Brahe , for which I settled in Prague , for which I have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical contemplations ? at length I have brought to light , and recognized its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations . Kepler 's predecessors had greatly confused matters with their cycles , epicycles and movable eccentrics , but 1 // Kepler himself now stepped in and straightened out the tangle . The old way was to go in circles , the new gave that up . To those used to the old routes it was irritating to be directed into detours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange curves . But by making these detours around congested districts the traffic was kept moving in an orderly way . Beside new routes there were new speed limits . Instead of circles and uniform motion the new laws said that any planet , as it nears the sun , must go slowly , but that as it goes further off it must go faster . The results showed that this scheme was correct . When Galileo turned the newly invented telescope to unexplored regions of space the laws of Kepler were found to be universal laws . This , then , marks the third great step in the advance of the new astronomy . Tycho the Dane had made observation of the heavenly bodies ; Kepler the German had made calculations as to their paths and speed limits ; Galileo the Italian now furnished the verification by discovering the laws of motion of bodies , from cannon balls to comets . His point of view he gave as this : Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes ? I mean the universe ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the language and grasp the symbols , in which it is written . This book is written in the mathematical language , and the symbols are triangles , circles , and other geometrical figures , without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it ; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth. ? 27 . Galileo , the Expositor The new astronomers before Galileo had furnished the blue print for the parts of the world machine . They had traced out the curves and shown how the various portions worked , but they did not know by what force they moved . The next problem then was to discover the motive power which made all bodies , great or small , act as they do act . This problem was taken up by Galileo the Italian , who was born in Pisa , lectured at Padua and Florence , and finally fell into the clutches of the Inquisition at Rome . Galileo 's first experiments were in the field of physics and concerned the laws of bodies in motion or at rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mortmain of the past ? the dead hand of authority resting heavily upon it . That authority was Aristotle , who declared that the velocity of falling bodies was proportionate to their weight . This would mean that a two-pound weight would fall twice as fast as a onepound , a three-pound weight three times as fast , and so on . There may have been some excuse for this statement if small bodies are meant . If a coin and a feather be dropped at the same time from a man 's hand the coin reaches the ground first . This is because of the resistance of the air , but Aristotle 's explanation would have involved also the old notion that heavy bodies tend to move rapidly to their " natural " place , the heavy earth , 151 // and that light bodies remain in the atmosphere which is " by nature " light . Galileo swept aside this false theory and this lack of observation by a simple experiment . He took to the top of the leaning tower of Pisa two weights , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushed them over the edge and let them drop together . They struck the ground at the same time . The experiment was a success , but many could not believe the evidence of their senses . The old Aristotelians declared that the young Galileo had done the trick through some unknown cause , probably by the aid of magic . Galileo 's experiments made him unpopular at Pisa . He found a scientific refuge in the Republic of Venice , which was more or less free from the fetters of tradition . At Padua he carried on further experiments . These dealt with the velocity of falling bodies . According to the old idea , weight determined the speed with which bodies reached the earth . Galileo had shown that the small cannon ball did not lag behind the larger when dropped from the tower . But he did not know what their common speed was . He now rigged up a smooth inclined plane and down it rolled a bronze ball . Then by means of a water clock he found out that a body will be falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the first second , 64 at the end of the second , 96 at the end of the third , and so on . In other words a body falls 32 feet faster every second until it reaches the ground . This was exact science . It furnished a fact instead of a fancy . The fact is the law that falling bodies move with evenly increasing speed through their course . The fancy is that a body hastens toward its " natural " place , just as a man // hastens more and more eagerly the nearer he gets to his fatherland . Another set of exact results obtained by Galileo concerned projectiles . People at that time did not know exactly what was the line of flight of a ball fired from a cannon . Galileo showed that a ball begins to fall as soon as it leaves the cannon 's mouth and describes a parabolic curve . This is due to the fact that the force of gravity begins to act at once . So instead of a simple motion due to the powder and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting in a kind of curve familiar to any one who keeps raising the sight of his rifle the farther off the target is . These new ideas had to be corrected as time went on . Some details were left out . For one thing the resistance of the air was not fully allowed for . Galileo of course declared that the air was a hindrance and not a help and that it did not rush in behind and make a body go faster . But the clear proof that a feather and a coin would reach the ground at the same time under proper conditions could not be furnished until the experiment was tried in a vacuum , such as in a vessel exhausted of its air . However , Galileo had laid the foundations of modern mechanics in regard to small bodies . At the same time he furnished a mass of new materials in regard to great bodies , especially the celestial bodies . This was made possible by means of the discovery of that new instrument the telescope . Who discovered this is not precisely known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put certain lenses in a tube and opened up the skies to man 's vision . Some recently discovered writings of the English monk have extraordinary pictures // of spiral nebulae or rotating star clusters . If Bacon did discover the telescope he kept it a secret . He was probably afraid of claiming to have explored the skies beyond the crystalline vault , just as some of Galileo 's friends were actually afraid of peeping through his telescope lest they should " fall into heresy , " as the saying was . By Galileo 's time the telescope was being used . Its invention was claimed by two different firms of Dutch spectacle makers . One story goes that some children were playing with lenses one day and noticed that if two of them were looked through at once , the clock on the distant steeple came out so clearly that the time could be read on it . Whatever the legend , the fact is that Galileo heard of the Holland spyglass and at once set upon improving it . With his knowledge of the laws of optics he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty times nearer and a thousand times larger than when viewed with the unaided eye . Now followed an astonishing list of discoveries , for a new instrument always brings great results . Take nowadays the invention of the gas engine . From it have followed airplanes , fire pumps , tractors , submarines , motor cars of all kinds ; in short , air , fire , earth , and water , all the elements , have one by one been conquered and made subservient to man by this one invention . So with Galileo and the telescope . He directed his little spyglass , not much larger than an opera glass , to the heavens , and here are some of the things he found : spots on the sun , mountains on the moon , phases or different aspects of Venus , four moons around Jupiter , Saturn with curious appendages , and the Milky Way // not the path of a comet , but made up of a multitude of stars . The results of these discoveries were as remarkable as the discoveries themselves . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun had spots , it was no longer the perfect , immaculate body demanded by its place in the heavenly realm . If the moon had mountains and craters , it was no longer the crystal orb of night with its pure smooth face . If Venus had different phases or aspects , like the moon , it was no longer a planet fit to dwell in the unchanging heavens . The same reasoning applied to Saturn with its appendages , later resolved into rings . Finally , if the Milky Way was made up of a multitude of stars , that would make possible the doctrine of the plurality of worlds . The general result of all this was to destroy the old dualism ? the belief that there are two realms ? the heavens above , perfect and unchangeable , and below the earth , imperfect and changeable . In brief , the universe now becomes one , heaven is brought to earth and earth is put in the heavens . There are no longer superior and inferior , but all bodies have equal rights . ? 28 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn from the new discoveries , Galileo naturally fell foul of the Church and of that immense body of the believers who held to the old views . His experiments with falling bodies at Pisa were as nothing compared with his fresh discoveries at Padua . But the worst was to come when Galileo declared that the new discoveries confirmed the system of Copernicus . In 1613 , two years after he constructed his first telescope , Galileo publicly declared that Copernicus was right and Aristotle wrong . The next year the Sacred Congregation , or Church board of censors , decreed that Copernicus ' doctrine of the two double movements of the earth was in contradiction to the Sacred Scripture . It was a conflict of authority with audacity , where authority won the first few innings but audacity won the game . This conflict lasted well on into the next century . Then Newton could show that a natural explanation was better than a supernatural . This meant that universal gravity was a simpler explanation than forces exerted by angels over the orbs , or a prime mover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heresy , or wrong doctrine , was not to come for several years . Meanwhile he did not hide his views , but defended the sun-centered system whenever he had a chance . Tycho , it will be recalled , was timid and made a compromise as to Copernicus. 156 // He brought the following objections against the theory of the earth 's movements . First , the earth was too heavy . As he put it : " The sluggish earth is unfit to move . " Next , if the earth moved , all loose things would be carried from east to west , they would fly off like drops of water from a wheel . Lastly , he could not conceive of the earth being turned upside down and of men hanging with their heads downward for twelve hours out of the twenty-. four . These are familiar old objections based on false assumptions and reasonings . The first is that the earth is the heaviest of the four elements whose natural state is that of rest . The second objection is based on false reasoning ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? like a cart wheel ? takes place in a large body like the earth , with its immense attraction for smaller bodies on or near its surface . Galileo met this objection by the simple statement that a ball dropped from a tower falls at its foot , just as an object dropped from the masthead of a moving ship drops on its deck . The third objection is a revival of the ancient and medieval prejudice against the antipodes ? the supposed region of the under earth where men could not live upside down , like flies hanging from a ceiling . This objection is met by bringing in the force of gravity . These objections seem weak and easily disposed of . But there were greater ones much harder to meet . Beside the assumptions , based on ancient authority and the Sacred Scriptures , Tycho turns to difficulties based on observation . Why is it that the constellations always preserve the same aspect , age after age ? The Great Bear or Dipper ; Orion and his belt ; Cassiopeia and her chair 1 58 FROM MYTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as shown by the old star maps . If the earth moves why have they not changed , just as the lights of a town shift as the traveler passes by ? The answer is that the constellations are at a distance practically infinite for the human eye . Copernicus suggested this and Galileo accepted his suggestion . Yet it was not until the present century that it was shown that the stars do show displacement with the seasons of the year . Because the distances are almost infinite , the differences appear almost infinitesimal . Of course Galileo could not reach these accurate results with his crude telescope made out of a length of old organ pipe . Tycho 's last objection against the Copernican system was this . If the earth revolves about the sun , Mercury and Venus ought to show phases like the moon . Copernicus predicted these phases and Galileo actually discovered them . But first he had to give proof of the powers of his telescope . This he did , as he wrote Kepler , by showing to the senators of Venice vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they were seen " without my spyglass , steering full sail into the harbor . " " My spyglass , " he explains , " makes a thing fifty miles off as near and clear as if it were only five . " With a better perspective glass turned towards the heavens , Galileo now discovered the phases of Venus . This means that , like the moon , the planet passes gradually from the thin crescent to the full round orb . Here was a confirmation of the Copernican system which implied that the planets , like the moon , shine by reflected sunlight . Added proof was given by some unexpected new discoveries . The greatest marvel of all , as // Galileo himself described it , was the discovery of four new planets . These , which we now know as the four secondary planets by which Jupiter is surrounded , Galileo described as " moving in the same way as Mercury and Venus and peradventure the other known planets move round the sun . " What did the other chief living astronomer think of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Copernican system in a college debate . He had tried to prove that Copernicus was right by his curious system of regular solids , the rings or hoops around which were supposed to represent the paths of the planets . When he sent a copy of his book , The Cosmographic Mystery , to Galileo , the latter replied that he was glad to have found so great an ally in the search for truth , since he himself had been for many years an adherent of the Copernican theory . He had collected many arguments for refuting the accepted theory , for example , that the moon is a body like the earth . But these arguments he had not ventured to bring to the light of publicity for fear of sharing the fate of Copernicus . " Our master , " he says , " who although he has won immortal fame with some , yet with very many ( so great is the number of fools ) has become an object of ridicule and scorn . " Galileo was cautious when he had only guesses to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in turn holds up the fools to ridicule and scorn . One man declined to look through his telescope at the satellites of Jupiter . Upon the death of this timid soul soon after Galileo sarcastically remarked : " I hope that he saw them on his way to heaven . " 16o FROM MYTH TO REASON When Galileo had discovered the phases of Venus and Mercury as predicted by Copernicus , a friend wrote to him that he must now convince the most obstinate . Galileo , more worldly-wise , replied that not even the testimony of the stars would suffice , were they to descend on earth and speak for themselves . Thus a professor of natural philosophy at Pisa , when requested by Galileo to look at the moon and planets through his glass , refused to do so . " What shouts of laughter we should have at this glorious folly , " wrote Galileo to Kepler , " to hear his laboring before the Grand Duke with logical arguments , as if with magical incantations , to charm the new planets out of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably like those of an astronomer of Florence . The latter reasoned in this way as to Jupiter and its moons : " The satellites are invisible to the naked eye , and therefore can have no influence on the earth , and therefore will be useless , and therefore do not exist . " For the time being Galileo had the best of his opponents . These people , as he put it , believe there is no truth to seek in nature , but only in the comparison of texts . But soon Pope Paul V called Galileo to Rome to explain his views . After his audience the two apparently parted good friends . But in the meanwhile the astronomer 's enemies urged both the Pope and the College of Cardinals to declare the Copernican system impious and heretical . The conservatives won . The work of Copernicus and Kepler 's commentary on it were both placed on the list of prohibited books and Galileo was commanded never to teach or believe the motion of the earth . The next Pope , Urban VII , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his learning , which misled Galileo into thinking that he might publish his views . This he did in his most famous work , The Dialogue on the Two Chief Systems of the World . ? 29 . The Conflict of Systems In his great work The Two Chief Systems of the World Galileo chose the dialogue form so that no one could say that he did not present both sides of the question . There were two chief speakers , one who upheld the new view of Copernicus , the other the old view of Aristotle . This seems fair enough until we discover that there was a joker in the names of the interlocutors . The conservative speaker , who upholds the old view , is named Simplicio . This suggests to the reader that he is a simpleton , a man of straw put up merely to be knocked down . One story goes that Galileo 's enemies at once caught at this and hinted to the Pope that it was he who was meant by this simple-minded character . And yet Galileo was not to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public . The decree which had condemned the Copernican doctrine expressly stated that it was permissible to mention that doctrine as an hypothesis or theory in scientific argument , but that it was forbidden to proclaim it as truth . This is what is known as the double standard . Bruno had attempted to appeal to it in his trials , for he had made a distinction between speaking as a Catholic and speaking according to reason . The distinction was vain there and was vain here . Anybody could see which side Galileo favored . In the preface he speaks of the former edict against himself as imposing a reasonable 163 // silence upon the opinion of the mobility of the earth . But he at once adds that this edict was gotten up by people who knew nothing of astronomical observations and who tried to clip the wings of speculation . He also appeals to the patriotism of his readers and hopes that " the world will know that , if other nations have navigated more than we , we have not studied less than they . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore spots . It made Galileo 's opponents appear ignorant and narrow minded . But worse was to come . When Simplicio , the Aristotelian , speaks , Salviati , the Copernican , talks to him as if he were giving information to a dull boy in school . He can hardly make him understand that there is such a thing as relative motion . Here is a sample of the Dialogue : Simplicio : Do you call that nothing when the sun goes from one meridian to another , rises up over this horizon and sinks behind that one , brings now day , and now night ? Salviati : All the changes you mention are such only in respect to the earth . They may all be reduced to the simple fact that the sun is first visible in China , then in Persia , afterwards in Egypt , Greece , France , Spain , America , etc ... . Exactly the same thing happens and in exactly the same way if , instead of disturbing so large a part of the universe ? such as the immensity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . . . . If , however , the earth is left motionless , we must go to an incomparably greater sphere , to which we must ascribe a complete rotation in twenty-four hours . This is the first and the chief argument against the astronomical systems in vogue before Copernicus . These systems were all based on the belief that the earth was the immovable center of the universe . But more argue z 64 FROM MYTH TO REASON ments are added until Simplicio is buried beneath an avalanche of new facts . A brief of this debate would run something like this : Sun spots show that the sun is not the perfect orb of day ; new stars that the heavens are not unchangeable ; comets that the spheres are not solid ; new satellites that there are more worlds than man ever dreamed of . Of all these points the alleged motion of the earth was the worst in the eyes of the churchman . Grant that the earth moves and it becomes a mere side show and not the theater of divine action . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the Church must exert its discipline . Scholasticism was literally a school , and when a scholar becomes too clever for his teachers either he must be suppressed or they must take a back seat . Schoolmen would never do that because they had the power to punish . The Inquisition stood ready not with a mere birch rod but with the rack , not with the ferrule but with the torch . It was not the case where an impossible pupil could leave the school . There was no other school except the Protestant . It never occurred to Galileo to go to the latter , for he declared himself a " jealous and Catholic Christian . " What was to be done under the circumstances ? It is either denial of his doctrines or death at the stake . So Galileo formally recanted his belief in the earth 's motion .

Besides these Galileo left behind him his wonderful discoveries which others were to verify . And last of all there remained those documents of condemnation which gave away the whole case for the prosecution . In the formal condemnation the inquisitors put the case even more clearly than Galileo himself had done . In addition they gave wide publicity to the two rival systems .

Here are some extracts : Whereas you , Galileo , son of the late Vincenzo Galilei of Florence , aged seventy years , were denounced in 1615 to this Holy Office , for holding as true the false doctrine taught by many , namely , that the sun is immovable in the center of the world , and that the earth moves , and also with a diurnal motion ; also for having pupils whom you instructed in the same opinions ; also for maintaining a correspondence on the same with some German mathematicians ; also for publishing certain letters on the solar spots , in which you developed the same doctrine as truth ; . . . Therefore , this holy tribunal being desirous of providing against the disorder and mischief thence proceeding and in166 FROM MYTH TO REASON creasing to the detriment of the holy faith , by the desire of His Holiness , and of the Most Eminent Lords Cardinals of this supreme and universal Inquisition , the two propositions of the stability of the sun , and the motion of the earth , were qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun is the center of the world and immovable from its place is absurd , philosophically false , and formally heretical , because it is expressly contrary to the Holy Scripture .

Newton , the Generalizer In the year in which Galileo died Isaac Newton was born and with him a new era . That era has been called the Age of Newton , for the great Englishman with his discovery of the law of gravity dominated it . That age may also be called new because it brought in the view of the world as a machine . Galileo had formulated the laws of small bodies falling towards the earth . Newton extended these laws to large bodies and to the very confines of the known universe . If an apple drops to the ground because attracted by gravity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of Newton under the apple tree may or may not be true . At least it serves to illustrate the fresh discovery , or rather the fact , that a real principle good for this sphere may be pushed into the realm of space . Here the new law is to apply to whatever may turn up ? comets , meteors , satellites . Now as the telescope was made larger , the bounds of the universe were broadened , but , however widely extended , these new laws kept pace with the new findings . So the world becomes a vast machine , more and more complicated but always working under the same laws . The diagrams in Newton 's Principles concern such matters as the path of the moon about the earth made up of its rate of fall and its own motion . And what applies to this earth with its little satellite applies to greater I67 // planets with greater satellites and to the sun itself with comets sweeping about it in vast orbits . The blue print is enlarged , and whether it applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world machine , it is always in scale , always after the same pattern , always obedient to the same laws of motion . This flexible framework of ideas is Newton 's great glory . At first , as applied to our little universe , it may have appeared as a working model in a patent office which is confined in a limited place . But with the advancement of science , with the discoveries of the immense stellar spaces , such as were made by Herschel when new island universes swam into his ken , it was found that the working model was a universal model , a thing that mortal mind had dreamed of but had never before confirmed . Newton , then , has the undying fame of being considered the great generalizer of the laws of motion . More truly than Kepler he was the legislator of the heavens , for he reduced Kepler 's three laws of motion to one law , the law of gravity . The first proof of this was the quick acceptance of his views by the men of his time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this late day . The chief question which Newton asked was : What makes the planets move the way they do ? Their paths had been described more or less well . But there remained the problem of the efficient cause , that is , the discovery of a cause sufficient to move them . Various explanations had been made . Aristotle of old had suggested a prime mover who spun around the first matter , or outer shell of the universe . The medievals had added angels to the scheme , each of whom had charge of a rolling sphere . // Then Copernicus , the Pole , thought a body could not turn without being fixed to a crystal sphere . Next Kepler , the German , had dropped these supernatural agencies and imagined spokes of force sticking out from the sun , as if the sun were the hub of a vast wheel . Meanwhile Descartes , the Frenchman , had suggested vortices or whirlpools of matter which carried the planets along in an eddying stream . Finally , Gilbert , the Englishman , considered that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this turned out to be wrong when Newton had his way . With the simplicity of genius he took two existing forces and showed by calculation that they would account for the revolutions of the heavenly bodies . The moon was his starting point because nearest to the earth . Grant that a body has motion of its own and moves onward in a straight line ; grant that it is falling toward the earth , as do all bodies near the surface , and the solution is at hand . Of course several things must be known , such as the size of the earth , the distance of the moon , the rate of acceleration of a falling body . The last of these had been worked out by Galileo , the second by Kepler , but the first was unfortunately not exactly known when Newton began his calculations . The length of a degree , onethree hundred and sixtieth of the earth 's diameter , was only roughly worked out . This was what threw Newton off the track in his first calculations . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move around the earth ? The natural thing is for a body , once started , to move on in a straight path . If that path is curved there must be some deflecting force . 1 70 FROM MYTH TO REASON In the , case of the moon the attraction of the earth may be that force . Can this be proved ? Newton asked . Yes , if the pull of the earth brings about the same rate of fall as for other foreign bodies . There are here three factors to be considered . The final circular path is the orbit of the moon , the tangent is the straight line touching any point of that circle , the pull towards the earth is the centripetal or center-seeking force . Thus with two pulls a curve is described . The shape of this curve is known . Does it agree with the law of moving bodies as stated by Galileo ? That is the question that occurred to Newton . If apples and cannon balls fall to the earth at a certain rate , why not the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the earth ? Newton went from apples and cannon balls to greater bodies and finally found that common gravity worked in the heavens as well as down here . Galileo estimated the speed of a falling body as just a trifle over i6 feet the first second . Newton tried to verify this but failed at first . His result was 13 feet , too far off to come under Galileo 's calculations . The reason for this was a faulty measurement of the earth . The astronomers of that day had estimated the circumference of the earth by measuring a part of a meridian or great circle . They had not used points far enough apart to make this measurement exact . But meanwhile the French had measured a meridian from two such widely separated places as Lapland and Peru . This gave a new estimate of which Newton learned almost a score of years after his first failure . He went back to his old figure , made the necessary corrections , and when he saw the answer was coming out right he became so excited that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GENERALIZER I j I finish his calculations . Eureka ! The result agreed with Galileo , and the law of the universal operation of gravitation was confirmed . As the great discoverer himself summed it up in Proposition IV of his Principles : The moon gravitates towards the earth . And by the force of gravity is continually drawn off from a rectilinear motion and retained in its orbit . Why did men at once accept Newton 's Principles , and before the end of his life almost worship him ? It was not because he discovered the force of gravity . From the Greeks to Galileo there was always some intelligent thinker who knew of that force . It was because Newton discovered and proved that our entire system was ruled by a central force coming from the sun . The control of the moon by the earth is a special case of a similar central control . So is that of the satellites of Jupiter by a force emanating from Jupiter . In a word , all the various bodies of our system obey a common mathematical law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genius . His Principles were looked upon as the " Bible of Science , " and he himself as a man who had confirmed the belief that order was heaven 's first law . Newton 's rival , the German philosopher Leibnitz , gave him the highest possible compliment . He said : " Taking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the times when Newton lived , what he has done is much the better half . " Newton himself was more modest . He simply said : " If I have seen further than other men it is because I have been standing on the shoulders of giants . " These giants we are familiar with ? Copernicus who // brought back the view of the universe as sun-centered ; Tycho who furnished a lifetime of observation ; Kepler who showed the paths of the planets to be elliptical ; Galileo who worked out the laws of falling bodies . All these did a great work , but Newton did a greater . His was the mind which generalized and saw unsuspected connections , connections which proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been E Pluribus Unum , for his discovery of the universality of the law of gravitation has been compared to that resolution of the Continental Congress for " a more perfect union . " Indeed , the foundation of the law of gravity has been likened to the adoption of the American Constitution . By this instrument the states were unified , and all drawn towards the central seat of government , as are all bodies towards the sun . And as there was a balance of forces between the sun , earth and moon , so there was a balance of powers between the three branches of the government . No one of these can go out of its way to check the other , no one encroach on the other 's orbit , but all are harmonious parts of a vast machine . In a word , Newton brought to his age a kind of federal universe whose parts formed a union one and inseparable . ? 31 . The World a Divine Design Sir Isaac Newton 's fame rests on the foundation which he made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the first facts . The Greeks had guessed it ; Bruno had philosophized about it ; Copernicus , Tycho , Kepler , and Galileo had each contributed mighty stones towards this foundation . Newton with his mathematical laws laid these in true courses and thus led men to the assurance that the universe was one and governed by uniform laws . Now the stability of the system appeared so wonderful to Newton that it led him to believe that there was a reasonable Being who had arranged all things from the start . The world then became a divine design . If man may reduce the problems of celestial mechanics to mathematical laws this is because it is " God who geometrizes . " We have pointed out a kinship between Newton 's unity of the universe and the formation of the American Union . There is another point of resemblance . Since the American Union has become " a more perfect union , " since it has withstood the lapse of time and the shock of civil war , some highly patriotic people have come to believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone so far as to say that the " founding fathers " were led to construct the Constitution by divine guidance . So it was with Newton . What was called celestial mechanics worked so marvelously that it became r7 // celestial in the supernatural sense . So this argument arose : " If there is a machine there must be a designer , and if this machine works perfectly there must be a divine designer . " This is the famous argument for design . It had been in men 's minds as a speculation for countless ages . Some of the Greeks held it , the medieval scholars reveled in it , and the astronomers of the Renaissance worked towards it . Now Newton brought forward fresh materials . The problem of design was a.lifelong'interest with the Englishman . As a boy he had constructed little machines ? windmills , waterwheels , and the like . At last he studied a world machine , a vast construction of countless parts , yet all working together . But where man 's machines wear out , break down and need repairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and never needs repairing . The laws of nature are eternal . As far back as men have calculated , the heavenly bodies have run their appointed courses , always dependable , never tiring out . If a comet fails to reappear at the expected time , this is only because of some retarding force which men failed to take account of . If a comet breaks up , that is only because of the attraction of some stronger body . These failures and fractures are only apparent effects . They are really due to reasonable causes if only we knew all the causes . In short , all the order of the universe is due to an all-powerful order . This view of Newton 's became immensely popular . At a time when human governments were changing or decaying , the divine government of the universe was without fault . Newton made his first approach to the discovery of the law of gravitation in the year in which England // suffered from a political revolution , when Cromwell overthrew the first Charles . Besides change in England there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun King , but it did not need a telescope to discover that there were spots on that sun . Among the courtiers there was naturally a kind of professional sun worship , for they basked in the rays of royal favor . But with the people and peasants matters were different . The world went very well for those near the source of light , but for those far away life was dark and cold . The influence of the great central body reached the prince but not the pauper . The latter was repelled , and not attracted as he should have been . In a word , the French system of centralized government did not work in all its parts ; it broke down at the edges , for its laws were not uniform for all . Now Newton 's system was a contrast to all this . If human affairs are badly run , if the political machine breaks down , let man but look up to the celestial sphere where the laws are uniform , where no exceptions are made , in short , where harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends in a great argument for optimism ? of all possible worlds this is the best possible world , some went so far as to say . So this double argument had a great vogue . It was a fine source of comfort for those who lived in bad times , especially for those who saw or suffered the cruelties and injustices of their form of political government . This was one reason why Voltaire , the French critic , welcomed the Englishman 's ideas and did all he could to make them popular in France . Just because he was a crabbed critic , a sour faultfinder , a pessimist at heart , he welcomed a system that might // bring a little cheer . He highly approved of Newton 's views that there is a divine purpose in the universe . Here he uttered his famous saying : " If there were no God , it would be necessary to invent Him . " Yet he can not go so far as Newton in believing in the particular as well as the general goodness of nature . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his characters say : " If this is the best world , what must the others be like ? " Problems and catastrophes like this show that it was hard to prove that the world machine was of divine design . Yet a long line of thinkers argued that it was . They began with the general and ended with the particular . Thus one of them reasoned that the Creator , being all wise , and pondering over the various world plans spread before his mind , would naturally choose the best possible plan . At the other end of the scale another reasoned that if any one thinks that there is no divine creation he should ponder over the intricate mechanism of the eye of a gnat , or the beautiful construction of a butterfly 's wings . But this kind of argument had another side . If the world machine down to its smallest details is quite perfect , does not this show that nature is self-sufficient ? Perhaps nature can produce everything out of herself . It is even possible that matter itself is the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have existed from all time . And if matter can think ? as the cautious Englishman Locke surmised ? then the very plan and purpose of nature is merely the unfolding of what already existed . It takes time for . the pattern to emerge , but the pattern was there as a potency or possibility . As an illusTHE // tration , here is a Japanese toy , a box of pith balls , all of which look alike . When put into water these unfold into various forms . It may be a flower , or a fish , or a man . This is a symbol of what matter itself may do , so if nature is made of matter it may contain within itself all that exists or is to be . This is the kind of argument that was directed against the view of the world as a machine of divine design . The opponents of that view granted that the world was a machine , but they held that it was of natural and not of supernatural design . Such is the view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but man a machine . The Age of Mechanics that began with Galileo now came to bear its full fruit . Galileo applied his laws to terrestrial mechanics , Newton to celestial . But the pendulum swings back again to earthly bodies ? this time not inanimate bodies like stones and cannon balls , but living bodies like men and animals . ? 32 . Man a Machine The idea of man as a machine keeps cropping up from time to time . A recent play has a stage full of these automatic creatures , made by machinery and themselves machinery . They look like men , act like men , and for all we know might be men , except they have no souls , and in an early stage , no feelings . But their maker , who stamped them out in his factory , found that without feelings they did damage to themselves . If they smashed their hands they felt no pain , and so great a loss of parts resulted from this that they had to be sent to the scrap heap . This did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves , and the result was that they reacted to pain and hurt and thus became more careful of themselves . They were capable of pleasure too , and when they came to find out that they were being deprived of the pleasures enjoyed by their masters and makers they revolted ? with dire results to those who brought them into being . The end of this play is not our concern , but the structure of the plot is . Fancy an animated statue , a mechanical chess player , a writing boy , a piano-playing girl , a manikin in a cave who tells his beads like a monk . Then imagine these made of various wheels , cogs , pulleys , bellows , tubes , and what not , and you have the beginnings of an idea that may explain living man as such . The French had this idea to a great degree , and several of 181 // their best thinkers carried it out into real life . It was an age of mechanical marvels , not only those just men-tioned , but many others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the twelve hours were struck in succession by the twelve apostles to the water toys of Versailles , where in the famous gardens of the palace the unwary stranger who enters the grotto of the nymphs steps on a hidden plank and a sea god arises and squirts him with water . This sort of thing logically carried out might explain man and his mechanism . One of these makers of mechanical marvels argued that , as he used more wheels for his flute player than for his quacking duck , so the driving works of a man are more complicated than those of animals . The person who really brought this notion into vogue was Descartes , the French philosopher . It is true that Tycho , the Danish astronomer , used to amuse the more light-minded among the visitors to his observ-atory and workshops with various performing puppets , but he reserved his celestial mechanism for the serious . Yet Descartes was serious enough , for he tried to show that the human puppets and the celestial machine were closely related . If the world is a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of similar matter , both sub-ject to similar laws ; that which explains one will explain the other . This was a bold question and at first sight a doubly dan-gerous doctrine . The very phrase " celestial mechanics " might mean that the heavenly bodies themselves were more under the guidance of mechanical laws than celestial beings ? from angels who rolled the planets along to the creator " whose arm wound up the vast machine . " And , // further , if man were a machine ? a construction made up of tubes , valves , juices , animal spirits , and the like ? what was the use of his possessing reason ? If this mortal frame be all , whence came his immortal soul ? These were ticklish questions and the way Descartes answered them strikes us as a bit evasive . He had com-pleted his book entitled The World and was ready to publish it when he heard of the condemnation of Galileo for teaching that the earth moves . The French philos184 FROM MYTH TO REASON opher had no desire to be confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inquisition . So he made this compromise . Oh , no , the earth does not move itself , he explained . It only is moved . There are great vortices or whirlpools of matter which carry it about , as a log is rolled over and over by an eddy in a stream . As for man as a mere machine , without guiding reason or immortal soul , that would be against the doctrines of the Church . But , says Descartes , I have no intention of teaching doctrines contrary to the Church . I merely suppose that if a man were a machine , with various tubes , valves , and animal spirits ? that machine would act precisely in the way that man 's body acts . In fact , most wise and illustrious doctors of the sacred faculty of theology in Paris , you yourselves could hardly tell the difference . Not that I want you to accept my views , but only that you might care to speculate over this ingenious theory . But the wise and illustrious doctors were not taken in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revised edition of Descartes ' book was suppressed and put on the index of prohibited works . But as usual this only whetted the curiosity of the clever , and the result was that Descartes ' notion of man as a machine aroused the interest of a whole school of writers , who carried out this line of thought up to and beyond the French Revolution . This general notion , without its early crudities , has persisted to this day . There is a modern school of biologists called behaviorists . These argue that living creatures , from polyps to people , behave thus and so // simply because of the way in which they are constructed . If dogs delight to bark and bite so do men perform their various actions because " it is their nature to . " The behaviorists are really old style mechanists . They bring in new things like protoplasm and chemical reactions . They have no more use for guiding reason and immortal souls than manufacturers of the modern " horseless carriage " have for dashboards and whipstocks , ? 33 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole was a curious one . He wanted to be orthodox and he wanted to be original . He wished to avoid Galileo 's dangerous doctrine of an earth which moves , and at the same time he did not want to go back to the ancient atomism . As he puts it , too many men hang on to old systems like ivy to the oak . So to meet these two conditions he invented a strange theory , that of vortices . The entire universe , he explained , is filled with whirlpools of subtle matter , and the path of the planets is to be explained by their being pushed from one whirlpool to another . Descartes ' own diagrams trace out these paths by mathematical laws , and so far as mathematics goes Descartes was a master . But the original stuff itself is harder to explain . As pictured in the diagrams the universe looks as if it were made up of revolving ball bearings , some large and some small . Being balls there must be some spaces between the parts . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , as a wall built of round stones has its cracks filled with rubble . In this way empty space was avoided . For Descartes , as a good churchman , had to hold to the belief that nature abhors a vacuum . All his opinions , he said , were submitted to the authority of the Church . Now the opposite of the absolute vacuum or emptiness is the plenum or fullness . Descartes obtained this by packing his universe with vortices and parts of 186 // vortices . Thus with the round bodies and their splinters he had a continuous mass of stuff without break or crack . This seems an impossible view , unless we have in mind our present-day doctrine of the ether as a universally diffused substance , too subtle for the senses , too light to weigh or measure . This substance , say certain modern thinkers , like Lord Kelvin , is beyond ordinary knowledge , and so far not found to offer the slightest drag on our revolving world unless the recent experiments at the Mount Wilson Observatory hold true . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must yet be assumed as existing within all things , as penetrating the pores of all matter , as present in the hollow tubes of barometer and thermometer , spread throughout space , and perhaps the source or ground of light , electricity , magnetism , and the like . Nowadays the ether , as used in the language of the radio experts , is supposed to bring about certain disturbances known as static troubles . In other words , the notion of a universe entirely full of matter , from the heaviest , most impenetrable metals to an almost unponderable or unweighable ether , has its upholders . This will perhaps bring out the ingenuity of Descartes ' views . The Copernican system as enlarged by Galileo 's telescope had left an aching void in men 's minds . There were terrific stretches of empty space which produced a feeling of being left alone in a desert . So Descartes ' theory had quite a vogue . A lady in the French court who took up with Descartes ' system is said to have remarked , " I adore vortices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities and was the accepted thing when Newton went to college . But the discovery of the law of gravitation seemed to give the death blow to the // scheme , for it was finally determined that the attraction between the sun , earth , and other heavenly bodies acts through empty space . So Descartes ' vortex universe fell from fashion , only to be revived in another form in modern times . Since the atom has been split into electrons it is supposed that the latter may consist in part of etherial whirls ? tiny ghosts , as it were , of Descartes ' great vortices in which the planets swam . Descartes ' vortical world machine broke down even in his day . But his theory of man as a machine lived on . It was not based so much on speculation as on observation . When he retired to Holland , where there was more freedom of thought than in the France of his day , he took up anatomy . We are familiar with Dutch pictures of anatomy classes and of dissected animals . Descartes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once visited him he found him busy with a scalpel over the head of a calf . This was no idle task , for later on he made the conjecture that perhaps , if men 's skulls were greatly enlarged , one might walk through them and see the machinery work as it does inside a Dutch windmill . Now when Descartes discourses on the proper method of finding how man is a machine , he makes this sugges-tion : So that there may be less difficulty in understanding what I shall say on this matter , I should like that those not versed in anatomy to take the trouble , before reading this , of having cut up before their eyes the heart of some large animal which has lungs ( for it is in all respects sufficiently similar to the heart of a man ) and cause that there be demonstrated to them the two chambers or cavities which are within it . // Without going into a lesson in anatomy , we find that Descartes argues that man is here built like a machine with tubes and valves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as water through a pump . This trite knowl-edge was a new thing to Descartes . He gained it from the English surgeon Harvey , who discovered the circula-tion of the blood and compared the heart to a water ram , the pulse being like the clack of that machine . Following Harvey , then , Descartes does not doubt that all the veins and arteries of the body are like streams by which the blood ceaselessly flows from the right cavity of the heart through the body and finally back into the left cavity . Thus the two cavities are like sluices through each of which all the blood passes in the course of each circuit which it makes in the body . All this brings up the familiar Dutch landscape . When Descartes looked out of the window of his her-mitage he could see the mills with their pumps , and the dikes with their sluices that kept the water in circulation . But these are artificial , some may object , while man 's body is a work formed by the Great Artificer . " Granted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no difference between bodies made by art and natural bodies , except-ing that machines made by men have parts large enough to be perceived by the senses , whereas the effects of natu-ral causes depend on certain organs minute enough to escape every sense . " The microscope was not yet available to Descartes , but he reasoned rightly that the laws of mechanics hold true in the most minute parts of natural bodies , or putting it the other way , all that is artificial is also natural . It is no less natural for a clock , made of the requisite Igo FROM MYTH TO REASON number of wheels , to indicate the hours , than for a tree , which has sprung from this or that seed , to produce a particular fruit . Accordingly , just as those who apply themselves to the consideration of an automaton , when they know the use of a certain machine and see some of its parts , infer from these the manner in which others which they have not seen are made , so from considering the sensible effects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the imperceptible causes and insensible parts contained in them . Here Descartes was pursuing what he calls the search after truth by means of the light of nature . This , he declares , without the assistance of religion or philosophy penetrates into the secrets of the most curious of the sciences . ? 34 . Anatomy and Machinery The science here considered is anatomy . By the study of this Descartes would prove that man is an automaton . As this science was then in its infancy , and as the microscope was not yet in general use , many of the views put forward sound more medieval than modern . Descartes had just been describing the circulation of the blood and the functions of the heart . To the question : " What is the principle of all these functions ? " he answers : We know that all these movements of the muscles as also all the senses depend on the nerves , which resemble small filaments or little tubes , which all proceed from the brain ; and thus contain like it a certain very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this , at first sight , might seem a forecast of a modern engine run by compressed air . It is really nothing but the revival of the medieval and even ancient belief that the animating principle of man is a subtle form of warm air . We still have an echo of this ancient idea when we say that people are " full of animal spirits . " But the old view had also a touch of alchemy in it . Just as spirits were distilled in a retort , so here the heart , perhaps because of its shape , also became an alchemical retort . As Descartes describes it : O So long as we live there is a continual heat in our heart , which is a species of fire which the blood of the veins there 191 // maintains , and this fire is the corporeal principle of all the movements of our members . But the process of distillation is not yet complete . Besides the heated retort there must be a cooling chamber . This is the function of the brain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phrase , " Keep your head cool . " This , then , according to Descartes , explains how the animal spirits are finally produced in the brain . All the most animated and subtle portions of the blood , which the heat has rarefied in the heart , enter ceaselessly in large quantities into the cavities of the brain . And because there are only very narrow passages there , those of its parts which are the most agitated and the most subtle alone pass through , while the rest spreads abroad in all other portions of the body . . . . Now what are here named spirits are nothing but material bodies and their one peculiarity is that they are bodies of extreme minuteness and that they move very quickly like the particles of the flame which issues from the torch . All this argument may appear fantastic after the lapse of three hundred years . But so may the view that some hold nowadays that life is electricity and man an electrical machine ? after the lapse of an equal period of time . Descartes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a machine run by that which is very subtle matter , but still matter . From this it follows that all the bodily members may be moved by the objects of the senses and by the animal spirits without the aid of the soul . For example , the machine of our body has pores . When these // are opened by heat as the stimulus , they affect the animal spirits , which in turn affect the nerves and muscles . Here is a small boy kneeling by a fire . Particles of the flames open his pores , these convey the message of heat by the nerves to his brain , these affect the animal spirits , the animal spirits affect the muscles , and these finally cause the boy 's foot to be withdrawn from the vicinity of the flame . So much for reflex action , where the movements of the body are more or less unconscious and involuntary . Descartes here gets rid of the so-called sensitive soul . In // this way he explains all the movements which we make without our will contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , eat , and in fact perform all those actions which are common to us and to the brutes . These only depend on the conformation of our members , and on the course which the spirits , excited by the heat of the heart , followed naturally in the brain , nerves , and muscles , just as the movements of a watch are produced simply by the strength of the springs and the form of the wheels . But so far and no farther . Descartes got rid of the so-called sensitive soul , he did not dare discard the rational soul . Hence he goes on to say that while we can explain mechanically all the functions which pertain to the body alone , yet we ought to attribute to our soul our thoughts . Here is a distinction . Is there really any actual difference from what went before ? The soul is still dependent on the machinery of the body . Thus when we see the light of a torch and hear the sound of a bell , this sound and this light are actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different movements in certain of our nerves , and by these means in the brain , give two different sensations to the soul . These sensations we relate to the subjects which we suppose to be their causes in such a way that we think we see the torch itself and hear the bell , and do not perceive that our sensations are due to the movements which proceed from them . In this passage Descartes , perhaps purposely , makes a very poor defense in behalf of the rational soul . He practically says that it really does not know , but that it only supposes or thinks that outside objects like a torch or a // bell exist . In other of his works he gets over this by saying that : " Since God has been so good as to give us a soul , He would not allow our senses to deceive us . " But here in his treatise on man as a machine Descartes really turns the soul into a part of the bodily machine . He is indeed hard put to it to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious cases , as where a soldier with an amputated leg still felt pains in his lost foot . From this he argued that the seat of the soul is in the brain , but in what part is the problem . The brain is built in two halves ; if both were affected we ought to see two roses when we look at one , feel two bullets when we touch one . This is a puzzle . To solve it we are forced to conclude that the seat of the soul is single . Now in the brain there is a curious part which has no counter-part ? a small gland called the pineal gland . This , he concludes , is the part in which the soul exercises its functions more particularly than in other parts . This of course is wrong . There is a gland called the pineal gland , but it is what is known as a vestigial remnant ? a discarded organ which once had a use , per-haps as a reptilian eye in the top of the head . However , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function for this gland . As the seat of the soul it is the location of " common sense . " As we might say in these days of the telephone , it is " central " to which all messages go to be relayed elsewhere . As Descartes represents it in his diagrams this little pear-shaped gland has various movements caused by the stimuli from outside , the meanings of which are interpreted by the soul . Furthermore the gland inclines first one way and then another and directs the animal spirits to different // parts of the brain through various pipes , just as currents of air are distributed in a pipe organ . Why does Descartes drag in the soul in this scheme of his ? It is in order to be on the safe side , for the Church demanded that the rational soul should be preserved . But like his pineal gland , Descartes ' opinions seemed to turn first one way and then another . At one time he argues that this machine of his imitates so perfectly the human being as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute . But naturally Descartes knew that the Church would accept no such substitute . So he sets to arguing on the other side . He explains that we can easily understand a machine 's being so constituted that it can utter words . For instance , if it is touched in a particular part , it may ask what we wish to say to it ; if in another part , it may exclaim that it is being hurt . But , he adds , while reason is a universal instrument which can serve for all contingencies , these organs have need of some special adaptation for every particular action . From this it follows that it is morally impossible that there should be sufficient diversity in any machine to allow it to act in all the events of life in the same varied way that our reason causes it to act . By all this , Descartes goes on to say , we may recognize the difference that exists between men and brutes . It is not the want of organs that brings this to pass , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words just like ourselves , and yet they can not speak as we do , that is , so as to give evidence that they think of what they say . . . . The fact that they do some things better than we do , does not prove that they are endowed with minds . It rather shows that they have no reason // at all , and that it is nature which acts in them according to the dispositions of their organs , just as a clock , which is only composed of wheels and weights , is able to tell the hours and measure the time more correctly than we can do with all our reason . ? 35 . Man a Machine with Feelings Descartes left behind him two views , each of which had two sides . One concerned the world as a machine , the other man as a machine . In his world made up of vortices , or whirlpools of matter , he set out to explain the movements of the parts of the universe . The planets move about the sun as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comets , and other heavenly bodies . All this he called a description of a new world and of the qualities of matter of which it is composed . The laws of this new world , he added , furnished a better explanation than the laws of cycles and epicycles put forward by Ptolemy . But before he published this Treatise on the World he learned with dismay of the punishment of Galileo for propounding a system contrary to that of Ptolemy . Descartes is astonished . He writes to a friend : I could hardly have believed that an Italian , and in favor with the Pope , as I hear , could be considered criminal for nothing else than for seeking to establish the earth 's motion . ... I confess that if the opinion of the earth 's movement is false all the foundations of my philosophy are so also , because it is demonstrated clearly by them . It is so bound up with every part of my treatise that I could not sever it without making the remainder faulty ; and although I consider all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would not for all the world sustain them against the authority of the Church . 198 // Descartes need not have worried . His world machine whose motive power was vortices did not last long . It was almost at once superseded by Newton 's discovery of the law of gravitation . Part of it was later salvaged from the scrap heap when the nebular hypothesis of another Frenchman , Laplace , came in . Whirling clouds of star dust out of which suns were formed did serve to explain some things in the universe , and so the vortex ring was partially revived . But Descartes ' other pet scheme fared better . The notion of man as a machine had a great vogue and it is still held by many . Descartes hardly dared put it on the market stripped of its accessories , but others did . By keeping the guiding reason and the immortal soul he thought to disguise the horrid machinery within . His more thoroughgoing successors had no use for these appendages . For a time the notion of a body machine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . Descartes said that reflex action could be explained without the intervention of the soul . When a friend pokes a finger at my eye , just for fun , the eye closes quicker than I can think , for really I do not think . Now apply this to the brutes , without any souls , and monstrous conclusions can be drawn . Dogs , for example , are mere automata . So when a certain Cartesian , or follower of Descartes , was upbraided by a friend for kicking a poor hound he replied that his treatment of the dog did not matter , as brutes have no feelings . So a correction was made . No society for the prevention of cruelty to animals was responsible for this , but only those who thought that the Cartesians were not // thorough enough . If animals are machines , why not men ? But men feel , retorted those who believed in the sensitive soul . Well , then , make matter feel , countered the materialist , and you get rid of the sensitive soul ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who put animal and human in two separate and different kingdoms did not like this . They were sticklers for class distinctions . But there are no such distinctions , argued the radicals . A dog howls for the same reason that an unthinking infant howls . It is because it is hurt . Each has a similar nervous system , and nerves are made of matter , and matter is sensitive . You are reasoning in a circle , replied the high and mighty believers in spiritual substance . No , replied the materialist , we have very good authority for our statement . The ancients put a kind of feeling of affinity into the atom . A great modern philosopher , John Locke of England , has gone so far as to say that , for all he knew , God might have endowed matter with thought . Now if matter can think , much more can it feel , for feeling is a lower form of thinking , just as thinking is a higher form of feeling . All this explains the next step taken in the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponds to that part of the play already mentioned where the author was obliged to put feeling into his mechanical characters , lest they should smash their fingers and other parts of their anatomy . In Act I they have no feelings ; in Act II the concern which manufactures these automatic workmen finds that it pays to furnish them with a nervous system . Now the natural philosophers of the eighteenth century // did the same thing . They declared that living creatures are not mere machines , but sensitive machines . Their motto was : " From Polyp to Prince all is but Pain and Pleasure . " ? 36 . Man a Sensitive Machine Descartes had made much of the soul . He said it was more easily known than the body . It might be confined to the brain , but it ruled the brain as a king ruled his kingdom . The materialist said that such a ruler was a do-nothing king , an empty husk , a mere name , a ghost of a pious idea . The body as a living machine had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of horologity or clock-ness to make it go . It goes because it is built of material parts and is wound up . In the case of the animal machine there is no winding up of weights or springs because its matter is alive and contains its own principle of motion . Of course it may stop never to go again , but this is only because of some very bad injury or entire breakage . But in slight injuries the living machine may repair itself . A cut finger , left to the healing powers of nature , heals itself . In lower organisms this goes further . A starfish is torn apart , it does not die , but each ray or limb forms a new starfish . But further , the wonders of nature are great because matter is wonderful . Its powers seem miraculous , if you want to keep that old-fashioned word . At any rate it is astonishing what matter can do . The seed sprouts and turns into a plant , bears new seeds , and these in turn new plants . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious . Then through the chrysalis it emerges a butterfly . This in turn lays eggs which hatch 202 // into caterpillars which go through the old process , and thus the immortal cycle keeps on . The materialists were accused of turning their gaze downward towards the earth , of being mere stupid clods like the matter of which they made so much . But just as the worm will turn , so did they . They retorted : You worshipers of abstract spirit and empty principles lift your eyes so high that you do not see the wonders ' at your feet . Material nature , which you despise , is a constant miracle ? if you care to use that word . It is a storehouse of bright treasures more valuable than your mosscovered traditions . This was a strange state of affairs . The despised materialists turned out to be a band of worshipers and furnished the very creed for the coming religion of nature . So the study of the natural sciences on the part of the materialists and so-called atheists led to a new cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Jean Jacques Rousseau to a sentimentalist like the author of The Swiss Family Robinson . This is the first chapter in that curious romance which might be called " Mother Nature , the Kindly Nurse of All . " We have not yet reached the end of this romance . Much is still written that makes nature bountiful , beneficent , ever faithful to the interests of man . The modern scientist , however , has a great deal to say to the contrary . From the Arctic to the Tropics he could give the sentimentalist much to think about ? cold and frost , cyclones and tornadoes , mosquitoes and malaria , rats and bubonic plague , all these read more like a Newgate calendar of crimes than a list of Christmas presents to Mother Nature 's favorite child ? Man . 2 04 FROM MYTH TO REASON But to go back to the people who started this sort of romance and fiction . They began as cynics and not as sentimentalists . The foundation of their belief was that all that exists may be traced back to matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomas Hobbes , for example , declares that all sensations could be explained by " the perpetual propagation of pressures . " By this neat phrase he meant that pressures , or waves of air , light , and so forth , made vibrations on the nerves and these in turn were carried to the brain . When the brain vibrated , sensations arose , and out of these came sense impressions or ideas . For example , when through various channels of sense I receive a perception of redness , roundness , sweetness , and so on , I obtain the idea of an apple . This explanation perhaps impressed the brain of Hobbes more than it does ours . As a description it may pass ; as an explanation it leaves a great deal to the imagination . It is like asking us to believe that a certain " spirit photograph " was developed in a dark room and at the same time not allowing us to enter the dark room to see what tricks are played . But in spite of all this the English vibration-sensation theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France and the French fell on it and thought it was the finest tidbit in the world . They next tried it with new sauces of their own mixing and gave such a relish to it that the public seemed never to have enough . We could give a long list of the new chefs ? La Mettrie and Holbach , Diderot and Condorcet , Helvetius and Cabanis , and many others . It is interesting to know that Thomas Jefferson when Minister to France tasted of their viands and was quite taken with // them . After meeting the last two of the men on this list he declared : " I am a materialist , I am a sensationalist " ? though later he changed his opinions and seemed to prefer the home cooking of the common-sense school . ? 37 . Man a Self-Regulating Machine Descartes , we recall , had written a book entitled Man and left the reader to infer that man was nothing but a machine . This was quite logical , because the soul , as described in this work , seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house ; open up the shutters from outside and there is nothing but a blank wall . Descartes indeed tried to keep the soul by giving it the job of moving the pineal gland , that little trapdoor in the attic of the brain . But this , argued the materialist , really leaves the body a soulless machine . If the body contains its own motions , or is supplied with them from outside bodies , then matter plus motion will explain the whole thing . It is like the steam engine of a later day . The speed of Watts ' machine was controlled by a boy who pulled a string . The boy was clever enough to discover that if the string were tied to a certain part of the mechanism , the engine would regulate itself . So with the body-machine . It regulates itself by its own mechanism . It was the Frenchman La Mettrie who brought this out clearly . Man , he explained , is so complicated that it is impossible to get a clear idea of the machine beforehand , and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human body is a machine which winds its own springs . It is the living image of perpetual motion . Let us now go into some detail concerning these springs of the human machine . All the vital , animal , natural , and X06 // automatic motions are carried on by their action . Is it not in a purely mechanical way that the body shrinks back when it is struck with terror at the sight of an unforeseen precipice , that the eyelids are lowered at the menace of a blow , as some have remarked , and that the pupil dilates to see objects in darkness ? Is it not by mechanical means that the pores of the skin close in winter so that the cold can not penetrate to the interior of the blood vessels , and the stomach vomits when it is irritated by poison , by a certain quantity of opium , and by all emetics ? That the heart , the arteries , and the muscles contract in sleep as well as in waking hours , that the lungs serve as bellows continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly than any other muscle ? But beside these little subordinate forces , well-known to all , there is another more subtle and marvelous force which animates them all ; it is the source of all our feelings , of all our pleasures , of all our passions , and of all our thoughts , for the brain has its muscles for thinking , as the legs have muscles for walking . Look at the portrait of the famous Alexander Pope who is , to say the least , the Voltaire of the English . The effort , the energy of his genius are imprinted upon his countenance . It is convulsed . His eyes protrude from their sockets , the eyebrows are raised with the muscles of the forehead . Why ? Because the brain is in travail and all the body must share in such a laborious deliverance . If there were not an internal cord which pulled the external ones , whence would come all these phenomena ? Is more needed to prove that man is but an animal , or a collection of springs which wind each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to tell at what point in the human circle nature has begun ? If these springs differ among themselves , these differences consist only in their positions and in their degrees of strength , and never in their nature ; wherefore the soul is but a principle of motion or a material and sensible part of the brain , which can be regarded , without fear of error , as the mainspring of the whole machine , having a visible influence on all the parts . La Mettrie proceeds to demonstrate that the human body is like a watch , a large watch constructed with such skill and ingenuity that if the wheel which marks the seconds happens to stop , the minute wheel turns and keeps on going its round , and in the same way the quarterhour wheel and all the others go on running when the first wheels have stopped , because rusty or , for any reason , out of order . Is it not for a similar reason that the stoppage of a few blood vessels is not enough to destroy or suspend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mainspring of the machine ; since , on the contrary , the fluids whose volume is diminished , having a shorter road to travel , cover the ground more quickly , borne on as by a fresh current which the energy of the heart increases in proportion to the resistance it encounters at the ends of the blood vessels ? The French materialist has proved , at least to his own satisfaction , how wonderful a machine is man . It goes by itself , shifts gears by itself , and now he can show that even the parts run by themselves . To prove this he must descend to animals . Since they are machines the proof holds good . So he adds that the flesh of animals , such as tortoises , lizards , and serpents , palpitates after // death ; that a frog 's heart moves for an hour or more after it has been cut from the body , and that a rooster with its head cut off runs about for a time . The critics might retort that this merely proves that animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Descartes really left animals without souls or sensations . The out-and-out materialist must then put man and animal in the same class . He does so when he declares that there is but one type of organization in the universe , and that man is merely the most perfect example of this type . He is to the ape and the most intelligent animals as a fine watch is to a pendulum clock .. If you object that animals , for the most part , are stupid automata run by blind instinct , savage beasts incapable of realizing the evil that they do , turn and consider men . For truly , up to a certain age , he is more of an animal than they , since at birth he has less instinct . What animal would die of hunger in the midst of a river of milk ? I will grant , says La Mettrie , that animals , even the best of them , do not know the difference between moral good and evil . But there is ferocity in our species as well as in theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one could find among lions , tigers , and bears put together . For our compatriots fight , Swiss against Swiss , brother against brother , recognize each other and yet capture and kill each other without remorse , because a prince pays for the murder . La 1Vlettrie is certainly a clever debater , for he hits right home . He writes from Geneva , famous for its watches , from Switzerland which furnished mercenaries to the French King , and uses these two facts to prove that animals are machines as well as men , and men beasts // as well as animals . As he puts it : Man is not molded from a costlier clay ; nature has used but one dough , and has merely varied the leaven . This language was at once seized upon by his adversaries . The anti-materialists said that this talk about our common clay turns the soul not merely into a soul of clay , but a soul of dirt . Materialism is a dirt philosophy , degrading to man , abhorrent to higher reason . This , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought forward nowadays by the anti-evolutionists . They can see no connection between monkey and man , or rather between these two creatures and a common " missing link . " They say it is insulting to the intelligence to reason that they come from the same stock , that it is monstrous even to suppose that there was a remote primate , the common ancestor of a Shakespeare and a specimen in the zoo . La Mettrie , the first and boldest of the modern materialists , certainly raised a disturbance , but he was defended by his patron , the sarcastic Frederick the Great . As a physician in France he had been appointed surgeon of the guards ; he had also published his book , Man a Machine , in Holland . With these two facts in mind the Prussian monarch made the following remarks in his eulogy of La Mettrie : The author underwent a frightful persecution and the priests claimed that a doctor accused of heresy could not cure the French Guards . . . . So La Mettrie , after losing sight of his hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy and wrote his Man a Maclaine . This work , which was bound to displease men who by their position are declared enemies of the progress of human reason , // roused all the priests of Leyden against its author . Calvinists , Catholics , and Lutherans forgot for the time that consubstantiation , free will , masses for the dead , and the infallibility of the Pope divided them : they all united again to persecute the philosopher who had the additional misfortune of being French , at a time when that monarchy was waging a successful war against their High Powers . ? 38 . The System of Nature La Mettrie had a lively defender in Frederick the Great . But in spite of the royal patron society generally turned against the author . Even before his death his enemies were upon him . The last straw was his writing a book entitled The Natural History of the Soul . Imagine , they exclaimed , the natural history of a supernatural object ! The very chaplain of the regiment of which La Mettrie was physician sounded the tocsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to say : The common ecclesiastic is like Don Quixote , who found marvelous adventures in commonplace events , or like the famous soldier , so engrossed with his system that he found columns in all the books he read . The majority of priests examine all works of literature as if they were treatises on theology , and filled with this one aim , they discover heresies everywhere . To this fact are due very many false judgments and very many accusations , for the most part unfair , against the authors . A book of physics should be read in the spirit of a physicist ; nature , the truth , is its sole judge , and should be read in the same manner . If a poor physician proves that the blow of a stick smartly rapped on the skull disturbs the mind , or that at a certain degree of heat reason wanders , one must either prove the contrary or keep quiet . If a skilful astronomer proves , in spite of Joshua , that the earth and all the celestial globes revolve around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or admit that the earth revolves . 2I2 // Yet even the free-thinking Frederick could not follow La Mettrie 's followers . One of these was Holbach . Born in Germany , educated in France , this wealthy baron became the center of the new school , a school so radical that it became a scandal . Even the cynical Voltaire could not stand it . Out-and-out materialism , he declared , led to atheism , and atheism , he added , is the most narrow view held by the reason . It is as ridiculous to say that the arrangement of the world does not prove a supreme artisan as to say that a watch does not prove a watchmaker . This sort of reasoning appears rather strange in the mouth of Voltaire , the skeptic . Yet while popularly believed to be an atheist , Voltaire had a place for a God in his system , just as he had a place for a chapel on his country estate . This God was an artisan , indeed , but not an all-powerful artisan . Just as a workman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter itself . Now extreme materialists did not stop with this halfand-half view . They boldly said : " Leave out God , the do-nothing King of Heaven . Leave everything to matter because matter can do everything . It crystallizes in the mineral , is sensitive in the plant , feels in the animal , and reasons in man . Why it does this nobody knows . It does it , that is enough . " Such indeed is the message of the System of Nature , which made as much of a sensation in the eighteenth century as Darwin 's Origin of Species in the nineteenth . Holbach did not dare to publish this book under his own name . His other books had been burned by the public hangman , and those who peddled them were put in the 2 14 FROM MYTH TO REASON pillory , scourged , branded , condemned to the galleys . The book therefore was fathered upon Mirabeau , the perpetual secretary of the French Academy , and printed by express order of the King . This authorship was pure fiction , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will or testament of belief for the benefit of posterity . By getting another to be his press agent , Holbach succeeded in publishing his own system . And what a system it was ! This " Bible of Scientific Materialism , " as it was called , declared for the self-existence of matter and for the possibility of deriving everything from matter . From matter in motion come all the events that strike our senses . All is matter or a function of it . Matter itself is not an effect , but a cause . It is not caused , but is its own cause , for it is from eternity and of necessity . It therefore needs no creator . Matter being eternal and necessary and the cause of all things , nothing therefore is outside the laws of physics and chemistry . Minerals , plants , animals , men ? all are results of matter and motion . If man affirms that he has free will and an immortal soul apart from his machine , that is idle talk . Still more idle is it to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology , or poetry about God , as Petrarch said , is ignorance of natural causes reduced to a system . Such is the System of Nature which went through some thirty editions in Europe and America . It was famous because it was counted infamous . It came out in 1770 , just before the revolutionary period in the two continents . It was the first rumble of the storm which cleared the air for some and brought ruin to others . To say // the least , the book was radical . If men believe in ideal powers , in imaginary intelligences , says the author , let them now get rid of them . They make nature capricious , unexplicable , useless for the happiness of man . The chief cause of man 's misery , of his lack of well-being , is his ignorance of the powers and possibilities of his own nature and of universal nature . Instead of calling upon supernatural powers , his best plan is to find out his place in nature and adjust himself to it . If ignorance of nature gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy them and the evil resulting from belief in them . In a word , truth , that is , correct ideas of nature , is the one thing needful to the happiness and wellbeing of man . We can easily imagine what a stir was raised by this so-called " Bible of Materialism . " Holbach himself was a delightful personality and his house a kind of philosophical inn for people with new ideas . But we fancy he must have been a social porcupine to others , for the darts he threw off punctured the skins of many . The conservative clergy , the moderate philosophers , the respectable members of society considered him a pest . Cries of irritation and pain arose . Many said that the System of Nature undermined both Church and State , in a word , that it was nothing but atheism " accommodated to chambermaids and hairdressers . " It is likely that Holbach 's attacks did partially under. , mine the Church . He was in the van of those natural philosophers who did all they could to prove that religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Holbach went too fat , yet even he himself suggested that " if there were no God , it would be necessary // that we invent one . " To Voltaire religion was a useful fiction , a kind of moral police to keep the common people in order . Beside such a fashionable skeptic as this there was the vulgar skeptic like Thomas Paine , author of the Age of Reason . The latter declared that religion was not only a fiction but a fraud , a scheme concocted by the priests , " for pence and power . " The System of Nature and its countless imitations certainly did much to undermine the Church . Instead of the worship of supernatural powers there came the worship of natural forces . In the minds of the revolutionaries the Bible , the Holy Book , was supplanted by the Book of Nature . There were to be no more miracles , no more divine interferences , but all was to be explained in terms of iron necessity . Such was the message of the so-called " Age of Reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by the " Altar of Reason " and the " Goddess of Reason . " What went on in Paris in the days of the Terror was reflected even across the Atlantic . A Jacobean society was started in Virginia ; a festival of reason was held in Philadelphia . In New York a popular picture represented the Book of Saints and the Ten Commandments as being dashed to the ground from the Altar of Truth and Justice . The system of nature as set forth by Holbach and his disciples tended to undermine the Church . Did it undermine society , as was also charged ? It certainly did , from the conservative point of view . The aristocrats who looked down upon chambermaids and hairdressers must have read with dismay a passage like this : " As // government only derives its powers from society , and is established only for its good , it is evident that society may revoke this power when its interests demand , may change the form of government , extend or limit the power entrusted to its leaders , over whom it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature that subordinates the part to the whole . " All this has a familiar ring . Written in 1770 it is almost the language of the Declaration of Independence which announces that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed . But this is going too far afield . The System . of Nature runs off into human nature , but it is the world more as a mere machine than as a political machine that we are now considering . Here the System , as it was simply called , brought about a strong revolt among the more moderate thinkers . To derive everything from matter , to say that matter plus motion explained even the process of thinking , to make man nothing but a machine , outraged some and did not convince others . God , freedom , immortality , the soul , goodness , beauty ? a whole set of ideas would be swept away by this scheme . And beside these matters of sentiment there were questions of science which men could not square with the System of Nature . Granted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why is there order in the universe , why laws according to which matter and motion act ? These were the questions which materialism did not explain , these were the questions that brought about the real revolt against materialism. ? 39 . The Revolt against Materialism Man a Machine and The System of Nature were the two most famous books of the eighteenth century to present the materialistic view of the world . They attempted a revolution in thought , in turn they met with a counter-revolution . Here there were two classes of critics . There were the supernaturalists who wished to preserve matters of sentiment , such as the belief in Deity , freedom and immortality . There were also the naturalists who wished an answer to matters of science . Man may be a machine , but does that explain him as a thinking being ? The world may be a mechanical system , but does that solve its law and order ? It is of course not possible to keep these two classes perfectly distinct . Sentiment and science , faith and reason , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work the other may sometimes take up its function . Science and reason , then , began to make such objections as these : When you compare men to mechanical toys you are going back to the nursery . In Paris there may be a figure in a grotto that tells his beads like a monk ; in Venice there may be a clock where two giants strike the hours with their hammers . These things are interesting to observe , but they do not explain . Man is more than a manikin , just as an animal is more than an automaton . If you reply that man is a thinking machine , and an animal a machine that feels , what do you 218 // mean by thinking and feeling ? You say that as a violin string vibrates and gives forth sound , so the brain fibers are stimulated to render or repeat the words that strike them . You also say that judgment , reason , and memory are merely modifications of the brain screen upon which images and objects painted on the eye , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply that these are mere long words of description , for description is valuable . The brain fibers do vibrate , or at least have some sort of motion ; the eye is somewhat like the lens of a magic lantern and obeys the laws of refraction . But is description the same as explanation ? The violin string vibrates , but does it feel ? The brain screen , in a way , " reflects , " but is this mental reflection ? In short the mystery of matter raises the further mystery of feeling and thought . For all your clever comparisons you have not reached the final answer . Put in a more modern way , these materialists have employed mechanics , but they have left out psychology . They talk of lines of force ; they say that where those from outside the body cross those from inside of the brain there arises consciousness . Now it has taken a bong time to invent a machine which can tie a knot , but no farmer would say that his self-binder is conscious of tying a knot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the forms and functions of the animal machine , the human machine , and the world machine . Yet they did little to explain how those forms , or molds , or models , or plans , or structures got inside matter . This is the real mystery of matter , perhaps never to
