The Cardboard Lover . A public which votes a straight ticket because its father did , a public which sang " Yes , We Have No Bananas , " which litters the countryside with picnic debris , has taken to Marion Davies . She appeared in Manhattan last week in something about a man who , wanting to make his sweetheart jealous , employed a cardboard lover . The cinema reverses the plot of Her Cardboard Lover ( Jeanne Eagels ) . <P> The Air Circus . Two significant features of this piece : it is aeronautical but has nothing to do with the 1914-18 shellfire ; its cast includes Louise Dresser , who was in two Manhattan cinema openings last week ( see A Ship Comes In . ) Miss Dresser may be depended upon when she assumes a mother role . She looks not unlike Irene Rich and shares with her the distinction of most able protagonist of domesticity among cinemactresses . As the mother of Buddy Blake , aviator-aspirant , Louise Dresser is properly maternal when her son fails to pass a test , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A Ship Comes In . A Serbian student in Sarajevo , Yugoslavia , fired a pistol 14 years ago . Nearly everything that has been produced in letters since then has re-echoed the barking of that pistol . So too has nearly everything in the cinema . No exception is this story of an immigrant who , unjustly imprisoned , is released only to find that his son has been overwhelmed in the big noise of 1914-18 . Rudolph Schildkraut is languid as the immigrant . This is one of two pictures in which able Louise Dresser gives simultaneous , current Manhattan performances . <P> The Water Hole . As every cinemaddict knows , one of the sure-fire plots is the one about the vivacious , vampy heiress who is kidnaped by either a cowboy or an engineer who wants to tame the shrew . This time it ( Jack Holt ) is an engineer , though neither rod , bob nor transit appears in the Arizona locale . He abducts Judith ( Nancy Carroll ) because she won a bet with her cronies that she could make Engineer Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the losing cronies who at the proper moment expose themselves , causing prodigious embarrassment to the engineer . The abduction , done in a spirit of fun and platonically , comes close to Serious Consequences when a half-breed steals both abductor 's and abductee 's horses in the desert . Thanks to Judith 's habit of daily ablution , the water supply at that juncture amounts to half-a-canteen-full . When abductor , abductee and a young would-be rescuer reach the nearest water-hole , following a 20-mile drag over the hot sands , they find the water-hole has gone dry . <P> Action thenceforth is rapid , confusingly quick compared with the lagging up to that time . The director seemed as willing as the audience to call a halt . The cinema has been adapted from Zane Grey 's piece identically named .
