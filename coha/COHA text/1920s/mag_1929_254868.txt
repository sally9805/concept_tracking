Brief , pithy , non-controversial was the annual report of Attorney-General William DeWitt Mitchell . Like his predecessors , he requested special legislation from Congress which would permit a husband and wife to testify for ( and against ) each other in criminal cases ; a grand jury to sit after the end of the court term ; a consolidation to be made of all U. S. legal activities within the Department of Justice . For himself he asked little-removal by Congress of the present restriction which prohibits the Department from employing as a special assistant any lawyer who in his private practice is prosecuting a case against the U. S. <P> " General " Mitchell marshaled battalions of statistics to show how U. S. court business has increased , cited the case of Judge Joseph West Molyneaux of Minneapolis who ' ' has broken down from overwork and is unable to return to the bench . " On June 30 there were 149,033 cases , civil and criminal , pending in U. S. courts . <P> Anti-trust cases were summarily reviewed : The year began with 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. won 11 out of 13 completed . <P> Like an echo from the past came the account by Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt. retired Assistant Attorney-General , of the prosecution of Prohibition cases . With patent pride she gave the year 's figures : 56,786 new cases started , 56,455 finished ; 47,100 convictions . 1,477 acquittals ; 21,602 jail sentences aggregating 8,663 years ; $4,200,052 in fines collected . Mrs. Willebrandt insisted that ' ' contrary to the general belief , considerable success was obtained " in her prosecution of New York night clubs ( TIME . Aug. 13 , 1928 ) . Of 98 defendants , 80 pleaded guilty , 15 were convicted on trial " while only three were acquitted-a doorman and two women entertainers " ( Mary Louise " Texas " Guinan and Helen Morgan ) . <P> Spirited was the report of Superintendent of Prisons Sanford Bates who called for the " professionalization of prison management . " In ironic statistics he suggested his difficulties : " 8,563 parole cases came before the parole board , of which the Superintendent of Prisons was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have to hear 28 cases a day . This is one of his sparetime diversions . " And again : " One of these officers had 1,738 probation cases in his charge . If he visits them once a month , he will have to visit almost 60 a day , seven days a week . "
