The only official voice to utter words relative to the Premiers ' Conference in London , which was scheduled to commence on July 16 and which aimed to settle the details of putting the Experts ' Report into operation , came from Chancellor Marx . <P> In a Berlin speech , he said : " It is far from my intention to express an opinion already regarding the London Conference , an invitation to which has not been extended to us yet. * But I am obliged to state that , owing to the agreements made between the Premiers of England and France , many of the hopes pinned on the London Conference seem to be seriously menaced . <P> " Were the spirit in which Germany understands the report really alive , it would be self-evident to the victorious Nations that Germany , whose economic and National existence are at stake , must finally be admitted to the negotiations as a partner with equal rights . Otherwise , how can the German people make new sacrifices if they feel that once more , as in the fateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated to them by the victorious wielders of power . <P> " . . . The condition which the German Government attaches to the carrying out of the Experts ' Report is simply and solely the following : <P> " ' The Experts ' Report must be honestly accepted and executed by all concerned according to its content and spirit . ' " <P> The main object of the Experts ' Plan , as contained in their reports , is to substitute business methods for military methods in collecting payments of reparations from Germany-virtually a modification of the Versailles Treaty . <P> Germany , as soon as the Experts ' Plan has started to function , is to be treated more as a business partner of the Allies and Associated Powers than as an ex-enemy State , from which payments have to be forced . There will be control of German finance , of German commerce , of German industry ; but none of these can possibly succeed unless German goodwill is shown . Moreover , Germany will have a distinct interest in cooperating with the Allies and their friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to increase her prosperity , which in turn may go far to stabilize the Republic by calming the agitated waters of domestic politics . <P> In this sense , then , she is to become a business associate of the Allies and Associated Powers in operating the Experts ' Plan for the common good of the Nations of the earth . <P> <P> *It is expected that Germany will be invited to attend the Conference after many perplexing details have been settled by the other representatives , i.e. , those from Britain , France , Italy , Japan , the U. S. , Belgium , Greece , Czecho-Slovakia , Yugo-Slavia , Rumania , Portugal .
