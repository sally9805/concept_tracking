Mercury First <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of May 14 under Aeronautics we note comment regarding the North German Lloyd Air Cruise characterizing it as the first Air Cruise in history . <P> This is incorrect . So far as we have been able to learn , - and we have gone into it quite thoroughly-the first Air Cruise is the one scheduled by this organization , press announcements of which were made some three weeks prior to those concerning the Lloyd tour . Our Air Tour operates some two months in advance of the Lloyd trip and I can not see how the North German Lloyd can conscientiously advertise their tour as being the first . . . . <P> <P> MERCURY TOURS <P> New York City <P> TIME stands corrected . The Mercury Air Tour begins on July 14 when passengers sail from Manhattan on the S. S. Tuscania . At London they will take plane for Amsterdam , Brussels , Cologne , Frankfort , Nuremberg , Munich , Zurich , Lucerne , Geneva , Paris-finally sailing for the U. S. on Aug. 25 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Questing Cook <P> Sirs : <P> I am very much interested in the book which was written by Mrs. Ruth A.
