txt President Harding defined his attitude on national defense this afternoon to the 1921 graduating class of the Naval Academy . At the outset of an impromptu speech he repudiated the accusations that preparation for defense is brutal and material by saying that no nobler task could come to any man than that of defending his country . " That is an inherent thing in men , planted in the human breast by God Almighty in his bequest of human attributes , and there would not be any civilization today if men were not willing to give their all for the preservation and life of the country , ' ' ' said the President . This note , sounded here in the country 's great training school for naval officers , and following a declaration by Rear Admiral A. H. Scales , commandant of the Academy , that " an adequate navy is a wise and economical form of national defense , " was loudly applauded . In expressing the hone that the class before him would " never be called upon to draw a sword or fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not mean by that that ours is to be the craven republic . I want an America unafraid . I want you to help make a republic of conscience , a republic of sympathy , a republic of strength , a republic of high ideals . " The President then repeated a thought which he voiced on Decoration Day at the Arlington National Cemetery when he spoke of the necessity for preserving the ideals upon which the country 's civilization is established . Crusading for new ideals has a different aspect , he said , for sometimes this struggle is not well fpunded . He held , that between the fervor of a crusade and the insistence upon the continuance of the old order lie the highest attainments of the American republic . Had Not Expected to Speak . The President , who motored from Washington with Mrs. Harding , had not expected to speak when he arrived in Annapolis . In fact , he had no intention of doing so until after he faced the graduates of the class and handed them their diplomas , one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , he . had been so impressed with their strength and earnestness that Admiral Scale 's request for a few remarks found a ready response . " I have had a very great pleasure in handing the graduates their diplomas , " the President said . " I thought I could not permit the program to end without saying a word to the class in general and to express my own pleasure in being present on this occasion . " The Admiral and the Secretary have spoken about the graciousness of the Executive in coming here . That is ail wrong . The Executive has had not only pleasure but inspiration in ' corning here . I am more than happy to greet this addition of trained men to the ranks of American defense . " A good deal is said nowadays about the materialization and the brutality of preparing for defense . I say to you young men of the graduating class and to the midshipmen to follow you , I know of nothing nobler in this world than the defense of one 's own country . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast by God Almighty ? in his bequest of human attributes , and there would not be any civilization today if men were not willing- to give their all for the preservation and life of the country . " I think there is a marked distinction between some of the basic inclinations of life . Preservation of the established order is one thing and it is highly essential . We must always be ready to preserve and to maintain the things upon which our civilization rests . Crusading for a new order is quite another thing . Sometimes it is most nobly inspired ; sometimes ill-advised , but I think the highest attainments in our republic lie in a successful blend of an established order and the enthusiasm of a crusade . I believe there Is a national blend of these two . " You meri have been educated at the hands of your Government not only to make you more proficient in warfare and defense , but better to fit you to sustain the civilization which is the ideal of the Republic . " I am glad you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope , sirs , you will never be called upon to draw a sword or to fire a gun except in expression of those comities that go with the service ; but promise you that while I am your commander you will never be called upon to fire a gun except you can do it with the consciousness that you are right to answer to God and to your country . " I do not mean by that that ours Is to be the craven republic . I want an America unafraid . I want you to help make a republic of conscience , a republic of sympathy , a republic of strength , a republic of high ideals , and the men who must lead in that attainment are the men who are made fundamentally able by the processes of education . " I was very much impressed by what the Secretary said about the men . After all , the measure of highest achievement is the measure of noblest manhood , and when I say that , I mean also noblest womanhood , because , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heroism worth preserving , never a strife for a high ideal that was not somehow inspired by the love of mother or sweetheart . " I shall not venture where the Admiral and the Secretary have gone in dealing with the feminine problem , but I warn you of one thing . You need not avoid the married state , but you will command less after you enter it than you did before . I am happy to express the congratulations of the Commander-in-Chief . I am glad you are going to the service of the Government . I know we shall keep the ship of state on its right course . " Service is the greatest thing in life . I was very much interested when the Secretary made reference to his service as an enlisted man and an officer in the Marine Corps and the Navy . That is why he is Secretary of the Navy . A man who can get all the viewpoints is the man fitted to lead , so I commend to you young gentlemen in the pursuit of your career to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he who always fights best always fights justly . " Edwin Denby , Secretary of the Navy . preceded President Harding in a speech . Secretary Denby spoke from the standpoint of both the enlisted man and the commissioned ( " officer , for he had seen war service as both . The keynote of his speech to the prospective officers was , Do you know men ? " He begged the graduates to learn what was in the heart of the enlisted man with whom they would come in contact , for otherwise no success could ever be attained by an officer . Warns of Vanity of Rank . " You must so conduct yourselves that your superiors in rank shall respect you , your equals love you , and those under your command ooey you with a smile , " he said . " That is the challenge of the navy to its commissioned  --  and enlisted personnel . Can you meet it ? If not , you still have to acquire the greatest attribute of an officer . You must be offices , but not snobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish vanity of rank . " No one knows better than I with what great respect the enlisted man looks upon- - an officer who is ' every inch a man . No one knows better . than I with what contempt the enlisted man views an officer unduly burdened with the weight of his own importance . Ah ! We need not worry about our rank . Our fitness for it will be justly appraised by those associated with us . The enlisted man will quickly size you up . He wants to like you . He wants to respect you . He quite properly feels that he is too much a man himself to want to be commanded by one lacking any essential element of manhood . If you go to the enlisted men whom , in due course , you will command , with the certain expectation of receiving all customary military deference , but never forgetting that it always becomes an of ? fiver to be friendly , kind and sympathetic , you will , I think , find him not only a first-class fighting man , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will feel something of the spiritual call that a man in our service should respond to . I hope you will fee , that exaltation of sacrifice . I trust you will see as I do in our country 's flag the spirit of the nation calling ' upon you , believing in you , trusting you . If you can feel that exaltation , your whole life will be rounded out , your careers will be happy because you are given up to duty and think in terms of pride and honor . " And when the red day comes ? if come it must  --  when in the flame of battle your souls are taken from you under the.country 's flag , you will die as gentlemen should die , honest and simple and brave , regretting nothing and glad that you have so lived as to merit so worthy a death . I do not anticipate , however . that if you live as officers should live and if the navy keeps up its ' standards of material and men you will ever be called upon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cautions Against Misdeeds . " You may flirt with danger in the line of duty as you will for the good of the service , but I beg you not to flirt with temptation not in the line of duty and not for the good of the service . I do not preach , but speak as one who knows . I have been an enlisted span in the navy , a commissioned officer in the naval militia and both an enlisted man and a commissioned Officer in the marines . " I speak not as a preacher , but as one who has been comrades with many men , intent observer of many more . The ' bereavement of the loss of a friend through battle is . as nothing compared to the bereavement of the loss of that friend 's honor , through misdeeds . You think perhaps I am too serious . You would not think so if you were compelled to sit as I do almost daily in judgment upon my fellow-men and assistants in the service . You would not think me too serious if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means dismissal or dishonorable discharge . I do not sign them as a man , but as an official , and yet the man must suffer when the official gives pain . Today it is my fondest hope that no Toof you shall ever come before me or before our Commander in Chief , the President , for the action it so pains him or me to take . " As on other graduating days , Dahlgren Hall , the official name of the great gymnasium where the ' ceremonies were held , was filled with friends and relatives of the midshipmen who were to receive their diplomas . Mothers , sisters and sweethearts were ? there . Compliments were paid to the feminine sex by each of the three speakers , the President , Secretary Denby and Admiral Scales . When the commandant said he " welcomed the sweethearts " there was great ' applause . Secretary Denby made everybody laugh when he spoke of all the sweethearts " and all the wives . " He quickly countered by saying he hoped that " not long after you receive one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high officer of the navy had advised him never to promote an officer - until he had met his wife . The President , too alluded to the ladies present . When he said that alter marriage the prospective officer would exercise less command , Mrs. Harding , seated near the platform , smiled , and the women who were with her applauded . The ceremonies were simple . With the exception of the three speeches , the remaining part of the program was the presentation of the diplomas . President Harding handed these to each of the white-uniformed graduates who filed past e the platform . Rousing cheers greeted favorite and renowned athletes such as " Eddie " Ewen , the football captain , " Lefty " Gaines , one of the pitchers , " Country " Moore of the crew , " Hal " Waters , a basketball hero , " Ed " Wilkie , a football player and " Turk " Wirth . When the President and the other distinguished visitors had walked out between the two lines of graduates and underclassmen , the graduating class broke the customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly into the air , while the youngladies clutched frantically for these trophies . In a snake dance the Class of 1921 sang in a triumphant chorus " One More River to Cross . " Almost simultaneously the plebe class dashed to the band stand on the parade ground and proclaimed their freedom from plebe restrictions , at the same time assuming their new-found privileges . The sun shone brilliantly , but the cool breeze from the Severn softened the atmosphere . Looking down the Severn , visitors could see at anchor at the mouth of the river the gray battleships waiting in Chesapeake Bay to take the midshipmen on their cruise tomorrow . Fully as picturesque was the scene inI side Dahlgren Hall . Many distinguished men were present , including members of the famous class of 1881 , of which Secretary of War Weeks , Major Gen. Barnett of the marine corps , Admiral Baron Uriu of the Japanese navy , Major Gen. Lejeune , commandent of the Marine Corps , and Admiral Henry B. Wilson of the Atlantic fleet were members . Secretary Denby alluded to the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgement of the applause which met his name . Among others on the platform were Admiral R. B. Coontz , Chief of Naval Operations ; Colonel Robert M. Thompson , Governor Albert C. Ritchie of Maryland and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt . Senators Keyes , Hale , Fernald , Nicholoson and Moses attended the exercises . The President and Mrs. Harding and those accompanying them were the guests of Admiral Scales . at luncheon . They motored back to Washington , a distance of forty-two miles , arriving at the ' White House at 4 o'clock . HOW HARDING DONS A HAT . Change From a Cap on Annapolis Road Startles Entourage . Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , ' June 2 . ? President Harding was whirling along the road to Annapolis this afternoon at a thirtyfive-mile-an-hour rate on his way to the graduating exercises at the Naval Academy . His motor car was swallowed in a cloud of dust . Suddenly , a mile from Annapolis , the car swerved sharply to the right of the road and stopped . An automobile filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great billows of dust hid the two cars from sight . ' Newspaper men in two cars behind urged on their chauffeurs convinced that some mishap had occurred . But the dust-clouds slowly rolled away and one of the secret service men was seen handing a large , brown leather hat box into the Harding . limousine . The President was exchanging his golf cap for his silk hat- before his entry Into the Naval Academy : grounds .
