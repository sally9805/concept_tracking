( See front cover ) <P> Baseball , ' ' National Pastime " ( largest commercialized sport ) , passed its mid-season mark in the Big Leagues . Familiar to " fans , " * many a fact about the 1929 season has now become visible to laymen : <P> Lively Ball . Greatest topic of discussion in baseball this year has been the " lively " or " rabbit " official ball . Experts at playing , watching and writing about the game have become convinced it is the cause of a rise of 50 points in batting averages during recent years , the cause of multifarious homeruns , of double-figure scores . <P> A. G. Spalding &; Bros. , official ball manufacturers+ maintained that the " lively " ball is a myth , that no change had been made since 1909 , when the cork centre was introduced . When the New York Telegram , crusading against the " lively " ball , last week produced cross-sections of a 1919 ball and of a 1929 ball to show that the 1929 ball contains a layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtiss , Spalding president , wrote to the Telegram : " Let me assure you that the life of the ball has not been changed since 1920 . " He left the inference , satisfying to sticklers , that it had been changed between 1919 and 1920 . <P> There is no argument but that the game has changed since " Home Run " Baker mad ? his name by knocking 12 homeruns during the season of 1913 . " Babe " Ruth knocked 60 in 1927 . Young Outfielder Klein had hit 29 this season up to last weekend . In the old days , the good aver age hitter batted about 25% perfect ( .250 in the tabulations ) . Today an average of .285 is only fair . About 116 batters in the two Big Leagues have surpassed .300 this year , with several of them up around .400. * A good average score used to be 4 runs to 3 . A few weeks ago the St. Louis Nationals in a game with the Philadelphia Nationals made 10 runs in the first inning , 10 more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimes of the Pittsburgh club says : " I used to figure on allowing two runs and winning . Now I figure on allowing four and winning . " <P> Perhaps the best indication of the change can be seen in the shift of the spotlight from pitchers to batters . Once upon a time small boys wanted to grow up and be like Pitchers Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson . Now they want to grow up and be like Hitters George Herman ( " Babe " ) Ruth or Rogers Hornsby. + <P> It is also probable that the average spectator at a ball game enjoys plenty of hitting and is bored by the old-fashioned " pitchers ' battle . " No one has ever yet booed a homerun and certainly the greatest crowd-getter in recent years has been Homerunner Ruth . The question raised against the " lively " ball seems only to be whether homeruns may not become too common . In a Brooklyn-Pittsburgh encounter lately , nine homeruns were hit in one afternoon .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
