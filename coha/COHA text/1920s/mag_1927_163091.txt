Readers of political fiction are well acquainted with the traditional figure of the Boss , especially the Boss in the field of municipal government . He is usually pictured with a red neck which hangs in folds over his collar . Across his paunchy stomach runs a heavy gold watch-chain . From his mouth protrudes a long , black stogy . By night he counts poker chips ; by day he miscounts ballots . He has become the symbol of the U. S. civic misrule which caused the late James Bryce to say that municipal government has been the outstanding failure in the U. S. political system . <P> Last week the people of Indianapolis decided that their city government represented one such " outstanding failure . " Said Meredith Nicholson , famed Hoosier novelist : " Do you know that for not one but for half a dozen years the newspapers of Indianapolis have printed almost daily stories of the degradation of public office ? . . . We have had one shameful thing after another and the end is not yet . . . . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia-a city corrupt but contented . " <P> But the people of Indianapolis were not " contented . " To the polls they went , marked 53,000 ballots for the adoption of a City Manager plan of government , marked 9,000 for the retention of the Mayor-and-Council system . Under the new plan , the city will be governed by seven commissioners , elected by popular vote . The commissioners will select a city manager and a mayor ( a member of the commission ) , but the mayor 's duties will be largely along lines of giving visiting celebrities the keys of the city . <P> The City Manager system can not take effect until Jan. 1 , 1930 , since the Indiana legislature recently amended the law dealing with changes in city government to stipulate that any change in Indianapolis could not become operative until the present group of city officials complete their elective terms . However , City Manager adherents hope to have this legislative action ( which was pushed through purely as a life-saver for the city hall officials ) declared unconstitutional . They talked also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , elected in 1925 with the support of the Ku Klux Klan , will shortly go on trial , along with the City Comptroller , his brother-in-law , for political corruption in the 1925 election . The Indianapolis election was generally interpreted as the end of " Klan rule " in Indiana , though there was very little organized opposition to the City Manager movement .
