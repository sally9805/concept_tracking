No restriction on the sale of spirits , wines or beer exists in Czechoslovakia ; * but at Prague one Michael Maresch , picturesque anti-prohibition zealot , publishes a magazine quaintly devoted to urging Czechoslovak citizens of the U. S. to foment anti-prohibitionist sentiment among their neighbors . <P> Because the renowned Pilsner beer industry of Czechoslovakia would profit hugely by a repeal of the U. S. Eighteenth Amendment , Zealot Maresch has long enjoyed complete toleration and some quiet encouragement by the shrewd burghers of Prague . Last week however public sentiment turned bitterly against him overnight , when he printed what was construed as an affront to the political idol of Czechoslovaks , famed Foreign Minister Eduard Benes . As everyone knows , Dr. Benes was the chief lieutenant of President Thomas Garrigue Masaryk in their heroic and successful struggle to create the Czechoslovak State during the World War . <P> Yet Zealot Maresch wrote of Idol Benes : " If our Foreign Minister were not an abstainer , the Czechoslovak ship of state might steer a better course . " <P> After so wanton a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave further provocation by declaring : " The efficiency of the police of Prague would be increased if each policeman took an occasional nip of spirits . " <P> Soon sober and efficient Prague police , who do not think that Dr. Benes should tipple , tope , booze , guzzle , swig or swizzle , laid heavy hands upon Michael Maresch and clapped him into a cell . <P> <P> * Except that they may not be sold on election day or the night previous .
