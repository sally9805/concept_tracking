A little licking flame , high up on the wooded slopes of Mount Tamalpais above San Francisco 's Golden Gate , one day last week , started eating through timber dried by months of drought . A strong wind whistled to its aid . Soon Mount Tamalpais ' long north and east slopes were ablaze . <P> Down in Mill Valley , rich householders and poor looked upward in common alarm . From across the bay San Franciscans could see the reddened , angry sky , the fire marching down the mountainside . Around the bay went the alarm , brought boats with firemen , U. S. Rangers , soldiers from three forts , small boys , milkmen , millionaires hustling to aid . <P> Somehow 150 men fought to the top of Mount Tamalpais , saved historic Tamalpais Tavern . Blistering , snapping at every twig and leaf , the flames swept down into Blythedale Canyon and toward fine homes , set on the knees of the mountain . <P> For three days thousands of men , haggard with weariness , blackened with smoke and cinders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung round to aid them , sometimes it veered against them , drove the flames across firebreaks to lick at the nearest roofs . The gas mains burst in Mill Valley . The water supply dribbled out . Two pump engines were hustled to Cascade Canyon to drain an abandoned reservoir . Refugees clogged the roads . Red Cross stations sprang up to treat the injured , house the homeless . <P> When only smoking embers remained on the hillsides 130 homes were destroyed , more than million-dollar damage was done . The dwellings of wealthy Ralston White , Lucian Marsh , Charles Coles , Mrs. Mary Webber Fisk , German Consul Kurt Zeigler , had been devoured . And as fire in a forest will sometimes lay bare a landmark half-forgotten , one ash-heap in Mill Valley stood out in despatches with historical significance . It was the home of Col. Andrew Summers Rowan , U. S. A. retired , onetime world hero , the man who " carried the message to Garcia . " <P> One April day in 1898 , with the U. S. hurrying inevitably toward war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army &; Navy Club . The older , serious-faced , put a question . The younger made a laughing reply . Serious-Face spoke again . Smiling-Face stopped smiling . In a moment both heads were bent together in low-toned , tense conversation . <P> Thus did Col. Arthur Wagner , chief of the U. S. Bureau of Military Intelligence , convey to Lieut . Andrew Summers Rowan the wish of President McKinley that he seek , in the jungles of Cuba , Lieut. - Gen . Calixto Garcia , insurgent Cuban leader , carry to him a McKinley message , ascertain the size and strength of Spanish forces . <P> On April 23 , Carrier Rowan landed in Kingston , Jamaica , sailed Cuba-ward that night on a dirty native fishing boat under the eyes of the Spanish patrol which was scouring the Caribbean . Flat on his back against a gunwale , Carrier Rowan heard a Spaniard swagger alongside shouting queries ; heard his pilot 's lazy answer , the Spaniard 's satisfied grunt .                 @ @ @ @
