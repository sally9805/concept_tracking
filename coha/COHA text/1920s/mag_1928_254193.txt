By automobile and airplane , by train and on foot , some 12,500 Rotarians arrived in Minneapolis last week to attend the 19th annual convention of Rotary International . Rotarians from Czechoslovakia or other strange places were welcomed in their own tongue by means of painted placards whose wording was the result of much Minneapolis scholarship . Four and a half thousand autos were used to carry the Rotarians about the city ; 80 typists copied registration lists so that no Rotarian might remain unnoticed . Before long all the Rotarians gathered in the municipal auditorium , second largest in the U. S. , third in the world , and listened to speeches , notably one by Governor Theodore Christianson of Minnesota , who said slyly : <P> " The Sinclair Lewises , the Lardners and the Menckens may continue to direct their shafts against our organization and others founded on the same principles . Ridicule is the weapon ... of a poor cause . They may continue to talk about Babbitry and scorn the Rotarian virtues but Rotary International will be known and honored long after Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as the shallow , superficial , overestimated literary cartoonist that he is . " <P> When the cheering ceased , the Rotarians listened to the principal speech of the evening , by James Hamilton Lewis , onetime ( 1913-19 ) U. S. Senator from Illinois . This Lewis praised Rotary , praised <P> Europe , characterized the U. S. as one of the greatest influences toward international brotherhood and as " that great , great republic which has inspired free government of the earth to fight for freedom of man . " <P> He said : " To you , ambassadors of world honor , and knights of sublime service , this United States gives you the hand of its heart . . . . " <P> The Rotarians roared lustily at this and proceeded to other diversions such as listening to the music of the 50-piece Sauk Centre Boys ' Band whose members range in age from seven to fifteen . They toured the city in cars and busses , played baseball and golf , attended the movies , and witnessed a pageant which traced the growth of Rotary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind of one Paul P. Harris , Chicago lawyer , to the present when it has 140,000 members from 44 countries . <P> In the Municipal Auditorium once more they heard what Nils Parmann , banker from Oslo , Norway , a new brother , had to say , viz. : <P> " I was a man of very retiring disposition . Now I expect to make friends by the thousands from now on . I had disliked travel , avoided crowds and hated conventions , but Rotary is changing me . " <P> Instead of sitting spellbound or humming they stood up bravely and shouted out the words of songs when they were lead by Homer Rodeheaver , who has been for 18 years musical assistant to Evangelist Billy Sunday . He likes to be thought of as the introducer and exploiter of Negro spirituals.
