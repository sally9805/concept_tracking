Four nights before the election , Governor Smith remembered something . " All during this campaign , " he said , " I have not had an opportunity to say something that I want to say now that I am home , and that is to extend congratulations , great good wishes and heartfelt gratitude to my running mate on the ticket , Joe Robinson of Arkansas . He is a man of extraordinary ability , great capacity and a man of wonderful experience . He has used every bit of the last six weeks working night and day in the interest of the success of the Democratic ticket . " <P> Able , experienced , great-capacitied Senator Robinson spent the last nights and days campaigning arduously in southern Illinois , where his voice could be heard in hard-fought Missouri . He made a side trip , for some reason , across Indiana into arch-Republican Ohio . Then he went home to Arkansas , one State he knew was going Democratic .                 @ @ @ @
