Between them is an ice-covered strait . Graham Land itself seems to be fringed with an archipelago . Between a great plateau to its north and a double mountain chain to its south is a broad expanse of white , which may indicate a valley or another strait . <P> The two men made their observation ? while flying their Lockhead-Vega plane in a 1,200-mile sally from their base on Deception Island , situated between Antarctica and Cape Horn . <P> A collateral marvel of their work was the speed with which their news reached the world . As soon as they relanded at Deception Island , Captain Wilkins sent a long news despatch from the whaler Hektoria , which is standing by him . The despatch went 7,500 miles by short wireless wave to the office of the San Francisco Examiner , one of the Hearst papers financing his expedition . The Examiner and its sister papers made adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press and science joined in mutual courtesy . The New York Times , which is supporting Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd 's Antarctic expedition , wirelessed him Captain Wilkins ' achievement . The message went 10,000 miles to the Ross sea where Commander Byrd , last week , was ice-locked on his City of New York . He rewired the Times an invitation to Captain Wilkins : " Hearty congratulations on your splendid flight . Do n't forget you will find a warm welcome if you fly to our base . " This message the Times forwarded by land telegraph to the Examiner in San Francisco , 3,000 miles across this continent ; the Examiner pushed it by wireless the 7,500 miles to Captain Wilkins . So it went a 20,500-mile triangle although the two explorers were only 2,000 miles apart .
