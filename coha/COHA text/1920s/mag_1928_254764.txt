President . The Society of American Bacteriologists at University of Rochester Medical School last week elected Alice Catherine Evans of Washington president . She did not attend the meetings , for she was bedridden in Washington with malta fever , contracted three years ago while experimenting with the germs . They cause an undulating fever , quite similar to typhoid or typhus fever . Goats usually are responsible for malta fever in humans . Professionally Miss Evans is a member of the U. S. Public Health Service at Washington . <P> Immunity . Dr. Malcolm Herman Soule of the University of Michigan presented a theory that disease germs occur in two forms-one virulent , the other relatively harmless . The presence of the virulent types in the blood incites some agent ( its nature yet unknown ) to dissociate the virulence , leaving the germs in their mild form . This gentle type the body cells &; fluids can easily destroy . It is the presence of that dissociating power , Dr. Soule believes , that renders people immune to disease , rather than any specific germicidal activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made some progress on the difficult problem of naming germs.
