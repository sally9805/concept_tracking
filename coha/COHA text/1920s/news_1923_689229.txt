txt Midsummer week has been American week in England . Never before have there been so many notable Americans in England as there are at the moment .. Two members of President Harding 's Cabinet are here-Mr . Mellon and . James J. Davis , the Minister of Labor . Also , there are about twenty United States Senators , - who are spending much time in and around Parliament . ? Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler has been giving a course of lectures that have been well received ; and John D. , Rockefeller , Jr. , has been investigating certain lines of humanitarian work . All told , fully 200,000 Americans have visited Eagland this summer , and the rush still continues . It is safe to say that at least half the guests in London 's big hotels , during July and August , will be Americans . By the courtesy of the American Chamber of Commerce in London , I have just received the advance proofs of the new Anglo-American Year Book , which will be published in September . This book , first published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 800 pages . It contains a " Who 's Who " of Americans in England , with 2,000 names ; and a list of over 6,000 business firms that have interests in both Britain and the States . It gives an extraordinary list of Anglo-American Clubs and Societies . There are the Anglo-American Society , for instance , with the Duke of Connaught as President ; and the English-Speaking Union , and the American %31ub , and the Old Colony Club , and the English Mayflower Club . There is even the Society of American Civil War Veterans , with 137 doughty old members . There is now an American Embassy with a staff of 20 and a Consular organization With 53 offices in Great Britain . This is progress when we remember that in 1841 , when Edward Everett was American Minister in England , the whole volume of Anglo-American business was carried on with one desk . The new Year Book shows 71 American scholars at Cambridge and 238 at Oxford .. The latter include the Rhodes scholars  --  two from every state in the Unipn . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . The best known American paper is the New ' York Herald , which now publishes both a Paris and a London edition . The most quoted financial papers are Barron 's and The Wall Street Journal . The Saturday Evening Post is on the large newsstands in England , and has a fairly large sale at 18 cents a copy . The Ladies ' Home Journal , too , is popular among English women . The most important American financial houses in London are the National City Bank , the Guaranty Trust , Brown Shipley . tk Co. , and Lee , Higginson di Co . In the moving picture houses , 90% of the films are American . In the regular theatres , at least 30% of the plays come from New York ; and possibly 15% of the novels are American . In the world of art , no one stands higher in England than Sargent , who was born in Italy , but whose father wan , a Bpston doctor . And in the realtn of religion , the mail AN- - be stands behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sioux City , Iowa . London 's handsomest business street  --  Kingsway ? has now become largely an American street . It contains the buildings of the Armour Co. , the Guaranty Trust , the Ingersoll Watch Co. , Waterman Pen , Dennison 's , Gilbert 's , Eastman Kodak , J. Walter Thompson 's and the United States Shipping Board . The two finest buildings in Kingway are the Stoll Picture House , built by Oscar Hammerstein. and the new Bush ? Building , which is by far the handsomest office building in London . The inscription on the front of the Bush Building is : " Dedicated to the friendship of English Speaking Peoples . " This has crawn much favorable comment from Londoners . The foremost American in England is beyond doubt Mr. Gordon Selfridge , who came to London 17 years ago from Chicago and revolutionized English methods of storekeeping . Mr. Selfridge is England 's ablest merchant and he has compelled his competitors to follow in his footsteps . Also , he has never in any way tried to be English . He has won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He still represents America in England , much more truly , in fact , that some of the American ambassadors do , Two other influential Americans in England are Francis E. Powell , who came to London 22 years ago to represent the Standard Oil'Co. ; and Pomeroy Burton , who was brought from New York by Lord Northcliffe to manage the Daily Mail . There is also Lady Astor , who is a member of Parliament and the owner of the Observer  --  the leading Sunday paper of England . She was Miss Nancy Langhorne of Virginia , and she is at present the most conspicuous woman in English public life . Even the Times  --  the old " Thunderer , " is now controlled by one of the Astors ; but the English descendants of John Jacob Astor of New York have long since forgotten their American or Dutch origin and claim to be 100% English . On the whole , there has been , since the war , such a blending of American and English in London that it is difficult to draw the line and say which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing plays on Lincoln and Lee , now that the statue of Lincoln is at the door of Parliament , now that James M. Beck is a member of the English bar and American ladies by the score are being presented at court , it is not easy to distinguish between the things that are English and the things that arc American . Recently , a large assemblage of English and Americans met in Westminster Abbey to unveil a tablet in honor ? of Walter H. Page , who was the best loved of all American ambassadors . This tablet stands near the memorial window that was built in honor of James Russell Lowell , who has never been forgotten in bEngland . So , while it is not true to say that England is being in any sense Americanized , it is a pleasant fact that the barriers of prejudice have never been so low , between the United States and England , as they are today .
