ONLY the literate may vote , of course , and last week was given over to deciding who was literate and who was n't . Very few people failed the test , yet , reading the questions , we marvelled that even one person should have passed it . One of the questions was : " What should a citizen talk about ? " Well , how did it affect a man 's literacy standing if he replied that a citizen is at his best when silent ? Another question was : " By whom are the people who make the laws elected ? " Suppose the applicant answered that whole handfuls of them have been known to he elected by the Methodist Church and the Anti-Saloon League was he called literate or illiterate ? The last question was : " What effect do good laws have upon the nation ? " Was that man counted literate or illiterate who replied that they chiefly tend to raise everybody 's blood pressure ? THE morning 's mail brought us TH of the subtle but unmistakable hook-up which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have never known two organizations we 'd rather see get together . The Junior League ladies , who we always thought were too busy for words , have shown that they are nut too busy to write letters to Saks , describing their enjoyable shopping experiences ; and Saks , on their part , have taken the time and trouble to relay these letters to theircustomers by direct mail . Thus , merely by being on the mailing list of Saks , you get letters from Junior League girls . Thousands of people ( including our tottering self ) who might have lived and died without getting so much as a note from a Junior League girl , will now receive whole letters from them . A store that is bright enough to see the possibilities in that , has our approbation . The idea is worth developing . We heartily recommend the Bov Scouts to Macy 's . THE **27;290;TOOLONG salary that Dr. Cadman is to get for broadcasting his Sunday sermon may sound high , but is it ? We got out our pencil and paper when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty million Americans , it is estimated , can now worship comfortably by radio . At two hundred worshippers per congregation , this means that we can dispense with a hundred thousand preachers . The average preacher 's salary was about four hundred and seventy dollars a year , or a total for the hundred thousand of $47,000,000 . Thus the merger which combines the best features of Dr. Cadman and a hundred thousand preachers represents a clear saving to the religions community of $46,975,000 . Offhand , that seems like a lot of money . THERE are " sound pockets " in New York , and that is something we never realized before . A friend has been describing a terrible night he spent in his new apartment , a nightmade unendurable by a sound pocket . He had moved from a street that was rather noisy to a street that was rather quiet , and it happened that the first night in his new abode was a foggy one . All the sounds to which he was accustomed were missing  --  the " L , " the trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through clearly was a foghorn from a ferry pier in the North River . The monotonous regularity of this deep cry so worked on his distraught brain that he arose , half conscious , at four o'clock , believing that a major disaster had occurred in the city . Frightened , he dressed and went to the street , where he immediately lost track of the foghorn and began to hear other and familiar sounds . Gloomily he went to a Childs , ate a bowl of shredded wheat , waited for dawn and the clearing away of mists , and then crawled hack to bed . He is still trying to solve the sound-pocket problem , and is considering hiring a small colored boy to make routine noises for him at night , so he can get a little sleep . FROM an active supporter of cour- tesy , we have become its active foe . Vie arc sated by courtesy , and want no more of it . Fate took us recently to a sandwich counter , where the aggressive cheer of the place , the chronic courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a courteous sign on the wall , " Let Us Do the Hurrying . " As if to offset this injunction , another polite legend read : " A Meal a Minute  --  Purely American . " The courteous waitress poured us out a second cup of coffee  --  courteously did not charge us for it . As we finished our last mouthful of sandwich ( quite forgetting to enjoy it ) we courteously slid a dime under the plate . It was returned , courteously . " Tipping is not done here . " Eventually we escaped , and that evening went the rounds of five night clubs , tipping and tipping , hurrying through every mouthful , not enjoying one . Lighters That Fail STANDSTANDING before the library the ING other day , at the aperitif hour , a gentleman was about to light a cigarette and had just placed thumb to his lighter , when an ordinary-looking , everyday sort of fellow bade him hold . " I 'll het you five dollars it does n't work the first time , " said this man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the wick of his silver case burst into flame . The stranger handed him a five-dollar bill . " What 's the ideal " demanded the proud owner of the lighter . " I make about fifty to sixty dollars a day at it , " said the other . He then explained that almost every healthy , red-blooded man has confidence enough in his cigarette lighter to bet five dollars it will work , but that this touching faith is misplaced three times out of five . We had heard before of this new farm of betting -- mostly- from fanciful men about town who might have made it up  --  hut our informant in this case is a serious-minded homebody who is still fluttery over the only real adventure he has ever had in this perilous city . Suits for Jimmy SEVEN new suits are now under construction for Mayor Walker . For this important work , Jeann Friedman , tailor to His Honor , has moved his shop from Thirty-fourth Street up to Forty-sixth Street , opposite the Ritz . Here , behind heavily panelled walls , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at the royal garrne nts . Mr. Friedman , who knows our unflagging interest in the Mayor 's appearance , telephoned last week , inviting us to inspect the new raiment. and when we called received us personally in hisreception room and let us finger the executive swatches . One series is called the Hyde Park Ensemble . Another the Biarritz Casino . Both are new departures , featuring jackets of plain cloth , with pants of a slightly different hue , vigorously striped  --  like the Bush Terminal Building . Five of the new suits now under the needle are of the Hyde Park ( different-colorpants ) type . Two are of the standard ( pants-match-coat ) variety . At the moment the Mayor is in an autumnal mood and leans toward brown . Among the ensembles there will be one reddish brown , two oak leaf ( or Broadway browns , one blue , one gray . The Biarritz group is a sports group . ( There is always a suspicion in Mr. Friedman 's mind that the Mayor may be going south . ) As a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " Just now am I just studying them , " said Mr. Friedman . " These combination effects , only for an outstanding man they arc , different from other people . " And he showed us exactly how the Biarritz Casino garment works  --  coat of dark gray , knickers of thatched-roof motif , flannels of light gray stripes ? " for lolling . " To fend off cold winds , three topcoats of pure cashmere are also being built for Mr. Walker . He already owns two fur coats , one black , one brown , and will be able to get through the winter inside of these , Mr. Friedman thinks . The brown is worth ten thousand dollars , on account of a very fine collar that a fellow brought the Mayor from Russia . About seventy suits comprise the Walker wardrobe . Many have been around the house for years . Ten of them hang in the tailor shop all the time . No room at home . " He leaves things laying around , " Mr. Friedman confided , pulling out a dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor spends three thousand dollars a year on this kind of equipment , and enjoys every cent of it . Life has opened up like a flower for Jeann Friedman since becoming tailor to Mr.Walker . Fifteen years ago he made a suit for a friend of Jimmie 's , and the snappy effect so took the Walker fancy that Jeann has done the tailoring ever since . Other tailors try with siren notes and custom effects to lure the Mayor away , but Jeann makes the Walker pants twenty inches at the knee , eighteen and a half inches at the bottom , no break at the instep ; makes the Walker lapels sit up where they belong ; and Jeann now has a nice shop with ashtrays in the reception room and a view of the Ritz . Also he has attracted attention in the trade . A writer for a fashion magazine interviewed him and quoted him as saying : " It is not so much a matter of a designing system , but accomplishment which comes through the trained , artistic eye visualizing the finished product according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his ashtrays and reads that statement over and over . Machinal THE Union ChM is up to the minute and has a radio in the lounge . An attendant tunes it in on all important speeches , polo games , and the like . Thus excitement comes to the Union Club . A chap who lunched there the other noon heard a vivacious announcer bawling out perfervid reports of the minute-by-minute or inchby-inch progress of something or other . Going to investigate , he found that the audience for the performance was one very old man seated with his back to the machine reading the Wall Street Journal . Interior Garden SOMEOSOMEONE followed a fifteen-foot NE cedar tree which was being wheeled through the front entrance of the Metropolitan Museum , thinking that perhaps it was a very famous cedar tree . It was really to be used in the museum 's garden in the Pompeian Court , which most visitors take to be artificial . The vegetation is real , however , living cedar trees and various small plants being used to set off some rather important fragments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least not surrounded by marble walls  --  and they are used because they die slowly . They last about four months . The garden is edged with a green plant called , if you are interested , Selaginella kraussiana . It now does very well , but the management spent thousands of dollars with it before they got it to grow . The only flora that lives without fuss in the Pompeian Court is ivy . Such success as has been had with the vegetation is due to the Metropolitan 's gardener , a Mr. Hauff . It was he who found how to make the Selaginella grow . He will not reveal how he does it . He merely says it is intricate doctoring . Mr. Hauff is a notable expert on trees and plants . He graduated from the Standard School of Floriculture at Centralia , Missouri , with the highest grade ever attained by any student there , ninety-nine and one-half per cent . He worked for James Speyer before the museum called him in . Sirens A COUPLE of cute young ladies who were visiting a western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told , and the head groom asked one of them whether she would prefer the flat English saddle or the Western saddle with a horn . " The flat saddle , " said the young thing , " because we are n't going to ride in any traffic and wo n't need a horn . " Daughter to Caruso LORIA CARUSO has come back Vi from Europe to play in Central Park and doubtless to endure a great deal of attention from restless people who can hardly wait for her to grow up . The little daughter of the illustrious tenor is only nine years old , but emotional admirers of the Caruso voice are proclaiming even now that Gloria has inherited it . Scientists who attempted to account for Caruso 's unusual voice laid great importance upon the construction of his throat . His daughter 's has been examined and found to be quite similar . As a matter of fact , however , voice people say that nothing much can be told about the child 's voice until she grows up . Gloria 's facial resemblance to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caruso in miniature . Her mother sees in this a fine portent for the future . When she was only three , the child began to sing , in a thin , nondescript voice , such tunes as " Three Blind Mice . " Now she has added little French songs like " Au Clair de la Lune " to her repertory , and once in a while is asked  --  and consents with alacrity  --  to sing for special company at her home in Park Avenue . She begins simply , without coyness or boldness , has a fetching smile and an attractive manner , and does not appear to be spoiled . This year she made her first Victor record , privately , and there will be a new one each year until she is sixteen , as a chronicle of her vocal progress . Now , except on gala occasions , her singing is discouraged  --  a difficult matter , since Gloria likes to sing , makes up small tunes of her own , and rather enjoys personal appearances . Last season , in the opera 's horseshoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her by various tenors and sopranos singing " Marta . " Most of the young lady 's public appearances to date , however , have had the more severe background of a courtroom , during the numerous legal squabbles concerning the large estate left her , and her father 's posthumous royalties . Gloria does not attend school , but is taught by tutors . Her musical education is in the hands of Dorothy Ken " Oh , Al Smith 's all right , but I 'm fer leaving prosperity alone . " nedy , and under the general supervision of John McCormack , whom Gloria likes very much . She will brook no teachers or supervisors who arc not easy to look upon . In addition to her music she studies French an hour each day and Italian an hour and a half , and she is regarded as a precocious student of these languages . Her playtimes are in the morning , with her baby sister , and for one or two hours each afternoon , in Central Park with neighboring children .

This we know because the management received a cablegram ordering that a line in the show be changed from " Ah , how beautiful " to " Oh , how beautiful . " The audience totalled only four at a recent performance of " The Ladder , " but the company , as is its habit , went through the show as though the auditorium were full . On this evening , when one of the actors left the stage , he paused in the wings and was heard to exclaim , " And the critics said the public would n't come !

Success MHERE is usually a kind of defeat - I-  in any victory . We are thinking , in particular , of a landscape gardener in Montauk , L.I. , whose successful practice is an outgrowth of his early penchant for digging in the soil with his hands . He grew up loving the feel of damp earth , happy in the bagginess of overalls , a man with a trowel . Now , with a large business , he finds that his rather elegant clientele expects him to wear decent clothes and keep his nails manicured . Erect and moody , he wanders through flowered paths , directing his men , unable to get down on his hands and knees . " It 's nice , " a lady overheard him whisper as he surveyed her garden . " Would n't I like to touch it ! " Big Scene ALADY who writes novels provides a movie story . She had sold the film rights to her most recent work , and lately , encountering a director for the company that bought it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine , " said the director , " except that we are having a lot of trouble with the panthers . " " Panthers ! " said the lady , " what panthers ? " for no such animals had been mentioned in her story . Well , it turned out that the movie people had decided to put pan thers in to embellish an incident in the novel . The writer had told how a beautiful heiress , driving seventy miles an hour on a Long Island road , had struck and killed a man , and the movie people thought that by using panthers in a kind of Roman Coliseum scene they could illustrate how much like the cruel patricians of ancient Rome is a lady who drives at seventy miles an hour and hits a man . The successful authors and playwrights , who these days belong to the wealthier class , are profiting greatly by the talkies , they say . One writer who sold the moving-picture rights to a novel was approached two months later by the same company , with a liberal offer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mechanical age . Psychology of Photography PERSONS appearing for sittings at a certain Fifth Avenue photographer 's studio are shown into a reception room where there is a phonograph , with records strewn about on a table . The idea is that the subject will casually select a favorite tune and play it , and that this will gently bring about that pleasant look which less modern and ingenious photographers bully people into assuming . If a subject does n't voluntarily select and play a record , it is suggested that he do so . The scheme sometimes fails . One lady could n't find any record she liked and had to arrange a later sitting because she had got all upset in the search for one . Some business men and highstrung matrons merely look a little sad during the playing of any piece . These types , and little children , are shown a bird . Catchpenny  - -  FOR the first time since we were very young we went into a penny arcade the other afternoon , one of those along Sixth Avenue . Only three or four youths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whistling . The reason for this dullness seemed obvious enough after we had a look around . The penny arcades have nothing to offer that they did n't have twenty years ago . The glassed-in music boxes equipped with earphones advertised nothing fresher than " Ram ona "  - -  - an d right across the street a sizable group of people stood about in front of a store where the latest vodeodo song was being trumpeted from a megaphone . In the arcade 's little movie contraptions , into which you drop a cent for views of girls and of sporting events , the most timely offering was pictures of the Dempsey-Turiney fight in Chicago . There was no novelty in the once alluring views of blonde ladies posing at dressing tables and no thrill in the movie called " Foiling the White Slavers . " It must go back at least as far as 1908 , for we put in a penny , and turning the crank , beheld a lady with her hair done up in a great knot at the back , and wearing a dress with flounces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theatre lobbies now offer free of charge more exciting things than this . For the rest , there are the ancient devices for telling your fortune and ? testing your strength . Several of these machines looked as if they had not been operated for years , and one bore a dismal out-of-order sign . The shooting gallery at the rear was not being patronized . The man in charge twiddled a heavy watch chain drowsily . The mechanism clicked dreamily . A man in a pink shirt got to playing " Valencia " on a mechanical piano , and we left , pretty sure we should n't have gone in anyway . On Parle Anglais AT Nevers , France , a former Amer- 1 ican army lieutenant hired a bicycle and rode about the area in which he had been stationed ten years before , looking for familiar places and faces . He enquired especially about a French boy named Pierre who , as a lad of twelve , had taken up with his military outfit . The youth had learned rapidly , the English language among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . When the unit departed for home , the members had taken up a purse and left it with his ? widowed mother to continue his education . The ex-officer felt certain that it would come out that Pierre had made his way in the world . Mother and son , alas , had moved away , but the American finally found someone who was able to tell him that Pierre had gone to Nice and to give him his address there . Being on the Riviera some weeks later , the lieutenant sought out the place . It proved to be an American bar , behind which was Pierre , now twenty-two , mixing cocktails .
