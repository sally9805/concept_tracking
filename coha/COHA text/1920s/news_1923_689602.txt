txt The wildcat stock promoters in the Texas oil fields began to run for cover when Dr. FREDERICK A. Coors and thirteen - of his co-workers in plucking the credulous were placed on trial in a Federal court at Fort Worth . Scores of fly-by-night companies closed their offices . the fungus oil press that advertised for victims suspended publication , and familiar faces were no longer seen in hotel lobbies . " It is amazing . " said a visitor to Fort Worth , " how boldly these companies " float their worthless stocks . There " are any number of them fleecing the " innocent investors . I found the " town running wild . " At Fort Worth the " reloading scheme " flourished . Its design was to merge defunct oil companies , the stockholders of which were asked to buy stock in the holding concern equivalent to 25 per cent . of their original investments. , Thousands were persuaded to do this by glib canvassers and prospectuses . It was easy to get stockholder lists of the moribund and extinct companies . Dr .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a guarantee that the merger company would pay dividends . It did  --  two of them in " stock . " In one of his letters , of which he sent out as many as 300,000 a week , Dr. COOK gave a " reloader " investor this assurance : " In reply to yours of Aug. 28 , there " is no market whatsoever for Heart " of the Duke at present . When the " same is converted into Association 1 " shares it will have a market value " of one dollar a share . " - The doctor also went gunning for shareholders of oil companies that still had assets : When they passed a dividend , shareholders were ' invited to take stock in the Petroleum Producers ' Association . A letterhead bearing the name of the still going company was used . CooK 's promotion functioned under a " declaration of trust . " Nothing in this document obligated the trustee to use the proceeds of stock sales for any specific purpose , but it provided that ultimately the assets would be divided among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the trust was fixed at twenty years . If the truste:Is were dishonest , they could vote themselves any sum in salaries without violating a Tevns statute . While this declaration of trust has been attacked , no decision upon its validity , has:been rendered by the ' Court , of : lase ; ea:Ai : At his trial Dr. Coox contended that he was doing business within the law . But he had not reckoned with rite Department of Justice at Washington . It was able to convict the defendants of fraudulent use of the mails and send them to jail for long terms . The prosecution prov4d intent to defraud by introducing in evidence representations that the merger company could count upon settled production from mere than 100 wells to pay dividends . A declaration that the " prob " able yearly income after the pro " posed drilling in fifty wells in the " Corsicana field will be between " $180,000,000 and $360,000.000 " was also put in evidence . Dr. Coox swore that he had " only altruistic aims " in his " venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of evolution . It would have been a great success , he argued , had oil not dropped to a dollar a barrel . According to the doctor 's counsel , former United States Senator BAILEY . " COOK would have " made a success of the enterprise if " the Government had not come along " and interfered when it did . " It was said in his behalf that he " took hold " of a dozen broken-down oil con " terns and made an honest effort to " - rebuild them into paying concerns . " The jury did not take that view of the case . Giving the defendants the benefit of every doubt , it brought in a verdict of guilty . If Dr. CooK did not discover the North Pole , he discovered the way to wealth in Texas . But it led to the prison door . It was characteristic of the man that as a promoter of wildcat oil companies he boasted that he had reached the Pole . The fiction was his certificate of integrity .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
