THOSE delegates to last winter 's Pan-American Conference at Ha ? vana who showed signs of appre ? hension at the menacing advance of the Colossus of the North might have given some attention to a new triumph of the Yankee steam roller that was taking place at that very moment , only seventy miles away . Key West was at last being annexed to the United States . This was no forcible conquest , to be sure ; the Key Westers wanted it , they rejoiced at it , they even put themselves in debt several million dollars to make it possible . But the moment it occurred ? the moment they could regard themselves at last as full citizens of the continental republic some few of them began to be struck with misgivings , to wonder if perhaps they had not sold a unique birthright for a mess of very ordinary pottage . For Key West was one of the few re ? maining American cities that had pre ? served its cultural autonomy . In an age when the life of this republic has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks almost exactly like Pittsfield , Massachusetts , Key West remained dif ? ferent and distinctive , with a peculiar outward aspect that was the natural flowering of its peculiar history and cul ? ture . Now it is already beginning to be ironed flat , and in that process it will lose half its charm . The other half , the cli ? mate , is fortunately indestructible ; but those of us who think American uni ? formity already has conquests enough will miss the Key West that survived un ? til the Overseas Motor Highway over the Keys was opened last winter , letting in the automobile and thestandardized civilization of interchange ? able parts which the automobile , with some aid from the movies and the news ? paper syndicates , has given to this country . Juridically , of course , Key West has been American for upwards of a century ? uninterruptedly a part of this republic , too , which can not be said for the rest of the state . Florida , as everybody knows , seceded from the Union in 1861 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , and less agreeable to the enthusiasm of the local boosters , it was left to the Confederacy virtually without argument , being some ? what less highly developed and adver ? tised in those days than it is now . But the navy held Key West all through the Civil War ; it was a base for blockading squadrons , and the ruined brick forts of that period are among the historic monu ? ments of the town to-day . Culturally , however , Key West has al ? ways been something apart . Even after the Florida East Coast Railroad came in over the Keys in 1912 , even after the Vol-stead Act inspired the railroad to build a great hotel as a convenience for tourists on the way to Havana , the town had little effective contact with the Continent . It did business with the mainland , of course ; Key West cigars , Key West fish , Key West sponges , are known to the world ; and the port does more business than all the rest of the coast towns in Florida . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( mainly machinery ) shipped down to Key West by rail , and a considerable import trade , chiefly in Cuban sugar . But the great migration which of late years has made Florida virtually a North ? ern state located in the South fell short of the Keys . Key West is not Florida , not United States . It is largely Cuban in population , more Cuban than anything else in vegetation ; but the climate of this flat island set down between the ocean and the guff is pure paradise ? never a night of frost , such as you get occasion ? ally even as far south as Miami ; and the atmosphere , the life , is nothing but Key West Even yet yen hear Key Westers ? and not Cubans or conchs , but what Key West calls " Americans " ? talk of " going to the States " as if they lived in Jamaica or Barbados . Indeed , since the passage of the Vol-stead Act Key West has been engaged in a desultory war with the United States . The town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorials in the local paper , is about twice as wet per capita as the West Forties in New York City . The Coast Guard headquarters , which was for some time located there , was last year removed to St. Petersburg , the Treasury alleging that Coast Guardsmen were treated by the inhabitants with disrespect and con ? tumely . One hears that the Coast Guardsmen became unpopular by unfair commercial practices the peddling of captured rum cargoes at lower prices than could be made by local dealers who had to buy their supplies . However that may be , the invasion of Key West by an armed expeditionary force of prohibition agents from Miami has become an an ? nual event . They raid local restaurants and arrest proprietors and waiters ; ac ? cording to the Key West version of the story , they also take what they find in the cash drawer and on the persons of any patrons who may have the misfortune to be on hand when they descend . Then they lock up their prisoners in the local jail and go back to Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outraged might , releases the pris ? oners by due process of law , arms its sheriff with warrants charging the pro hummock breaking the far expanse of grass-grown marsh . Then Key Largo and its lime groves , and the weedy wreck ? age of great developments of the boom days ? and then you are on the Keys , off the continent of North America . The railroad and the motor road too follow the main line of the islands , where the shallow sea-bottom lifts in a long curving spine of scattered vertebrae above the surface ; but you see other islands to right . and left , flat green banks of mangroves huddled down on the sea , with cocoanut palms lifting above them erect and flaunting ? not drooping slant ? wise and apologetic like most of the East Coast palms . Clusters of cocoa palms growing out of the white sand , matted banks of mangroves , dogwood and but ? tonwood thickets ? that is the landscape of the Keys ; and the ground is carpeted with morning glories from one end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named flower , for on these islands the morning glory blossoms all day long . And to right and left the shallow ocean spreads away in a variety of color which the Northerner finds utterly incredible --  green over white sand , mauve or purple over seaweed , blue above the distant depths ; and past the Pullman windows flies the pelican or the white heron , un ? disturbed in this refuge where till lately only infrequent fishing parties broke the primal calm . One may heartily admire the East Coast and the cities thereof , and still prefer Key West . The East Coast has its charm , which the inhabitants do not encourage you to forget ; but it breaks the monotonous uniformity of these States only with its own subspecies of uniformity . Palm Beach has its ostentatious opu ? lence , Miami its fantastic splendors ; but the East Coast is substantially one piece ; the vegetation ( native or installed ) , the architecture , the landscape , the life , are very much the same from Ormond to Cocoanut Grove . St. Augustine , per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to attract the crowds , has been tolerably successful so far in preservingits individual flavor . But Key West is alien and peculiar . It lies on a flat bank of coral sand , roughly a couple of miles square . All Florida is flat enough ; ten feet above sea level is called altitude on the East Coast . But Key West has no tall buildings except the Concha Hotel and the disused blimp hangar left over from the War ; it is so flat that the light ? house is three blocks inland instead of at the water 's edge . In this shallow soil the vegetation is stunted ; palms rarely grow to half the height they attain two hundred miles north . Palms and hibis ? cus and bougainvillea , the staples of the continental Floridian landscape , one sees here ; but one sees , too , the bamboo and the banyan and a score of other trees and shrubs to which the non-botanical visitor from the North can put no name . He recognizes them only as the vegetation of Cuba , not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly to the relief of the voyager who has started every day wrong on the East Coast by trying to shave in the hard water brought up from the limestone soil . In Key West one shaves in rain water , as one drinks rain water ; for on this flat sand ? bank the surface water is brackish and the deeper water is frankly salt . Fire hy ? drants go straight down , to no line of water mains , but each to its own salt water well . The citizens bathe in the surface water , but they drink rain water caught in cisterns ; and after a dry sum ? mer they have to import drinking water from the Continent in tank cars . So perhaps you begin to observe that this is a peculiar city . Its peculiarity is a matter of history and ethnography as well as geography and geology . In the population of Key West ? which is anywhere from twelve to eighteen thousand , according to the civic vision of the resident whom you may happen to ask about it ? there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) three racial groups : the Cubans , the conchs , and the " Americans . " It was an American , John W. Simonton , who bought the island from its Spanish owner for two thousand dollars shortly after Florida was purchased from Spain ; but the bulk of the early settlers were conchs . These conchs ( so the local antiquaries tell one ) were originally Londoners , eighteenth-century Londoners who mi ? grated , voluntarily or by request , to the Bahamas , and then drifted over at the beginning of the nineteenth century to settle the Florida Keys . They have a reputation for languor which seems not altogether deserved ; certainly they are boatmen and fishermen of the first quality , There were scattered Cubans here al , most from the first ? the beginnings of the Cuban cigar industry of Key West date from the eighteen thirties , but not till the great unsuccessful Cuban rebel ? lion of 1868 to 187S did they begin to immigrate in quantity . Of late years many of the cigar factories have been drawn away to Tampa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are still a third or more of the town . And whoever is not a Cuban or a conch is an American . He may be a naturalized Swede or Italian or Russian Jew ( though he probably is n't ; most of the " Americans " are Southerners ) ; but he is an American none the less , a title denied by local usage to conchs whose ancestors may have been in the Western Hemisphere for a century and a half , or to a Cuban whose American ancestry may go hack twice that far . There was a time when wrecking was the principal local industry , There is a good harbor and a fairly deep channel leading to it ( though the battleship that took Mr. Coolidge to Havana last year had to wait for him seven miles out ) ; but all around the island are shallow seas with a coral bottom , and in the old days ships whose cargoes offered rich salvage to the residents used to run ashore with surprising frequency . The present-day inhabitants , jealous of the good name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were not induced by such false beach lights as gave Fire Island , New York , its name . None the less it is on record that the establishment of government light ? houses on the reef to the south was re ? garded by the residents ? half a century or more ago , this was ? as a murderous blow at local industry . Luckily the first Cuban rebellion just then gave a great impetus to cigar making , and the wreckers gradually became a tradition like the buccaneers . The great days of Key West were in the Spanish War , when the town was the base for much of the naval operations against Cuba . Indeed , war has always profited Key West ; even the hated Yankee oppressors of the Civil War spent money in the town , and are cred ? ited with first giving nation-wide adver ? tising to Key West cigars ; and in the World War there were naval and aviation training stations which brought much money to the town and encouraged an influx of population . But after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many of the cigar factories , and the cigar business as a whole was declining before the increasing competition of the cigarette . No wonder that as cigars went out of fashion and the Florida cli ? mate and Florida real estate suddenly came into fashion , not merely for mil ? lionaires but for the mass of the people , Key Nesters looked up along the curving chain of islands which stretches down from the mainland and ii.rgned that where a railroad had been built , a motor road could be built too ? and built more cheaply , for automobiles could be fer ? ried over the deep-water gaps which the railroad had had to bridge at heavy cost . It could be done ; and , they argued , it would be worth doing . For the wealth which the railroad might have dropped in Key West prohi ? bition had flung across the channel to Havana . If the members of the Havana Chamber of Commerce were grateful men they ought to vote a life pension to the Honorable Andrew J. Volstead . Every year thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through Key West ; but few of them stop longer than overnight . They go from the train to the Havana boat , from the Havana boat back to the train ; or if perchance they linger to see the local sights , they can see them all ? fish docks and turtle crawls and cigar factories , forts and airport and Navy Yard ? in a three-hour motor trip ; and then , asks your tourist , what else is there to do ? The Casa Marina ? the seaside hotel opened here by the railroad in 1921 , a hotel that would be packed for the sea ? son anywhere in continental Florida ? is four-fifths empty except when a batch of excursionists comes in for a single night . For it takes time , and a certain type of temperament , to appreciate Key West . It has without argument the best winter climate in the United States ; the perfect days that are only sporadic on the East Coast before the middle of March follow one another in steady succession through January and February on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? mometer is down in the sixties and logs are blazing in the fireplace , you can still swim without discomfort in the shallow ocean ; or if that is too much work you can take a sun bath on the beach at no greater risk than that of having the wind blow sand into your ears . So now and then some enthusiast for warm weather braves the quiet of the place ? that " deadness " which affronts all good Americans ? and stays awhile ; or , more frequently , someone stays awhile for the fishing , which is unsurpassed . Convales ? cents discover that they can get well more rapidly under the Key West sun ; returning voyagers from Havana pause for a day or two to get rid of hangovers , or of the still more dire effects of the cross ? ing on the unstable little boats ? and then they begin to feel the peculiar lan ? guid charm of this flat gray town , a fusionof the old Southern leisureliness with Latin ease ; utterly unlike ? or so it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , for one visitor who sits down to meditate in the sun , there are a hundred who fling themselves with grim determination into the pursuit of pleasure . There is nothing to " do " in Key West except swim and fish and play golf ? and drink the excellent Bacardi ruin and Tropical beer with which Cuba pays its debt to its liberators ; and after the first three hours there is nothing to see , in the sense in which that verb is used by tourists . Outside of one or two front yards , any deliberate landscape garden ? ing dates from the 1025 boom , and there is not much of it even yet . Architectu ? rally the town evokes snorts of disgust from visitors who have come down the East Coast with its replicas of Spanish palaces , its bright-colored stucco bunga ? lows . The mass of houses in Key West are gray unpainted frame shacks , with pentagonal fronts , porches of one story or two ; nothing more than shelters against the wind and rain . The more pretentious houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural style of the eighteen eighties . But presently one feels that these rows and rows of gray shacks somehow fit the town , fit the flat , almost treeless sand ? bank on which Key West is built , and fit the life of the people . For they are ob ? viously mere sleeping quarters in a climate where most of the living can be done outdoors . The landscape and the town and the life that goes on here are all of one piece , and a grave breach of artistic fitness will be committed if the boosters attempt , as it seems they pres ? ently will , to make over Key West into something resembling an East Coast town . The new architecture , doubtless , will fit the altered life ; and then the unique quality of Key West will be lost forever . A languid life people live here ; and to the good American leisure is still a carnal and unhallowed indulgence that must hastily be legitimized by using it for golf or fishing . But the Key Westers soak in it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their open-front cafes scattered up and down Duval Street where they drink coffee and smoke local cigars ? Key West is one of the few towns left in the country where you can still get a good cigar for a nickel ; but conchs and " Americans " enjoy it too . For it does n't cost money ; the climate is free , cigars and liquor are cheap ; food and rents have been low , till lately , and there has been no social pres ? sure obligating a man to live beyond his means . The richest man in Key West has not a great deal that is beyond the reach of the poorest . The town 's only rapid transit is a bus line ; and last year the service was speeded up so that during rush hours the buses came through the business center of the town at twelve-minute intervals . That will give you some idea of what Key West calls a rush . A leisured life , and its leisure gradu ? ally permeates the winter visitor . He comes to appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its atmosphere of Spanish War times , of the Unpretentious Nineties ; the two-story frame business buildings with their porches or balconies , the sunny quiet that pervades this bit of Cuba which is still not Cuba , this corner of the United States which is the least Ameri ? can of American cities . Here is some ? thing peculiar , novel , peaceful , refresh ? ing ? or more exactly , here it was . Before this winter is over , I suspect the debacle will have begun . It threatened to begin three years ago , when the Keys were infected by the virus of the great Florida boom . But that tidal wave of lunacy which inun ? dated continental Florida was all but spent before it reached the Keys . True , several real estate developers bought up and improved the vacant eastern half of the island on which Key West lies , andfor a few weeks the excitement spread up and down the Keys . Mangrove swamps and dogwood thickets far from the high ? way , whose owners had paid no taxes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying up , were sud ? denly " being held " at eight hundred dollars an acre . They are still being held , but not at that price ; eight dollars an acre , last year , would have bought half the Keys . I am persuaded that land on the Keys is an excellent investment if you can afford to hold it for some years . All these islands have matchless fishing and a per ? fect climate ; as winter residence sites for people who like warm weather and can do without urban excitements they are beyond all competition . But they will all need a good deal of developing , and till lately they were virtually inaccessible unless you had a yacht . Now the main line of the Keys is open to anybody who has a Ford , and local residents of moder ? ate opinions think that within five years investments along the highway line will pay out . The remoter keys will prob ? ably pay out ultimately ? the late Mr. Clarence Barron predicted that they are destined to be the greatest winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys them now had better figure that he is tying up his capital for the sake of leaving a gold mine to his children . Well , the boom came and went with ? out doing much damage . There is a good deal of empty office space on Duval Street ; streets have been opened and palms planted on the eastern half of the island , in districts where the purchasers of lots are still too busy meeting their payments ? or not meeting their pay ? ments , as the case may be ? to afford to build . Perhaps a dozen scattered bun ? galows , some excellent new schoolhouses built by the city in those optimistic days ? these are the only visible souvenirs of the Great Excitement . But during the boom Key West ( Monroe County , to be exact , but Key West includes most of the taxable property of the county ) bad let itself in for the Overseas Highway . The residents had gone in cautiously at first , voting a few hundred thousand dollars ' worth of bonds at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citi ? zens went up to Miami , and there , entertained by the great Miami develop ? ers , they received a pentecostal visita ? tion of the Miami spirit . I do not be ? lieve this was done in malice ; I think it was a mere ebullience of fraternal gener ? osity , in those days when every Floridian thought all Floridians were going to be multi-millionaires . The growth of Key West ( in the only direction in which Key West can grow ) is bound to hurt Miami . Key West to-day is so different from Miami that one can enjoy them both ; but Key West developed will turn into something like a little Miami ? a little Miami with a far better climate ; and some of the advantages which Miami now enjoys as the most southerly town in the tourist region will be lost if tour ? ists get the habit of going to Key West . None the less , Miami , so far as can be seen from the outside , has shown none of that malice and jealousy toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward San Diego . There are , Miami appears to feel , cus ? tomers enough for all ; or will be when Florida comes back . All the same , when the Miamians shot the Key Westers full of the Miami spirit they ruined Key West . As one of the members of that delegation said afterward , " We went to Miami thinking in dimes and we came back thinking in millions . " And when you think in millions you presently have to worry about how you are going to get your millions back . Monroe County borrowed nearly four million dollars to build the Overseas Highway , on an assessed valuation of about nine millions ? valuation deflated from the boom days but still perhaps a little high . Certain automobile taxes turned over to the county by the state at present pretty nearly cover the interest on the bond issues , and every candidate for governor in last spring 's primary promised to try to persuade the legisla ture to build the bridges over the water gaps , more costly than the road . Mr. Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last year , was credibly reported to have told some of the citizens that the Federal gov ? ernment ought to do it . But even if the state or the nation should take over that part of the job , the cost of the highway is still a pretty heavy burden . When the road opened last winter there was a forty-mile ferry trip in the middle . Road building on some of the intermediate Keys reduced that this season to two ferry trips of seven and twelve miles respectively , considerably speeding up the time of the trip . But all Key West looks forward to the ultimate bridging of the gaps ? and somehow all this must be paid for by the tourist . Obviously , then , your Key Wester must become a booster ; and he has , Not that the town was wholly free from this vice before the road opened ; it used to call itself the Gibraltar of America on the strength of a couple of obsolescent forts that might heat off a cruiser squad ? ron . But what was perfunctory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary of the raucous shouts of the booster , it afflicts you with redoubled pain to hear them in this last resort of peace and quiet , a town whose people have hitherto had the leisure to live and are now doing their best to divest them ? selves of this rare blessing . True , Key Westers are human ; they can hardly be blamed for wanting to live more abun ? dantly . But till lately they did not seem converted to the cardinal American doc ? trine , that large quantities of money are an essential preliminary to the abundant life . ( I do not deny that there is some merit in that doctrine ; but it is not the whole of the Law and the Prophets . ) But they are converts , now that they have gone in the hole four million dollars . And if some few of them have begun to realize that the incursion of the motor tourist means the end of the Key West they have loved , it is too late to do any thing about it now . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infallible , inex ? orable regularity the interest falls due . The first car that came into Key West in January , 1928 , was a car of Jugger ? naut , an ineluctable steam roller driven by the Colossus of the North . Well , you may ask , just what will the motor tourists do to the town ? In the first place they will make it more expen ? sive ; try as the local leaders may to per ? suade the citizens to keep prices down , they can not have more than a partial success . For once tourists come in in numbers , land will be worth more , rents will be higher ; the overhead on every ? thing will go up . That narrow gap which separates the possible enjoy ? ments of the poorest man in Key West from those of the richest man will broaden and broaden and broaden . There may perhaps still be five-cent cigars in Key West three years from now ; there may even still be twenty-five-cent rum , though I should dislike to bet money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be higher , for visitors and residents too . And by that time , Key West will have heard that there is such a thing as a cover charge . Moreover , Key West is not equipped at present to handle tourists in any number . The Casa Marina , owned by the railroad , exists for the railroad trade ? mainly the Havana traffic , though there is a steadily increasing number of seasonal guests . There is a good and modern downtown hotel , one of the lega ? cies of the 1925 boom ; but it is small , and even the motor traffic of the first season , when only twenty or thirty cars came in each day , filled it to overflow ? ing . There must be more hotels ; and above all , if tourists are to stay for the season , there must be cottages and bun ? galows and apartments that can he rented , furnished , for the season . Of these , at present , there are practi ? cally none . So if Key West is to handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building ? new residence sections at first , and pres ? ently the sleepy old-fashioned business district must be rebuilt too . And then some man of vision will rise up and de ? mand that all these rickety old gray wooden shacks be swept out of exist ? ence , and the town freed of an eyesore . And there will be the end of the distinc ? tive color of Key West . Why not ? your booster may object . Must we go on being uncomfortable for the sake of being quaint ? Well , at present they are not uncomfortable ; most of the gray shacks , I suppose , are occupied by Cubans and conchs who are perfectly content with the shelter the shacks afford ; there are at present no mansions in Key West that might make them dissatisfied , and , what is more to the point , few showy modern bungalows . But will the Cuban whose bobbed-haired , bilingual daughter goes to high school and tries to dress like the women she sees in the movies be able to slay in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school friends , down for the winter from the North , live in stucco bungalows ? His house is good enough for him , but his children 's friends will think it is only a shanty . He must have a new house , and he must work harder to pay for it . No more loafing in the caf ? of evenings , gos ? siping with his friends while he smokes a cheap but adequate local cigar . He must undergo the blessings of American civilization . The Key Westers will certainly have to rebuild their town ; the only question is whether the new buildings will fit the local color and the landscape as well as the old . The East Coast bungalow of pink or green or blue stucco distinctly does not fit . On the East Coast it is in place ; it is artificial but so is the land ? scape of the East Coast , or as much of it as is worth looking at ; but here it is as plainly a foreign intruder as a Dutch Colonial cottage . Well . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more unpainted frame shacks ; but happily they are not reduced to that . They have another native building material of far greater value ? the plastic white marl that is the formation underlying the Keys . It can be dredged up soft and shaped in wooden molds ; and pres ? ently it hardens with a hardness surpass ? ing that of concrete . The Casa Marina and one or two other buildings are built of that marl ? still white and dazzling in the atmosphere of this virtually smoke ? less town ? and they belong , they fit the landscape and the spirit of the place ; they are simple , unadorned , starkly beautiful , tropical . A Key West re ? built in marl might have a new color all its own . But I shall he much surprised if within a decade it is not an imitation of an East Coast imitation of a California imitation of the Riviera . For the tourists will not care . Even if you could put Key West as it is behind a fence like a museum exhibit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be un ? fair to car owners as a class , for I am that abhorrent creature , a pedestrian ? a treasonable and atheistic anachronism who has no place in the perfected civili ? zation of this great republic . But among the people who tour by motor I do not perceive ( with , of course , some rare exceptions ) much appreciation of characteristic local differences . The American travels ? some observant for ? eigner has remarked ? not to see , but to be able to go back home and say that he has seen . What he has seen appears to make little difference ; it is not variety he wants but quantity . He can go hack home in the spring and tell his friends that he saw not only St. Petersburg and Sarasota , Orlando and Daytona , West Palm Beach and Miami , but Key West too . And of Key West he will remem ? ber the fish docks and the turtle crawls , the climate and perhaps the cigars ; but of the flavor of the town he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , except perhaps that there is nothing doing there now but that a few live boosters are trying to make it a real town . This is not the a priori conclusion of a soured eccentric ; it is an induction from considerable observation of the Ameri ? can family traveling by automobile . There is a good deal of that feeling among railroad travelers too , but not so much , I think ; and in any case it is the motor tourist who will remake Key West in his own image . The disintegration has already begun . As soon as the road was open civic or ? ganizations set to work to install horse ? shoe-pitching courts , and checkerboards in the City Park , and benches scattered about town where the retired Northerner might sit down and rest his rheumatic bones ? just as in St. Petersburg and West Palm Beach . St. Petersburg and West Palm Beach are worthy towns , good places for the Northerner to spend the winter ; but they are not Key West , they are not different and exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key West will no longer be different and exotic either ; somebody will compel the citizens to paint their houses and the assimilation will be complete . But they ca n't spoil the climate . To that residuary consolation one returns from any survey of Florida ; and now that Florida has definitely annexed the Keys it must be the epitaph on Key West too .
