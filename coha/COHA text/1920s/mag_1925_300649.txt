A Momentons Coming Event <P> Miss Amy Lowell 's great Life of John Keats* is about to appear . I call it a great life , having read a large part of it and found it human , beautifully written , a combination of scholarship and readability that is exceedingly rare . I expect that it will prove as popular as it is highly praised . <P> The amount of work involved in the preparation of such a book as this is almost unbelievable . Only a fine executive , as Miss Lowell is , could accomplish it . It seems to me that as much energy goes into the preparation of a biography as into the founding of a business or the conduct of an important and complicated case at law . Miss Lowell has for many years been interested in the collection of Keatsiana . Her library safe holds one of the best groups of Keats manuscripts and letters in existence . She has not been content to allow any fact , however small , that it was in any way possible to obtain , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear in discovering , and as unusual powers of understanding in interpreting . Recently , in New York City for a brief rest , during the course of which she lectured at Columbia University , she seemed a trifle tired . Small wonder ! Visualize if you can the amount of physical work involved in correcting proofs and verifying quotations in a two-volume work of 600 pages . <P> She has not forgotten her poetry while she has been preparing what will probably prove to be one of the most important biographies ever written by an American , and while she accepted invitations to lecture before various societies of scholars and laymen in England this spring . During the years in which she was writing her life of Keats , she wrote many poems ; in fact , a collection of these will be published this autumn ; and there are her well-known Yankee dialect sketches , one of which , in spite of its verse form , Edward J. O'Brien lists among the fine short stories of the year . These sketches will some day be collected in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she perpetrated her literary hoax , a la her famous ancestor , and fooled the public for many months with A Critical Fable , published first anonymously , finally acknowledged . The Sonnets to Duse should not be forgotten ; they were a glowing tribute to a great genius and a friend . <P> The publication of the Amy Lowell Keats will be one of the momentous literary events of years . <P> T. F. <P> * LIFE OF JOHN KEATS-Amy Lowell-Houghton Miffiin ( 2 vols. $10.00 ) . The book is scheduled to appear in February .
