The report of this 5-4 decision , coming so soon after the rejection of the Child Labor Law , was followed at once by the renewal of three proposals which are steadily increasing in popular favor : 1 ) A constitutional amendment to require a 6-3 decision of the Supreme Court to overrule acts of Congress . 2 ) Senator Borah 's proposed amendment requiring a 7-2 decision to overrule an act of Congress . 3 ) A constitutional amendment which will broadly recognize the right of States and of Congress to exercise their " police power " for social justice . The third proposal , a blanket amendment , would make unnecessary a new amendment for every new piece of social legislation . Many believe the provisions of the Constitution are broad enough now to permit legislation making for social justice . But if five members of the Supreme Court do not think so , let there be an amendment which will satisfy their legal scruples . The Supreme Court has already upheld social legislation based on the police power . Laws regulating hours of labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police power . The Minimum Wage Law would have been tolerated on the same grounds , if Mr. Taft had had his way .
