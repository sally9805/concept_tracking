txt While the Arctic expedition was storm-bound today in the harbor here , only thirty miles from the home port of Wiscasset , Lieut . Commander ' Richard E. kyrd , in command of the party 's naval . aviation unit , defended he record made by the navy 's fliers in the Far North . " The thought that is uppermost in my mind , " he said , " is that though we did not accomplish our mission , our fight with the Arctic  --  the super-human - effort , courage and great efficiency of the handful of men with me  --  was not in vain . " Then lib went on : " Failure or tragedy has been the rule in the-Arctic ... It look - Peary many Mrs to reach the Pole , , : . " Aviation ' haa4litak ; : 1-e'filniiing and it will in a very few years reach its ob'ective . There is no part of the world aviation can not conquer . " With a little more  --  time and a better season than we had , airplanes can penetrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that a plane can be navigated up there . In spite of the great unreliability of the compass needles we have found a way . " The navy has taken a very large part in Arctic exploration and it is fitting Ithat the navy should have had a part in the first attempt to conquer it by air . " Had the navy sent any other planes than the Loening Amphibians , we would not have gotten so far . The plane stood ? ip splendidly and the amphibious quality was a great help . " And so I think that again the great ' National Geographic Society has fathered an expedition tbat  --  has contributed scientific knowledge to the world . " 1 Byrd 's Story of Arctic , From Air . Summing up the accomplishment of the navy 's planes in the Arctic , Lieut . Commander Byrd said : " Being hardly yet in the primer class 1 when it comes to knowledge of the Arctic , I can only give you my impres1 alons gathered from the 3,000 square miles we saw beneath us from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , edies , or near-tragedies , have been the ' rule in Arctic exploration . " Our flights toward Axel Heiberg I Land from Etah took us frequently over the spot where nineteen of Greely 's men 1 met their death . " The first time I looked from 4,000 feet at the rugged coast line where ' Greely 's camp lay , I stuck iy head out lin the windstream so as to get a good view . It was bitterly cold up there in the air that day and the exposed part of my face got numb very soon . " Possibly it was the cold that made it easy to visualize Greely 's camt - bitter cold , hunger , utter desperation , death . I gained at that moment a new respect for the men who have explored the Aretice by dog sledge . Forced Landing Meant Disaster . " A few minutes later I made the following note in my plane log : ' 11:35 P. M. ( nearly midnight ) : the ir , ew is magnificent , but no place to land should the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logboqk  --  you know you ca n't make yourself heard behind a Liberty I motor  --  and wrote across a ps.4 ' Will You fly for a few minureor " As I took the stock , thinking that was just taking my turn to fly , Bennett climbed out on the wing in that cold stream of air and I knew that some : Ithing was wrong with the engine and 1 began to look around for a landing Mace , but there was nothing but jagged and snow-covered mountains and cliffs and water full of rough ice , so that a I forced landing would have been a complete washout . " I saw Bennett tinkering with the oil tank on the starboard fuselage . I knew then from the gauge that the tank was threatened with bursting from excessive oil pressure , from some effect of the 1 cold or some other cause . " Bennett finally got the cap off the oil tank and that relieved the'oll pressure . That was quick and courageous action , typical of the officers and the men that the navy sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little laer , while checking up the nagivation , I wrote the following In my log : " ' Schur is still much off the course . Why ? ' " He seemed to me to be several miles Ito the right . We compared notes later and I found that he thought , that I , too , was off the course , whereas I had been right on it . ? " We found that there seemed to be up there , over Ellesmere Lana. a Kind of optical delusion when gauging the distance of a plane from another plane . In the first place . a plane beneath was more than ordinarily hard to keep track of with a background of rugger : cliffs or broken up ice in the water . " Then the magnitude and the stupendousness of the land formations seemed to make the planes appear very small indeed and no further away than they really are . " Many times I felt quite useless , for the unit did not need a commanding officer to tell them what to do . The biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some sleep and rest . But in spite of me they many times worked all night and reported ready to go the next day . " ' These fellows took out of the planes three 800-pound Liberty motors and put three new ones in their place . I still do n't see how they did it . " And when it came to flying over Ellesmere Land , where a forced landing meant ' curtains , ' they were eager to go . " I am proud of them and their courage anti what they accomplished , even though we did not reach the objective . " " Yet , in spite of the landing conditions and the risky weather and the pitifully short operating time , the men with me flew altogether 5,800 miles on the work of accomplishing the mission out over Ellesmere Land . Bowdoin Almost Drifts Ashore . When the storm was at its height this morning . the fifty-mile gale drove the little schooner Bowdoin. which dropped her anchor last night in Deadman 's Cove . dangerously close to the shore . Commander guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , airplane carrier of the expedition , was tied up at the dock and had no difficulty in riding out the gale . The weather today , which caused the expedition to delay its departure for Wiscaaset , thirty miles away , until tomorrow , was a fair sample of that which the expedition has encountered all the way down from its northern base at Etah , Greenland , eleven degrees from the North Pole . Commander MaeMilian said he had never experienced such bad weather in the Far North or returning from it . Lieut . Commander Byrd , went to the mainland this afternoon , planning to take the first available train to Washington , where he will report for duty in the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics . Jacob Care , another member of the expedition went with him . They braved the rough passage in a yacht piloted by Captain'Brackett. a Monhegan skipper . Although Wiscasset was waiting with its official welcome by Governor Brewster , navy officials ant other dignitaries , Commander Macatillan decided not to hazard the transportation of the fifty friends and relatives of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to greet them . They could be accommodated on the decks of the ships in good weather , but with a combination of high wind , driving rain and heavy sea the voyage would have been rather dangerous . In less than an hour the welcoming relegation bought out the hamlet 's stock of waterproof garments , and , since the hotel is closed , they drew heavily on the reserve food supplies of the residents .
