A PRESIDENT is BORN-Fannie Hurst-Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Story . " Twenty-two sat down to dinner on a Thanksgiving afternoon at four , 1903 , in the House on Sycamore Street . " These were the sons and daughters , the grandsons and granddaughters of Mathilda Schuyler and the Old Gentleman , her husband . It was this coarse , fibrous old man who , at the end of dinner , told the family which he had planted so securely in fertile Ohio : " Your mother , children , God bless her , is going to have a baby . " <P> This baby was David Schuyler . He grew up with his nephews and nieces who were older than himself . In a sense , he was like them , carrying on in his small person many of those clan qualities that made the Schuylers a tough and strenuous unit . But he had added to his mother 's wiry energy and to his father 's clumsy power a delicacy of mind that had never been developed in either of them .

His mother kept for her last child a name that had never belonged to any one else in the family ; so , also , she reserved a special tenderness for David . <P> As David grew up in Centralia he began more and more to understand the broad tolerance , the bitter and sympathetic scepticism that , had they been alloyed with ambition , would have made his brother Henry great as well as splendid . David , possessing that ambition , strengthened it upon his brother 's wisdom . He looked at the World War with the wise critical eyes of early adolescence ; he watched the branches of his family twist and struggle along trellises of suffering and achievement . He worked in the fields of the great farm , fell in love with Dora Tarkington , filled his mind with knowledge . Then a day came when , with Dora and his mother he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sandwiches . When the train came in , David said goodby and boarded it for Springfield . There he would work , study and , afterward , practice law . On that day the story ends . <P> The Method . Author Hurst , desiring to write down a narrative of embryonic genius , was faced with a dilemma . To explicate the later prowess of the boy she writes about , to give to the man 's career , after her history of his boyhood has been concluded , the semblance of truth , to make her fiction about his youth appear to be a biographical rather than an invented recountal , she imagines herself writing the book long after David Schuyler has become President of the U. S. It can be supposed that he became President in about 1950 , that the book is written perhaps 25 years after this . To supply a background of later events that are not included in her story of David Schuyler 's boyhood , Author Hurst quotes , in footnotes , from the imagined diaries of David Schuyler 's sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; perhaps in this book a precedent is born for those pseudo-biographers who bend the lives of great men into bizarre and unlikely curlicues .
