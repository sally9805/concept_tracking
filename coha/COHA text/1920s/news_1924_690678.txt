Smith as a candidate for Governor of New York for the fourth consecutive time . With Governor Smith were renominated Lieut . Gov . George Lunn and the other State officers who were elected with him two years ago . There were cheers for the other candidates as their names were presented , but it was a Smith convention , and the feature of the day was . the Governor 's speech . in which he accepted renomination and announced his intention of making a , vigorous and aggressive campaign . The Governor declared that , the - ono issue of the campaign was " honest . straightforward , progressive , intelligent administration of the affairs of the Government , " and added that , if he understand ' the temper of the American people , they " wanted it restored at Washington and retained at Albany .

" This Is the first official gathering of the Democratic Party and its representatives in this State since the National Convention last July , and it : the excitement of the closing hours of that . convention I was compelled to say only In a feeble way the feeling of apprecia. - ion I had in the bottom of my heart to the delegation from New York State for the faithful . loyal and devoted way that they stood behind me .

" It is exactly twenty-one years ago this month since I was first nominated for elective office . Ever since that time , with the exception of two years that I Was a truckman , I have been constantly in elective office . and no office to which I ever was elected was for a longer term than two years , so all you need is a pencil and a little piece of paper and just add it up and you will find out how many times .

It is true that it only lasts for a month or so . and you see kind of a clear sky ahead from the long . bard labors , but the work of the Governorship never stops . And I hold that it is the most exacting position there is probably today in this country . " Anything that has been said or written I would hate to have you think for a moment any under-estimation by me of the greatness of the office of Governor . I appreciate it to the very , very ? last degree . I do n't think there ever was a man In the history of this State that felt as proud as I did when I was inaugurated Governor cf the State of New York . " In 1920. when the black clouds of defeat were hanging all over the eastern part of the country , I came through in a way that was entirely satisfactory if defeat had to be met. and I can remember a telegram I received front the Chairman of your meeting .

" However , I was unable to answer the arguments of certain of our leaders , because I knew that they were right I know how the country needs the Democratic Party , and I know how much this State needs a continuance of its power . I never ran away from a fight in my life . and I never will while I am able to fight . " Everything that I got of public honor and of public office I got from the Democratic Party , and I owe it to them to lead this fight . and I will lead it as vigorously and as aggressively as I possibly can .

" We have in this country and in this State a Government of parties . How many people know the conditions for office , particularly when they run for the first time , and what marks the line of division as between the parties  --  the fact that the people accept the declaration of political ihinciple set forth in the party platform upon which that condition stands ?

It ca n't be done . I " Take the situation in the State . Who is responsible for the Albany blockade ? Mr. Machold ? No . He could n't do that . " Mr. Machold comes from the village of Ellisburg , up in Jefferson County . Pretty nearly all the legislation that he helped to destroy was of benefit to the people of his own section ; part of it affected other sections of the State . The Republican Party is responsible , because he carried out to the letter the wishes of the leaders of that party , and , as a reward he is retired to private life .

That would be a fine state of affairs . Says a Myth and a same Ca n't Win .

" While we are on the subject of platforms , let me congratulate this Democratic convention upon the forceful document that you have put forth . as the platform for the Democratic Party  --  no equivocation ; no bunk , no ambiguity , right- straight from the shoulder ? an honest , straightforward declaration of political principle that every one of us will take a certain amount of delight in standing upon and defending in the face of any kind o ars a.rmament .

I feel grateful , grateful to this conven- : lion for its overwhelming expression of confidence in me from the very bottom of nay heart . " And on this public platform today I renew the promise I made to many Democratic conventions in the past : I will make it my business to see that you will never regret it .

How cap he help it when the Republican Convention yesterday did everything It could to help him ? " a After several other seconding speeches , Governor Smith was nominated unanimously on the roll-call and an elevenminute demonstration .

The Rev. John McCrary of Syracuse pronounccd the benediction and the convention adjourned sine die . The candidate renominated today will be officially notified at the National Democratic Club . New York City , at noon on Oct. 3 by a committee headed by John P. Sullivan of Erie County . Democratic leaders after the convention expressed confidence that the State ticket would be victorious in the corning election and declared that Governor Smith. , through his speech to the delegates , had given the campaign an impetus which would result in one of the most enthusiastic campaigns ever engaged in by the Democratic Party . " This Is a magnificent ticket , " dedared Senator Royal S. Copeland . " It led us to victory in the election two years ago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of their wonderful record of accomplishment while in office . " Governor Smith put it very effectively when he said that the Republican Party had a myth In Washington as a candidate and but a name for Governor in this State .

Roosevelt said : " It 's a splendid ticket and I feel , just as I did two year. * ago , that it will be successful on the coming election day .
