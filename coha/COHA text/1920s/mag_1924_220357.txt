There arrived in the U. S. a Japanese Commission , established to examine the trial-by-jury system of the Occident . Among the members Were M. Minagawa , Attorney General of Japan ; M. Toyomizu , Justice of the Court of Appeals of Tokio , and M. Iwamura , Councilor and Secretary to the Minister of Justice . After leaving the U. S. , the Commission will proceed to Britain , France , Germany and Italy , to conduct further investigations into the application of trial-by-jury in the courts of those countries . <P> In the land of the Empire of the East , the Judge is the all-powerful factor in the courts . He decides the guilt of a prisoner and sentences him according to the law , no matter if that sentence be one of death . <P> Speaking of the trial-by-jury system , M. Minagawa said : " Our first impression of the system is that cases can not be tried as quickly before a jury as when a judge is the only one before whom the facts are placed . Then , too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are accustomed to seeing . However , we sat through several cases in San Francisco , and in each instance we agreed among ourselves that the juries ' verdicts were the same as ours would have been , if any one of us were acting as judge .
