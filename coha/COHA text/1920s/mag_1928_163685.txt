When one boxer fouls another the profession of boxing is also fouled ; when judges hand out a bad decision the profession is given a figurative black eye . Last week in the sixth round of an elimination light heavyweight fight at Ebbets Field , Brooklyn , Leo Lomski , roundheaded Pole , hit hatchet-faced Pete Latzo in the groin . While Latzo writhed on the canvas the crowd rioted , felled one spectator with a cane , then trampled him until stopped by policemen . Two nights later , at Coney Island , N. Y. , George Courtney , middleweight , after thrashing David Shade for ten rounds , saw with amazement the referee give the decision to Shade who , barely able to sit up , smiled broadly but painfully with a cut mouth in a face pounded raw by blows and crimsoned with blood flowing from a cut over the left eye and on the bridge of the nose .
