In London , that foggy , busy , chilly , Christian city , Daya Hewaviarne , manager of the Maha Bodhi Society , announced that there would soon be built a temple to Buddha , the God who squats in the stuffy temples of Asia , to whom unhurried Buddhists babble their patient prayers . This first English temple to Buddha will make no effort to attract converts but will cater to present Buddhists now resident in London . The Buddhist priests will be dressed in robes of orange color . The temple will fly the Buddhist flag . This is an emblem in six hues , blue , red , yellow , white , orange , and a combination of all five , for when Buddha discovered knowledge , under a Bo tree , he found himself surrounded by an aurora containing these bright and wonderful colors.
