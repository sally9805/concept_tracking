0N our way to the office last Thursday we met Mr. Charles E. Hughes at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street as the traffic was changing . The former Secretary of State was being given a frightful bawling out by a Luxor taxi driver . " Where in hell are you going ? " asked the driver . Mr. Hughes refused to make any statement . ITTLE boys and girls with very I very short dresses and trousers are appearing in Central Park again , which means that society is coming back to us . To our mind , not by any means the least charming part of society is its offspring . The smart note is still to show as much chubby thigh as possible . It is a Paris style . Even three years ago in the Tuileries , Gallic ingenuity had contrived costumes little short of amazing . Although our nurses and seamstresses are doing well , they have a long way to go yet before they catch up to the French .

THE Fall shows , bright though they may he , will have to he exceptional to furnish art circles with more chuckles than did one of the last of the Spring , a private view which was attended by a goodly group of notables , among them Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney and Mr. George Luks . It was Mr. Luks 's conceit at this show to follow Mrs. Whitney , who is the sculptress , wherever she went , hanging on her remarks as though entranced . Eventually , this wore on Mrs. Whitney 's nerves . Icily , she inquired , " Would you be so good as to tell me , Mr. Luks , why you are following me around the gallery so per-sistently ? " The whimsical George bowed humbly . " If you really want to know , Mrs. Whitney , " he murmured , " It 's because you 're so frightfully rich . " First Nights TWENTY-FIVE years ago , Mr. Al Woods 's first nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model , " but last week his was the distinguished premiere of the season ; a play so eagerly sought after that even in a week providing twelve openings , speculators were offering five hundred dollars for twenty tickets to " The Green Hat " ? offers Mr. Woods piously rejected . Moreover , so keen was the desire for seats in the Broadhurst that the messenger carrying a pair to Mr. Max Steuer was waylaid and tricked out of his envelope , just as though it had contained a mere million dollars worth of negotiable securities . It was the maddest week any of us remembers in the theatre . There were " The Vortex " and " No , No Nannette " the night after " The Green Hat , " among the more important of the dozen , and on Thursday , " First Flight " at the Plymouth , by which time the inveterate first-nighters had seen each other often enough to give some attention to the play . And there was also , on Monday , the Theatre Guild 's presentation of " Arms and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser fry simply were lost sight of completely . TO Mr. Woods 's , as I have said , were the honors of the week , such is the flare for Mr. Michael Arlen and the lady whose tiger-tawny hair is raven black on the stage . Yet , as the advertisements have it , there is always a touch of yesterday about what Mr. Woods does to-day . For all the Hispano Suiza off-stage and the Rolls-Royces outside , the genial Al could not forget wholly the friends of other days ; and such friends as will appear in no blue book except when the telephone company chooses this color for one of its volumes . But , of course , there were the elect , also , in droves . That young Mr. Arthur Bachrach , late of Princeton and the Triangle Club and now engaged in glorifying the male necktie , lent his benign presence . He is , I believe , the most consistent of first nighters outside the ranks of the critics ; the logical successor , in this respect at least , to the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elderly and mysterious gentleman  --  name unknown to any of the many who have seen him , and age generally estimated at sixty  --  who bowed that grande dame , his mother , to her seat with all the courtly elegance of an Eighteenth Century beau . There were Mr. Gilbert Miller , most consistent of the managers at premieres , and Mr. Ray Goetz , and Miss Irene Bordoni , and Mr. Irvin Berlin  --  and , indeed , every bigwig of Broadway , as well as many of the two Avenues . The most distinguished first night Mr. Woods has ever known ; and yet , as observed before , there is always a touch of yesterday in what Mr. Woods does to-day , THERE are definite standards for first night audiences , and among these , Mr. Sam Harris sets his highest . If there is doubt about any applicant for tickets , the Social Register is held at hand for final assay . - Mr. Winthrop Ames is another who places stress on the quality of his first audiences , as do Mr. Belasco , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for recognition by the Last , one must have had four mentions in the society columns , have made , say , five visits to Miami or Palm Beach , and , further , one must possess the prestige of two visits to Deauville . All theatrical managers , however , pay their social debts with invitations to first nights , a gracious payment , indeed , in these days when dinners are many but amusements are few . It is noteworthy , too , that the learned Justices of the Supreme Court are on every manager 's list . And first night tickets arc not , as may be supposed , free . Some newspaper critics even pay for their extra guests . As well do the actors and the author . And whatever the producer may do by way of complimentary presentations of seats , is an item to be entered under withdrawals in his personal checking account . Issuance of passes starts after the premiere . Such is the custom .

He will tell you that , once , the tickets for a first night were allotted to the clubs , and the members took their families . You used to see the Vanderbilt and the Whitney boys , Billy Jerome , Stanford White , Samuel Adams Clarke , Jack Fallensby , Freddy Gebhard , James Poor , No comparison to-day , sir ; nothing like it . And the critics  --  a poor lot . Only three out of the grand company remain : Alan Dale , Charles Pike Sawyer and James Metcalfe . And it may be as the elders tell ; who can say ? Yet , twenty-five years hence , doddering ancients ourselves , we shall probably find ourselves informing some young whipper-snapper that he does n't know what he 's talking about  --  why Julia Hoyt in that rose gown , or Alec WooIlona rotoundly advising some fair young thing to be less sexy  --  those , my boy , were the days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second entr'acte , Mr. Charles Hanson Towne was discoursing with friends as to what had gone thus far in " The Green Hat " when an impressive limousine slid slowly up to the curb . " There is the height of nonchalance , " murmured Mr. Towne . " A gentleman arriving for this opening after the second act . " The limousine 's passenger dismounted and strode quickly into the theatre . It was Mr. Michael Arlen . Mr. Arlen , they say , had never seen a complete performance of his play to that date . He had seen an act in Detroit and another in Chicago . Even the opening in town did not enable him to complete his acquaintance with his own work . Nervousness , they say . Diamonds FOR picturesqueness , those of the old order always can cite Diamond Jim Brady in a dispute , and there can be no rebuttal . We have no first nigh ter to-day whose shirt front glows so magnificently ; certainly none who goes to the extreme of carrying unset diamonds loosely in his pockets for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for unset stones gave Mr. Brady a fright one night when , with kindred souls , he was travelling in the private car of Charles Sanger Mellen , then President of the New Haven . The company dined well and , afterwards , partook of the contents of many tall glasses , while they were marvelling at the beauty of the dia- moslynd.s Mr. Brady handled so carelesPresently , the party retired . Mr. Brady ambled to his stateroom . He reached for the switch . It did not work . Grumbling , he undressed in the dark , and threw back the covers . Before him then danced a hundred glittering shafts . He reached for them but they eluded him . Again and again . They climbed the steel walls of the stateroom . " Porter , " he screamed frantically , " porter ! " But the porter did not come , nor did anyone else until the joke had worn ofF and Diamond Jim Brady 's companions were pleased to inform him they had placed fireflies in his bed . Standards A FRIEND who lately returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there delightfully and quite inexpensively , in a good-sized farmhouse which he rented . Property is cheap enough for outright purchase . A good-sized chateau and several acres of ground may be bought for the same sum as would swing a six-room bungalow in the Stamford section . But , for shorter stays , leasing a place is preferable . There was only one disadvantage to renting ; the plumbing was , to put it most mildly , primitive . When he leased the place my friend proposed installing a bathroom in the smallest of the bedroms , a proposal he advanced to his landlord with the bright good will of the tenant who is going to improve the owner 's property . Strangely , the owner of the house objected strenuously , and , when his " What do you mean by coming in this time of the morning and waking me up ? " " Why , you worm , you told me distinctly you would n't be back until after breakfast yourself !

I offer in evidence the tale given me by one of the members of the New York Symphony staff , lately returned from a tour of the provinces with Dr. Damrosch 's orchestra . In a North Carolinian city , the local committees , Rotarians , Chamber of Commerce and the like , met to decide upon a form of welcome for the visiting musicians which would sustain the South 's reputation for cordiality . At last they hit upon the ideal plan . When the tired members of the orchestra tumbled from their car , they were met by the blare of fourteen wind instruments , tortured in the dissonances of the Shriners ' Brass Band . Discipline THE Transport Henderson , recently arrived from the West Coast , brought into port the Secretary of the Navy and Mrs. Wilbur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naval officers ' wives were playing bridge on deck . One of the ladies , in the excitement of a redouble , lighted a cigarette . An instant or two later , Mrs. Wilbur , chancing by , removed the solacing brand from the tray where it had been laid and dropped it gingerly into the sea . " Tut , tut , " she said . " Smoking on the Sabbath ! " Another time there was a dance . After the party the ladies who had acted as hostesses were preparing to pass out the remnants of the refreshments to the sailors who had acted as waiters , etc . Again the first lady of the Admiralty appeared in a nick of time . Intercepting a plate which was intended for an innocent sailor , she called aside the wife of an officer of the fleet : " My dear ! How do you expect us to maintain the discipline of the Navy ? " The officer 's wife said she did n't know . Charity RUPERT HUGHES has disposed IA- of his big country place near Bedford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of the furnishings . At the outset , the prices were not very commanding . Mr. Hughes had not gone in for antiques , and that is a fatal mistake in northern Westchester if one ever intends to break up housekeeping and sell off . The auctioneer and his followers invaded the author 's studio , and a dictaphonewhich sheds some light on the present modes of literary composition  --  went for $9 . An expensive , but distressingly modern , rosewood desk yielded little better than cartage , and then a picture was brought to the block . Eventually three dollars was bid . " For the third and last time . Do I hear a quarter ? " Mr. Hughes , who had been watching the progress of events with dismay , thought his moment had came to intervene . " May I say a word ? This drawing is an original by James Montgomery Flagg , presented to me by the artist . It was made to illustrate one of my hooks . A few days ago a similar one was sold on Fifth Avenue for $150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bidding was resumed with spirit , and did not cease until Mr. Flagg 's original brought $4 . Mr. Hughes effaced himself , and strolled through his old living room . THE NEW YORKER 5 A rural Episcopal rector was admiring a magnificent couch which must have cost its owner a chapter of a successful serial . " Do you like it ? " asked Mr. Hughes . " Oh , yes indeed , " replied the clergyman . " It is yours . " much a contradiction in terms as its owner , Commendatore Fortune Gallo . The company is , as a whole , poorly paid ; it goes in for cheap scenery . Withal , it gives usually a first-rate performance . Signor Gallo will ask you to dinner and regale you with luxury . Next time , if he is in the throes of one of his periods of economy  --  personal as well as business  --  he will take you to a table d'hote where the sixty-five cent charge is outrageously high . In the long , hard road he has travelled in twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting expenses ; and what he has learned he practices ruthlessly . Yet , he is the major hope of young singers , young composers , and young conductors . More than a few of them owe to him their first chance to make public appearances . He is sincere in his wish to help beginners along . Besides , it helps keep the salary lists down . Probably , his San Carlo Company will make money at the Century , where more magnificent enterprises have been flat failures . It is meet that it should be so ; for if we are to have native opera , it must he hardy enough to flourish when chill winds blow .
