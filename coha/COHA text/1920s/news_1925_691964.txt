txt The revolt of youth is resulting in a kind of slavery  --  the very worst kind , according to reports of what President RICHMOND said to his Union College class of ' 29 . It is the predicameAt of those who have repudiated all authority in an effort to " live their own lives "  --  the authority of parents , of college Faculties , of the statutory and the moral law  --  only to find that their own lives are fearfully and wonderfully undervitalized . It was at a neighboring institution that Dr. RICHMOND discovered young men who could not dress in the morning unless some one turned on the victrola . But the home truths he tells are a sufficient revelation . J. ! Students have to be trans " Ported across the campus lest they " arrive ' at their classes in a state of " physical exhaustion .

" They are limbs of Satan  --  and , as aforesaid , of slavery : This is a new complaint against the American college man . Doubtless it served its amiable purpose of amusing the freshmen . But doubtless also it had a philosophic implication that eluded telegraphic transmission . Only the disillusioned know how large a share of our ? moral and intellectual strength , even of our physical wellbeing , we receive , as if by induction , from the tonic atmosphere of college , school and home  --  and , first but not least in potency , from the nursery . A world of some maturity has found certain folkways salutary . It does not itself know just why . Often in insisting on the mores it is extravagantly absurd . One of the first signs of intelligence and spirit is to question too ready judgments and resist authority . But the youth who acts upon his own unaided impulses has need of abundant inward strength or he , wilts like an uprooted plant .

In our colleges , as elsewhere of late , there has been somewhat too much of this dead-wire radicalism . Among those who were amused by Dr. Rich:worm there were doubtless the usual number of predestined Phi Beta Kappa men and of candidates for the eleven and the nine . The two groups deserve to be studied . One is dear to the Faculty , the other to the undergraduate . Neither has the unfailing approval of the champions of the other group . Yet this much can be said for the athlete , that he does not require to be jrmed into his shirt . Nor does the " poler " ' or grind wait for . a sedan to Convey him to ' Wages . Such thoughts should console those who have taken Dr. , RICHMOND 'S light-hearted satire too seriously . They should also afford reflection to a Faculty that has not always valued what JOWETT affectionately called " the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led Balliol men to cast stones - through his windows .
