txt In a dramatic speech at a dinner given tonight by the French Government in honor of the American Legion , Premier Poincare pleaded for the cooperation of the Legionaires and the country they represent in the international effort to prevent another world war . Supporting his moving plea , the head of the French Government quoted the words of President Wilson as he was about to embark for the United States on June 21 , 1919 . " The late war has been very great , " ? said'Mr . Wilson , " but it has awakened mankind to the moral necessity of completing the unity required among men in order that never shall such an evil occur again . " Premier Poincard 's appeal preceded a speech by Commander Howard P. ' Savage in which the chief of the Legion emphasized the purpose of the American Legion to promote " 100 per cent . Americanism .

" That is why we are here today . for that irresistible instinct which draws a man back to the home of his childhood has brought the Legion back to Paris , the scene of its-birth . " We did not need the kind words of officials to make it known to us that we are welcome . The trees , the sky , the very green fields themselves , smiled greetings to us , and , yes , the rain itself as it came pattering down , made us realize that we are in the beloved land once more .

" It would clearly not have come to this grave determination if it had not considered France , England , Belgium , Italy  --  and the rest of the Allies as champions of a just cause , and held it to be its duty to join them in their fight for the salvation of free nations .

" In June . 1919 , when President Wilson paid me his parting visit , I observed to him that true peace would only be evolved by a continuous creation , and added : ' We will not forget that , after the blood that has been shed and all the ruins that have been accumulated , we united our efforts in an attempt to secure a fair status for outraged humanity and to raise a lasting monument to universal peace . ' " To which the President replied with that immortal remark that unity among men must be maintained ; that such a terrible war shall not occur again .

" The conclusion of the Premier 's speech was the signal for prolonged applause by the Legionaires from the far corners of the great dinner hall of the Hotel Palais d ' Orsay , taking up the familiar Legion cry . The room was ' a mass of color , of red , white and blue , and the banners of every State in the Union hung from the walls . Outside an American flag measuring 200 feet , done entirely in electric lights , covered the entire front of the hotel . Savage Tells of Naming Legion .
