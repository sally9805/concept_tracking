Although the " steel barometer " has failed to register a decline so far , it is still possible that somebody may be holding a match under it . Elsewhere in business , the earmarks of a new downward " trend " seem plainly apparent . Not only have commodity prices as a whole registered their first decline for many months , but in the speculative markets the drop has been especially severe . Even the much-heralded intention to advance steel prices has apparently been abandoned . Thus it may be that the recent advance of the New York Reserve rediscount rate will mark a " turn " in business from expansion to contraction . Moreover , some lines of business , such as the textiles , have been poor all along . <P> Merchants look , and not without sound evidence , for a generally profitable spring . Beyond that , the outcome will depend largely on the size and profitable character of our major crops and the situation abroad .                 @ @ @ @
