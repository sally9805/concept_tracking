THE HILL OF HAPPINESS- George N. Bhuster-Appleton ( $1.75 ) , The Franciscan monastery of these quaint tales might as well be in Renaissance Perugia as where it is in fact , modern California . Ineredible as it may seem , no modern note steals in , unless a circus , wet concrete or an ichthyosaurus may be called modern . St. Bonaventure 's is as little concerned with the outside world as it is with the early lives of its members - now all disguised as Brother Benedict , Brother Cosmos and the like ( no Brothers Pete , Mike , Joe or Henry ) . The village , where the author grew up , is of a similar unworldliness - perhaps a thought too Arcadian since the villagers oscillate between the modern vernacular and a strong resemblance to Hans the blacksmith , ; Schwartz the butcher and other such traditional creatures . But out of his acquaintance with real monks Mr. Shuster has wrought an atmosphere of which the charm is quite beyond cavil , even the well-nigh inescabable air of proselyting being warded off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel in the garden ; a dream reconciles them . They argue of a prehistoric monster ; the Father Superior sends them to the circus , which they miss through absentmindedness , forgetting their monster with their destination . Not by grace but by slices of red beef does Brother Exuper tame the fearsome mastiff . The monument achieved by Brother Giles , after unseemly longing , is his huge foot print in a new cellar floor . By such simple means is the essence of a faith distilled , not for the saints but for the love of art .
