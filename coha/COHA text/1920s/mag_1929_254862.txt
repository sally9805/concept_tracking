South Shore Jews <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue dated Nov. 25 , p. 56 , in the lower right hand corner , there is the following : SOUTH SHORE COUNTRY CLUB <P> ( Many a Jew ) <P> As a subscriber to your paper and a member of the Jewish faith I am interested in knowing the significance of the statement , " Many a Jew . " <P> ALBERT E. KAYE <P> Longview , Wash . <P> As everyone knows , Jews are discriminated against in many a leading U. S. country club . Knowing this not to be the case at the famed South Shore club , TIME mentioned it as of incidental news-interest. - ED . <P> Greek Cinema <P> Sirs : You have been making a lot of printers ' errors - the Greeks have the real lowdown on how to spell American names to produce the right pronunciation : F ? ? ? ? T ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? TS - Fox Movietone News ? ? ? ? ? ? TI ? - The last name of Mr. Samuel Goldwyn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dove ? ? ? ? ? ? S ? ? - Al Jolson . <P> MANFRED GOTTFRIED <P> Athens , Greece <P> Buglers <P> Sirs : <P> Americans hear and read so often of the French view , that the horde of tourists from the United States annually visiting that country are loud , ill-bred , uncouth and make a vulgar display of money , that one wonders why the " retort courteous " is not more often resorted to . <P> During several trips to Paris , the writer has been often annoyed , and frequently amused at what seems to be a favorite indoor sport of the French people . At meal times in the restaurants and hotels at table , it seems to be a universal custom for some Frenchman to blow a loud blast upon his nasal appendage ( regularly called " bugle " in the United States ) . <P> This habit or custom is very impressive , because it always occurs when perfect quiet otherwise prevails . The one able to blow the loudest blast is always rewarded by grateful smiles and looks of indulgence from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between those possessed of unusual ability in this regard , and if the successful one receives a prize or a decoration in honor of the memorable occasion . <P> It must be admitted that Americans are vastly outdistanced and outclassed by the French in this branch ( breach ) of etiquette . <P> JOHN J. FOSTER <P> Del Rio , Texas . <P> Pennsylvania 's Reed <P> Sirs : <P> As public-spirited Pennsylvanians and firm constituents of Senator David A.
