Death came last week to Desir-Joseph Cardinal Mercier . At it the dying one looked with composure , with a clear mind , a peaceful mind . For days he knew he had no further earthly hopes . Three weeks before , under a local anesthetic , he had been operated upon for a stomach ulcer ; and he had watched the operation with the understanding gained in his early days as a medical student . He had seemed to rally . But the long precedent persistent dyspepsia , which had made nutrition insufficient for " his active life , had been an incubus to his strength . Food he swallowed he could not assimilate. * Indirect feeding , and his powerful will-to-live , sustained him until that day . That Saturday morning the death passion set in . To his sagging jaw , as he lay propped up on his white pillows in the clinic of St. Jean in Brussels , a sad nursing sister held tenderly the rubber tube from the tank of oxygen standing on the bedside table . Consciousness did not leave him entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrowful , pain-wracked figure of the Crucified . He saw his two nephews , Father Joseph Mercier and Professor Charles Jean Mercier , of Notre Dame in South Bend , Ind . He smiled wanly at them . <P> Father Mercier , in a low voice , said mass for his dying uncle . At the moment of the Agnus Dei , with its supplication to the Lamb of God , " who takest away the sins of the world , " to give him peace , the dying one inclined his head as a token of peaceful leave of those around him . He tried to pronounce the benediction , but was too weak . His thin , transparent hand moved through the sign of the cross with effort . He was certain of death ; had been refusing all medicines . Towards the last , attendants thought they heard him whisper " . . . rien qu'attendre . . . " About two o'clock in the afternoon he went into a deep coma . The oxygen did no good . Kneeling and holding in the Cardinal 's clasp a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Community of Morey , kneeling , held the other hand . Both prayed softly for the soul of their superior . <P> At three o'clock , as twilight set tled over quiet Brussels , his hollow-cheeked , highbrowed , thin-haired head fell forward on his chest . He was dead . <P> Outside the bells of Saint Gudule moaned the grief of the world . Women who had been praying for hours in the street outside the clinic crossed themselves once again ; rose with stiffened knees and chilled bodies . " Requiem in aetemam dona eis , Domine , " prayed all society . Lying in state at Malines on Sunday , the frail old body was approached with reverence by a long queue . They touched the hems o ? hio robes , they brough/ pious tokens and keepsakes for the cold fingers to brush . Toward evening the line still stretched far down the dusky avenue . There was rioting before the doors were shut . The funeral was to take place during the week , probably a state funeral , Belgium 's fourth. * <P> Desir-Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was one of those rare men who in youth so thoroughly foresee their life work that the desiccating years can not warp the fulness of their ideals , can scarcely shrivel even their bodies . Yet his disease did waste him to scarcely 100 pounds .
