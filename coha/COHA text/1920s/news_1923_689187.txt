txt Judging from reports sent out by press agencies in Mexico City , a quick settlement of the differences between Mexico and the United States is imminent and to be imI mediately followed by formal recognition . These reports are almost unmixed humbug . The so-called " recOgnition conference " is a step in the right direction , but much water must yet run over the wheel before Mexico becomes a safe investment field for foreign capital . Mexico saw fit in 1917 to adopt a new constitution , which is now the organic.law of that country , . It follows , therefore , that however much the executive branch of the government , or even the people , may desire recognition by the United States they are governed by that law . In the law is a provision confiscatory of titles to sub-soil wealth , even though honestly and legitimately acquired before the constitution was adopted .

Writers from Mexico City have " settled " this matter , in a way satisfactory to themselves if to no one else . The Supreme Court of Mexico , they say , has decided that Article 27 is not retroactive . Thus they have removed thei great bar to recognition . But it was slkown in these columns a year ago that the very decisions referred to did not cover the point at issue at all , and so far as an assurance to foreign capital they were utterly valueless . The Department of State at Washington sees only one way of giving capital any assurance whatever in Mexico , and that is by a treaty between the two countries in which Mexico will guarantee  --  that Article 27 shall not have a retroactive effect . The Mexican President has flatly refused to entertain such a proposal . Meanwhile the constitutional provision stands , and it is to be expected that government as well as people will obey it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mexico manifests a willingness to enter into such a treaty it will be time to talk of recognition .
