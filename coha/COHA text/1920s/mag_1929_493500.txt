Will the Young Plan Work ? ' THE Dawes Plan had not tested Germany 's capacity to pay , but only Germany 's capacity to borrow . Why , then , was it felt necessary to call a new conference of experts and ' develop a new plan ? If the Dawes Plan was an experiment to test Germany 's capacity , . why not let it run until we could see whether Germany could develop an export surplus , and if so , how large a surplus ? Or , if she could not develop such a surplus , why not let it run until we could see whether Germany could continue to borrow , year after year , enough to meet her reparation obligations ? The official statement of the necessity for revision did not meet these points squarely . It spoke of the desirability of giving Germany a " definite task " ? that is , of fixing the total amount for which Germany was to be liable , something which the Dawes Plan left open . The assumption was that if Germany knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would get rid of the incubus as 1 This is the second of a series of articles . The third will be published nett week , and will deal with the International Bank.soon as possible . The other expressed reason was the desirability of getting rid of political control by the Allies over German tax-collections , and over the transfer of reparation funds . It assumed that the " transfer protection " ? providing for the cessation of transfers if the exchange value of the mark were affected ? ought to be abolished . But how could these things be safely done , if Germany 's real capacity to pay were not definitely known ? The experts who met to frame the Young Plan were thus faced with a dilemma . They were supposed to make a final settlement . They were supposed to fix a definite amount for Germany to pay and a definite term for the annuities . They were supposed to remove the whole issue from the realm of political controversy , and to fix payments which could be so certainly made that no transfer protection would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could know how large the payments could safely be . Was this not an absurd task to give to any body of experts ? There must have been a compelling reason for such an absurdity . And the reason probably was a knowledge of the real failure of the Dawes Plan . If it continued much longer , one of two results was certain . Either reparation payments would shrivel and cease , and the whole structure would collapse , or foreigners would go on lending money to German governments and institutions until the total German indebtedness would threaten national bankruptcy , through inability to meet the service of the commercial debt and to retire it . One more experiment was necessary to see if there was any way out of this dilemma . Germany must be put rigidly on her own . A " final " ( and much smaller ) total must be fixed for her reparation indebtedness . It must be pretended that this decision was non-political and subject to no revision . Then Germany might , by some hook or crook , devise ways of paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germans and others . Only by pretending that a settlement was not an experiment , could a real experiment be made . It is not necessary to accuse the experts of conscious double-dealing in order to suspect that some such consideration as this underlay the calling of the conference . They worked with the utmost perspicacity and good faith . Brought down to realities , they were for a long time on the brink of failure to report . Their final recommendations were amazingly ingenious . One of the most important puzzles of the Young experts was to make an adjustment between the reparation sums demanded by the politicians and by public opinion in the Allied countries , and the much smaller total which would be necessary if Germany were to be given a fixed and definite task . It must be remembered that Germany , in the fifth year of the Dawes Plan , had been paying the standard annuity of 2,500,000,000 marks . Something like this total must be included in the new plan , if public opinion were to accept it . But it was far too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted was to divide the annuities into two distinct parts ? " non-postponable " and " postponable . " The non-postponable part is intended to provide the interest on bonds which may be sold to the public for cash , and so may immediately wipe out , at a discount , a large part of the indebtedness to the Allied governments . This device of " mobilization " or " commercialization " of the reparations debt had been discussed for a long time , as a means of simultaneously reducing it , and getting it out of the realm of inter-governmental relations . But the amount which could by any stretch of the imagination be so mobilized was not large enough to satisfy the Allies . Hence there was added to it the " postponable " part of the annuities , which are not to be commercialized by bond issues . The non-postponable payments amount to 660 , - 000,000 marks a year . They are to continue for thirty-seven years , and then are to cease . This is assunied to be the term of the bond issues on which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be raised within Germany by a direct tax on the railroads , enjoying priority over any other tax or charge . They are to be paid in foreign currencies ? that is , the marks collected within Germany wherewith to pay this amount must be exchanged . This is the solid part of the settlement , the " definite task . " The postponable part of the annuities varies from year to year , rising from 1,137,400,000 marks in the second year to 1,176,800,000 marks in the thirty-seventh year . From then on , they run for twenty-two years more . By some curious coincidence , their amounts are almost identical with the amounts which the Allies will have to pay the United States in retirement of the War debts , and the term for which they are to run is the same . By another curious coincidence , the Allies consent to reduce them if the United States should consent to reduce their War debt payments . The funds for these postponable annuities are to be obtained entirely from the German budget for the first thirty-seven years . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay them . These annuities may be postponed for a maximum period of two years by the consent of a special committee including the governors of the central banks of the four chief countries concerned , if German exchange and economic life are seriously endangered by their collection and transfer . What will happen if the danger lasts beyond the maximum period , the experts ' report does not specify . Such an eventuality may be left to the imagination . It is easy to see how III unsubstantial are the postponable part of the annuities . Most discerning economists would be as much astonished if they continue to be paid as they would have been if the original tremendous sums fixed for reparations , before the Dawes Plan , had been paid . It is on the cards that Germany will sooner or later be unable to transfer them , and that the occasion will be utilized for a renewed drive to revise or cancel the remaining part of the Allied War debts to the United States . The Allies have , in effect , admitted that they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how about the non-postponable annuities ? How safe will it be for investors to buy bonds for which these are to provide the interest ? It is true that 660,000,000 marks is only a little more than one-quarter of what Germany paid during the fifth Dawes year . On the other hand , pre-war Germany had a favorable balance in her international accounts of only about 400,000,000 marks a year . This was the sum which she used to put into new foreign investments . Only by considerable pulling in of the belt could pre-War Germany have met such an annual charge as 660,000,000 marks . We have seen that the War greatly injured GerNovember 13 , 1929 THE NEW many 's capacity to pay by depriving her of territory which produced large amounts of iron and steel and other manufactures which could be exported , by necessitating greater imports of food , by literally decimating her foreign investments , and by injuring her shipping . Since the Dawes Plan , another handicap has arisen , of even greater magnitude . Germans have borrowed , all told , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high interest rates . These securities were sold at a discount , and the banking and flotation agencies retained a large share of the money so raised . While this money was flowing into Germany , it enabled her to meet reparation and all other foreign obligations . But if the flow should cease today , Germany would have to pay out a large sum annually to her post-war creditors , aside from reparations . Herr Schacht , President of the Reichsbank , estimated the amount of interest on these loans , at the end of 1928 , at about 1,000,000,000 marks . This sum alone is more than twice as large as the German surplus of annual foreign payments before the War . It raises the total annual net payment across her borders to 1,660 , - 000,000 marks ? unless she keeps on borrowing more every year than she has to pay in interest and amortization . But the more she borrows , the larger the interest and amortization grow , and the more serious the eventual crisis becomes . With the interest on the reparation bonds a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their transfer in case the exchange value of the mark should fall , where do the post-War lenders to Germany come in ? Indeed , if the effort to pay them , by failing , created an economic crisis in Germany , how could the interest on- the reparation bonds themselves be paid ? There is a school of thought which attributes the failure of Germany to develop an export surplus under the Dawes Plan to the transfer protection itself . Before Germany can ship out a net surplus of goods and services , they argue , it is necessary for the exchange value of the mark to fall . When it falls , that means that it is cheaper for foreigners to buy goods in Germany than elsewhere . That means that tourists and others can get more for their dollars , francs or pounds by living in Germany than elsewhere . Internal German prices would rise if the mark should fall , it is true , but experience ? as in France a few years ago ? demonstrates that for a while they could not rise so rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , combined with the rise of internal prices , would encourage foreign consumption and decrease domestic consumption at the same time . It would direct German productive resources into export channels . And this outflow of exports would help to keep the mark from falling too low . Whether this can happen in the present instance is one of the tests which the Young Plan is expected to make . But whether it can happen depends , of course , upon whether Germany can within a sufficiently brief period produce the necessary goods for export . This little twist of economic theory can not get us far from the fundamental question concerning Germany 's physical capacity to bring forth and ship out a surplus . And here lies the last hope of the optimists . Have the billions of new capital flowing into Germany sufficiently enlarged and improved her plants and machinery , and the ability to turn out goods per labor hour , to meet the demands that will be placed upon her ? From the beginning , economic authorities all over the world as well as in Germany herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How productive are they , as a matter of fact ? No detailed and comprehensive study has been made . About half of them consist of privately offered borrowings , a large share of which is in the form of short-term credit . This can not have gone to any extent into plants and machinery , but rather into working capital . Germany sorely needed working capital to restore her pre-war capacity , but no amount of working capital could , by itself , greatly increase her capacity over pre-War days . An analysis of the publicly offered loans from 1924 to October 31 , 1928 , made by the Agent-General for Reparations , shows that 60 percent of them went to the German Republic , states , provinces , counties , cities , public credit institutions , and public utility corporations . Less than 40 percent went to industrial or commercial corporations . The remainder went to religious organizations . Much of the money was used for public works ? bridges , harbor improvements , and the like . Still more went into enlarging electric power equipment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be contended that all of such utilization is productive in the broadest of senses ? even the religious instruction . But it is undeniable that a good deal of the money financed projects which do not themselves yield a return sufficient to pay the interest . And there is no indication of the amount of productive capacity added to Germany 's pre-War status , or of the amount that could be turned to producing goods which might find a foreign market . Although , according to Robert R. Kuczynski , ' the loans contribute to a revival of German economic activity , there is no answer to the question " whether the use of those loans will yield in marks the equivalent to the amount of dollars needed for the debt service and , if so , whether they will influence the German balance of payments so as to make the transfer easy . " We have a little evidence concerning the actual effect on physical production . On the basis of average production July 1924 to June 1926 , the index for the year 1925 stood at 106.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for 1928 at about 120 . An increase of 20 percent is encouraging , but by no means enough . How much farther Germany can go , nobody knows . The United States , which boasts of its rationalization , and has had every advantage of 1 , , Amerlcan Loans to Germany , " New York , The Macmillan Company . ' 352 THE NEW plentiful capital saved within its own boiders , experienced an increase of industrial production between 1920 and 1926 amounting to 29 percent per worker employed . Can Germany do better ? Furthermore , in doing better , can she get along without a corresponding rise in imports , in view of the fact that a large share of her manufactured products must be made out of imported materials ? The experts did not dare to leave all these uncertainties hanging in the air . They were intent upon removing the reparation controversy from the political sphere and making its settlement a business matter . The curious device which they were thus forced to adopt as a means of handling continuously the complications whose outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be the subject of the next article .
