Still are the waters about Rio de Janeiro , deep are they and clear . Be- cause of their stillness , their clarity , to Rio last week repaired Zarh H. M. Pritchard , * painter . He paints pictures of the deep sea . Where the coral spreads its fan , where sea-grass lifts and sways to currents vague as wind , and blunt-nosed fishes ply , this way and that , their white bellies agleam , their eyes phosphorescent , there goes Painter Pritchard in a kind of diving suit . His pictures are hung in the Natural History Museum , Manhattan , in many European galleries . Says he : <P> " I work on the ocean floor exactly as I would work in my studio . All my sketches are done in color under the surface . Sometimes fish eight or ten feet long have come close to me as if they were curious , but I have never been attacked . . . . The smaller fish exasperate me . " <P> <P> * Artist Pritchard 's Christian name was originally Walter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Walter Pritchards , he changed it to Zarh . Said he : " There were eight other Walter Pritchards . One was a drunkard , another was a man who never paid his bills , and a third was constantly running away from his wife . It was this last Pritchard who determined me to change my name . I received a letter from his wife . She begged me to return to her , saying that the daughter , Mary , had grown into a fine , tall , good-looking woman . So I changed my name to Zarh , which is Persian for light . "
