I T is public opinion which in the last analysis created the Washington Conference , gave power to Mr. Hughes 's proposals , and even now is forcing the assembled elder statesmen to deal realistically with submarine and other problems which they evidently had not intended to face . It is public opinion also which must finally determine the merits nr demerits of President Harding 's suggestion of annual conferences which may broaden into a new association of nations . Senator Borah has already advanced serious objections to such an association , comparing it with the League of Nations . Some machinery for international action there must be ; the important thing is the spirit which inspires it and the uses to which it is directed . We opposed the League of Nations not because it was international , but because it was innately imperialistic . America 's entrance into it would have served only to underwrite the terms of the Treaty of Versailles . Any association by whatever name will be as obnoxious if it is merely a mask for the exploitation of Central Europe or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet there is an W HAT could be more confusing than the business situation ? On the one hand there is a booming bond market with apparently unlimited funds awaiting investment , together with signs of approaching recovery in the stock market . With this goes much optimistic talk of decreasing unemployment and of gradual industrial recovery . On the other hand , the bank situation has not improved much and some banks , under official orders are forced to write off as losses large " frozen credits " ; the railroad situation does not improve materially despite some decreases in rates . Then the Republicans have at last forced through a tax bill which pleases nobody , and they are still bent on getting through an old-fashioned tariff bill which is the worst thing that could possibly be done for the economic recovery of the United States and of Europe . Finally , the situation in Europe is obviously getting so much worse that it offers no real prospect of better conditions here . M BRIAND thunders against militarist Germany . He ? has to ; his office is dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hating days of 1919 . But his bark is worse than his bite ; he supports the LoucheurRathenau agreements for payment in kind by Germany , which are in - effect a treaty of economic alliance ; and under the auspices of his Cabinet a joint delegation of French and German workingmen recently made a tour of the regions under reconstruction , and then made a joint proposal for German labor aid in reconstruction . Meanwhile French public opinion is rapidly shifting , and the Chamber no longer represents the mind of France . The prefect of the Somrae has reported to the Government that the mayors of the ruined villages in his department assure him that the refugees in their towns would welcome German labor . And two districts of Paris , called upon to elect members of the Municipal Council , have just returned mutineers of the Black Sea fleet which in 1919 refused to fire upon the Bolsheviks  --  one of them by a vote of three to one against the super-patriotic bloc national candidate . F RANCE and Turkey have made peace . The treaty lays down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cilicia ; another clause provides , in the futile way that modern treaties do , for the protection of minorities . It is a most innocent document , devoid of any sus-picion picion of political or economic imperialism . But , by a curious coincidence , the Foreign Minister of the Turkish Government , Mr. Yussuf Kemal Bey , who signed the treaty for Turkey , wrote a note to M. Franklin-Bouillon , who signed the treaty for France , on the same day on which the treaty was signed ; and in this note he declared : Desiring to further the development of the material interests of the two countries , my Government instructs me to inform you that it is disposed to grant the concession for the iron , chrome , and silver mines in the Harchite Valley , for a term of 99 years , to a group of French capitalists which , within five years of the signature of the treaty , would proceed to develop the concession under Turkish laws and would permit Turkish participation up to 50 per cent of the stock . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence other offers which may be made by French groups for concessions of mines , railroads , ports , and riverways , so long as these-suggestions conform to the interests of Turkey and of France . Furthermore , Turkey desires French specialists . . . , etc . We suppose that the treaty will , in accord with the Covenant of the League of Nations , be registered at Geneva , and that the note will not . And yet we have a suspicion that the note is more important than the treaty , and far more illuminating as to the ways in which modern Powers do business , and the interests which dictate their policies . TRANGE alliances mark these modern days . In Belli gium Socialists and Catholics are electoral allies on the issues of short military service , no French alliance , and equal rights for the Flemish language ; there is a Socialist-Catholic coalition government in the city of Antwerp headed by an able Catholic radical , M. van Cauwelaert . The Catholic and Liberal parties joined forces to vote woman suffrage , while the Socialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength against it . The recent election was the first national election in which women voted , and the results were as had been expected . The Catholics gained ; the Liberals and the Socialists lost . More significant is the fact that the Flamingants in the Catholic and Socialist parties and the extreme Flemish Front party , held their own . Flemish national feeling has too often been pictured in this country as a product of war-time German intrigue ; it existed long before the war , and has developed since despite intense counter-propaganda by the French  --  an election appeal signed by Maurice Maeterlinck and others denounced the Flamingants as attacking " the French language , that indispensable instrument of high culture and of economic expansion sic , which is to the respectable Flemish language what the master-key of a palace is to the bolt of a peasant 's hut . " A post-war law has established Flemish as the official administrative language in the postal , fiscal , customs , and other services in Flanders ; and the defeat of the Liberals at the election may mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and abandonment of the military entente with Frane . I N 1756 Siraj-ud-Daula , Nawab of Bengal , imprisoned 146 Englishmen all night in a guardroom , measuring 18 feet by 14 feet 10 inches , with only two tiny windows . In the morning all but 23 were dead . The memory of that Black Hole of Calcutta lives in millions of minds ; it is a symbol of horror to men who know nothing of the incident which gave rise to it ; it has been used a thousand times as justification of European rule in India . And now , under a liberal and supposedly humane British Government , 100 Moplah prisoners have been left overnight in a closed British railway wagon , so suffocating that in the morning 64 of them were dead . Do the British shudder with horror and go into sackcloth and ashes that civilized white men should repeat the horrors of a century and a half ago ? Do their leaders follow Gandhi in fasting in penitence for the excesses of their followers ? No more than after Amritsar . The Associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair . " The London Times correspondent says that " it is the general opinion in Madras that the wagon was unfit for its purpose and that at any rate it was a mistake to put so many prisoners in it at once .

H ERE are facts taken from sworn testimony before the New York Transit Commission which the Subway Sun has failed to set before the weary strap-hanger in an effort to solace his feelings : In the eighteen years of its life the Interborough Rapid Transit Company has received a net income of $67,867,878.48 and has paid out $65,625,000 in dividends  --  this on an actual cash investment by stockholders of $21,620,000 . During the last three years it has paid $7,000,000 in dividends out of past surplus  --  while borrowing money for expenses . During the same eighteen years the company paid $75,336,000 to a holding company ? which did no work at all  --  for rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original cost of the lines , and the lease has 900 years to run ! The Interborough carries on its books as an asset the stock of the New York and Queens Company at $2,895,160 , though that company has a deficit of $4,667,949 . It has told the public that it needed higher fares because of the increased cost of labor , yet it persuaded its employees to accept a reduction of $2,600,000 , out of which it promptly paid $390,000 to bankers who demanded one per cent more on a loan . Its publicity campaign for higher fares was charged against operating expenses . For the New Yorker the chief moral of such revelations is the necessity of eliminating ' the old transit ring from the management of the public service of transportation . For Americans generally the moral ought to be a deepened distrust of corporation financing and corporation publicity . First the packers , and now the Inter-borough , prove that the corporation 's publicity man is most to be distrusted when he is most voluble . In view of these revelations what shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal operators ? C ONGRESS has at last passed a tax bill which is satisfactory to nobody . It was the resultant of two contending forces , the Administration and the agricultural bloc . neither of which could work out its ideas . Whether it will raise the amount of money necessary to run the Government nobody knows , for no one yet knows how much money it will take to run the government or how much revenue the bill will produce . Mr. Simmons stated in debate : " The actuary of the Treasury tells me that the bill . . . will involve a deficit for this fiscal year of possibly not over $51,000,000 , but that when the bill gets in full operation as it will be in the fiscal year 1923 there will be a deficit of $170,000,000 . " That is only one guess on a subject concerning which no one can be certain because of our lack of a proper budget system . The Senate had the negative virtue of defeating the sales tax , but Republican leaders prophesy the adoption at the next session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This scheme is cunningly devised to abate popular opposition to a tax which always tends to be passed on to the consumer and is usually multiplied in the process . Of course under such a tax the poor man pays relatively more than the rich , since his purchases are greater in proportion to his income and any increase in the cost of his living is harder to bear . Yet the tax is generally supported by the press , - which affirms but does not prove that it is " absorbed " before it reaches the consumer . Is it a coincidence that the tax is also more popular than high income taxes with business enterprises which are great advertisers ? NCE more there is a strike in the coal fields owned by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company . It is occasioned by a 30 per cent wage cut . The company officials claim that the cut was made solely in order to make possible a lower price on coal , which was to stimulate buying and so give the men four days of work a week instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan under Mr. Rockefeller 's famous scheme of representation . Evidently men do not strike as they vote in paternalistic company unions , for even the company admits that more than 50 per cent of the men have struck . Most sinister was the action of Governor Shoup in declaring martial law one day before the strike began . The commander of the State forces is the notorious Patrick J. Hamrock who was largely responsible for the Ludlow tragedy in 1914 . The company says that it will not import strike-breakers , evict strikers from company-owned property , or prevent meetings , and that it did not ask for martial law . In that case it ought to join with decent men everywhere in demanding the end of martial law and the recall of Hamrock . Already the State has begun the same tactics which led to Ludlow . Is not one such massacre enough for Colorado ? THY does the Southern Negro want the vote ? Mr. V V S. D. Redmond of Jackson , Mississippi , gives one answer : because the disfranchised Negro can not secure for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities . Mississippi has more Negroes than whites . They are segregated in trains and in all public institutions . According to Mr. Redmond 's figures their comparative opportunities in Mississippi may be summarized thus : deleted table T O be the ruler of an island in the tropics is almost an ideal life , according to the books on the South Seas and other regions where the bong-tree grows . There is nothing to do but equip oneself with a fan and a fig-leaf and lie in the breeze under a breadfruit tree , catching the slices as they fall already toasted and buttered . But latterly even the people of tropical islands have been attacked by that accursed germ of civilization known as pep , and the representative of a far-flung empire has to gird his loins with more than a fig-leaf in order  --  as the language of the street has it  --  to get by . For particulars inquire of E. Mont Reily , Governor of Porto Rico , lately returned to America to explain to President Harding why he has not been able to report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand On the edge of the sand They danced by the light of the moon . Governor Reily seems to be an amiable gentleman who acquired his knowledge of colonial administration by living in Kansas City . Upon his arrival in Porto Rico a delegation from the dominant party , the Unionists , called and told him what he was to do and what offices they expected to have . Governor Reily resented this , answering with possibly more force than diplomacy , and he turned to the Socialists , among others , for assistance . Now the Unionists are representing in Washington that Governor Reily has been consorting with Bolshevists , while the Governor 's friends declare that the Unionists are secessionists and unworthy of American confidence . We shall know more about all this later , but meanwhile the trouble has modified our idea of the joy of life on a tropical island . A NDREAS LATZKO , exile from his own Budapest , half starved in a Viennese garret after the war . Is it any wonder that he resents  --  as in his article in the Supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreigners who flock to the shadow-gaiety of that strange corpse of a great capital ? Yet there was something very sympathetic in the grace with which a starving people clung to their opera and their art-galleries . After all the musician who sells his bed before he parts with his Steinway has learned more than most of us of the real significance of life . Perhaps it should be pointed out that today Vienna maintains her opera rather as an attraction for foreigners , believing that her continued life depends upon her continuing as a " reception-room for foreigners , " upon her becoming a sort of Switzerland , living on hotels and foreign purchases . We like better the proletarian clothes of Moscovi 's opera than the foreign splendor of Vienna 's  --  but we think it a tribute to the quality of the Russians and the Austrians that in the midst of hunger the operas persist . T HE earlier announcement by The Dial that it would offer an annual award of $2,000 in recognition of the service to letters rendered by some young American writer was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award itself , which for 1921 goes to Sherwood Anderson . Though judgments will of course differ among various critics as to the wisdom of this particular award , no competent critic can decently deny that Mr. Anderson has made great and steady strides since his first books and that his career is full of admirable promise . He is original , powerful , experimental . At times his ideas have outrun his style and at other times his style has outrun his ideas ; he has brooded so desperately over his matter that he has made it now profound and now confusing ; in his latest book , however , " The Triumph of the Egg , " he has brought beauty and passion and reflection together and given them masterful form and outline . If The Dial 's award each year finds an artist so promising and helps assure him a period of leisure for further work it can become a priceless element in American literary life .
