Wit . i the s% securities as a basis , the corposation would advance to the Director General cash sums to be paid to the roads to settle the claims they hold against the Government .

This debt was placed on the railroads to compel them to furnish certain equipment Which the railroad administration considered necessary . In a statement accompanying President Harding 's message , James C. Davis , the Director General of Railroads , said ' the Government should not hesitate to fund the debt over a period of ten years , " in view of the fact that the reason it was made im'hiediately due grew out of the war and the public needs . " ? The statement of the Director General revealed the present situation of the railroads. lie said that up to July . 15 claims amounting to $758,001 ) , ( 100 had been filed and that $08,000,000 had been paid out to adjust claims of $225,568,764 .

This latter sum the roads receiving such equipment have signified as indebtedness to the Government , leaving a balance of $763,000,000 spent in tracks , terminals , &c.; It is this indebtedness which Mr. Davis contends should be funded for a period of ten years . ? Mr. Davis added that claims of the railroads based on " inefficiency of labor " during the war had not teen allowed , and it is now known that the railroads have deferred these claims pending the adjustment advised by President Harding . Text a Harding 's Message . President Harding 's message , which Was transmitted to Congress by messenger , reads as follows : " To the Senate aria House of Repre-sentatives : " It is necessary to call the attention a Congress to the obligations of the Government to the railroads , and ask your co-operation in order to enable the Government to discharge these obligations . There is nothing new about them , but only recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sincere endeavor to effect an early settlement . These obligations already have been recognized by the Con-gr ess in the passage of the Transportation act restoring tha railroads to their owners , but previous recognition was made in the contract under which the railroads were operated by the Govern ! ment for the period of the World War . The contract covering operation pro-f Nfided that the railways should be returned to their owners in as good condition as when taken ' over by the GoV --  expenditure for this equipment has been taken Dare of in equipment trust certificates now held by the railroad administration . This leaves about $763,000,000 of additions and betterments. which , if not funded , must be deducted from the amount due from the railroad administration to the carriers in final settlement . An extension of the time in which these addition and betterment obligations could be paid to such carriers as could give reasonable and satisfactory security would enable the carriers receiving this extension to expend this amount of money in the much needed rehabilitation of their cars and locomotives and apply the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the national system of transportation could be equipped during the coming Fall and Winter to promptly and effectively perform its duty to the public in the way of prompt and efficient transportation . Diletee.RENCE BETWEEN NORMAL AND PRESENT NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF BAD ORDER FREIGHT CARS AND LOCOMOTIVES . - The percentage of bad order freight cars has not been below 5.0 per cent . at any time during the past dive years . During the year 1917 it ranged between 6.2 and 6.0 per cent . While there is no general agreement as , to what the normal percentage should be . it seems to be generally accepted at from 5 to 6 per cent . The percentage of bad order cars on July 1 , 1921 , was 15.8 per cent. , or about 10 per cent . above normal . The total number of freight cars in service at the present time is about 2 , - 400,000 and 10 per cent . of that number would be 240,000 , which represents the excess , or abnormal , bad order condition of freight cars today . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 per cent . , The percentage of bad order locomotives . on July 1 was 23.9 , or 14 per cent . above normal . The total number of freight and passenger locomotives , ( exclusive of switching ) is about 50,000 and 14 per cent . of this would be 7,000 locomotives , which represents the abnormal had order condition of locomotives at the present time . DEFERRED MAINTENANCE . The amount of deferred maintenance at the present time has been conservatively estimated at $400,000,000 , of which $200 , - 000,000 represents maintenance of way and $200,000,000 maintenance of equipment . That is , these are the amounts which should be expended on the railway properties to bring them up from their present physical , condition to nor-mal SHORTAGE ITT NUMBER OF RAILWAY EMPLOYES . The total number of railway employes in the first quarter of 1921 was 1,691,471 . This was less by 340,456 than the average number In 1920 ; and less by 302,053 than in the first quarter of 1920 . This manifestly means an enormous increase of unemployment . If the railroads were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures and equipment it is conservatively estimated that it would mean immediate employment of at least 200 , - 000 workmen . DELAYED PAYMENTS OF - VOUCHERS . Delayed payments of the current liabilities of the railways , representing principally payments due for fuel and materials used in operation , have been conservatively estimated at not less than $300,000,000 . The failure to pay these has involved great industrial distress and depression . It ' has meant the shutting down of many industries . If the railroads are paid what is due them by the Government , they in turn can pay these debts , and the starting up of industry will be enormously assisted and promoted . It is evident , if the products of our farms , of our forests , of our mines and industries our other indus:Ies are to find a way to market , that our railroads must be adequately equipped to move them . Manifestly , from the foregoing statistics they are not now so equipped . If there is to be a return , as we devoutly hope there soon will be , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted and obstructed by insufficient transportation , which is a fundamental condition of all commerce . FUNDING . By the terms of - Section 6 of the Federal Control act , the President was authorized to incur , on behalf of the carriers , indebtedness for additions and betterments . To create an indebtedness to be paid by others without limit ' in amount is , it must be admitted , a most unusual power and was justified only by the exigencies of war . As a result of the exercise of this power . a large amount of indebtedness was created by the Director General and imposed upon these carriers , for additions and betterments , some of it assented to by them and some of it not concurred in . This class of indebtedness , although on capital account , was made by the Government immediately payable , instead of being arranged in long-time obligations . If the carriers had been dealing with their own affairs in respect to additions and betterments , it is reasonable to suppose that they would not have undertaken to provide for these large capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed their usual course , which would have been not to incur indebtedness as to a large part of this amount until they had succeeded in financing the capital required on longterm obligations . They could not do this under the conditions of Federal control and of the war for the two reasons : First , because the matter was not legally within their control and , second , because the entire investment market was necessarily absorbed by the Government in securing war loans . The question , therefore , arises , What is it equitable and just to do now in regard to the adjustment of this indebtedness ? The Carriers insist that it should be funded by the Government for a term of at least ten years . This , they claim , is just , not only because of the circumstances above narrated , under which the indebtedness was created , but for an additional reason , in which the public , as well as the carriers themselves , have an interest . The carriers at the end of Federal control had been out of possession of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on at that time to resume the responsibility of furnishing transportation adequate to the needs of commerce . It must be admitted that they undertook the performance of this duty under adverse conditions . Their organizations had been broken lip ; much of the normal traffic of the various lines had been diverted to others ; their rolling stock had been widely scattered by Government management throughout the country , and their labor expense had been enormously increased during Federal control . This situation , they claim , put upon them the necessity of providing for abnormal expenses of operation at the very outset . It is in the public interest that they should be able to perform successfully the duty of transportation . This will necessitate not only an adequate supply of cash for their abnormal expenses , due to the special conditions which have surrounded their properties , and for their current purposes , but also will necessitate the borrowing of large amounts of new capital , so - as to keep their roads up to the requirements of the public and for other capital purposes , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in a market disturbed by war conditions and where there is a tremendous competition , as between themselves and with , other industries , for the funds available for investment . It is even more vital to the public than to the carriers that the carriers should succeed in securing the money necessary to the successful performance of their transportation duties . If the Government refuses to fund this indebtedness which it created for the carriers , and for which the Transportation act , expressly provided , and if , in addition to their large capital requirements for other purposes , it is necessary for them to borrow also the amount they owe the Government for additions and betterments , their problem and the public 's problem in respect to transportation will be enormously embarrassed . The indebtedness of the carriers to the Government for additions and better= ments incurred under the circumstances above mentioned ought not to be allowed to constitute an additional complication and embarrassment in this situation . To avoid this the Government ought not to hesitate to carry this indebtedness : for ten years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the-fact that the reason it was made immediately due grew out of the war and the public needs . ' JAMES C. DAVIS , Director General . ernment , and the Transportation act , recognizing that betterments and additions belong to capital account , provided that such sums as the railway companies owed the Government for betterments and new equipment , added during the period of Government operation , might be funded . There has been , at no time , any question about the justice of funding such indebtedness to the Government . Indeed . it has sheen in progress . to a measureable degree ever since the return of the railroads to their owners . It has been limited . however . to such cases as those in which final settlements with the railway Administrae tion have been effected . The process is admittedly too slow to meet the difficult situation which the owners of the railroads have been facing , and I believe ' it essential to restore railway activities and essential to the country 's good fortune to hasten both funding and settlement . " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are morally and legally bound to fund , the Government admittedly owes the railway companies large sums on various accounts such as compensation , depreciation and maintenance . There has been a wide difference of opinion relating to the amount the Government owes , due in the main to the claim of the owners that in spite of materials and hours of labor being estimated in proper relations to similar expenditure in the pre-war test period , the ' inefficiency of labor ' still left a wide difference between actual upkeep and the expenditure made during the Government operation . in miler to expedite settlement and funding an informal understanding which is all that is possible or practical , has been reached , under which the railway claims based on the ' inefficiency of labor ' are to be waived to hasten complete and final settlements , without surrender of any rights in court in case there is failure to settle . I have no doubt that early , final and satisfactory settlements will be reached , since the policy of the railway administration already has been effective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $225,662,764 , resulting in the payment to them of $88,141,222 . " The way now would seem to be clear to very early adjustment and relief , except for the fact that the railway administration , though possessing assets , does not command the funds necessary to meet what will be its admitted obligations . Asks Congress Authority . " There is no thought to ask Congress for additional funds . Perhaps $500 , - 000,000 will be necessary . The Railroad Administration has , or will have in the progress of funding , ample securities to meet all requirements if Congress only will grant the authority to negotiate these securities and provide the agency for their negotiation . " With this end in view you are asked to extend the authority of the War Finance Corporation so that it may purchase these railway funding securities accepted by the Director General of Railroads . No added expense , no added investment is required on the part of the Government , there is no added liability , no added tax burden . It is merely the grant of authority necessary to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available funds to purehase securities for which Congress already has authorized the issue and turn them into the channels of finance ready to float them . " I can readily believe that so simple a remedy will have your prompt sanction . The question of our obligation can not be raised , the wisdom of affording early relief is not to be doubted , and the avoidance of added appropriation or liability will appeal to Congress and the public alike . " The after-war distresses of two great and fundamental activities have been riveting the anxious attention of the country . One is the readjustment and restoration of agriculture , the . other is the distress of our railway transportation system . " Pending proposals for relief and their discussion have already brought to the attention of Congress the very promising . possibilities of broadening the powers of the War Finance Corporation for the further relief of agriculture and livestock production . This corporation has proven itself so helpful in the relief thus far undertaken that I can not help but believe that its broadened powers , as have been proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the nation-wide emergency . This is an impelling moral obligation to American farming in all its larger aspects , and it will be most gratifying to have your early sanction . " In the ease of the railroads there is a moral and a contractural obligation , and your favorable action is no less urgent , and will no less appeal to public approval . Railway solvency and efficiency are essential to our healthful industrial , commercial and agricultural life . Everything hinges on transportation . " After necessary and dramatic curtailments. after harrowing straits in meeting their financial difficulties , the railroads need only this financial aid which the fulfillment of our obligations will bestow to inaugurate their farreaching revival . Its effects will be'felt in varied industries and will banish to a large degree the ? depression which , though inevitable in war 's aftermath , we are all so anxious to see ended .

The full text of Director General Davis 's message follows : MEMORANDA FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE RAILROADS . Progress of railway liquidation . The total number of Federal controlled carriers , including subsidiary companies , was 423 . The mileage of the Federal controlled roads was 239,009 . The number of claims on final settlement filed with the Director General up to July 13 , 1921 , was 184 , the aggregate amount claimed being 758,032.235 . The mileage of the roads that have filed their claims aggregate 167,070 . The amount of claims settled by the Director General up to and including July 13 , 1921 , aggregated $225,568,764 . These settlements represent some 43 per cent . in number of the claims actually filed . The total amount paid in settlement was $68,141,227 . The largest single disputed item in final settlement is the claim for undermaintenance of way and structures and equipment . The under-maintenance claims represent more than 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Included in these claims for under-maintenance is the much discussed claim variously described as " inefficiency of labor , " " ineffectiveness of labor , " or the " difference in the cost of applied , material as between the test and Federal control periods , " this item representing some 70 per cent or 75 per cent . of the total under-maintenance claims . Claims for inefficiency of labor have not being allowed by the Railroad Administration not only , as contended by the Railroad Administration ; because such claims are not contemplated by the standard contract , but they are of a too highly indefinite speculative and contingent character to warrant ' consideration . In addition to the claims on final settlement , covering the various items of dispute between the carriers and the Administration , there are innumerable claims for loss and damage in the transpertation of freight , fire and personal illjury cases , and reparation claims g. - owing out of freight rate controvereies . These claims are being rapidly disposed of . and within a reasoM2.ble time the ' adjustment of same should be completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad administration , on behalf of the carriers , sornb $1,144,000,000 In additions and betttrments , properly chargeable to capital account .
