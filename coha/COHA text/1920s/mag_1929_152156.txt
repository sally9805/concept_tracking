The resignation of Baron Giichi Tanaka , grizzled seadog , and the advent of Yuko Hamaguchi , tall , shaggy economist , as Prime Minister of Japan ( TIME , July 8 ) , seemed last week to portend two changes of international interest : 1 ) increased calm in China ; 2 ) Japan 's co-operation at the imminent five-power naval reduction conferences . <P> To the two reasons popularly given for the fall of the Tanaka government-lse-majest and the Manchurian murder of Chang Tso-lin-Tokyo businessmen added a third last week . Baron Tanaka 's " Positive Policy " of intervention , vigorous protection of the Japanese colony in Tsinanfu , had brought a boycott of Japanese goods throughout China . By the most rudimentary bookkeeping , balancing the $250,000,000 colony of Tsinanfu against $500,000,000 annual trade with China , Tokyo businessmen realized that the " Positive Policy " must go . <P> Political observers examined the new cabinet last week , saw it as follows : <P> Yuko Hamaguchi , the new Prime Minister , third untitled Prime Minister of Japan , * leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " The Lion " ) because of his Lloyd-Georgian hair and mustache , his roaring voice , unusual in a Japanese . Actually he looks less like a lion than a quiet , white-headed chow . Not affluent , Shishi has a reputation for the highest integrity . A Liberal , an economist , he is expected to be more flexible and progressive than the Conservative government just fallen . Twice Minister in previous cabinets , popular for his eccentricities with Japan 's masses , Economist Shishi has a son , Kazuhiko Hamaguchi , at present a research worker in the New York branch of the Bank of Japan . Graduate of the Imperial University of Tokyo , onetime intercollegiate jiu-jitsu champion of Japan , fond of tennis , eager for golf , Son Kazuhiko shares a small villa at Bayside , L. I. , with an office mate . Interviewed last week he giggled politely , admitted that his father likes walking and reading , wears kimonos at home , European clothes on the street . <P> Familiar to Washington is the new Foreign Minister Baron Kijuro Shidehara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed , ever smiling , Baron Shidehara would be an agreeable , helpful principal in any conference on naval reductions . As Foreign Minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Wakatsuki , preceding Baron Tanaka , he inaugurated the policy of conciliation with China which Tanaka so disastrously upset . <P> Others in the Liberal Cabinet : <P> Home Affairs : Kenzo Adachi , onetime Minister of Communications . <P> War : General Issei Ugaki ( same post in 1926-27 ) . <P> Marine : Admiral Takeshi Takarabe ( same post 1926-27 ) . <P> Finance : Junnosuke Inouye , international banking expert , onetime Governor of the Bank of Japan . <P> Railways : Yoku Egi , onetime Minister of Justice . <P> Communications : Matajiro Koizumi , onetime journalist . <P> Justice : Viscount Chifuyu Watanabe , banker and newspaper owner . <P> Impartial observers considered the Hamaguchi cabinet the ablest since 1921 . But roaring Shishi , like grave Ramsay MacDonald of Britain , has a minority government . Japan 's parliament seats are divided as follows : <P> Liberal Party 180 <P> Opposition 261 <P> Independent Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
