txt // in that way , serve in their decomposition the needs of higher forms of life , is practically certain . For example , as long ago as 1888 , Manly Miles showed the author a culture of unknown organism which was etching the glass of the test-tube in its struggle for potassium . The eminent Italian botanist , Orazio , has made exhaustive studies of lavas recently thrown out by eruptions of Vesuvius . He is reported by Rossi 1 as stating that " the first plants to inhabit rocks are unicellular algae  --  these algae associate with fungous masses and give rise to lichens . " Rossi confirms the observation and remarks , " When we consider that upon lava once incandescent and upon soils directly derived from it , there has arisen the most intense cultivation known in the world , and also that from these areas , bearing witness to the Horror of the struggle with devastating plutonic forces , we pass almost without interruption to the enchanted ground of Capri , Ischa , Portici and Naples , we can not help feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other for studying the earliest stages of life , while to the agriculturist it presents an unequalled chance to obtain knowledge respecting the formation of plant soil . " We have only begun to study and realize the intensely complicated biological and physical reactions going on within the soil as set up by nature and we know even less of the many and profound influences , favorable and unfavorable , exerted by the processes which the farmer employs in the conduct of his business . Formerly we explained soil changes to our satisfaction , if not to our understanding , by recourse to the compara- // tively simple inorganic forces known to be involved . Latterly , however , we have come to see that these are only the basic , the incidental perhaps , but by no means the exclusive or even the typical processes by which natural rock is broken down and its constituents so combined with each other and those from the atmosphere as to make possible the successful and systematic growth of higher plants which is the basis of profitable farming . We know now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events must transpire in which succeeding species give way , one to the next , each living in part upon the remains of its forerunner and in part upon what it can extract from the most ordinary , that is to say the most stable , of nature 's compounds as found in soil and atmosphere . The farmer 's crop is the last of the series and his art , to be successful , must not offend the science by which the ages have been preparing for his industry and by which constant forces stand ready to labor with him for success . Why there is a fertility problem . If all the fertility of the soil were immediately available and if crops could operate on the subtraction plan as we do in checking out a bank deposit , then we could plow , reap and rest easy for some hundreds , if not thousands of years . But , fortunately for the world not yet born , these materials are only slowly made available by nature 's forces . So that we are concerned , not so much with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the natural processes in getting at a sufficient fraction each year to insure satisfactory yields . // After the question of availability is settled we find that plants do not operate on the subtraction plan as we do in drawing bank checks , but they withdraw rather on the percentage basis . That is to say , the roots and the root-hairs can not come into actual contact with the total soil surface and are therefore unable , even in distress , to obtain access to the entire available supply . Nobody knows the exact proportion reached and recovered , but it is fairly well established that , in general , plants can not obtain in any one year , aside from nitrogen , more than 1 per cent or even less of the total fertility actually present . in humid climates any excess of soluble nitrogen above the immediate appropriation by crops is washed out in drainage water . Here , in general , even with the best farming , the nitrogen lost is fully equal to that recovered by crops and often even more . Minerals in solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that calcium salts are generally subject to loss . There is , therefore , always and everywhere a fertility problem . EXHAUSTION AND LIMITATION OF FERTILITY As long as crops operate on the percentage basis they will never be able entirely to exhaust the fertility of soils . It is like the old problem of our boyhood days : If a train runs halfway from A to B today , half the remaining distance tomorrow and so on , each day covering one-half the remaining distance , when will it arrive at B ? It is as if , in drawing our check , we were not free to specify the amount as long as we had a balance , but were always restricted to 1 per cent or even 10 per cent . In that case , we should always have some money // in the bank even though , bye and bye , the amount would become extremely small . By exhausted soils , therefore , is not commonly meant those from which all the fertility has been mined out , but rather those which have been so depleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one season is not sufficient to make a paying yield . By this is meant , of course , in competition with better lands , for if all the soils of the world were on a lower plane of productivity than now , then competition would not be so sharp and fewer soils would be abandoned . The Wisconsin Station studied forty-eight depleted soils and the corresponding virgin lands in order to determine what had impaired their value . ' In general the difference was mainly one of solubility in the surface soils , the virgin soils being markedly more soluble at the surface though not as to subsoil . It has been mentioned before that poor lands are never again as valuable as in the very first years of pioneer agriculture . This is partly because most thin soils have accumulated through the thousands of years of idleness a small stock of readily obtainable fertility and will yield a few fairly satisfactory crops . It is even more due to the fact that as population begins to press on the food supply , the price rises , lands become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fertilized more heavily than was possible under a lower range of prices ? a point to be elaborated later . All of which means that a populous world struggling for sustenance will mean rich , not depleted , soils and against these , poor or impoverished lands can never compete . // This is true even of good soils that have been allowed to run down unless some one will invest heavily in fertility , waiting indefinitely for his income . This a capitalist may do but not an ordinary farmer who must , first of all , make a living for his family . The building up of exhausted lands is an uphill and expensive job even when it can be accomplished . The limiting element . By poor or exhausted lands we do not necessarily mean soils in which all the ingredients are below the paying point . If only one has so dropped , that one will limit the yield as effectively as if all were deficient . For example , of all the soils listed in Table XVII we should expect the lower Illinoisan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its phosphorus-content . We , therefore , speak of phosphorus as the limiting element in this particular soil as it is on most prairie lands . Whenever the crop has reached the limit of supply in any essential element or condition then and at that point the limit of growth is reached . Is it phosphorus ? Is it potassium ? Is it water ? Is it heat ? Is it sunlight ? Whatever it may be the missing essential is the limiting factor and most of our yields are the result , not of possibilities , but of limiting conditions either of fertility , of water or of climate . This deciding element in successful farming will be pursued further in later chapters . Ii , is sufficient here to recognize the fact that a very small consideration may stand in the way of successful production and that a low yield is not necessarily an indication of a hopeless soil , though continued low yields raise suspicions . // Lack of materials for the building of crops is not always the limiting factor in yield . If it requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through the tissues of the crop in order to make a normal yield and only 300 or 400 are available , then the crop is certain to be shortened no matter what the supply of chemical materials may be . The University of Illinois reports the effect of rainfall during June , July and August on the yield of corn grown continuously on the same ground as follows : These yields being taken from the same ground must be due to moisture rather than fertility . This 750 tons to the acre , more or less , required for maximum crops , means around seven inches of rainfall besides what runs off over the surface in time of freshet , drains away underground during the rainy season or finally evaporates from the surface of the soil , especially during drought when the competition with the crop is keenest . This seven inches or so needed by the crop , therefore , is available only as a kind of left-over after the run-off , the under drainage and summer winds have taken their toll . If rains were timely , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming purposes , a limited rainfall might suffice . But it rains " when it gets ready " and often the heaviest precipitation comes in the winter or early spring months when it is wasted except as to the amount the soil is able to retain against gray- // ity . This amount varies greatly with different soils and under varying conditions . King , ' working with the boulder clays of Wisconsin , reported that the upper three feet of these soils could hold approximately 16 inches of water before it would stand upon the surface , that is , run off if opportunity offered . This means a waterlogged soil . It means , too , that under the conditions of the experiment all the air was driven off and the total space filled by water ? conditions impossible in the field where , in heavy rainfalls , much of the air remains trapped below a waterlogged surface , thereby excluding water . Kinds of soil are so variable and conditions so different that it is practically impossible to set a figure representing what agricultural land will hold against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the matter is exceedingly important . Manifestly an extremely porous soil will hold less than clay and is , therefore , more dependent on timely rains . Widtsoe and McLaughlin , ' working in western soils , found the figure to be about 24 per cent of the weight of the dry soil , though somewhat less for surface layers . This would indicate for the upper 40 inches a waterretaining capacity against gravity but not surface evaporation of something like 720 tons or between six and seven inches of rainfall ? slightly under the probable need of maximum crops . When any material becomes so finely divided as to behave in a jelly-like fashion , it is said to be in a colloidal state . Formerly we considered the soil as made up of small but sizable particles supposed to behave on // a small scale like a pile of stones or gravel . We know now that there is , in all soils , considerable colloid material and that it affects their water-retaining capacity . We know , also , that farmyard manures and organic materials generally tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiments of E. J. Russell of Rothamsted . ' In these experiments Russell found that " poor heavy loams " in a moist state could retain 23.2 per cent of volume , whereas a " heavily dunged , " arable soil could hold 30 per cent . After a long period of drought the first soil dropped to 17 per cent and the second to 20 per cent , showing in both cases the beneficial effect of organic material . In a humid climate like England with considerable cloudiness , surface evaporation is low and with only 28 inches of rainfall , even though much of that is in the winter months , crops rarely suffer for lack of moisture . The same can be said for eastern and middle United States except in time of drought . For , although our skies are clearer than those of England and surface evaporation greater , yet we have in this section around 36 inches of rainfall , and only later maturing crops , like corn , are likely ever to suffer from lack of water . As we go further west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 inches and , in certain districts known as arid , even to 10 inches , much of which comes in downpours known as cloudbursts and as a consequence is mostly lost in run-off . Not only is the rainfall reduced in mid-continental areas , but the skies are comparatively cloudless and surface evaporation is high . This means that , with an // annual rainfall of say 10 inches , agriculture is impossible without irrigation . Even with 20 inches , water is commonly , in most climates , the limiting factor and irrigation pays . The universally larger crops taken from skillfully irrigated land are extremely significant especially where , as in Colorado , wheat yields of 50 and 60 bushels are not at all uncommon against 10 or 12 of the non-irrigated fields or the 25 to 40 of the eastern states . All of which demonstrates that , commonly speaking , water is the limiting factor in many , if not most , of our yields from real agricultural lands . CHAPTER XIII THE DURABILITY OF SOILS SOME of our better soils are enormously rich in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer says when he applies to his crops the language of the feeding yard . But any such study of soils raises at once the question of the producing power of the land and its ultimate possible exhaustion . Table XXIV shows the amounts removed from the soil by a few of the more common crops and by moderate annual yields , by which we see that crops have different needs and appetites . The first point to attract attention in Table XXIV is the obvious but not surprising fact that every crop makes a very different demand on the soil for its elements of fertility . In the case of wheat , for example , there are 48 pounds of nitrogen and 29 of potassium against 8.0 of phosphorus and 5.2 of calcium . The second outstanding fact is that various crops have very different appetites for the same constituents . Thus wheat needs 48 pounds of nitrogen for a crop and corn 74 . Clover , despite its restorative effect , is a heavy feeder on nitrogen and the hardest of all on calcium ? indeed over five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These facts are capable of translation into terms of soil durability after waiving all questions of leaching 159 and of processes of restoration . That is to say , we can , by the aid of our knowledge of the amounts removed by crops as shown in Table XXIV , express the contents of any soil of known composition in terms of crops ? a kind of endurance test subject to many modifying influences of course but on the whole illuminating . Such an attempt is made in the following table computed from Tables XVII and XXIV. // Such an exhibit is useful but can not be accepted as collection of authentic facts , ? first , because we can not draw on our soils in this cavalier fashion ; second , because there is wastage , especially of nitrogen , quite aside from what goes into crops ; third , because not all crops are removed completely from the land ; fourth , because certain restorative processes are always in operation . It should be considered merely as an attempt to express the soil 's inventory of fertility in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bringing out certain features of practical farming and among them the following : First . In general , nitrogen is the limiting element on this soil as it is the first to fail in the case of every crop . // Second . With the nitrogen restoration necessary to all good farming , phosphorus becomes the limiting element , a fact true of nearly all agricultural soils except peat . Third . Alfalfa , aside from its restorative powers , would be the first crop to exhaust the soil of its nitrogen as it is by far the first to exhaust the calcium , with clover conning next ; indeed all legumes are hard on calcium . Fourth . It is the straw of the wheat crop and not the grain tlhat is hardest on the potassium and the calcium and 11 that should be returned to the land , this soil should be able , theoretically , to supply potassium for 5,326 crops of grain alone against 1,194 of grain and straw and the calcium would hold out for 18,560 crops of grain alone , against 1,784 of grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far but within reason the point is valuable . Fifth . Even the best soils have a definite durability when subjected to the mining processes of agriculture and that is what farming amounts to despite all the optimistic assertions to the contrary . As Lawes and Gilbert very pertinently remark : " It has sometimes been maintained that the soil is a laboratory and not a mine . But not only the facts ascertained in our own and in other investigations , but the history of agriculture throughout the world , so far as is known , clearly show that a fertile soil is one which has accumulated within it the residue of long periods of previous vegetation ; and that it becomes infertile as this residue is exhausted . " Though this was written over thirty years ago , it still holds , except for overflowed lands and for the fact that the soil is now known to be a real laboratory for // the capture of nitrogen . As to minerals , however , farming is a mining proposition and every crop leaves the land just that much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soils , even those most richly endowed by nature , have definite limits in respect to durability . What these limits are and how to deal with their approach is one of the chief problems confronting , not only the farmer , but the public . The durability of any soil , however good it may be naturally , is largely a matter of treatment as will be discussed in some detail in succeeding chapters . By neglect and hard usage it can be mined out quickly , in which case it may as well be abandoned , for a time at least , like a worked-out coal mine . Or , on the other hand , by proper care it can be made to last indefinitely , indeed often becoming even better than nature made it . Fortunately for posterity the fact that crops must be produced on the percentage basis and not that of subtraction means that every hard-worked soil will have to be abandoned for economic reasons long before it is utterly exhausted . Paradoxical as it may seem , some of our worst land-miners and soil-robbers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have learned methods of increasing solubility , but refuse to practice restoration or even conservation of fertility . Such a policy is profitable while it lasts but it means bankruptcy to the successor . It must not be assumed that soils would remain as they are today , even if unoccupied by man . Every rain that falls in the humid districts , every freshet that swells the flood-waters and every wind that blows over arid lands or at time of drought , profoundly affects the soil . Winds are constantly whittling away at rock and land , // pulling out , picking up and carrying off the lighter particles . Waters are as continuously dissolving out the more soluble portions and carrying annually away to lower levels millions of tons of the finer and more valuable portions of the upland soils , leaving the coarser materials and the less valuable behind to support our agriculture . The proof of this is seen at every downpour on every hillside and in every valley . It is found in gigantic proportions in the history of glacial drift where the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fertility than are the more recent by some thousands of years , as the Late Wisconsin . ( See Table XVII . ) The plain truth is that by the operations of the socalled blind forces of nature , some soils are being benefitted and others as consistently and as certainly depleted of their fertility . Very few maintain an even keel in the kaleidoscopic changes that go almost unnoticed because they have become familiar . The fact that here and there small tracts have been abandoned for farming purposes does not prove that they were exhausted by farming . They may have been poor in the first place and profitable only under new country conditions and until farming had exhausted the small store of readily soluble materials , thousands of years in accumulating through the agency of natural herbage unremoved . History and remains of ancient civilization attest clearly that populous nations once existed where now is only desert , as in northern Africa and western Asia . This is partly due to the abandonment of vast irrigation systems ? for in those regions water is the great limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well // as leaching out , of the materials out of which crops are made . Just as the interior of every great continent tends to non-production through the lack of moisture , so do the higher lands lose ultimately the materials out of which nations may make their food . An example is the interior of China where for mile on mile no man lives , yet just below is the most populous region of all the earth save only portions of Belgium . Fortunate is the man and the nation whose lands do not all lie on the hilltops or the higher slopes . As a nation 's chief problem is in mastering erosion ? so the farmer 's chief problem is in avoiding it , for in playing that game with mother nature the cards are stacked against him . That lands wear out by cropping quite independently of leaching is capable of experimental proof . Dr. Shutt reports on two soils from New Brunswick , one virgin , the other long cultivated as it would be in that old country but supposed to be otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Many attempts have been made to secure samples of mid-west virgin prairie soil for comparison with that of cultivated fields . The problem is attended with many difficulties in securing what may fairly be called virgin soil . Manifestly samples taken from the roadside , for example , would be deceptive as having been mixed with dust from the highway for perhaps a generation . Samples from old fence rows would be abnormal as would those from timber . The writer is in possession of a number of analyses but feels that the data are too uncertain to warrant publication of definite figures . In general it may be said that so far as these analyses show anything , it is that cultivated soils have lost in fertility as compared with virgin lands , but less than would be supposed , while in many cases they seem to have gained slightly in solubility of phosphorus and potassium compounds . If , as has been said , crop production were run on the subtraction basis , a simple problem in division would indicate the year when any soil , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception to this statement lies in the fact that our methods of analysis probably fail to find the absolute total of the elements of fertility . What seems to happen in a soil undergoing exhaustion is an initial falling off in yield that is very rapidly followed by slower decline , settling into a kind of apparent constant which , however , actually shrinks a little year by year with ups and downs according to seasons but , in general , exhibiting a gradual subsidence . This is well illustrated by the history of Broadbalk Field at Rothamsted now continuously in wheat since 1843 . Complete data are not at hand but through the personal kindness of Sir John Russell , the present // Director , the author is able to bring down to date the main results of this remarkable experiment in growing wheat for eighty years without fertilization of any sort or any kind of relief from the cruel grilling of continuous cropping to wheat . As would be expected , the earlier of the unfertilized yields following a five-course system of farming ran comparatively high . Later came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated by the following data : The drop in the last eight-year period is particularly significant as at no time did the yield reach as high as 10 bushels while in 1923 it dropped as low as 4 bushels and in 1924 to 2.15 . There has been a feeling that this unmanured yield was settling down to a kind of constant around 12 bushels or a little less . These last yields look like an accelerated decline , but it must be remembered that these have been bad wheat years in England , no treatment rising higher than 21.2 bushels in 1923 or 24.1 in 1924 , this from plots whose annual average for seventy-one years has been as high as 35.1 // bushels . The safe conclusion is that Broadbalk field is being slowly but surely drained of its minerals for every soil has its limit of output as well as its limit of content ? a good lesson for farmers to remember and to act on before the soil declines to a point at which paying crops are no longer possible . CHAPTER XIV RAINFALL , RUN-OFF AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth not only varies greatly in different localities , but its fate is equally variable ? whether escaping as run-off , by drainage through the soil , or by evaporation . All these variables affect the production of crops , not only as to available plant-food but as to those physiological and biological processes on which plant growth so largely depends . RAINFALL It was formerly thought that rain and snow bring down vast quantities of fertility ; indeed the old proverb ran to the effect that snow is the poor man 's manure . In truth the actual amounts of plant-food contributed by rain and snow are very small , rarely amounting to more than four to five pounds of nitrogen to the acre annually with varying but small amounts of sulfur . The amounts of nitrogen brought down by rainfall vary with the season and probably with the locality . Rothamsted reports an average of five pounds 1 ? four as ammonia or nitrates and one as organic nitrogen from various sources . Obviously rain will bring down any atmospheric gas which is soluble in water and that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signifies for our purposes : 1 . Oxygen , which the roots of plants can use . 2 . CO2 , a mild acid but increasing enormously the solvent powers of water upon the minerals of the soil . 3 . Small amounts of ammonia ( NH3 ) arising from decomposing vegetable and animal matter on the surface of the ground . 4 . Varying amounts of nitric oxide ( NO2 ) , a mild acid formed by atmospheric electric discharge , ' which is immediately absorbed by rain-water to form nitrous and nitric acids ( HNO2 and HNO3 ) , both of which react , upon the ammonia present , forming nitrites and nitrates . 5 . Varying amounts of sulfur arising from burning wood or coal , especially the latter , the amounts being greatest near large cities . Various other materials are brought down by rain that do not much concern agriculture , such as chloride of sodium dissolved out of the floating dust of the air . Indeed almost anything may be present which is capable of rising into the atmosphere as a gas or being carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain-water , aside from the question of moisture , is its solvent action augmented by the dilute acids arising from its contacts with CO2 and NO2 . RUN-OFF There is no known measure of the amount of rainfall which runs off the surface of the ground or of the 1 Chemists tell us that at 1500 ? small amounts of nitrogen and oxygen are combined as NO which , however , at once takes up another equivalent of 0 , becoming NO , . // fertility and materials it carries away with it . No estimate can be made , for it is one thing for A 's farm and another for B 's , and it is very different on the same farm at different times and seasons : Bulletin 207 of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station states that on some drainage areas of that state as high as 50 per cent of the rainfall runs off the surface and the estimate is that 20 per cent of this prairie state is subject to damage by erosion . That the run-off is enormous and the loss of fertility and material beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the following are prominent : 1 . The fact that most highlands at all subject to wash are denuded of their finer materials and are relatively infertile . 2 . The very names of certain rivers such as the Red , the Big Muddy , the Hoang Ho , the Missouri , whose waters are said to carry at times as much as 39 per cent sediment . The Yellow Sea is a permanent acknowledgment of the industry of the Hoang Ho at the expense of the interior highlands . 3 . The vast original gorges filled by river sediment , such as the Mississippi from St. Girardeau to the Gulf , over 500 miles in a straight line and the Amazon from Manaos , more than 700 miles from the sea . 4 . The deltas formed at the mouths of many great rivers , such as the Mississippi , the Nile and the Ganges . 5 . The alluvial island of Marajo at the mouth of the Amazon , one-third the size of Kansas and half as large as Ireland . These and other similar witnesses attest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the high lands , washing out the finer particles from the soil and dissolving away the more soluble elements of fertility by wholesale . And while no definite figures can be employed to set up the situation , the gross evidence should be sufficient to convince the farmer that one of his principal problems is to protect his land from the depleting effects of the run-off , not only by keeping the ground covered and by appropriate methods of cultivation but even , in some localities , by meandering , even terracing , as the price of a permanent agriculture . DRAINAGE WATERS On the amount and composition of drainage waters there is considerable information though manifestly both will vary much with locality , the system of farming and with season . A lysimeter or drain-gauge is an out-of-doors box or bin made of cement or other water-tight material and filled with soil for the purpose of measuring the amount and determining the character of the drainage water that percolates through the soil and drains away at the bottom into contianers . Sometimes the bins are made like great cisterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural conditions the bin is constructed around a core or column of soil which , in that way , is left undisturbed . Rothamsted drainage records . ' In 1870 Lawes and Gilbert constructed three great " drain gauges " of one-thousandth of an acre each , one running to a depth of 20 inches , one 40 and one 60 inches // of undisturbed soil . No crop is raised upon the soil , no weeds are allowed to grow and no fertilizer of any kind has been added except in certain instances to the 40-inch gauge for experimental purposes . Both the amount and composition of the water draining from these gauges are now matters of record for many years , including some 18,000 drain-gauge readings . The average annual rainfall for the entire period has been 28.94 inches . The percolation has been , ? from the 20-inch gauge , 14.74 inches , from the 40-inch gauge 15.42 inches and from the 60-inch gauge 14.78 inches , showing that for this particular soil and climate , when no run-off is permitted and no crop is grown , approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half disappearing by evaporation or other natural causes if any such exist . No determination of nitrogen in the drainage water was made for the first seven years but the total amount recovered for the thirty-eight years , 1877 to 1915 inclusive , is given as 1,170 pounds for the 20-inch gauge , 1,007 for the 40-inch and 1,141 for the 60-inch gauge with the remark that " the 40-inch gauge has always shown certain differences that could not be explained . " It will , therefore , be here discarded for bad behavior . As would be expected this loss was not uniform , being much greater in wet seasons . Besides , there has been a gradual decline as appears from combining the data into four-year periods shown in Table XXVIII . In this table both the irregularity and the gradual but , marked decline are well brought out . Whether there is a tendency toward a kind of constant is uncertain but the later amounts are but little more than half those of the first period and at that time the gauges had been in operation for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning is , of course , quite a matter of conjecture . The author 's estimate is at 283 pounds for the 20-inch gauge and 265 for the 60-inch gauge . This would seem a low estimate because at the initial rates given in the table , 47.23 and 44.75 , the amounts would be 331 and 310 respectively . The deduction was probably made on account of rainfall and must be conservative . They also add 29 pounds to each gauge to bring the data down to 1917 when the report was prepared . The total nitrogen output from the beginning in 1870 up to April 1917 would , therefore , seem to be : ' // Fortunately data exist for a fairly satisfactory answer as to where all this nitrogen came from . When the drain-gauges were installed in 1870 two samples of soil were taken from nearby spots , one from bare ground , the other from barley ground . The former was believed by Sir John Lawes more nearly to represent the gauges than the barley ground but the two were as follows : In 1917 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 18 inches showing the following composition : At 176 If now this composition of the soil of the drain-gauges is compared with that of the soil of the nearby bare ground taken forty-seven years before , it will be seen that substantial losses have occurred , assuming that the bare ground sample correctly represents the original composition of the gauges . Debit and credit in the nitrogen account will then stand as follows : figure To these losses which seem to have come from the soil must be added an amount brought down by rain during the forty-seven years of the investigation , which the authors estimate at five pounds to the acre a year // or a total of 235 pounds . Adding this estimate , the visible supply of nitrogen for the 20-inch gauge becomes 1,250 + 235 or 1,485 and for the 60-inch gauge 1,732 + 235 or 1,967 or ample to account for the 1,482 and the 1,435 actual and estimated as having passed through the two gauges . This takes no account of possible nitrogen below 18 inches 1 and seems to warrant the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixation of nitrogen in the bare ground devoid of organic matter . Indeed if there has been such fixation there must have been some unknown and unsuspected source of loss . The supply has evidently come from the rain and the soil , mostly the latter , which is gradually but surely failing . The marvel is that it has lasted so long . The University of Illinois has installed a system of fifty-six lysimeters or soil-bins mostly one rod square ( see Plates VIII and IX ) on which crops are grown under rotation and various treatments , with full facilities for the study of drainage waters . In time the data from these investigations will assume high values . The study of drainage waters coming from cropped land indicates that , roughly speaking , a full half of all the soluble nitrogen applied to the soil or produced by natural agencies will , in humid regions , make its escape through drainage waters . This is a strong argument for keeping a fertile soil as busy as the climate and a feasible system of cropping will permit ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the maintenance of fertility . // Mineral losses by drainage . Drainage waters have not been sufficiently studied but what information we have points to the conclusion that serious as is the loss of all the elements of fertility by erosion and run-off , the loss of phosphorus , potassium and magnesium by drainage is practically negligible . This is not the case with lime . While it is not so immediately soluble as nitrogen in the form of nitrates , yet all indications are that lime is subject to serious loss . Only slowly soluble in clear water , lime , in most of its combinations , is exceedingly soluble in the presence of the CO2 carried down by rain-water and the still larger amounts of this dilute acid liberated by decaying vegetation . Experience at Rothamsted warrants the assertion that , in general , the loss of lime from the soil is three or four times as much as is the amount removed by crops . While we do not possess sufficiently definite data to warrant sweeping assertions of fact for the various sections of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions the English ratio will hold though manifestly on undrained soils the loss would be less by percolation and more by run-off , which on all lands subject to rainfall is the great thief of fertility . From the standpoint of drainage , nitrogen and calcium are , therefore , the most likely to become deficient in agricultural soils , as phosphorus is commonly deficient in their composition . Indeed , the world over , these three elements , next to moisture , heat and light , are the limiting factors in crop production . CHAPTER XV ORGANISMS OF THE SOIL WE used to think of the soil as an inert mass of broken down rock containing more or less decaying vegetable matter called humus and useful as standing room for crops , as a reservoir of water and as a carrier of certain mineral elements of plant-food . We know now that the soil is all of this and much more . For it not only provides standing room and food for crops but it is the home and feeding ground of countless billions of living organisms ranging in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of microscopic size so minute that an hundred or more lying side by side would scarcely reach through the thickness of the paper on which these words are printed . Truly , the soil is very much alive for the population of its upper eight or ten inches vastly exceeds all the animals and plants , big or little , that inhabit its surface , even including the insects that live and breed by the millions . Most of the individuals are so minute , their specific characters so uncertain , even shifting from time to time , and their inter-relations so complicated that attempts at taking a soil census have not been very successful . Accordingly , attention has been directed mainly to certain species or groups known to have agricultural significance and to what may be called the general reactions of the soil population . 179 // The species are known to run into hundreds and the individuals past all computation as we realize when we know that a thimbleful ) of fertile soil may contain , besides algae and fungi in limited numbers , as many as 100,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal numbers of protozoa , also microscopic , though essentially animal in their nature and habits of growth . Here in the darkness of the soil amidst the roots of growing crops , neighbors of earthworms and burrowing creatures , is a world of the infinitely little , each inhabitant living its separate life , subsisting upon whatever is near at hand , slackening or suspending operations when food is scarce until better times shall come , often operating in friendly , even partnership , relations with other species but more frequently in competition as fierce and unrelenting as that of the larger creatures above ground . Like animals and the higher plants , they probably all absorb oxygen and give off CO2 , while certain species , like the higher plants , reverse the operation . As a whole , however , soil processes are mainly disruptive and not constructive as with higher plants . So far as carbon at least is concerned , the process is one of oxidation with the evolution of heat and the liberation of energy which the organisms of the soil make use of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own bodies and manufacturing their own peculiar products . Even though bacteria are classed as plants , they do not manufacture chlorophyll . Besides , they are shut away from the sun and are , therefore , on every count compelled , like animals , to secure their energy by destructive metabolism. // This oxidation of the carbon of non-living organic matter seems to be the first step in decomposition and the oxygen supply which is usually abundant seems to be the only limiting factor as long as the carbon lasts . Some species ( aerobic ) are capable of absorbing their oxygen supply directly from that of the soil atmosphere , while others ( anaerobic ) either prefer or are obliged to get it from its combinations , while still others , commonly aerobic , may turn anaerobic when laboring under hard conditions as with a water-logged soil practically impervious to air . In either case , the reaction is an oxidizing process whose end products are water and CO2 which is often found in soil-air to an extent ten times as great as that of atmospheric air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscopic organisms need nitrogen for the formation of the protoplasm of their tissues . The supply is usually taken from the decomposing organic matter , plant or animal , on which they are at work . It is , therefore , more than abundant for their needs , the excess being left behind as food for crops , to which purpose also they ultimately yield their own bodies after the brief life cycle has been run , often saving thereby what would otherwise have been washed out and wasted . It is fortunate that a few species of bacteria are able to secure their nitrogen supply directly from the free and uncombined stock of the atmosphere because nitrogen compounds are exceedingly soluble and in the many and various transformations they undergo in the growth cycle , great quantities are lost in the drainage water . Of the bacteria possessing this unique power of securing their nitrogen supply direct from the atmosphere , some live independent lives in common with other // organisms while a few have set up a kind of permanent partnership with legumes . This symbiotic relationship seems mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live alone provided they are supplied with combined nitrogen and the bacteria can exist in the soil , for a considerable time at least , without the host and some of them can secure their own nitrogen when living alone . On the whole , therefore , the activities of soil organisms tend to reverse the cycle of growth by decomposing or tearing down the bodies and products of higher plants and animals , restoring the materials to a condition in which they can again be utilized by new generations of plants and afterward of animals . Without this general decomposing 1 process the earth would soon become encumbered with the remains of plant and animal life and the available material for organic existence would be rapidly and permanently locked up . With these decomposing processes the ground is kept cleared and the plant and animal building materials are constantly released and made ready for succeeding generations . However , while the activities of the soil organisms are on the whole and in general destructive , there is also to a less extent a constructive metabolism on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the torn down materials , so far as needed in their body building , effecting the new combinations into their own peculiar structures by means of the energy set free in the vastly larger process of decomposition . As the excess of material over and above what // is needed in building these microscopic organisms is left behind in condition to serve as plant-food in crop production , so the excess energy escapes as heat of low intensity and goes to warm the soil . While the whole subject is yet in the investigational stage and the details of what is going on within the soil are little understood , especially so far as species are concerned , yet a few significant facts of special interest to practical agriculture stand out clearly and others will develop as investigation proceeds . In the meantime it is well worth while to cast up accounts and see what has been learned , somewhat in detail , and on which agricultural practice may be based . EARTHWORMS Not counting the roots of growing crops or of such weeds as may have gained a foothold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common angleworms are the largest and most active organisms living in and from the soil . We all know them as individuals but few realize either their numbers , their activities or their agricultural significance , especially upon clayey soils and in humid climates , for they require moisture and their food is decaying vegetation . It was Darwin who first noted the activity of earthworms in pulling fallen leaves into their holes , consuming vast amounts of dead roots and passing the whole , along with much finely divided soil , through their bodies to be discharged at the surface of the land , partially digested , well mixed and flocculent . This observant naturalist estimated the amounts of material so handled by these subterranean workmen in a humid // climate and under good conditions as not less than ten tons to the acre annually . The author has just counted thirty-six holes in one square foot of garden soil , some of them stopped by great plugs of a fine grass mulch which the worms had been unable of pull down , being a full half inch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that their burrows constitute a ramifying network for the admission and distribution of air that could not be duplicated by any other known machinery . Wherever he can thrive , the earthworm is , therefore , an important factor in productive agriculture , particularly as the worm , like the microscopic organisms , leaves his own body behind , when he is done with it , as further food for crops . Recent counts at Rothamsted report half a million earthworms to the acre on unmanured lands and over twice that number on manured.l This population of worms is estimated as weighing no less than 217 pounds an acre on unmanured land and 472 on manured , carrying five pounds and ten pounds of nitrogen to the acre respectively . It must not be understood that this nitrogen is a gain to the soil on account of the worms for they have no power of fixing free nitrogen . It all came from decaying vegetation , but the worms are active agents in thoroughly incorporating the material with the soil . Clearly these counts for English soils and climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they be equalled in any soil deficient in organic matter , such as in the tropics where decomposition is exceedingly rapid . Earthworms , like all other forms of life , prosper // best and multiply fastest where food is most plentiful and living conditions most favorable . As Sir John Russell puts it , " Earthworms are the great distributors of energy material to the microscopic population . " OTHER ANIMAL AND PLANT LIFE While not so closely identified with amelioration as are the earthworms , yet the soil is the home of millions of insects and other small creatures whose bodies at death , like those of birds and most of the larger animals , go back to enrich the soil which originally produced their food ? the final debt to nature that every living thing is called on to pay . The following table gives the Rothamsted counts for these so-called " larger organisms " ? larger in truth when compared with the swarm of microscopic life with which it is associated . // These figures are noticeable for their immense insect population , for the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thousand-legged " creatures , and lastly for the greatly increased life on the manured land , showing the extent to which fresh organic matter is raw material for their activities . Micro-organisms . It is in the truly microscopic life that numbers really abound . Among these little people species are so many with characters so ill-defined , numbers so immense , life so complicated and competition so intense that no actual census seems possible . The best that can be obtained is a kind of cross-section taken on the fly , so to speak . The Rothamsted investigations have made daily counts for a year and find both daily and seasonal fluctuations , especially as between bacteria and protozoa which seem to alternate in high numbers , whether from antagonism or from some other cause not being as yet quite clear but with an appearance that , in general , the protozoa have a habit of feeding off the bacteria . While certain species are definitely known to exist in most agricultural soils , yet the species are so many and the relations so complicated that no attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While defying attempts at census enumeration , the microscopic organisms of the soil fall into four great groups , namely , algae , fungi , bacteria and protozoa , although many species possess characters common to more than one group . Of these groups the protozoa are distinctly animal in their nature , while the algae , fungi and bacteria as definitely ally themselves with plants , // except that only the algae produce chlorophyll and only these can live at the surface and get their energy direct from the sun . Indeed , sunlight is one of the best disinfectants , being especially fatal to bacteria which are , like the higher animals , obliged to secure their energy supply from previous plant or animal growth . Like animals , therefore , protozoa are in general destructive . Alger . Of all the micro-organisms of the soil the algae alone are capable of developing chlorophyll , though many species are true denizens of the soil , and at depths which mean that they are shut away from light . As a group algae possess large powers of organizing complex compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in company with shore-line vegetation , the great supporters of the life of the sea which is their typical home . What may be their function in the soil is not yet well known . Their numbers , both on the surface and in the substance of the soil , indicate notable activity , but whether beneficial or otherwise to crops is as yet undetermined . Naturally , when growing on the surface and taking their energy from the sun , algae function like other plants , adding organic matter to the soil . However , when buried in the soil , they thrive best if supplied with organic matter and it is not yet clear that they could otherwise support themselves . The fact of their presence under such conditions is generally accepted as evidence of their saprophytic character as having to do , in common with most soil organisms , with the destructive phases of the life cycle . Their power to fix nitrogen has // been asserted , but so far as is known to the writer not established . Fungi . Fungi , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in humid fertile soils and constitute one of the chief agencies in the breaking down of cellulose and the carbon portions of dead vegetable matter in general . As a group they attack with great vigor all organic matter from which life has become extinct . Many species , like the rusts and smuts , become truly parasitic , invading the very tissues of the host and constituting , when conditions are favorable , a very great menace to profitable production especially of grains and grasses . Practically all infectious diseases of plants belong to the fungi and so handily does this group of lowly organized creatures take to this piratical form of existence that Sir John Russell remarks : " There are probably few fungi that can not , under particular conditions , invade living tissues . " Knowing the elasticity in behavior of the more lowly organized of living things and the bitter struggle for a means of subsistence , the question is whether we do not have here a group of plants which , like some of the bacteria , prefer a host but can in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly many spores can live in the soil for considerable periods . It is certain that the continuous production of the same crop tends to the accumulation of the specific fungi preying on that particular plant as in corn-smut , flax sickness and the like ? a very strong argument for // rotation of crops . Though it is possible that certain fungi , ordinarily parasitic , may be able to carry on independently in the soil , certainly to exist for a time at least in the spore state , yet at best it seems a rather precarious existence from the fact that rotation appears in general to reduce the probability of fungous attacks on cultivated crops . Normally the fungi of the soil attack most vigorously all forms of non-living organic matter , their thread-like growth penetrating the entire mass of tissue , breaking down with great vigor its complex carbon compounds as a first step in general decomposition . Opinion seems about equally divided as to whether any of the species of fungi is capable of nitrogen fixation . Even so it is clear that in any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially active , however , in ammonification of organic nitrogen , paving the way to the formation of nitrates by bacterial action . It is certain that under suitable conditions many fungi attack and utilize the supply of nitrate nitrogen , a competitive habit with crops that goes far toward offsetting their beneficial service in breaking down cellulose and other plant remains . A large number of important questions await the investigator as to the distribution and the role of fungi from the agricultural point of view , a field of research of extreme difficulty from the branching habit of growth peculiar to these organisms . Protozoa . Animal in nature though microscopic in size , the protozoa constitute an important but puzzling group of soil inhabitants . Like the other micro-organisms of the soil , // their species are too numerous and their interactions too complicated for extended discussion in a book of the present purpose ; indeed , the whole field is yet for the most part in the hands of skilled investigators . Protozoa are most abundant near the surface , occupying the same space as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a not altogether friendly nature . They are accused of feeding upon their humbler neighbors of the plant world , the only defense of the bacteria , being their exceedingly rapid powers of reproduction . At any rate , the numbers of bacteria and of protozoa seem to rise and fall in inverse ratio , although it is true that some of the processes achieved by bacteria , such as nitrification , seem to proceed with greater rapidity when protozoa are present , at least in moderate numbers , suggesting some kind of mutual relationship which is not difficult of understanding when we remember that most microscopic organisms living alone soon die in their own product . Protozoa seem indifferent alike to acidity or alkalinity of soils , thriving under both conditions , while in general bacteria are sensitive to acids . It is highly improbable that protozoa are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen , though certain experiments seem to indicate that soil inhabited by nitrogen-gathering bacteria accumulates nitrogen faster when protozoa arc present than when absent , an instance of the principle just cited . This does not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the opinion of Russell , ' " A more likely explanation is that the protozoa , by consuming the Azotobacter , kept down the // numbers and transfer the nitrogen to their own bodies , " thus maintaining a cycle of nitrogen fixation at a higher rate of intensity and for a longer active period than would be possible with the Azotobacter living unmolested in its own product . Bacteria . Here among the smallest of all known organisms and in numbers exceeding by far all a1g , fungi and protozoa combined , we have a microscopic population of . many species literally swarming by the billions in all fertile soils . If counts can be at all relied on ? and no work in science has been more carefully done ? the number of bacteria in an acre of fertile soil in a humid climate must be no fewer than 20,000 million million organisms in the top six or eight inches and at the maximum in spring or fall the numbers would easily rise to twice that figure or even more . The conditions for rapid multiplication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a favorable temperature with an abundant supply of food and energy ? especially the latter in the form of decomposable organic matter . Bacteria , though belonging to the kingdom of plant life , are yet destitute of chlorophyll . They are , therefore , like animals , dependent for energy on materials that have been organized by former generations of plants capable of utilizing directly the energy of the sun ? that is , dead organic matter now capable of decomposition . In a few cases bacteria , like many fungi and some protozoa , become parasitic and invade the tissues of living organisms , plant or animal , both for materials and for energy . // Bacteria , like fungi , secure their energy from organic matter at the expense of the carbon compounds ? cellulose , starch , sugar ? the breakdown resulting in the evolution of CO2 which greatly aids the solvent power of soil-water . In general , the function of bacteria , like that of other soil organisms , is disruptive , joining the great army of fungi and other lowly organisms in preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise would soon encumber and possess the earth . Certain species , in common with fungi , perform the very useful service of breaking down the nitrogen compounds in such a way as to produce ammonia , which in turn is seized upon by other species and converted into nitrate , a form available for the use of crops , thus completing the nitrogen cycle , which , so far as we now know , would be impossible of full completion without the aid of bacteria . ' It is fairly well established , however , that in the presence of a heavy excess of carbohydrates , such as straw for example , these particular species multiply to an extent which soon exhausts the available nitrogen necessary for their own tissue building . In this case they attack and consume the ammonia they have produced instead of leaving it as a by-product for nitrification by other species and for crop use . In extreme cases they will even consume the nitrates and so come into direct competition with the crop as many a farmer has found to his sorrow following an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is generally ascribed to " burning out the soil . " While in general the function of soil organisms , whether animal or plant , and whether large or small , is disruptive , setting free materials and energy for new uses , yet certain constructive activities are going on within the soil . These are exceedingly complicated and not at all well understood . It seems , however , so far as their end products are concerned , that they resolve themselves into two distinctive groups : First , the building of the bodies of the organisms themselves in which the lowly life of the soil competes directly for materials though not for energy with the higher life of crops , an activity and a competition necessarily exercised by all species . Second , the bringing of large amounts of the free nitrogen of the atmosphere into combinations which can be used by the higher plants , a service not in competition with crops and performed by a few of the many species of bacteria , without which , so far as we know , the world would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture . This " fixation of nitrogen , " an extremely complicated process or series of processes , is generally spoken of under the comprehensive term , nitrification , under which heading it will be discussed briefly in the succeeding chapter . SUMMARY If no decomposing processes were at work , the earth would soon be encumbered with the remains of dead animal and plant life . In the processes of nature such decomposition is prompt and rapid , the materials being utilized in building the structure of future generations 19 ? The Farm of plants , the energy released in the decomposition being employed in building the tissues of non-chlorophyllbearing organisms engaged in the decomposition and in supporting their own vital processes . These decomposing and reorganizing processes are exceedingly complex and in detail not well understood . Some portions of the process are probably chemical only , but the bulk of the work is the result of hosts of organisms , plant and animal , mostly the former , ranging in size from earthworms and insects down to microscopic , if not indeed beyond the powers of ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is doubtful whether they can ever be determined fully because of the relative instability of many otherwise distinguishing characters which seem ready to change radically under altered conditions . All known microscopic organisms of the soil are rather conveniently , though somewhat arbitrarily , classified under four groups ? algae , fungi , bacteria and protozoa , all essentially vegetative except the protozoa which are allied with animal life . These lowly organisms by the millions live together in varying numbers and proportions under all possible relations , generally in direct competition for food and energy , often , however , supplementary , one species beginning where another leaves off . Not infrequently the relationship is so close that two species appear to live together in mutual helpfulness , amounting in a few cases to real symbiosis between themselves or with higher plants as in the case of tubercle-forming bacteria on the roots of legumes . In general and taken as a whole , this inter-related activity of many species results in the following : // First , the breaking down of the carbon compounds with release of CO2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , this requires large supplies of oxygen which certain forms ( aerobic ) can take from the air of the soil while other forms ( anaerobic ) must extract , or at least may extract if so compelled , from organic compounds nearest at hand . Second , the liberation of vast amounts of energy which can be utilized in supporting the vital processes and building up the simple compounds characteristic of lowly organized creatures . Third , the breaking down of the nitrogen compounds of dead organic matter , first into ammonia by certain species and by others converted from this form into nitrates in which combination it is most generally available for the use of crops . Fourth , the possible destruction of these nitrates by the micro-organisms themselves if working in an excess of crude carbon material like fresh straw . Fifth , the actual combination of the free nitrogen of the air by two classes of bacteria , the one in symbiotic relation with the roots of legumes , the other living free like most forms of microscopic life in the soil . Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural point of view . Sixth , the conversion of sulfur compounds into sulfates , the form in which sulfur enters the growing crop . Seventh , the occasional formation of acids during the complicated actions and reactions following the absorption of oxygen , nitrogen and water on the one hand and the breaking down of carbon , nitrogen and sulfur compounds on the other . CHAPTER XVI NITROGEN FIXATION Tim most distinctive service of soil organisms is the fixation of small portions of the free nitrogen of the atmosphere and its conversion into forms which can be used by crops , a service which none of the higher plants and no known animal is able to perform . Doubtless a considerable number of different species are able to do this work , certainly more than one . Whatever the number , they divide for all practical purposes so far as we now know , into two groups : First , those which live by themselves like other soil organisms , securing their food and energy ? except for nitrogen ? from dead organic matter ; second , those which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a kind of symbiotic relation of mutual adventage . The first group is wholly benevolent , working for nothing and boarding themselves , giving off the captured nitrogen and in the end yielding their own bodies and completing the nitrogen cycles without money and without price . The most active and widely diffused of all known free-living nitrogen-gathering bacteria has been named Azotobacter . It appears to be always and everywhere present and invariably at work . The second group demands both lodgings and board . That is to say , it penetrates the very root tissues of the growing legume ? clover , alfalfa , pea , bean , vetch , cow-196 // pea , soybean or other pod-bearing plant and there abides , living practically off the juices of the plant and paying for accommodations in the coin called combined nitrogen . The plant has no choice but to make the best of the situation . In an abundance of soil nitrogen , it has no immediate ' need of this bacterial old man of the sea but in time of scarcity the arrangement is exceedingly profitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom present in sufficient amounts to meet the excessive demands of the legumes nor can the farmer afford to supply this costly and exceedingly soluble form of plant-food in the quantities desirable for these particular crops ? certainly not when there is a cheaper way by letting out the job to these benevolent organisms whose specialty it is , even if it should become necessary to inoculate the soil , which is rarely the case except when some new legume is about to be introduced . The leguminous crop appears not to be disturbed greatly by the parasitism of its nitrogen-gathering guest . It throws out a little tissue at the point infected ? the so-called root-tubercles ? as if in protest , perhaps , but after that it goes about its usual business seemingly as well off as before . After the season is over the land as a whole is found to have gained rather than lost in nitrogen . This can be said after no other crop than legumes and then only when the soil carries a bacterium that can thrive upon the roots of that particular crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term species with such inconstant forms as these ? will grow on any or every legume . On the other hand , not every legume has its exclusive type . For example , the form characteristic of the pea will grow also upon one or two other // legumes but not generally . That adapted to the soybean will not , so far as known , thrive on any other host , while the organism commonly found on sweet clover serves alfalfa equally well but not the true clovers . It is , therefore , generally necessary , when introducing a new legume , to inoculate with the specific organism . One infection seems to be sufficient , at least for many years , suggesting that these organisms may have more than one way of living or at least existing , perhaps in a more or less quiescent state , although it seems clear that some at least of the species commonly parasitic in legumes can , under favorable circumstances , fix nitrogen when living a detached existence . ( See Plate X. ) This fact , together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has often raised the question whether they could not be bred to live upon hosts other than legumes . Such efforts have not so far succeeded , certainly so far as agricultural plants are concerned . This work of fixing the free nitrogen of the atmosphere , especially by non-parasitic species , like the decomposition of vegetable matter , the conversion of ammonia to nitrates and every other activity of soil organisms , requires , besides a favorable temperature , a free supply of oxygen and an abundant supply of energy-yielding organic matter . This is sufficient reason for a porous soil , good cultivation and plenty of farmyard manure or its equivalent in green crops plowed under . // DISCOVERY OF NITROGEN-GATHERING BACTERIA The discovery of nitrogen-gathering bacteria on the roots of legumes antedated by some years the knowledge of free-moving species engaged in the same kind of service . The long-continued investigations which led to the discovery of nitrogen-gathering bacteria inhabiting the roots of legumes were classic in scientific ingenuity and persistence as they were also the most significant addition to the science and practice of agriculture . Chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the " nitrogen mystery , " that is , how crops obtain their nitrogen supply , remained , for years , unsolved . It was finally learned that soil in which clover and other legumes had grown was usually richer in nitrogen than before , while with all other crops it was poorer . Chemists then for a time divided plants into nitrogen-consumers , the narrow-leaved crops , and nitrogen-producers , the broad-leaved . Further research , however , determined that when clover is grown in an sterilized medium no nitrogen is added . In the meantime agriculture was suffering for " combined nitrogen " and fleets of ships were busy hauling guano from the South Sea Islands to England in order to maintain paying yields . It was about this time that the writer saw a letter written to Dr. Manly Miles by Sir John Lawes . In that letter Sir John pointed out the absurdity of supposing that the agriculture of the world could long be sustained by ancient beds of " bird dung " deposited on a few rainless islands in the South Pacific Ocean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some natural and universally operative method of // securing combined nitrogen , else whence came the original world supply ? Shortly afterward , that is in 1886 , Hellriegel made the discovery that when legumes are grown in arable soil root-tubercles develop and in that case nitrogen is added . But if they are grown in sterilized soil no tubercles develop and no nitrogen is fixed . Botanists had noticed these " warts " on certain roots and had considered them as a disease to be " bred off . " Hellriegel showed them to be colonies of nitrogen-gathering organisms . Lawes and Gilbert at Rothamsted had long been working on the same problem and it was the privilege of the writer to see the original clover plants with which they confirmed Hellriegel 's investigations and to hear Dr. Gilbert explain how his discovery had been instantly pushed into its agricultural ramifications , finding confirmation in their own experiments which had then been running for over half a century . Altogether this discovery of the symbiotic relation between legumes and certain bacteria resulting in the addition of notable amounts of combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements of the times but of the most consequence to practical agriculture of all the attempts of science to meet the needs and serve the purposes of the farmer . AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN FIXED The amounts of combined nitrogen so brought into the soil are considerable . The exact figures have never been determined and perhaps are impossible to fix except indirectly and by inference . It is generally believed that the amounts fixed by the free-living bacteria are less than those brought to the soil by those living in symNitrogen // biotic relation with the roots of legumes , though without doubt both are exceedingly variable in response to conditions . A. D. Hall , ' writing of the history of agricultural land abandoned for more than twenty years , finds an accumulation of practically twenty-five pounds of nitrogen annually on land bearing no legumes and therefore presumably dependent on free-living bacteria for nitrogen fixation . He remarks that perhaps five pounds annually might be credited to rainfall , something additional to bird droppings and other accidental causes , but that the remainder must be accredited to the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the soil or assume a rise of nitrates from lower levels . If , however , all the upper twenty-seven inches of the soil is included there was an accumulation of considerably over 800 pounds of nitrogen in the twenty-one years or something more than forty pounds a year , an amount which fairly well agrees with the estimates of other scientists . ' In the monograph above cited Hall also makes a report on the accumulation of nitrogen on an abandoned section of another but near by field ( Broadbalk ) also run wild for over twenty years , but supporting a mixed herbage in which a goodly proportion was leguminous . Here the accumulation of nitrogen was at the rate of over 100 pounds a year , from which we conclude , so far as this experiment is concerned at least , that the legume-inhabiting bacteria are three or four times more effective as // a whole than the free-moving species . In both cases no allowance is made for denitrifying processes which might have been at work , especially in the absence of a growing crop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of how much nitrogen bacteria can bring to the soil in a single season . Alfalfa was grown as a field crop both on inoculated and uninoculated land . The first of four cuttings indicated an excess of over forty pounds an acre in favor of the inoculated ground . Before the second cutting cross inoculation had evidently occurred , but from the comparative yields the conclusion is drawn that the bacteria in the inoculated plot brought to the land approximately 172 pounds of nitrogen during the growing season and where minerals had been added no less than 252 pounds . Manifestly the methods are again inconclusive without drainage records and especially so in the absence of soil analyses both before and at the end of the season . Even so , pot experiments were held to confirm these conclusions . The Canadian Annual Report for 1905 gives an account of pot experiments on soil containing only 874 pounds to two million of soil and found that at the end of two seasons ' growth of mammoth clover , the land had apparently gained in nitrogen to the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hartwell and Pember 1 conducted a five-year pot culture experiment with legume rotation running continuously , that is in greenhouse during the winter and outof-doors in the growing season . They report a total nitrogen gain by soil processes equivalent to one ton to the acre . for the five-year period , or 400 pounds annually . // We greatly need further careful work in this field . It is exceedingly difficult because of the natural complications of the situation , including losses by drainage and because the fixation of nitrogen is evidently influenced by changing conditions . In the absence of more reliable information it is reasonable to assume that under good conditions , with plenty of minerals , bacteria working on the roots of legumes are capable of gathering as much as 100 pounds of nitrogen annually , or three or four times the probable efficiency of the free-living organisms , although it must not be forgotten that species normally living on the roots of legumes may have some power of nitrogen fixation when living alone . INFLUENCE OF CROP ON NITRIFICATION Considerable work has been done on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators seem to agree that Indian corn is extremely favorable and oats unfavorable to the formation of nitrates . Of course , neither crop supposedly brings nitrogen to the soil , but that crops differ greatly in their influence on the general nitrifying processes is established beyond a doubt . Lyon and Bizzell 1 have done a notable piece of work in determining the nitrate-content of the soil at different stages of the growth of the crop occupying the land and have shown that this crop influence often extends into the following season . The very large need for nitrogen in agriculture and the fact that most legumes are food for live-stock rather than for man have led to many and persistent experi- // ments to determine whether some form of nitrogengathering organism could be induced to grow on the roots of other crops , hopefully the grasses or the grains , but thus far without success . T. J. Burrill of Illinois , a pioneer in bacteriology , devoted his last work and thought to this problem , believing that with the well-known elasticity in habit of these microscopic organisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either so cultivated or so bred as to tolerate a change of host . However , death closed his labors which are reported by his junior associate , Dr. Hansen , in Illinois Bulletin 202 as altogether negative . He even failed to confirm earlier claims of nodule formation and nitrogen fixation by certain non-leguminous non-agricultural plants as asserted by other investigators . So far as is known to the writer , biologists are not at present active in this particular field , feeling no doubt that if such adaptation were possible or at least practicable under field conditions , it would long since have come about through natural causes . EXCESSIVE NITRIFICATION The almost universal lack of combined nitrogen and its exceeding solubility have made whole generations of farmers feel that good farming must be ranged around its production , conservation and economical use . Such a thing as too much nitrogen has hardly been known on ordinary farms since the days of pioneer farming on alluvial soils or newly cleared land . It is true that Bailey discusses the effect of excessive amounts of nitrogen on orchard trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with the lodging of small grains upon spots which , for one reason or another , had been over abundantly supplied with nitrogen . Excessive nitrification had been recognized at the mouth of caves as at Mammoth where gunpowder was made for the war of 1812 and under or about old buildings where organic matter had long accumulated . But about 1892 Colorado farmers began to notice char-. acteristic " brown spots " on which nothing would grow . Orchards were killed out and ordinary crops either failed to start or speedily died , leaving the ground bare and barren . By 1905 the trouble had become so serious that it was brought to the attention of the experiment station and has been carefully studied by W. P. Headden , chemist of the station , and by Walter G. Sackett , bacteriologist . These spots might be only a foot or two in diameter and they might cover whole fields . They are described by Sackett 1 as looking moist and dark as if marking a spot where crude oil had been spilled . However , below the half inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown spots or areas are characterized by an excessive amount of nitrate , amounting in some instances to 56.74 tons to the acre foot for an orchard area of ten to twelve acres . In another instance , involving an eight-acre tract , a five-inch sample indicated 172 tons of nitrate to the acre , showing that the " problem is not one involving pounds , but rather tons per acre . " It was at first assumed that these nitre areas , popularly called alkali and confused with the black alkali // ( sodium carbonate ) , might be due to seepage caused by excessive irrigation upon higher levels . This point was especially investigated as well as the character of soilwaters by Headden who succeeded in finding no evidence of nitrate either from shales or due to seepage . On the contrary , he found the characteristic brown spots on top of mesas , in one case eighty feet above the water level . In some instances he found shallow well-water rich enough in nitrates to kill cattle and it was suggested that the surface nitrates had been left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for the amounts of nitrate often present it would require the evaporation of 1,327 acre feet which would take some 265 years and would leave behind enough other salts to cover the land seven feet deep . In nearly every case the surface soil , especially the top three or four inches , was much richer in nitrates than the lower soil . He also found the line of demarkation so distinct that , " A sample of the brown crust from the side of an irrigating furrow in an orchard contained 640 parts per million of nitrate nitrogen , while two and a half feet away the surface four inches of normal soil gave 34 parts . " ' It seemed clear that the nitrate must be formed in place by the nitrifying organisms of soil . To test this possibility these experimenters confined 3,000 pounds of the soil under control conditions in a bed six inches deep , kept it under uniform temperature and moisture conditions for forty days , at the end of which time it // had gained nitrogen a% the rate of thirty-six pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons sodium nitrate to the acre foot . Experiments were conducted under control conditions to test the nitrifying power of soils from many different localities , from which Sackett concludes that , " The nitrifying flora of Colorado soils is distinct from that found in the majority of foreign ( other state ) samples ; it is either made up of entirely different organisms , or , if the same organisms they behave like different strains . " This exceedingly puzzling and difficult matter seems to be linked up either with some peculiar infection under semi-arid conditions or else with some unknown factor favoring fixation . It is certainly clearly distinguished from ordinary alkali trouble , either black or white , though the brown color is doubtless due to the presence of sodium . Gillette considers that " the nitrate trouble is one that is practically as extensive as the arid area in this country " ? some difficulty having been encountered " as far east as western Kansas and Nebraska and as far west as California . " From all the evidence now at hand as to fixation of nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems impossible that humid climates will ever be troubled with excessive nitrification ? certainly not unless some new types are encountered or the old ones take on new and hitherto unprecedented behaviors . On the contrary , it will probably be true in humid climates that the farmer 's most difficult single problem is to secure sufficient amounts of combined nitrogen . // The nitrogen problem is , probably , all things considered , the most complicated and difficult of all known agricultural questions . The field , which is exceedingly technical , belongs to the trained investigator with proper equipment and is no place now for the layman to indulge in speculations . It is , however , a field rich in promise of results for the practical farmer and he will do well to keep in close touch with future developments at the research institutions . CHAPTER XVII SOIL ACIDITY MOST crops thrive best in soils slightly alkaline or at least neutral . Whatever may be the reason or reasons , most lands tend to become acid through long-continued cultivation . While most ordinary crops seem indifferent to mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the roots of legumes , are extremely sensitive to acid conditions . Soil acidity , therefore , which seems to develop with the business , is antagonistic to the farmer 's best means of securing nitrogen and about the only way of getting it cheaply enough for ordinary crops . It is easy to say that the plowing under of large masses of green-manure sours the lands . There is basis for the conviction , for in silo fermentation acid-forming bacteria are exceedingly common and while the multitude of actions and reactions going on within the soil are not well understood , it is perfectly clear that acids of many sorts are being formed constantly . There are other causes of acidity . All forms of plantfood must be soluble . Most of these compounds are called salts by the chemist , that is , a union of an alkaline base , such as ammonium , calcium , magnesium , with an acid such as carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , nitric acid ( HNO3 ) , hydrochloric ( HCL ) or sulfuric ( H2SO4 ) . 209 // Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced . Others , like H2SO4 , are strong . A weak acid uniting to a strong base will give a salt that is probably alkaline but a strong acid uniting with a weak base will almost certainly give rise to a salt with an acid reaction , in all probability a not infrequent cause of acid soils . A far greater cause is known as selective absorption of bases . This means that , in general , crops have more use for bases than for acids and do not hesitate to take what they need and leave the acid radicle behind to find another mate , or , failing that , to give the soil an acid reaction . Chemical affinity between bases and acids is sufficiently strong that when an acid is dispossessed of its base by any cause whatever , it will effect another union if possible , even if compelled to oust a weaker acid like CO2 which , though ubiquitous and busy , is forever being driven from pillar to post by stronger competitors . In practice it appears that in lands long cultivated under humid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving unsatisfied acids to accumulate to the detriment of agriculture , justifying the ancient and widespread practice of liming . The term " acid soils " is rather loosely used to cover various conditions adverse to crop production . However , while the whole subject is yet involved in much obscurity , it looks now as if most of the trouble arises , not so much from free acids as from strong acids being forced to combine with weak bases like aluminum or iron because of a deficiency in the stronger bases , calcium and magnesium . The Experiment Station of Rhode Island has been working on acid soils for many years and the above is // the conclusion arrived at by L. P. Howard in Contribution No. 263 from the Station as given in Soil Science , Vol . VIII , No. 4 , October , 1919 . It is not the province of a text of this character to enter on ground which is yet in the experimental stage any further than is necessary to acquaint the reader with the nature of the unsolved problem and give some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a solution . CHAPTER XVIII COLLOIDAL MATERIAL OF THE SOIL UNTIL recently not much attention was paid to the size of the particles that make up soils beyond the fact that stones interfere with farming operations and some soils are so coarse as to be " leachy . " It was known , of course , that clays must not be worked when wet from fear of " puddling " and then of " baking " as they dry out . Experience had shown , also , that lime improves the texture of clays , but why they puddle , bake and flocculate was a question that neither the farmer nor the scientist was prepared to answer . MECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF SOILS Then came the so-called mechanical analysis of soils , shifting the study from the field of chemistry to that of physics , not to the abandonment of the former but to the advantage of both . This purely physical study of the land is based on the fact that all soils are composed of particles that vary greatly in size as well as in chemical composition ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finer particles , and that this proportion has much to do with the general character of a soil , especially respecting its relations to water and indirectly to air and to the ordinary operations of farming . This mechanical analysis consists in actually separating the coarser from the finer particles of the soil to be examined , and afterward determining the percentage 212 // of each . In the earlier analyses the process consisted in adding a liberal amount of water to the sample of soil , shaking it thoroughly in a suitable container and permitting the contents to settle by the force of gravity . Manifestly the coarser particles would settle first , the finer next and the finest of all might remain suspended for hours , perhaps for days . By measuring the sedimentation at stated intervals , a kind of rough approximation to degrees of fineness could be attained . The process was long and slow because of the indefinite suspension of the finer particles , many of which were never recovered by the earlier and cruder technique . Improvements followed , however , and the Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the centrifuge as a kind of artificial and intensified gravity system by which much time is saved and more accurate distinctions of fineness established Attention now became directed more and more to the actual size of particles and the Bureau standardized in seven different grades or " separates " ranging from the coarsest to the finest soil particles . In 1904 the schedule of names and sizes shown in Table XXXIV was published . Of these gradations in fineness , the last two , silt and clay ( 0.05-0.005 and below ) are not visible to the naked eye and some of the " below " is invisible even to the ultra-microscope . ' Not until the development of colloid chemistry were we in position to understand at all adequately the peculiar significance of these finer particles as they affect the soil in its physical aspects and quite aside from its chemical properties . Even yet the whole subject is , for the most part , in the experimental stage , although no little light has been shed on certain angles of the problem . COLLOID CHEMISTRY The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colloidal chemistry deals with matter in an exceedingly finely divided state , so finely divided that , like glue or jelly , it will remain suspended in its containing medium , water for example , without settling to the bottom in response to gravity . This looks like a thick solution but a solution is quite distinct from a colloid , // the particles being still finer , probably being reduced very near if not quite to the molecular state . Familiar examples of colloids besides glue are soaps , albumen or white of egg , starch that has been boiled with water , oil emulsions , gelatin and jellies in general . These particular colloids are products of animal or plant life , but any substance that is capable of exceedingly minute subdivision is capable of existing in the colloidal state , gold for example . Chemists tell us that an ounce of gold can be beaten to sheets aggregating 100 square feet in area , in which case it would require 282,000 such sheets , piled one upon another , to equal one inch in thickness . ' This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles are not over 1/282,000 of an inch in diameter which is practically that of the colloid state . If in any way , mechanical or chemical , particles of gold are reduced in size to 1/10,000 of a millimeter ( one 250,000 of an inch ) in diameter , they become invisible to the ordinary microscope , exhibit the Brownian movement , will remain suspended in a liquid indefinitely and are , therefore , in the colloidal state . If further reduced to 1/25,000,000 of an inch , they may still be detected by the ultra-microscope but refined chemical methods are capable of carrying the subdivision to the point of absolute invisibility . Colloid chemistry , therefore , deals with matter in an extremely divided state , whether in the original form of solid , liquid or gas . Fogs and clouds are familiar examples of a liquid suspended in a gas , just as smoke consists of solids so suspended . Cement is systematically reduced to the colloid state // preparatory to its hardening while potter 's clay naturally exists in that condition . Following the general theme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to anyone who really wishes to understand about : cements , bricks , pottery , porcelain glass ; oils , soaps , glue , starch ; paints , varnishes ; rubber , celluloid and other plastics ; pencils , crayons , inks ; cream , butter , cheese and casein products2 . " Soil colloids . Accustomed as is the farmer to the loose and friable character of a kindly soil , it would seem impossible that it should contain a large percentage of anything like such a substance as glue or gelatin . Yet such is the fact . Robinson and Holmes of the Bureau of Soils separated the colloidal material from a number of typical soils and describe it as " a stiff and sticky gel . " 3 These investigators studied the fineness of division and the chemical composition of the colloid material from forty-six typical soils from different parts of the United States . They report in the bulletin just cited that the particles of colloid material examined ranged in diameter from 0.3 microns , ' down , and by " down " they mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment was to determine the chemical composition of the colloids . For this reason no attempt was made to extract the total colloidal content but for the purposes at hand the amount of colloid material actually extracted varied from 7.01 per cent in . // Marshall silt loam from Nebraska to 38.50 per cent from Sharkey clay ? locality not stated . Nor is this to be taken as the total content of colloid material from these soils for in the opinion of the investigators , " The colloid not extracted by our methods may be as much as half of the total colloid in the soil as determined by both absorption and microscopic methods . " As would be expected the chemical composition of the colloid material of these soils from different sections of the United States varied widely , showing that it had originated from various materials . The most plentiful substance is silica , SiO2 , which varied from 51.32 to 93.66 per cent . Alumina , Al2O3i came next , ranging from 2.57 to 22.92 per cent with iron oxide , Fe2O3j from 0.93 to 13.82 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 0.30-0.60 per cent , in six samples reaching 1.0 per cent and in one case 7.77 per cent . Potash , K2O , was perhaps twice as plentiful as lime , but in only one case did P2O5 reach as much as 0.30 per cent . Source of colloids . Most of these colloids must have had a source similar to that of the bulk of the soils , though it must not be forgotten that considerable proportions of decaying vegetable matter assumes the colloid state and that many bacteria come within the category of colloidal material . Compared with the composition of soils from which the colloidal material had been extracted , the composition of the colloids was about four times as high in Al203i five times as high in Fe203 , twice as high in CaO and about the same in potash . The great difference was // in silica , of which the coarse soil had twice the percentage of the colloids , namely 87.2 as against an average of 43.34 for the colloids . Effect of colloids . The presence of any considerable amounts of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the soil as a whole , particularly as to its relations with water . In general , soil colloids exhibit a great affinity for moisture which they hold with exceeding persistence . It is not difficult to appreciate this property when we remember that a thin film of water exists upon the surface of almost everything and when we calculate what minute subdivision means in the way of increase of surface we can begin to understand what the colloidal state may mean with reference to moisture . That is to say , while a perfectly solid cubic inch of matter ? if such a thing could be ? presents only six square inches of surface , the same material , if divided into cubes one millionth of an inch on a side , would then have a total surface of 3,472 square feet or nearly one-twelfth of an acre . It is easy , therefore , to understand the intense avidity and holding power for water possessed by the colloid portion of soils . In satisfying this need it swells greatly in bulk and , if excessive in amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shutting out the air and , in extreme cases , even preventing the passage of free water , making under-drainage impossible . A clay soil will endure a large proportion of colloid // material provided it is also supplied with a high percentage of relatively coarse particles to which the finest material may cling , like barnacles to the ship bottom . Even the stickiest gumbo , if so supplied , will behave fairly well as an agricultural soil . When all the soil is relatively fine the impalpable material is left to its own devices , so to speak , and , having nothing to which to adhere , it swells into a more or less homogeneous jelly-like mass which practically excludes the entrance of either air or water . Such " tight clays " are undrainable because water can not penetrate them when once the colloidal capacity is satisfied . Rain , falling on the surface , then will settle into every depression , even the tracks of animals , where it will stand until evaporated . Watering places for live-stock are made in that kind of soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet of any water course that may chance to have formed upon the surface . Such a soil when once dried out is again almost impervious to water because of the difficulty in displacing the air which , by this time , has succeeded in gaining entrance . It will behave toward water like a dish of the finest flour . When , however , during the rainy season such a soil finally becomes moistened and then thoroughly wet , a surface blanket is formed which practically excludes both air and water from the deeper levels . The result is that , while the waterholding capacity of any given portion of such a soil is high , not a large enough body of soil becomes thoroughly moistened and summer crops will quickly suffer from drought and vast columns of the finest dust // will rise from the roadways , proclaiming for miles away the progress of a passing vehicle . ' The only practicable method of dealing with clays excessively supplied with colloid material is either to treat liberally with lime or , from time to time , plant deep rooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well filled with undecomposed roots as clinging space for the smaller particles . Besides the high percentage of finely divided material carried in clay it must not be forgotten that the silicates , which constitute its basis , easily crystallize in flat flakes , like pieces of paper , mica for example . Such flakes when wet will cling together with an energy unapproached by the bulky crystals of sand with their sharp corners . CHAPTER XIX THE WATER OF THE SOIL IN the earlier studies of soils ground-water was considered as existing in three different states : First , free or " gravitational water " which passes between the soil particles and on out through the drainage system under the influence of gravity . Second , " capillary water " or that which exists as a thin film on the surface of the particles but will move horizontally or even vertically as the tension is relieved at any point , either by evaporation or the absorbing power of roots . Third , " hygroscopic water " or that portion which does not respond either to gravity or to the capillary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These distinctions , while hardly meeting the niceties of modern science , after all roughly fit the facts and by common consent still stand . Gravitational water varies greatly in amount with season , soil and climate . It must be disposed of by some sort of drainage system before it shuts off too much air from the roots of growing crops and the useful organisms depending on the atmospheric supply of oxygen . As it has no agricultural value , rather the contrary , that portion of the subject of soil-water can be disposed of under the head of Drainage . 221 // HYGROSCOPIC WATER A hygroscope is an instrument for measuring the moisture of the atmosphere . By definition , therefore , the hygroscopic water of the soil is that moisture which it absorbs from the air that rests upon the surface and circulates between its particles . Manifestly the amount will vary greatly from time to time , depending on the condition of the atmosphere . It varies even more in different kinds of soils , being very low in coarse sand and relatively high with clays or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems to be due to surface attraction and is , therefore , to a high degree a function of the colloid material present . According to the investigations of Briggs and Schantz , ' fine sandy loam with 12.9 per cent of clay will absorb thirteen times as much water from a saturated atmosphere as will coarse sand , and a clay loam with 22.0 per cent of clay will absorb approximately twenty-three times as much . This water must be held by surface contact with the soil particles . From the facts that considerable heat is required to drive it off and that a soil thus deprived of its hygroscopic water will develop heat when again exposed to a moist atmosphere , it looks a little as though this form of water has set up some sort of chemical relationship . The whole matter is a great mystery , particularly as it is asserted that water may actually penetrate the material of glass . In this connection Langmuir is quoted by Bancroft = as reporting : " If a 40-watt incandescent lamp bulb which has been // exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several hours , it loses enough gas to form a layer of water 55 molecules deep all over the surface . " Whether this is matter of agricultural significance is a question that must await further investigation . It is certain that moisture held with a tenacity that requires several hundred degrees of heat to drive it off can not be of immediate consequence to crops as a source of available moisture . If it is true , however , that such water has entered into some sort of intimate chemical relation to the materials of the soil substance , for this reason it may have very great influence in solvent action and in the development of the soil solutions upon which crops must feed . CAPILLARY WATER This is the water on which crops seem to be dependent for moisture and , in practice , it means all the water of a well-drained soil except the hygroscopic . In calling it capillary we probably make rather free use of the term . The word " capillary " comes from capillus , a hair . Hair is supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tube in which water will gradually rise because the surface tension between the water and the sides of the tube is stronger than the force of gravity , the height to which it will rise depending on the fineness of the tube . The principle gets its best application in the cellular structure and the vascular bundles of growing plants or wherever long fine tubes are in contact with a liquid . But the principle does not depend on actual hairs or hair-like tubes . It resides in the tension of surface films by which any inequality in film thickness tends // immediately to adjust itself by a flow from all directions to the spot where the film is deficient . It is not necessary , therefore , that surfaces should be in the form of tubes though in that form we have the maximum surface tension in proportion to gravity . All that is necessary in order that surface tension should cause a flow in the film is that the surfaces should come into actual contact or rather that the films themselves should actually join . These conditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay or wherever colloid material makes up a considerable percentage . This colloid material is known not only to absorb 1 immense amounts of water but to swell in bulk , sponge fashion , and here is the undoubted supply on which the roots can draw . For the principle is that any reduction at any point from any cause , evaporation , root absorption or what not , will immediately be followed by a flow of the film in that direction until the tension is equalized . Experiments indicate that in most soils water will not rise over about three feet by capillarity , showing clearly that soil-moisture available for crops does not , in general , rise from the water-table . Instead , it is retained from the rainfall that percolates the soil and is caught on the wing as it passes by to the water-table below . ' // The finer the soil the more will be retained of whatever actually enters the soil , but it must be remembered that a soil may have so high a percentage of impalpable material that the rain-water can not displace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall . The farmer 's business , then , as to moisture supply for his crops , is first to drain off the free water which is only injurious , then maintain as high a proportion of finely divided soil material as possible up to the point of overdoing the matter , a condition he will quickly discover by the difficulty of water entering the soil and the early suffering of crops from drought .
