txt The Government admitted today the possibility that if the Federal courts cancel the sale of seized German patents to the Chemical Foundation and return these patents to the Government . the patents may eventually revert to their former German owners . This admission , in reply to a query by Judge Morris . was made by Special Assistant Attorney General Henry W. Anderson . It Is regarded as tending to bear out the contention of Isador J. E.-reset , counsel for the Foundation , that cancellation of the sale ultimately would mean the return of the patents to the German dye trust , w hien he has described as " an invisible plaintiff in this action . " Colonel Anderson declared that if the Government wen this edit the patents would be at the disposition of Congress . and he agreed that it was possible Congress could order their return to the Germans . In an address during argument on legal questions Culonel Anderson made a summary of the Government 's charge of conspiracy against the Foundation and the American Dyes Institute . Cites Choate 's Statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee by Joseph H. Choate , formerly general counsel to the Alien Property Custodian and now counsel for the Foundation . Mr. Choate appeared in June . 1919. before the House Ways and Means Committee as counsel for the Foundation and representing the American Dyes Institute . composed of manufacturers , and which financed the search for patents transferred by the Custodian to the Foundation . He declared in this hearing that the $250,000 paid by the Foundation for the patents Was arrived at by guesswork . Mr. Choate told the committee that the transfer of patents to the Foundation . was at private sale because only at such a sale could there be assurance of bona fide bidders . At a public sale . he testified . " the only other kind of bidder would be a hold-up artist , who would buy the patents for profit or to hold them for his own use . " After reading this record , Colonel Anderson said : " The evidence has now reached a stage which shows that the Chemical Foundation and the American Dyes Institute are one and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the hand of the Institute ; that every dollar of money put into the Foundation was suoscribed by members of the institute : that they organized it ; that they are the real . beneficiaries of its operatiens ; that the Institute and the Foundation and those who organize.i them are parties to the various traesactions the purpose of which was to monopolize this industry . prevent and restrain foreign commerce , ** bring about the condition we have enumerated . Says Validity of Title Is Settled . Judge Morris asked whether the Government held that the court could not determine the validity of the seizure , to which Colonel Anderson replied : " The question of validity can not be raised , because the Government can not attack its own title . The foundation , claiming through the Government , certainly can not attack its title , because It has no title . The original German owner can not attack the title of the United States , because the treaty of peace ratified the seizure , agreeing that the property be held until Germany 's compliance with the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim title through the same source , the custodian . The question is merely as to whether there was a valid sale . If it was not , title rests in the United States and the United States holds it " " Although " asked the court , " that seizure may have been one of the steps , should we find a conspiracy in acquisition of the patents by the industry ? " " Undoubtedly . " answered Colonel Anderson . " if agents of the Government were guilty of conspiracy in the seizure the Government can not be estopped by their wrong . The Government has contracted with Germany by treaty that its title against the German owner is good , and the only question is as between the United States and its assignee . " Discusses Holding of Patents .. In reply to the Court 's question as to the Government 's Intention if it recovered the patents , Col Anderson said : " I have not said the United States was going to hold them . " " I thought you told me the United States was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Morris , " It will against the defendant , the Chemical Foundation , " said Colonel Anderson . " The question of what Congress may do with the patents is not for me to consider . The Executive Departmerit. will hold them until Congress acts . and hold them as long as Congress elects not to act . The remedy against misuse of the patents lies in Congress . " The United States has three courses if the p ? V ? nts are returned to It : One is , Congress has power to return them to their owners under such conditions as it sees fit : second . Co congress may keep theme patents and reimburse the German owners ; third , Congress may confiscate . but I hope Congress will compensate the owners . " You have spoken of a decree to protect the licenses under these patents , " said Judge Morris . " Would that prayer go so far as to warrant a decree of this character , namely , that in the event that this or some Appellate Court should determine that the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the purpose of ascertaining your views , assuming the proper price was $1,000,000 or 55.900,000 , that the decree should be such that the Chemical Foundation might be directed to pay that sum into the Treasury of the United States within a specified time or surrender the patents ? ' I answer no. " without the slightest hesitation . " Colonel Anderson replied . " Tour Honor 's power in this matter is either to affirm or set aside the sale . It Is either good or bad . You can not make a new sale . There is no power in the Court to make a new sale . " Ittany Doctunents Presented . More than 150 documents were introduced by the Government in its effort to establish a high value for the 4,800 seized German patents which the custodian sold the Foundation for $250,000 , and later in the day Colonel Anderson recorded trills of complaint in sixty-one suits tiled by the Foundation against chemical and dye companies operating under patent licenses issued by the Federal Trade Commission . These were offered to help prove the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a money-making organization rather than solely altruistic . Charles R. F'arrnele , a New York chemist , was recalled by the Government to tell about the seizure of his patent for chinosof and its sale to the Chemical Foundation , which demanded a royalty from him for its use . He did not pay , and eventually the patent was returned to him . When Parmele declined to make known his profits from the chinosol patent . thus making it impossible to verify his $100,000 estimate of its value , the Court . turning to Government counsel , remarked. ; " I do not see how I can pay much attention to this testimony , "
