SCENE .  --  A bedroom . A small room containing an " installment plan " bed , dresser , and chairs . An ugly electric light fixture over the bed with a single glaring naked lamp . One small window with the shade drawn . The walls are papered with sheets of foolscap covered with columns of figures . MR . ZERO is lying in the bed , facing the audience , his head and shoulders visible . He is thin , sallow , undersized , and partially bald . MRS . ZERO is standing before the dresser arranging her hair for the night . She is forty-five , sharp-featured , gray streaks in her hair . She is shapeless in her long-sleeved cotton night- gown . She is wearing her shoes , over which sag her ungartered stockings . MRS . ZERO as she takes down her hair. I 'm gettin ' sick o ' them Westerns .

" " You 're right , Mrs. Twelve , " I says . " That 's what I like , too . " They 're showin ' too many Westerns at the Rosebud . I 'm gettin ' sick of them . I think we 'll start goin ' to the Peter Stuyvesant . They got a good bill there Wednesday night . There 's a Chubby Delano comedy called " Sea- Sick . " Mrs. Twelve was tellin ' me about it . She says it 's a scream . They 're havin ' a picnic in the country and they sit Chubby next to an old maid with a great big mouth .

Mrs. Twelve was tellin ' me she laughed so she nearly passed out . He sure can pull some funny ones . An ' they got that big Grace Darling feature , " A Mother 's Tears . " She 's sweet . But I do n't like her clothes . There 's no style to them . Mrs. Nine was tellin ' me she read in Pictureland that she ai n't livin ' with her husband . He 's her second , too . I do n't know whether they 're divorced or just separated . You would n't think it to see her on the screen . She looks so sweet and innocent . Maybe it ai n't true . You ca n't believe all you read . They say some Pittsburgh millionaire is crazy about her and that 's why she ai n't livin ' with her husband . Mrs. Seven was tellin ' me her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Grace Darling . He says her name ai n't Grace Darling at all . Her right name is Elizabeth Dugan , he says , an ' all them stories about her gettin ' five thousand a week is the bunk , he says . She 's sweet , though . Mrs. Eight was tellin ' me that " A Mother 's Tears " is the best picture she ever made . " Do n't miss it , Mrs. Zero , " she says . " It 's sweet , " she says . " Just sweet and wholesome . Cry ! " she says , " I nearly cried my eyes out . " There 's one part in it where this big bum of an Englishman  --  he 's a married man , too  --  an ' she 's this little simple country girl . An ' she nearly falls for him , too . But she 's sittin ' out in the garden , one day , and she looks up and there 's her mother lookin ' at her , right out of the clouds . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' sure enough , when everybody 's in bed , along comes this big bum of an Englishman an ' when she wo n't let him in what does he do but go an ' kick open the door . " Do n't miss it , Mrs. Zero , " Mrs. Eight was tellin ' me . It 's at the Peter Stuyvesant Wednesday night , so do n't be tellin ' me you want to go to the Rosebud . The Eights seen it downtown at the Strand . They go downtown all the time . Just like us  --  nit ! I guess by the time it gets to the Peter Stuyvesant all that part about kickin ' in the door will be cut out . Just like they cut out that big cabaret scene in " The Price of Virtue . " They sure are pullin ' some rough stuff in the pictures nowadays . " It 's no place for a young girl , " I was tellin ' Mrs. Eleven , only the other day . An ' by the time they get uptown half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go downtown  --  not if wild horses was to drag you . You can wait till they come uptown ! Well , I do n't want to wait , see ? I want to see ' em when everybody else is seein ' them an ' not a month later . Now do n't go tellin ' me you ai n't got the price . You could dig up the price all right , all right , if you wanted to . I notice you always got the price to go to the ball game . But when it comes to me havin ' a good time then it 's always : " I ai n't got the price , I got ta start savin ' . " A fat lot you 'll ever save ! I got all I can do now makin ' both ends meet an ' you talkin ' about savin ' .

Where do you get that tired stuff , anyhow ? What about me ? Where do I come in ? Scrubbin ' floors an ' cookin ' your meals an ' washin ' your dirty clothes .

You ai n't much to be proud of . She rises , goes to the window , and raises the shade . A few lighted windows are visible on the other side of the closed court . Looking out for a momentShe ai n't walkin ' around to- night , you can bet your sweet life on that . An ' she wo n't be walkin ' around any more nights , neither . Not in this house , anyhow .

If I was the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . She approaches the bed and stands there a moment I guess you 're sorry she 's gone . I guess you 'd like to sit home every night an ' watch her goin's-on . You 're somethin ' to be proud of , you are ! She stands on the bed and turns out the light . A thin stream of moonlight filters in from the court . The two figures are dimly visible . MRS . ZERO gets into bedYou 'd better not start nothin ' with women , if you know what 's good for you . I 've put up with a lot , but I wo n't put up with that . I 've been slavin ' away for twenty-five years , makin ' a home for you an ' nothin ' to show for it .

With great agility they get off their stools , remove their eye shades and sleeve protectors and put them on the desk . Then each produces from behind the desk a hat  --  ZERO , a dusty derby , DAISY , a frowsy straw . DAISY puts on her hat and turns toward ZERO as though she were about to speak to him .

New Year 's Eve , Election Night , Armistice Day , and the Mardi-Gras . The noise is deafening , maddening , unendurable . Suddenly it culminates in a terrific peal of thunder . For an instant there is a flash of red and then everything is plunged into blackness@@ SCENE .  --  The ZERO dining room . Entrance door at right . Doors to kitchen and bedroom at left .

You 'll be holdin ' down the same job at the end of another twenty-five years  --  if you ai n't forgot how to add by that time .

Three bare white walls without door or windows except for a single door in the right wall . At the right is a jury-box in which are seated MESSRS .

Behind the books ZERO is seated , his face buried in his hands . There is no other furniture in the room . A moment after the rise of the curtain , one of the officers rises and going around the table , taps ZERO on the shoulder . ZERO rises and accompanies the OFFICER . The OFFICER escorts him to the great empty space in the middle of the court room , facing the jury . He motions to ZERO to stop , then points to the jury and resumes his place beside the jury-box . ZERO stands there looking at the jury , bewildered and half afraid . The JURORS give no sign of having seen him . Throughout they sit with folded arms , staring stolidly before them . MR .

I been on the jury , too . Them lawyers ! Do n't let ' em fill you full of bunk . All that bull about it bein ' red ink on the bill-file . Red ink nothin ' ! It was blood , see ?

Sure I killed him . Why did n't he shut up ? If he 'd only shut up ! Instead o ' talkin ' an ' talkin ' about how sorry he was an ' what a good guy I was an ' this an ' that . I felt like sayin ' to him : " For Christ 's sake , shut up ! " But I did n't have the nerve , see ? I did n't have the nerve to say that to the boss . An ' he went on talkin ' , sayin ' how sorry he was , see ? He was standin ' right close to me . An ' his coat only had two buttons on it . Two an ' two makes four an '  --  aw , can it ! An ' there was the bill-file on the desk . Right where I could touch it . It ai n't right to kill a guy . I know that . When I read all about him in the paper an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tell you . They had the kids ' pictures in the paper , right next to mine . An ' his wife , too . Gee , it must be swell to have a wife like that . Some guys sure is lucky . An ' he left fifty thousand dollars just for a rest-room for the girls in the store . He was a good guy , at that . Fifty thousand . That 's more'n twice as much as I 'd have if I saved every nickel I ever made . Let 's see . Twenty-five an ' twenty-five an ' twenty-five an '  --  aw , cut it out ! An ' the ads had a big , black border around ' em ; an ' all it said was that the store would be closed for three days on account of the boss bein ' dead . That nearly handed me a laugh , that did .

But I thought he was goin ' to give me a raise , see ? On account of bein ' there twenty-five years . He never talked to me before , see ? Except one mornin ' we happened to come in the store together and I held the door open for him and he said " Thanks . " Just like that , see ? " Thanks ! " That was the only time he ever talked to me . An ' when I seen him comin ' up to my desk , I did n't know where I got off . A big guy like that comin ' up to my desk . I felt like I was chokin ' like and all of a sudden I got a kind o ' bad taste in my mouth like when you get up in the mornin ' . I did n't have no right to kill him . The district attorney is right about that . He read the law to you , right out o ' the book . Killin ' a bird  --  that 's wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave her . It was a dirty trick tellin ' the cops on her like that . I should n't ' a ' done that . But what was I gon na do ? The wife would n't let up on me . I hadda do it . She used to walk around the room , just in her undershirt , see ? Nothin ' else on . Just her undershirt . An ' they gave her six months . That 's the last I 'll ever see of her . Them birds  --  how do they get away with it ? Just grabbin ' women , the way you see ' em do in the pictures . I 've seen lots I 'd like to grab like that , but I ai n't got the nerve  --  in the subway an ' on the street an ' in the store buyin ' things .

I never said I did n't kill him . But that ai n't the same as bein ' a regular murderer . What good did it do me to kill him ? I did n't make nothin ' out of it . Answer yes or no ! Yes or no , me elbow ! There 's some things you ca n't answer yes or no . Give me the once-over , you guys . Do I look like a murderer ? Do I ? I never did no harm to nobody . Ask the wife . She 'll tell you . Ask anybody . I never got into trouble . You would n't count that one time at the Polo Grounds . That was just fun like . Everybody was yellin ' , " Kill the empire !

An ' that time in the subway . I was readin ' about a lynchin ' , see ? Down in Georgia . They took the nigger an ' they tied him to a tree . An ' they poured kerosene on him and lit a big fire under him . The dirty nigger ! Boy , I 'd of liked to been there , with a gat in each hand , pumpin ' him full of lead . I was readin ' about it in the subway , see ? Right at Times Square where the big crowd gets on . An ' all of a sudden this big nigger steps right on my foot .

But he kept talkin ' an ' talkin ' . An ' there was the bill-file right where I could reach it . Do you get me ? I 'm just a regular guy like anybody else . Like you birds , now .

He goes on haranguing the empty jury-box as the curtain falls@@ SCENE .  --  A grave-yard in full moonlight . It is a second-rate grave-yard  --  no elaborate tombstones or monuments  --  just simple headstones and here and there a cross . At the back is an iron fence with a gate in the middle . At first no one is visible , but there are occasional sounds throughout : the hooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the croaking of a bull-frog , and the yowling of a serenading cat . After a few moments two figures appear outside the gate  --  a man and a woman . She pushes the gate and it opens with a rusty creak . The couple enter .

But how could I be dreamin ' when I ai n't been asleep ? He looks about againWell , no use goin ' back . I ca n't sleep , anyhow . I might as well walk around a little . He rises out of the ground , very rigidly . He wears a full-dress suit of very antiquated cut and his hands are folded stiffly across his breast . Walking woodenlyGee ! I 'm stiff ! He slowly walks a few steps , then stopsGee , it 's lonesome here ! He shivers and walks on aimlesslyI should ' a ' stayed where I was . But I thought I heard her laughin ' . A loud sneeze is heard . ZERO stands motionless , quaking with terror . The sneeze is repeated . HoarselyWhat 's that ? p. 33 A MILD VOICE It 's all right . Nothing to be afraid of . From behind a headstone SHRDLU appears .

Suppose we keep each other company , shall we ? MR . ZERO eagerly.Yeh , that would be great . I been feelin ' awful lonesome . SHRDLU nodding.I know . Let 's make ourselves comfortable . He seats himself easily on a grave . ZERO tries to follow his example but he is stiff in every joint and groans with pain MR . ZERO I 'm kinda stiff . SHRDLU You must n't mind the stiffness . It wears off in a few days . He seats himself on the grave beside ZERO and produces a package of cigarettesWill you have a Camel ? p. 34 MR . ZERO No , I do n't smoke .

HesitantlyI 'm scared if I tell you who I am and what I done , you 'll be off me . SHRDLU sadly.No matter what your sins may be , they are as snow compared to mine . MR . ZERO You got another guess comin ' . He pauses dramaticallyMy name 's Zero . I 'm a murderer . SHRDLU nodding calmly.Oh , yes , I remember reading about you , Mr. Zero . MR . ZERO a little piqued.And you still think you 're worse than me ? p. 35 SHRDLU throwing away his cigarette.Oh , a thousand times worse , Mr. Zero  --  a million times worse . MR . ZERO What did you do ? SHRDLU I , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amazement.Go on ! You 're kiddin ' me ! SHRDLU Every word I speak is the truth , Mr. Zero . I am the foulest , the most sinful of murderers ! You only murdered your employer , Mr. Zero . But I  --  I murdered my mother . He covers his face with his hands and sobs MR .

He wipes his eyes , still quivering with emotion MR . ZERO I remember readin ' about you in the papers . SHRDLU Yes , my guilt has been proclaimed to all the world . But that would be a trifle if only I could wash the stain of sin from my soul . p. 36 MR . ZERO I never heard of a guy killin ' his mother before . What did you do it for ? SHRDLU Because I have a sinful heart  --  there is no other reason . MR . ZERO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SHRDLU She was a saint  --  a saint , I tell you . She cared for me and watched over me as only a mother can . MR . ZERO You mean to say you did n't have a scrap or nothin ' ? SHRDLU Never a harsh or an unkind word . Nothing except loving care and good advice . From my infancy she devoted herself to guiding me on the right path . She taught me to be thrifty , to be devout , to be unselfish , to shun evil companions and to shut my ears to all the temptations of the flesh  --  in short , to become a virtuous , respectable , and God-fearing man . He groansBut it was a hopeless task . At fourteen I began to show evidence of my sinful nature . MR . ZERO breathlessly.You did n't kill anybody else , did you ? SHRDLU No , thank God , there is only one murder on my soul . But I ran away from home . MR . ZERO You did ! SHRDLU Yes . A companion lent me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , I 'm thankful to say . It was called " Treasure Island . " Have you ever read it ? p. 37 MR . ZERO No , I never was much on readin ' books . SHRDLU It is a wicked book  --  a lurid tale of adventure . But it kindled in my sinful heart a desire to go to sea . And so I ran away from home . MR . ZERO What did you do  --  get a job as a sailor ? SHRDLU I never saw the sea  --  not to the day of my death . Luckily , my mother 's loving intuition warned her of my intention and I was sent back home . She welcomed me with open arms . Not an angry word , not a look of reproach . But I could read the mute suffering in her eyes as we prayed together all through the night . MR . ZERO sympathetically.Gee , that must ' a ' been tough .

SHRDLU By the time I was twenty I had a good job reading proof for a firm that printed catalogues . After a year they promoted me and let me specialize in shoe catalogues . MR . ZERO Yeh ?

It was an honest and moral mode of life . MR . ZERO It sure was . SHRDLU Then came that fatal Sunday . Dr. Amaranth , our minister , was having dinner with us  --  one of the few pure spirits on earth . When he had finished saying grace , we had our soup . Everything was going along as usual  --  we were eating our soup and discussing the sermon , just like every other Sunday I could remember . Then came the leg of lamb  --  He breaks off , then resumes in a choking voice I see the whole scene before me so plainly  --  it never leaves me  --  Dr. Amaranth at my right , my mother at my left , the leg of lamb on the table in front of me and the cuckoo clock on the little shelf between the windows . He stops and wipes his eyes p. 39 MR . ZERO Yeh , but what happened ? SHRDLU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you ever carve a leg of lamb ? MR . ZERO No , corned beef was our speed . SHRDLU It 's very difficult on account of the bone . And when there 's gravy in the dish there 's danger of spilling it . So Mother always used to hold the dish for me . She leaned forward , just as she always did , and I could see the gold locket around her neck . It had my picture in it and one of my baby curls . Well , I raised my knife to carve the leg of lamb  --  and instead I cut my mother 's throat ! He sobs MR . ZERO You must ' a ' been crazy ! SHRDLU raising his head , vehemently.No ! Do n't try to justify me , I was n't crazy . They tried to prove at the trial that I was crazy . But Dr. Amaranth saw the truth ! He saw it from the first ! He knew that it was my sinful nature  --  and he told me what was in store for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are over now . SHRDLU his voice rising.Over ! Do you think this is the end ? p. 40 MR . ZERO Sure . What more can they do to us ? SHRDLU his tones growing shriller and shriller.Do you think there can ever be any peace for such as we are  --  murderers , sinners ? Do n't you know what awaits us  --  flames , eternal flames ! MR . ZERO nervously.Keep your shirt on , Buddy  --  they would n't do that to us . SHRDLU There 's no escape  --  no escape for us , I tell you . We 're doomed ! We 're doomed to suffer unspeakable torments through all eternity . His voice rises higher and higher . A grave opens suddenly and a head appears A HEAD Hey , you birds ! Ca n't you shut up and let a guy sleep ? ZERO scrambles painfully to his feet MR . ZERO to SHRDLU.Hey , put on the soft pedal . SHRDLU too wrought up to attend.It wo n't be long now ! We 'll receive our summons soon . A HEAD Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls into the graveHey , Bill , lend me your head a minute . A moment later his arm appears holding a skull p. 41 MR . ZERO warningly.Look out ! He seizes SHRDLU and drags him away just as THE HEAD throws the skull A HEAD disgustedly.Missed ' em . Damn old tabby cats ! I 'll get ' em next time . A prodigious yawnHohum ! Me for the worms ! THE HEAD disappears as the curtain falls@@ SCENE .  --  A pleasant place . A scene of pastoral loveliness . A meadow dotted with fine old trees and carpeted with rich grass and field flowers . In the background are seen a number of tents fashioned of gay-striped silks and beyond gleams a meandering river . Clear air and a fleckless sky . Sweet distant music throughout . At the rise of the curtain , SHRDLU is seen , seated under a tree in the foreground in an attitude of deep dejection . His knees are drawn up and his head is buried in his arms . He is dressed as in the preceding scene . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and looks about him with an air of half-suspicious curiosity . He , too , is dressed as in the preceding scene . Suddenly he sees SHRDLU seated under the tree . He stands still and looks at him half fearfully . Then , seeing something familiar in him , goes closer . SHRDLU is unaware of his presence . At last ZERO recognizes him and grins in pleased surprise MR . ZERO Well , if it ai n't  --  ! He claps SHRDLU on the shoulderHello , Buddy ! SHRDLU looks up slowly , then recognizing ZERO , he rises gravely and extends his hand courteously SHRDLU How do you do , Mr. Zero ? I 'm very glad to see you again . p. 43 MR . ZERO Same here . I was n't expectin ' to see you , either . Looking aboutThis is a kinda nice place . I would n't mind restin ' here a while . SHRDLU You may if you wish . MR . ZERO I 'm kinda tired . I ai n't used to bein ' outdoors . I ai n't walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the tree . MR . ZERO Do they let you sit on the grass ? SHRDLU Oh , yes . MR . ZERO seating himself.Boy , this feels good . I 'll tell the world my feet are sore . I ai n't used to so much walkin ' . Say , I wonder would it be all right if I took my shoes off ; my feet are tired . SHRDLU Yes . Some of the people here go barefoot . MR . ZERO Yeh ? They sure must be nuts . But I 'm goin ' t ' leave ' em off for a while . So long as it 's all right . The grass feels nice and cool . He stretches out comfortablySay , this is the life of Riley all right , all right . This sure is a nice place . What do they call this place , anyhow ? SHRDLU The Elysian Fields . MR . ZERO The which ? p. 44 SHRDLU The Elysian Fields . MR . ZERO dubiously.Oh ! Well , it 's a nice place , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all places . Only the most favoured remain here . MR . ZERO Yeh ? Well , that let 's me out , I guess . SuddenlyBut what are you doin ' here ? I thought you 'd be burned by now . SHRDLU sadly.Mr . Zero , I am the most unhappy of men . MR . ZERO in mild astonishment.Why , because you ai n't bein ' roasted alive ? SHRDLU nodding.Nothing is turning out as I expected . I saw everything so clearly  --  the flames , the tortures , an eternity of suffering as the just punishment for my unspeakable crime . And it has all turned out so differently . MR . ZERO . Well , that 's pretty soft for you , ai n't it ? SHRDLU wailing.No , no , no ! It 's right and just that I should be punished . I could have endured it stoically . All through those endless ages of indescribable torment I should have exulted in the magnificence of divine justice . But this  --  this is maddening ! What becomes of justice ? What becomes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's maddening  --  simply maddening ! Oh , if Dr. Amaranth were only here to advise me ! He buries his face and groans. p. 45 MR . ZERO trying to puzzle it out.You mean to say they ai n't called you for cuttin ' your mother 's throat ? SHRDLU No ! It 's terrible  --  terrible ! I was prepared for anything  --  anything but this . MR . ZERO Well , what did they say to you ? SHRDLU looking up.Only that I was to come here and remain until I understood . MR . ZERO I do n't get it . What do they want you to understand ? SHRDLU despairingly.I do n't know  --  I do n't know ! If I only had an inkling of what they meant  --  Interrupting himJust listen quietly for a moment ; do you hear anything ? They are both silent , straining their ears MR . ZERO at length.Nope . SHRDLU You do n't hear any music ? Do you ? MR . ZERO Music ? No , I do n't hear nothin ' . SHRDLU The people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're kiddin ' you . SHRDLU Do you think so ? p. 46 MR . ZERO Sure thing . There ai n't a sound . SHRDLU Perhaps . They 're capable of anything . But I have n't told you of the bitterest of my disappointments . MR . ZERO Well , spill it . I 'm gettin ' used to hearin ' bad news . SHRDLU When I came to this place , my first thought was to find my dear mother . I wanted to ask her forgiveness . And I wanted her to help me to understand . MR . ZERO An ' she could n't do it ? SHRDLU with a deep groan.She 's not here ! Mr. Zero ! Here where only the most favoured dwell , that wisest and purest of spirits is nowhere to be found . I do n't understand it . A WOMAN 'S VOICE in the distance.Mr . Zero ! Oh , Mr. Zero ! ZERO raises his head and listens attentively SHRDLU going on , unheedingly.If you were to see some of the people here  --  the things they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I think somebody 's callin ' me . THE VOICE somewhat nearer.Mr . Ze-ro ! Oh ! Mr. Ze-ro ! p. 47 MR . ZERO Who the hell 's that now ? I wonder if the wife 's on my trail already . That would be swell , would n't it ? An ' I figured on her bein ' good for another twenty years , anyhow . THE VOICE nearer.Mr . Ze-ro ! Yoo-hoo ! MR . ZERO No . That ai n't her voice . Calling , savagelyYoo-hoo . To SHRDLUAi n't that always the way ? Just when a guy is takin ' life easy an ' havin ' a good time ! He rises and looks off leftHere she comes , whoever she is . In sudden amazementWell , I 'll be  --  ! Well , what do you know about that ! He stands looking in wonderment , as DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE enters . She wears a much-beruffled white muslin dress which is a size too small and fifteen years too youthful for her . She is red-faced and breathless DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . I 've been followin ' you for days  --  callin ' an ' callin ' . Did n't you hear me ? MR . ZERO Not till just now . You look kinda winded . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I sure am . I ca n't hardly catch my breath . p. 48 MR . ZERO Well , sit down an ' take a load off your feet . He leads her to the tree . DAISY sees SHRDLU for the first time and shrinks back a littleIt 's all right , he 's a friend of mine . To SHRDLUBuddy , I want you to meet my friend , Miss Devore . SHRDLU rising and extending his hand courteously.How do you do , Miss Devore ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE self-consciously.How do ! MR . ZERO to DAISY.He 's a friend of mine . To SHRDLUI guess you do n't mind if she sits here a while an ' cools off , do you ? SHRDLU No , no , certainly not . They all seat themselves under the tree . ZERO and DAISY are a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . ZERO I was just takin ' a rest myself . I took my shoes off on account of my feet bein ' so sore . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Yeh , I 'm kinda tired , too . Looking aboutSay , ai n't it pretty here , though ? MR .

To DAISYHe do n't hear me . He 's thinkin ' again . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE sotto voce.What 's the matter with him ? MR . ZERO Why , he 's the guy that murdered his mother  --  remember ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE interested.Oh , yeh ! Is that him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all figgered out how they was goin ' t ' roast him or somethin ' . And now they ai n't goin ' to do nothin ' to him an ' it 's kinda got his goat . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE sympathetically.Poor feller ! MR . ZERO Yeh . He takes it kinda hard . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE He looks like a nice young feller . MR . ZERO Well , you sure are good for sore eyes . I never expected to see you here . p. 50 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I thought maybe you 'd be kinda surprised . MR . ZERO Surprised is right . I thought you was alive an ' kickin ' . When did you pass out ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Oh , right after you did  --  a coupla days . MR . ZERO interested.Yeh ? What happened ? Get hit by a truck or somethin ' ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE No . HesitantlyYou see  --  it 's this way . I blew out the gas . MR . ZERO astonished.Go on ! What was the big idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . You see , I lost my job . MR . ZERO I 'll bet you 're sorry you did it now , ai n't you ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE with conviction.No , I ai n't sorry . Not a bit . Then hesitantlySay , Mr. Zero , I been thinkin '  --  She stops MR . ZERO What ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE plucking up courage.I been thinkin ' it would be kinda nice  --  if you an ' me  --  if we could kinda talk things over . p. 51 MR . ZERO Yeh . Sure . What do you want to talk about ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Well  --  I do n't know  --  but you and me  --  we ai n't really ever talked things over , have we ? MR . ZERO No , that 's right , we ai n't . Well , let 's go to it . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I was thinkin ' if we could be alone  --  just the two of us , see ? MR . ZERO Oh , yeh ! Yeh , I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHRDLU does not stir MR . ZERO to DAISY.He 's dead to the world . He turns to SHRDLUSay , Buddy ! No answerSay , Buddy ! SHRDLU looking up with a start.Were you speaking to me ? MR . ZERO Yeh . How 'd you guess it ? I was thinkin ' that maybe you 'd like to walk around a little and look for your mother . SHRDLU shaking his head.It 's no use . I 've looked everywhere . He relapses into thought again MR . ZERO Maybe over there they might know . p. 52 SHRDLU No , no ! I 've searched everywhere . She 's not here . ZERO and DAISY look at each other in despair MR . ZERO Listen , old shirt , my friend here and me  --  see ?  --  we used to work in the same store . An ' we got some things to talk over  --  business , see ?  --  kinda confidential . So if it ai n't askin ' too much  --  SHRDLU springing to his feet.Why , certainly ! Excuse me ! He bows politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him until he has disappeared MR . ZERO with a forced laugh.He 's a good guy at that . Now that they are alone , both are very self-conscious , and for a time they sit in silence DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE breaking the silence.It sure is pretty here , ai n't it ? MR . ZERO Sure is . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Look at the flowers ! Ai n't they just perfect ! Why , you 'd think they was artificial , would n't you ? MR . ZERO Yeh , you would . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE And the smell of them . Like perfume . p. 53 MR . ZERO Yeh . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I 'm crazy about the country , ai n't you ? MR . ZERO Yeh . It 's nice for a change . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Them store picnics  --  remember ? MR . ZERO You bet . They sure was fun . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE One time  --  I guess you do n't remember  --  the two of us  --  me and you  --  we sat down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doin ' now . MR . ZERO Sure I remember . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Go on ! I 'll bet you do n't . MR . ZERO I 'll bet I do . It was the year the wife did n't go . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE her face brightening.That 's right ! I did n't think you 'd remember . MR . ZERO An ' comin ' home we sat together in the truck . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE eagerly , rather shamefacedly.Yeh ! There 's somethin ' I 've always wanted to ask , you . MR . ZERO Well , why did n't you ? p. 54 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I do n't know . It did n't seem refined . But I 'm goin ' to ask you now , anyhow . MR . ZERO Go ahead . Shoot . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE falteringly.Well  --  while we was comin ' home  --  you put your arm up on the bench behind me  --  and I could feel your knee kinda pressin ' against mine . She stops MR . ZERO becoming more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE What I wanted to ask you was  --  was it just kinda accidental ? MR . ZERO with a laugh.Sure it was accidental . Accidental on purpose . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE eagerly.Do you mean it ? MR . ZERO Sure I mean it . You mean to say you did n't know it ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE No . I 've been wantin ' to ask you  --  MR . ZERO Then why did you get sore at me ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Sore ? I was n't sore ! When was I sore ? p. 55 MR . ZERO That night . Sure you was sore . If you was n't sore why did you move away ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Just to see if you meant it . I thought if you meant it you 'd move up closer . An ' then when you took your arm away I was sure you did n't mean it . MR . ZERO An ' I thought all the time you was sore That 's why I took my arm away . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be in a jam , like you read in the paper all the time about guys gettin ' pulled in for annoyin ' women . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE An ' I was wishin ' you 'd put your arm around me  --  just sittin ' there wishin ' all the way home . MR . ZERO What do you know about that ? That sure is hard luck , that is . If I 'd ' a ' only knew ! You know what I felt like doin '  --  only I did n't have the nerve ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE What ? MR . ZERO I felt like kissin ' you . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE fervently.I wanted you to . MR . ZERO astonished.You would ' a ' let me ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I wanted you to ! I wanted you to ! Oh , why did n't you  --  why did n't you ? p. 56 MR . ZERO I did n't have the nerve . I sure was a dumb-bell . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I would ' a ' let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cared . I know it would ' a ' been wrong but I would n't ' a ' cared . I was n't thinkin ' about right an ' wrong at all . I did n't care  --  see ? I just wanted you to kiss me . MR . ZERO feelingly.If I 'd only knew . I wanted to do it , I swear I did . But I did n't think you cared nothin ' about me . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE passionately.I never cared nothin ' about nobody else . MR . ZERO Do you mean it  --  on the level ? You ai n't kiddin ' me , are you ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE No , I ai n't kiddin ' . I mean it . I 'm tellin ' you the truth . I ai n't never had the nerve to tell you before  --  but now I do n't care . It do n't make no difference now . I mean it  --  every word of it . MR . ZERO dejectedly.If I 'd only knew it . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you . I may as well tell you everything now . It do n't make no difference now . About my blowin ' out the gas  --  see ? Do you know why I done it ? p. 57 MR . ZERO Yeh , you told me  --  on account o ' bein ' canned . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I just told you that . That ai n't the real reason . The real reason is on account o ' you . MR . ZERO You mean to say on account o ' me passin ' out  --  ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Yeh . That 's it . I did n't want to go on livin ' . What for ? What did I want to go on livin ' for ? I did n't have nothin ' to live for with you gone . I often thought of doin ' it before . But I never had the nerve . An ' anyhow I did n't want to leave you . MR . ZERO An ' me bawlin ' you out , about readin ' too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOROTHEA DEVORE reproachfully.Why did you do it ? MR . ZERO I do n't know , I swear I do n't . I was always stuck on you . An ' while I 'd be addin ' them figgers , I 'd be thinkin ' how if the wife died , you an ' me could get married . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I used to think o ' that , too . MR . ZERO An ' then before I knew it , I was bawlin ' you out . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Them was the times I 'd think o ' blowin ' out the gas . But I never did till you was gone . There was n't nothin ' to live for then . But it was n't so easy to do , anyhow . I never could stand the smell o ' gas . An all the while I was gettin ' ready , you know , stuffin ' up all the cracks , the way you read about in the paper  --  I was thinkin ' of you and hopin ' that maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind if I ever did see you , I 'd tell you . p. 58 MR . ZERO taking her hand. I 'm sure glad you did . I 'm sure glad . RuefullyBut it do n't do much good now , does it ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE No , I guess it do n't . Summoning courageBut there 's one thing I 'm goin ' to ask you . MR . ZERO What 's that ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE in a low voice. I want you to kiss me . MR . ZERO You bet I will ! He leans over and kisses her cheek DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Not like that . I do n't mean like that . I mean really kiss me . On the mouth . I ai n't never been kissed like that . ZERO puts his arms about her and presses his lips to hers . A long embrace . At last they separate and sit side by side in silence DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE putting her hands to her cheeks.So that 's what it 's like . I did n't know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' could be like that . MR . ZERO fondling her hand.Your cheeks are red . They 're all red . And your eyes are shinin ' . I never seen your eyes shinin ' like that before . p. 59 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE holding up her hand.Listen  --  do you hear it ? Do you hear the music ? MR . ZERO No , I do n't hear nothin ' ! DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Yeh  --  music . Listen an ' you 'll hear it . They are both silent for a moment MR . ZERO excitedly.Yeh ! I hear it ! He said there was music , but I did n't hear it till just now . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Ai n't it grand ? MR . ZERO Swell ! Say , do you know what ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE What ? MR . ZERO It makes me feel like dancin ' . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Yeh ? Me , too . MR . ZERO springing to his feet.Come on ! Let 's dance ! He seizes her hands and tries to pull her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ai n't danced in twenty years . MR . ZERO That 's nothin ' . I ai n't , neither . Come on ! I feel just like a kid ! He pulls her to her feet and seizes her about the waist p. 60 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Wait a minute ! Wait till I fix my skirt . She turns back her skirts and pins them above the ankles . ZERO seizes her about the waist . They dance clumsily but with gay abandon . DAISY 'S hair becomes loosened and tumbles over her shoulders . She lends herself more and more to the spirit of the dance . But ZERO soon begins to tire and dances with less and less zest MR . ZERO stopping at last , panting for breath.Wait a minute ! I 'm all winded . He releases DAISY , but before he can turn away , she throws her arms about him and presses her lips to his MR . ZERO freeing himself.Wait a minute ! Let me get my wind ! He limps to the tree and seats himself under it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spirits rather dampened MR . ZERO Whew ! I sure am winded ! I ai n't used to dancin ' . He takes off his collar and tie and opens the neckband of his shirt . DAISY sits under the tree near him , looking at him longingly . But he is busy catching his breathGee , my heart 's goin ' a mile a minute . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Why do n't you lay down an ' rest ? You could put your head on my lap . p. 61 MR . ZERO That ai n't a bad idea . He stretches out , his head in DAISY 'S lap DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE fondling his hair.It was swell , was n't it ? MR . ZERO Yeh . But you got ta be used to it . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Just imagine if we could stay here all the time  --  you an ' me together  --  would n't it be swell ? MR . ZERO Yeh . But there ai n't a chance .

You know it ai n't right . Ai n't I got a wife ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Not any more you ai n't . When you 're dead that ends it . Do n't they always say " until death do us part ? " p. 62 MR . ZERO Well , maybe you 're right about that but they would n't stand for us here . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE It would be swell  --  the two of us together  --  we could make up for all them years . MR . ZERO Yeh , I wish we could . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE We sure were fools . But I do n't care . I 've got you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ZERO I 'm sure crazy about you .

I sure am crazy about you . Suddenly he sits uprightWatch your step ! p. 63 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE alarmed.What 's the matter ? MR . ZERO nervously.He 's comin ' back . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Oh , is that all ? Well , what about it ? MR . ZERO You do n't want him to see us layin ' around like this , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he does . MR . ZERO Well , you ought a care . You do n't want him to think you ai n't a refined girl , do you ? He 's an awful moral bird , he is . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE I do n't care nothin ' about him . I do n't care nothin ' about anybody but you . MR . ZERO Sure , I know . But we do n't want people talkin ' about us . You better fix your hair an ' pull down your skirts . DAISY complies rather sadly . They are both silent as SHRDLU enters MR . ZERO with feigned nonchalance.Well , you got back all right , did n't you ? SHRDLU I hope I have n't returned too soon . MR . ZERO No , that 's all right . We were just havin ' a little talk . You know  --  about business an ' things . p. 64 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE boldly.We were wishin ' we could stay here all the time . SHRDLU You may if you like . ZERO AND DAISY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may remain  --  MR . ZERO But I thought you were tellin ' me  --  SHRDLU Just as I told you , only the most favored do remain . But any one may . MR . ZERO I do n't get it . There 's a catch in it somewheres . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE It do n't matter as long as we can stay . MR . ZERO to SHRDLU.We were thinkin ' about gettin ' married , see ? SHRDLU You may or not , just as you like . MR . ZERO You do n't mean to say we could stay if we did n't , do you ? SHRDLU Yes . They do n't care . MR . ZERO An ' there 's some here that ai n't married ? SHRDLU Yes . MR . ZERO to DAISY.I do n't know about this place , at that . They must be kind of a mixed crowd . p. 65 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE It do n't matter , so long as we got each other . MR . ZERO Yeh , I know , but you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE to SHRDLU.Can we get married right away ? I guess there must be a lot of ministers here , ai n't there ? SHRDLU Not as many as I had hoped to find . The two who seem most beloved are Dean Swift and the Abb Rabelais . They are both much admired for some indecent tales which they have written . MR . ZERO shocked.What ! Ministers writin ' smutty stories ! Say , what kind of a dump is this , anyway ? SHRDLU despairingly.I do n't know , Mr. Zero . All these people here are so strange , so unlike the good people I 've known . They seem to think of nothing but enjoyment or of wasting their time in profitless occupations . Some paint pictures from morning until night , or carve blocks of stone . Others write songs or put words together , day in and day out . Still others do nothing but lie under the trees and look at the sky . There are men who spend all their time reading books and women who think only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughing and singing and drinking and dancing . There are drunkards , thieves , vagabonds , blasphemers , adulterers . There is one  --  p. 66 MR . ZERO That 's enough . I heard enough . He seats himself and begins putting on his shoes DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE anxiously.What are you goin ' to do ? MR . ZERO I 'm goin ' to beat it , that 's what I 'm goin ' to do . DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE You said you liked it here . MR . ZERO looking at her in amazement.Liked it ! Say , you do n't mean to say you want to stay here , do you , with a lot of rummies an ' loafers an ' bums ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE We do n't have to bother with them . We can just sit here together an ' look at the flowers an ' listen to the music . SHRDLU eagerly.Music ! Did you hear music ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE Sure . Do n't you hear it ? SHRDLU No , they say it never stops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening.I thought I heard it before but I do n't hear nothin ' now . I guess I must ' a ' been dreamin ' . Looking aboutWhat 's the quickest way out of this place ? p. 67 DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE pleadingly.Wo n't you stay just a little longer ? MR . ZERO Did n't yer hear me say I 'm goin ' ? Good-bye , Miss Devore . I 'm goin ' to beat it . He limps off at the right . DAISY follows him slowly DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE to SHRDLU.I wo n't ever see him again . SHRDLU Are you goin ' to stay here ? DAISY DIANA DOROTHEA DEVORE It do n't make no difference now . Without him I might as well be alive . She goes off right . SHRDLU watches her a moment , then sighs and seating himself under the tree , buries his head on his arm@@ SCENE .  --  Before the curtain rises the clicking of an adding machine is heard . The curtain rises upon an office similar in appearance to that in Scene Two except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen a glimpse of the corridor outside . In the middle of the room ZERO is seated completely absorbed in the operation of an adding machine . He presses the keys and pulls the lever with mechanical precision . He still wears his full-dress suit but he has added to it sleeve protectors and a green eye shade . A strip of white paper-tape flows steadily from the machine as ZERO operates . The room is filled with this tape  --  streamers , festoons , billows of it everywhere . It covers the floor and the furniture , it climbs the walls and chokes the doorways . A few moments later , LIEUTENANT CHARLES and JOE enter at the left . LIEUTENANT CHARLES is middle-aged and inclined to corpulence . He has an air of world-weariness . He is barefooted , wears a Panama hat , and is dressed in bright red tights which are a very bad fit  --  too tight in some places , badly wrinkled in others . JOE is a youth with a smutty face dressed in dirty blue overalls . LIEUTENANT CHARLES after contemplating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing . p. 69 MR . ZERO looking up , surprised.Whaddja say ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES I said stop punching that machine . MR . ZERO bewildered.Stop ? He goes on working mechanically LIEUTENANT CHARLES impatiently.Yes . Ca n't you stop ? Here , Joe , give me a hand . He ca n't stop . JOE and CHARLES each take one of ZERO 'S arms and with enormous effort detach him from the machine . He resists passively  --  mere inertia . Finally they succeed and swing him around on his stool . CHARLES and JOE mop their foreheads MR . ZERO querulously.What 's the idea ? Ca n't you lemme alone ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES ignoring the question.How long have you been here ? MR . ZERO Jes ' twenty-five years . Three hundred months , nine-one hundred and thirty-one days , one hundred thirty-six thousand  --  LIEUTENANT CHARLES impatiently.That 'll do ! That 'll do ! MR . ZERO proudly.I ai n't missed a day , not an hour , not a minute . Look at all I got done . He points to the maze of paper p. 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZERO Quit ? Whaddye mean quit ? I ai n't goin ' to quit ! LIEUTENANT CHARLES You 've got to . MR . ZERO What for ? What do I have to quit for ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES It 's time for you to go back . MR . ZERO Go back where ? Whaddya talkin ' about ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Back to earth , you dub . Where do you think ? MR . ZERO Aw , go on , Cap , who are you kiddin ' ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES I 'm not kidding anybody . And do n't call me Cap . I 'm a lieutenant . MR . ZERO All right , Lieutenant , all right . But what 's this you 're tryin ' to tell me about goin ' back ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Your time 's up , I 'm telling you . You must be pretty thick . How many times do you want to be told a thing ? MR . ZERO This is the first time I heard about goin ' back . Nobody ever said nothin ' to me about it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay here forever , did you ? MR . ZERO Sure . Why not ? I did my bit , did n't I ? Forty-five years of it . Twenty-five years in the store . Then the boss canned me and I knocked him cold . I guess you ai n't heard about that  --  p. 71 LIEUTENANT CHARLES interrupting.I know all about that . But what 's that got to do with it ? MR . ZERO Well , I done my bit , did n't I ? That ought a let me out . LIEUTENANT CHARLES jeeringly.So you think you 're all through , do you ? MR . ZERO Sure , I do . I did the best I could while I was there and then I passed out . And now I 'm sittin ' pretty here . LIEUTENANT CHARLES You 've got a fine idea of the way they run things , you have . Do you think they 're going to all of the trouble of making a soul just to use it once ? MR . ZERO Once is often enough , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does it ? Well , who are you ? And what do you know about it ? Why , man , they use a soul over and over again  --  over and over until it 's worn out . MR . ZERO Nobody ever told me . LIEUTENANT CHARLES So you thought you were all through , did you ? Well , that 's a hot one , that is . MR . ZERO sullenly.How was I to know ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Use your brains ! Where would we put them all ! We 're crowded enough as it is . Why , this place is nothing but a kind of repair and service station  --  a sort of cosmic laundry , you might say . We get the souls in here by the bushelful . Then we get busy and clean them up . And you ought to see some of them . The muck and the slime . Phoo ! And as full of holes as a flour-sifter . But we fix them up . We disinfect them and give them a kerosene rub and mend the holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 72 MR . ZERO You mean to say I 've been here before  --  before the last time , I mean ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Been here before ! Why , you poor boob  --  you 've been here thousands of times  --  fifty thousand , at least . MR . ZERO suspiciously.How is it I do n't remember nothin ' about it ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Well  --  that 's partly because you 're stupid . But it 's mostly because that 's the way they fix it . MusinglyThey 're funny that way  --  every now and then they 'll do something white like that  --  when you 'd least expect it . I guess economy 's at the bottom of it , though . They figure that the souls would get worn out quicker if they remembered . MR . ZERO And do n't any of ' em remember ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Oh , some do . You see there 's different types : there 's the type that gets a little better each time it goes back  --  we just give them a wash and send them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type that gets a little worse each time . That 's where you belong ! MR . ZERO offended.Me ? You mean to say I 'm gettin ' worse all the time ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES nodding. Yes . A little worse each time . p. 73 MR . ZERO Well  --  what was I when I started ? Somethin ' big ?  --  A king or somethin ' ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES laughing derisively.A king ! That 's a good one ! I 'll tell you what you were the first time  --  if you want to know so much  --  a monkey . MR . ZERO shocked and offended.A monkey ! LIEUTENANT CHARLES nodding. Yes , sir  --  just a hairy , chattering , long-tailed monkey . MR . ZERO That musta been a long time ago . LIEUTENANT CHARLES Oh , not so long . A million years or so . Seems like yesterday to me . MR . ZERO Then look here , whaddya mean by sayin ' I 'm gettin ' worse all the time ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Just what I said . You were n't so bad as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other monkeys did , but still it kept you out in the open air . And you were n't women-shy  --  there was one little red-headed monkey  --  Well , never mind . Yes , sir , you were n't so bad then . But even in those days there must have been some bigger and brainier monkey that you kowtowed to . The mark of the slave was on you from the start . p. 74 MR . ZERO sullenly.You ai n't very particular about what you call people , are you ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES You wanted the truth , did n't you ? If there ever was a soul in the world that was labelled slave it 's yours . Why , all the bosses and kings that there ever were have left their trademarks on your backside . MR . ZERO It ai n't fair , if you ask me . LIEUTENANT CHARLES shrugging his shoulders.Do n't tell me about it . I do n't make the rules . All I know is you 've been getting worse  --  worse each time . Why , even six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the time you were hauling stones for one of those big pyramids in a place they call Africa . Ever hear of the pyramids ? MR . ZERO Them big pointy things ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES nodding.That 's it . MR . ZERO I seen a picture of them in the movies . LIEUTENANT CHARLES Well , you helped build them . It was a long step down from the happy days in the jungle , but it was a good job  --  even though you did n't know what you were doing and your back was striped by the foreman 's whip . But you 've been going down , down . Two thousand years ago you were a Roman galley-slave . You were on one of the triremes that knocked the Carthaginian fleet for a goal . Again the whip . But you had muscles then  --  chest muscles , back muscles , biceps . He feels ZERO 'S arm gingerly and turns away in disgustPhoo ! A bunch of mush ! He notices that JOE has fallen asleep . Walking over , he kicks him in the shinWake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ! He turns to ZERO againAnd then another thousand years and you were a serf  --  a lump of clay digging up other lumps of clay . You wore an iron collar then  --  white ones had n't been invented yet . Another long step down . But where you dug , potatoes grew and that helped fatten the pigs . Which was something . And now  --  well , I do n't want to rub it in  --  p. 75 MR . ZERO Rub it in is right ! Seems to me I got a pretty healthy kick comin ' . I ai n't had a square deal ! Hard work ! That 's all I 've ever had ! LIEUTENANT CHARLES callously.What else were you ever good for ? MR . ZERO Well , that ai n't the point . The point is I 'm through ! I had enough ! Let ' em find somebody else to do the dirty work . I 'm sick of bein ' the goat ! I quit right here and now ! He glares about defiantly . There is a thunder-clap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that ? He clings to CHARLES LIEUTENANT CHARLES It 's all right . Nobody 's going to hurt you . It 's just their way of telling you that they do n't like you to talk that way . Pull yourself together and calm down . You ca n't change the rules  --  nobody can  --  they 've got it all fixed . It 's a rotten system  --  but what are you going to do about it ? MR . ZERO Why ca n't they stop pickin ' on me ? I 'm satisfied here  --  doin ' my day 's work . I do n't want to go back . LIEUTENANT CHARLES You 've got to , I tell you . There 's no way out of it . MR . ZERO What chance have I got  --  at my age ? Who 'll give me a job ? p. 76 LIEUTENANT CHARLES You big boob , you do n't think you 're going back the way you are , do you ? MR . ZERO Sure , how then ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Why , you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES nodding.You 'll be a baby again  --  a bald , red-faced little animal , and then you 'll go through it all again . There 'll be millions of others like you  --  all with their mouths open , squalling for food . And then when you get a little older you 'll begin to learn things  --  and you 'll learn all the wrong things and learn them all in the wrong way . You 'll eat the wrong food and wear the wrong clothes and you 'll live in swarming dens where 's there 's no light and no air ! You 'll learn to be a liar and a bully and a braggart and a coward and a sneak . You 'll learn to fear the sunlight and to hate beauty . By that time you 'll be ready for school . There they 'll tell you the truth about a great many things that you do n't give a damn about and they 'll tell you lies about all the things you ought to know  --  and about all the things you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get through you 'll be equipped for your life-work . You 'll be ready to take a job . MR . ZERO eagerly.What 'll my job be ? Another adding machine ? p. 77 LIEUTENANT CHARLES Yes . But not one of these antiquated adding machines . It will be a superb , super-hyper-adding machine , as far from this old piece of junk as you are from God . It will be something to make you sit up and take notice , that adding machine . It will be an adding machine which will be installed in a coal mine and which will record the individual output of each miner . As each miner down in the lower galleries takes up a shovelful of coal , the impact of his shovel will automatically set in motion a graphite pencil in your gallery . The pencil will make a mark in white upon a blackened , sensitized drum . Then your work comes in . With the great toe of your right foot you release a lever which focuses a violet ray on the drum . The ray playing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell which in turn sets the keys of the adding apparatus in motion . In this way the individual output of each miner is recorded without any human effort except the slight pressure of the great toe of your right foot . MR . ZERO in breathless , round-eyed wonder.Say , that 'll be some machine , wo n't it ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Some machine is right . It will be the culmination of human effort  --  the final triumph of the evolutionary process . For millions of years the nebulous gases swirled in space . For more millions of years the gases cooled and then through inconceivable ages they hardened into rocks . And then came life . Floating green things on the waters that covered the earth . More millions of years and a step upward  --  an animate organism in the ancient slime . And so on  --  step by step , down through the ages  --  a gain here , a gain there  --  the mollusc , the fish , the reptile , then mammal , man ! And all so that you might sit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the great toe of your right foot ! p. 78 MR . ZERO Well , then  --  I ai n't so bad , after all . LIEUTENANT CHARLES You 're a failure , Zero , a failure . A waste product . A slave to a contraption of steel and iron . The animal 's instincts , but not his strength and skill . The animal 's appetites , but not his unashamed indulgence of them . True , you move and eat and digest and excrete and reproduce . But any microscopic organism can do as much . Well  --  time 's up ! Back you go  --  back to your sunless groove  --  the raw material of slums and wars  --  the ready prey of the first jingo or demagogue or political adventurer who takes the trouble to play upon your ignorance and credulity and provincialism . You poor , spineless , brainless boob  --  I 'm sorry for you ! MR . ZERO falling to his knees.Then keep me here ! Do n't send me back ! Let me stay ! LIEUTENANT CHARLES Get up . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Come on , time 's up ! MR . ZERO I ca n't ! I ca n't ! I 'm afraid to go through it all again . LIEUTENANT CHARLES You 've got to , I tell you . Come on , now ! MR . ZERO What did you tell me so much for ? Could n't you just let me go , thinkin ' everythin ' was goin ' to be all right ? p. 79 LIEUTENANT CHARLES You wanted to know , did n't you ? MR . ZERO How did I know what you were goin ' to tell me ? Now I ca n't stop thinkin ' about it ! I ca n't stop thinkin ' ! I 'll be thinkin ' about it all the time . LIEUTENANT CHARLES All right ! I 'll do the best I can for you . I 'll send a girl with you to keep you company . MR . ZERO A girl ? What for ? What good will a girl do me ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES She 'll help make you forget . MR . ZERO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , I 'll call her . He calls in a loud voiceOh ! Hope ! Yoo-hoo ! He turns his head aside and says in the manner of a ventriloquist imitating a distant feminine voiceYe-es . Then in his own voiceCome here , will you ? There 's a fellow who wants you to take him back . Ventriloquously againAll right . I 'll be right over , Charlie dear . He turns to ZEROKind of familiar , is n't she ? Charlie dear ! MR . ZERO What did you say her name is ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Hope . H-o-p-e. p. 80 MR . ZERO Is she good-lookin ' ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Is she good-looking ! Oh , boy , wait until you see her ! She 's a blonde with big blue eyes and red lips and little white teeth and  --  MR . ZERO Say , that listens good to me . Will she be long ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES She 'll be here right away . There she is now ! Do you see her ? MR . ZERO No . Where ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther . To the right . Do n't you see her blue dress ? And the sunlight on her hair ? MR . ZERO Oh , sure ! Now I see her ! What 's the matter with me , anyhow ? Say , she 's some jane ! Oh , you baby vamp ! LIEUTENANT CHARLES She 'll make you forget your troubles . MR . ZERO What troubles are you talkin ' about ? LIEUTENANT CHARLES Nothing . Go on . Do n't keep her waiting . MR . ZERO You bet I wo n't ! Oh , Hope ! Wait for me ! I 'll be right with you ! I 'm on my way ! He stumbles out eagerly . JOE bursts into uproarious laughter LIEUTENANT CHARLES eyeing him in surprise and anger.What in hell 's the matter with you ? p. 81 JOE shaking with laughter.Did you get that ? He thinks he saw somebody and he 's following her ! He rocks with laughter LIEUTENANT CHARLES punching him in the jaw.Shut your face ! JOE nursing his jaw.What 's the idea ? Ca n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funny ! You keep your mouth shut or I 'll show you something funny . Go on , hustle out of here and get something to clean up this mess with . There 's another fellow moving in . Hurry now . He makes a threatening gesture . JOE exits hastily . CHARLES goes to chair and seats himself . He looks weary and dispirited . Shaking his headHell , I 'll tell the world this is a lousy job ! He takes a flask from his pocket , uncorks it , and slowly drains it
