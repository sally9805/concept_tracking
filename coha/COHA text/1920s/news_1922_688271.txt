txt Not enough attention , it is said , is being given by many retailers to their children 's clothing departments , with the result that good-will is not being built up , and many sales which could be made are being lost daily . According to the merchandise manager of a prominent local retail establishment , the merchandising errors are not in the varied selection or the quality of the merchandise offered , but in the way customers are sometimes handled . " Many retailers , " said he , " seem to overlook the fact that it is just as necessary to ' sell ' the child as it is the older man or woman . It is an extremely shortsighted policy to figure that , because a child 's garment may sell for only a few dollars , the sale should not be as carefully handled as that of more costly clothing for adults . This view is seemingly held by too ' 1 many retailers , particularly the smaller ones , who very often slur over the attention thay should give this class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I the children 's trade is one of the most difficult to handle . The reason usually advanced ts that there is not one person to be considered in the sale , as i usually the case in grown-ups ' clothing , but several persons . Not only must the , 1 child be pleased but the mother as well and , very often , it is a matter of also pleasing father or sister . " Through long observation , I have noticed that the quickest way to Amite a sale in the children 's department is to make much of the child . This is the surest way of preparing to overcome any sales resistance on the past of the parents or other relatives . For there is not a parent in the world who does not feel pleased when the offspring is shown marked attention . " Impress this on your salesmen . A little pat on the cheek , a few remarks on how attractive the child is or , in the case of a Loy , ' what a little man he is becoming ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sale . I have known of a store which expanded this idea still further . On a certain day each week this establishment gave each little customer sonic small toy or novelty . The parents themselves said this loomed big in their childrens ' minds and , every time it was necessary to buy clothes for them thereafter , the youngsters asked to be taken to ' s store . . ' They give nice things to me ' was the reason . " When I have been in other cities I have had occasion to go into large and small stores and I have noticed that . very often , while the child was being fitted with garments , the mother was standing or walldng to and fro in a tired manner . To many women a shopping tour is a source of no little fatigue . Why not offer her a chair and , In fact . make it a regular custom to offer one to every woman customer who comes into the children 's department ? Of course , every one may not care to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , instead , of making the mother follow the salesman while he is getting the garments from the various racks , /et her sit in comfort and view the articles as they are tried on the child . " In meeting the parents ' possible objections , the skill of the salesman comes into play . The point should be borne in mind that , even if the present sale appears lost , nothing should be said by the salesman v.hich would cause the customer to look elsewhere for her future requirements . In other words , if the customer says that the suit or other garment fot the child is made of a poor fabric and your salesman knows better , or thinks he knows , it never pays to push the point to extreme . The expression ' the customer is always right ' has much to recommend it . It is always the customer 's privilege to walk out , but tha store should not make it a case of ' not to come again . ' " I had an example in point told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the department , desiring to look at certain sults which were advertised at 58.75 each . The salesman made his usual tactful approach and showed her the garments . She studied them rather hastily and said This stuff is very poor . It is shoddy and will give very poor service . I do n't think I want these . ' , " Well , the salesman knew otherwise , and did not press the point at the mordent , but diplomatically said that she might care to look at some others which he displayed . She studied these with more care , but was dubious about the price as being a little too high . Then the salesman began to explain how the suits first shown - were reduced from $11.75 , and that really they would give excellent service . As the result of this diplomatic procedure , the customer finally left the store with the suits which she had so roundly condemned after a hasty examination . If she had given signs of annoyance at her attention being again directed to the first suits she looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another tack . " A type very often met with is the woman who likes to ' shop around , ' particularly when buying children 's garments . After being given every attention and still no sales result , this type may be directly asked to come back to the store if she is not . satisfied elsewhere . One of the salesmen reported to me a couple of days ago a case where a woman had expressed a desire to see what the ? other stores were offering in the merchandise she wanted . He agreed that was her privilege and suggested that he would be glad to serve her it she were to return . She did return and bought two overcoats and six suits , the purchase totaling $139.15 . " Another point that retailers should impress on their salesmen in the children 's department Is that sales are very often negotiated when there does not seem to be any possibility at the moment . The very last garment shown may look so attractive on the youngster that its appeal will clinch the otherwise doubtful sale . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time required does seem rather excessive . It will pay in the end . " Frequently , little favors may be selldered customers that are good-will builders . An example of this happened the other day when a man came into the children 's department and asked for a child 's velvet suit in white . He said his little boy was to be a page at a wedding that was to take place shortly and the velvet suit was necessary . Now , white velvet for youngsters is not usual and we had none in stock . ' " The salesman at first said it would have to be made special , requiring from ten days to two weeks . Tho customer explained that this would he too late to be of service , as the wedding was to take place within the next few days . The matter was put up to me and I got in touch with a niannf:o-t user I thought might be able to supply possibly one suit from stock . Luckily i eras able to get it , and the customer was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the garment to the store . His offer , of course , was not taken and we got it through our regular messengers . That man was a customer for life , according to his own declaration . " The point to bear in mind is that , even if it does mean a little extra work to do special favors , it is worth while . Summed up in a nutshell , the answer o the problem of better business in he children 's department is better set ? ice . "
