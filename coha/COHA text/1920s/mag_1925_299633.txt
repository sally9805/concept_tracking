Since the world began , big men have tried to justify their size by deeds of prowess , little men to prove that an ounce of agility is worth much ponderous brawn . In Newark , N. J. , before a vast crowd , two men continued this controversy . Though the difference in their sizes was barely perceptible , one came into the lists as champion of the big men-Mike McTigue , the 160-pound , world 's light-heavyweight champion . Mickey Walker , 149 pounds , world 's best welterweight , stood up for the little men . They scuffled . <P> Little Walker took the first four rounds . Savagely he tore into McTigue , slashed him around the ropes with rights and lefts , made small men stand up in their chairs . The next three rounds were not so fast ; the fighters were listless . The bell rang for the eighth , both boxers dragged languidly into action amid a salvo of boos . More flaccid pommeling , clinching , pushing . A raucous fan began to sing Every Hour I Knead Thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McTigue feebly rallied . Referee Lewis gave the victory to little Walker . McTigue kept his title , as the boxing law of New Jersey does not permit an official rendering of decisions . The vast crowd audibly wished that they had kept their money . Tony Polozzolo , McTigue 's trainer , leaned through the ropes to vociferate that McTigue had hurt both hands early in the fight , hence his defensive demeanor . Walker 's retainers testified that he had a bad cold .
