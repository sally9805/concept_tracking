Bloomfield , Neb. , farm country town of about 1,800 , shouted along the telegraph wires last week that practically all its merchants had trained practically all the townspeople to pay spot cash for goods . Only lumber , building material , farm implement and furniture concerns , the garages and photographic studios and one of the three hardware stores gives credit . Others deliver for cash , even the doctor his visits . Newspapers all over the country , by printing the story , indicated how rare such cash custom now is and how justified Bloomfield was in shouting .
