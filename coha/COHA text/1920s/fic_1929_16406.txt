Sears grabs up a cap and dusts first one shoe and then the other , all the time doing fancy little steps . Then , Roebuck hops out , and shuffling one foot around , he marks out a circle with the other . Little Coe has ideas of his own on dancing  --  he just stands still and shivers .

Zeke stands behind her , thrilled , breathless . Outside can be heard the booming , sonorous voice of the Parson , impressing the sanctity of the mood as he unites this man and woman in the holy state of matrimony .

There is no resisting this rhythm and the bride and groom swing off into a snappy march that soon turns and twists into an old-fashioned cake-walk . They strut down toward the house and meet the Parson and Mammy who are strutting toward the fire . Zeke and Missy join in and give a fancy exhibition of cake-walking .

Zeke is olated : &nbsp; ZEKE " Dat 's right , Brothers ! You ca n't make no mistake locatin ' in FAITH ! " Now he starts up again . His arms move back and forth like the giant drivers of a locomotive - his foot stamp on the floor - his chug-chug grows faster and faster . 359 Chick is watching him intently , the amused look on her face fading - she is gradually falling under the spell of his personality . 360 Suddenly Zeke claps his hand over his cyes and yells : &nbsp; ZEKE " Uh-Uh ! See dat old Debbil throw a cinder in my eye ? Tryin ' to make me miss de next station !

Zeke looks right at them - says : &nbsp; ZEKE " Here , Sister , do n't you leave you man behind - make him git off at OBEDIENCE . " The comedy woman grabs hold of her little man and drags him down front to Obedience . She yells to him : &nbsp; WOMAN " You no-good nigger . Bring my umbrella along - and do n't yo forgit dat parrot and cage . " The poor , bewildered little man looks frantically around for the mythical umbrella and parrot . She gives him a jerk that sends him headlong on his knees down front . 363 Zeke again begins his sales talk . He says : &nbsp; ZEKE " OBEDIENCE am a nine-o'clock town and de curfew done blow ever night .

" Niggers come racing down the aisle - shaking - yelling : &nbsp; MEN " Lemme off , Lawd - lemme off here  --  ! " " I done got on dat train by mistake ! " Zeke starts his train again . He yells as a parting shot at the converts : &nbsp; ZEKE " Remember ! No mo ' speeding in OBEDIENCE or the Lawd 'll send his cycle cops after you . " He chugs on - getting faster and faster . 366 Chick is watching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the platform , a couple of niggers , alarmed by their proximity to Hell , jump and yell : &nbsp; MEN " We wants to git off dis train . " 368 Zeke shows by his actions that this is the wrong spot  --  it 's as if somebody wanted to leave a train in the middle of the desert - but he is gracious - says : &nbsp; ZEKE " All right - you sins am forgive  --  set down ! " 369 Now he announces with great gestures : &nbsp; ZEKE " Wese a-comin to de last station  --  de last station : REPENTANCE - REPENTANCE , I says  --  " with solemn impressiveness he starts to spell it : &nbsp; ZEKE " R-E-P-E-N-T  --  " But he is lost - so he covers it with a loud voice : &nbsp; ZEKE " REPENTANCE ! Anybody want to get off here ? "  --  84  --  370 Half the congregation rise . But they are slightly anticipatory . He has n't had a chance to give his booster talk yet - and like any ardent C of C-ist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ZEKE " Not yet - set down ! " 371 372 The congregation sits and he begins : &nbsp; ZEKE " REPENTANCE am de big Jubilee town - where dey 's nothing but one-way streets and dey all lead down to the river Jordan . " Several niggers fidget in their ssats - they are thoroughly convinced - can hardly wait to get saved . Zeke goes on : &nbsp; ZEKE " De Lawd 's angels am de traffic cops in REPENTANCE - showin de way to all de sinners . " The niggers ca n't stand it any longer - they bob up again shouting : " I see de way , Lawd  --  I wants to git saved  --  " etc . Zeke is n't ready for them yet - he is really put out as he says : &nbsp; ZEKE " Not yet - set down ! "  --  85  --  373 The niggers sit down disappointedly - almost weeping , childish . Zeke goes on : &nbsp; ZEKE " Dey 's lots of cool , shady spots in dis town - but you got to pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He decides to let them off - says : &nbsp; ZEKE " Anybody want to git off at REPENTANCE , de las ' stop fore Hell ? " 374 Practically the whole congregation comes rushing down the aisle and falls on their knees on the grass . Only two women are left in the congregation - Chick and another woman . Zeke singles Chick out and preaches directly at her from now on . 375 He starts the train up again slowly - gives his parting word to the convers he is leaving behind at Repentance . He says : &nbsp; ZEKE " You am wise  --  it gits kinder hot in REPENTANCE sometimes , but never as hot as Hell ! " The niggers on the ground all roll their eyes seriously and amen and hallelujah this . Now Zeke starts his train up faster . He yells : ( at Chick ) &nbsp; ZEKE " You can still git off - come on - jump ! "  --  86  --  376 He has directed this at Chick , but the other woman suddenly jumps up and runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off ! I got off ! " Zeke works it up big - sweat is pouring off his face - he takes out a big silver watch , looks at it - exhorts Chick : &nbsp; ZEKE " Come on - repent Sister - wese running behind schedule . " 377 Chick sits there , fighting against his personality and the call of religion . She is torn - wild - almost hysterical . Zeke makes a personal appeal : &nbsp; ZEKE " Come on , Sister , repent ! I 'm stickin ' with de las ' sinner  --  and I do n't want to go to Hell ! " Still Chick sits - she is quivering but still resistant . He pleads : &nbsp; ZEKE " I don ' want to go to Hell ! I don ' want to go to Hell ! " 378 The other niggers are looking back at Chick - urging her to jump - they chant : &nbsp; MEN " Don ' take him to Hell - " " Jump - Sister - Jump ! " " It 's you las ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeke pleads :  --  87  --  &nbsp; ZEKE " You las ' chance - here 's a curve - comme on - jump - jump - JUMP ! " And Chick unable to resist longer - leaps up and comes screaming down the aisls - falls on the grass . She is resentful , crying from anger and resentment that he has beaten her . Zeke is exultant - he lets the train thunder off - he shouts : &nbsp; ZEKE " Dere she goes on down to Hell - an not a passenger on her ! " 379 He chugs up and down and in a circle - working it up until he is going around and around with his arms upraised - Quite naturally and unconsciously he goes off into a jazzy rhythm , then leads off into a spiritual : &nbsp; ZEKE " Free at las ' , free at las ' I thank God I 'm free at las ' . " 380 They all join in singing : &nbsp; ALL " Way down yonder in de grave yard walk I thank God I 'm free at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank God I 'm free at las ' . "  --  88  --  381 At the end of the song , Zeke is exhausted . The congregation shouts and hollers and they all rush up to vent their enthusiasm upon him . They swarm about and congratulate him - the bold ones shake his hand , the emotional kiss his cheek , the timid sinners touch his garments . 383 Chick steps back and watches him . Others crowd up between them , but she leans against a tree and sees how his eyes search over the mob until they find her . 383 At last , when he can break away he comes straight to her : &nbsp; ZEKE " I hope , Sister  --  " " Just call me , Chick . " " I hope , Sister Chick , you will git religion and be baptized tomorrow . " Burning eyes that are sincere - a voice vibrantly earnest as Chick answers : &nbsp; CHICK " My soul is in your keeping , Brother Zeke  --  in your two hands . " Zeke slowly backs away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others crowd around him again .  --  89  --  384 385 386 Missy Rose has been watching them - a heart-sick premonition stealing over her she sees her man attracted to this yeller gal . Slickum appears alongside of Chick . He seizes her arm and while she squirms in pain , he says calmly : &nbsp; SLICKUM " Come away , Yeller Gal . I do n't trust nigger preachers anymore'n I do rattlesnakes . " She writhes in pain and anger as Slickum pulls her away . FADE OUT pp. 31-64 &nbsp; pp. 90-111 387 THE RIVER : THE NEXT DAY Zeke and the old Parson , clad in St. Peter 's robes , stand waist-deep in the stream , baptizing the sinners . On the bank , two long rows of sinners , dressed in their best , wait to be washed clean . The women 's pink and white dresses are starched stiff . Grouped on either side of the converts in the congregation of the faithful . Sinners and congregation sing passionately in rhythm to the submerging , with an obligato of " praise-the lawd " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sputtering . Every movement blends into the rhythm of the baptism as the singers chant and sway in time to the dipping . 388 Mammy and Missy Rose stand on the bank , helping encouraging , singing . Chick is in Zeke 's line - she is afraid , shaking , sincerely religious now . 389 Two or three are baptized first - the funny comedy fellow with the big wife . As he goes under , he is filled with the spirit of the Lord . He comes up blubbering - jumps out onto the bank and begins shouting gibberish : &nbsp; MAN " **28;2034;TOOLONG " Everyone is highly impressed . He is manifesting the religious phenomenon known as talking tongues . "  --  91  --  390 Now Chick is next in line . Quaking she wades out to Zeke. 391 The old woman whom the Person is baptizing comes out hysterical . She jerks and shakes and Mammy and Missy Rose hurry over to Pappy 's line . Missy Rose wades out and brings the old lady in . Mammy meets them half way - together they half-carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass . 392 Chick is in Zeke 's arms for baptism . He feels her tremble as he dips her under and can not understand the emotion that sweeps over him . . . . " Get thee behind me , Satan . " He feels her long , slim arms elasped around his neck . . . . . " They 're soft and brown and Missy 's are black " . He feels her hot breath upon his cheek . . . " Oh , Lawdy. . this erring sister . . her lips are red . . . the folly of her ways . " He feels her soft , supple body clinging - clinging - clinging . . . . " The spirit . . . the flesh ! " He tries to pull away from Chick , but finds that she is deliberately clinging to him - he tries to pull away , then suddenly finds that he does n't want to pull away . She weeps , faints , cries but hysterically . He slips his other arm under her back and lifting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Missy Rose are occupied with the old woman on the bank . Zeke carries Chick toward a tent erected for emergencies .  --  92  --  Zeke enters with Chick still in his arms . He lays her down upon a bench . She is limp now and he stands off and looks at her , passion struggling with doubt for possession of her . 394 Chick opens her eyes and looks at him . peeping , she raises her arms to him - cries out : &nbsp; CHICK " Hold me , Brother zekial . Hold me in your strong arms . Don ' let dat ole debil get me. " 395 396 Zeke kneels down to comfort her , then as she throws her arms about his neck , and draws his face close to hers , his control snaps and he kisses her passionately . She responds and they play a sincere sex scene , which is interrupted by . Mammy coming into the tent . She bustles over to them , ready to take care of Chick . Zeke gets to his feet - goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on out to resume his baptising. 397 OUTSIDE THE TENT Zeke on his way to the stream meets Missy Rose who is hurrying excitedly to the tent . Missy questions him eagerly : &nbsp; MISSY ROSE " Has she got religion ? "  --  93  --  Zeke looks at her for a long moment , then without conviction to himself , he nods his head  --  goes on . Missy hurries into the tent . She is interested in the woman inside . 398 AT THE RIVER Zeke pauses a moment on the bank - he is struggling with himself . He is doubting his own sincerity for the first time . He is down-cast and self-accusatory as he wades into the river . 399 IN THE TENT Missy Rose and Mammy rub Chick 's wrists . Mammy , long accustomed to dealing with such cases , slaps her resoundingly and brings her to . 400 Chick jumps up and runs out of the tent , singing and yelling that she 's got religion . She dances down to the bank , dancing about in ecstacy of spirit . 401 IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the door-flap of the tent . Missy Rose says piously , sincerely : &nbsp; MISSY ROSE " Praise the Lawd - she 's got religion !  --  94  --  Mammy is a little troubled - more than a little skeptical as she says : &nbsp; MAMMY " I 'd feel easier in my mind about it ef she 'd stop snappin ' them hips . " FADE OUT .  --  95  --  Section Details 402 FADE IN NEXT EVENING OUTSIDE CHICK 'S HOUSE Slickum , resplendent in a checked suit and a gray derby , swaggers down the street . He is on the rickety old porch in a couple of quick steps and without knocking , turns the doorknob and enters . 403 INSIDE THE HOUSE LIVINGROOM As Slickum closes the door , he can hear Chick singing in another room . Smilingly satisfied , he takes off the gray derby and sits down to wait . 404 IN THE BEDROOM Chick is before a cracked mirror getting ready to go to the religious meeting . Her starched dress crackles elegantly as she swishes about trying one effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to look and feel pure . She at last decides that a magnolia blossom makes her look more pure and innocent than anything else . She sings as she pins it in her hair . &nbsp; CHICK " Gim me dat ole time religion , It 's good enough for me. " 405 IN THE LIVINGROOM As Slickum - smiles cynically as much as to say : " I 'll take care of that ! " 406 IN THE BEDROOM Chick sings out piously : &nbsp; CHICK " It was good for de Hebrew children , An it 's good enough for me . " She is happy , spiritually elated as she rushes from the room .  --  96  --  407 IN THE LIVINGROOM Chick runs in - slickum jumps up right in front of her and with his face close to hers , whispers : 408 IN THE LIVINGROOM &nbsp; SLICKUM " Come on , Chick . I can show you somethin bettern ' dat ol ' time religion ! " Chick is breathless . Slickum swells his chest magnificently - tightens his muscles . Then he grabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss hotly compelling . He lifts her high off the floor and for a moment she can not move as he presses her slim body against his . Then she regains her breath and strength , and fighting fiercely , she struggles down out of his arms . Almost as if he were teasing her , he buffets her about with his superior strength , until at last , he pins her down upon the floor , his big bulk hovering over her . 409 410 ON THE FLOOR Frightened , Chick pleads : &nbsp; CHICK " Ca n't you see my blood 's washed in the spirit of the Lamb ? " Slickum is tickled - then enflamed . He moves closer - says : &nbsp; SLICKUM " I can see that your blood 's washed in the fire of the Devil ! " He grabs her again and kisses her repeatedly , even more passionately than before . Chick fights like a wildeat , she kicks and claws as Slickum a laughs and eggs her on . He picks her up finally and throws her down on a couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , desperate pants - her  --  97  --  eyes blaze as he pinions her down . He laughs into her face : &nbsp; SLICKUM " Pears to me that your soul done take on the spirit of a hundred she-cats , yeller gal . " Crying , scratching , biting , Chick manages to push him onto the floor . In a flash she has grabbed a heavy , cheap vase and crashed it down over his head . 413 ON THE COUCH Crouching on the couch , she watches him as he sinks back unconscious , then leaping up , she gives him a kick . Hurriedly , she tidies herself , fixes the magnolia blossom in her hair as if nothing else in the world mattered and without another glance at Slickum , rushes out of the house . 414 AT THE CHURCH : NIGHT A white-washed church on the edge of the woods : its lights valiantly shine out trying to pierce the heavy gloom of the forest . Into their feeble rays the figure of Chick darts from the woods . She pauses a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the two steps and on into the church . 415 416 INSIDE THE CHURCH The congregation is seated on wooden benches and chairs . 417 Zeke is on the platform preaching . The rest of the family is arranged in their customary group with Missy Rose at the organ . 418 Zeke is boxing with the devil . He shadow-boxes - strikes out - says :  --  98  --  &nbsp; CHICK " Back-bitin ' , guess dat uppercut 'll hold you for a while . " Chick slips into a vacant seat - turns worshipful eyes on Zeke . He goes on- hits out again - says triumphantly : &nbsp; ZEKE " You'se out - Greed ! " Satisfaction , peace steel over Chick . She is lifted out of herself . All about , big eyes pop , huge red mouths hang open , quivering breaths indrawn in absorption as they wait for the crucial knock-out . Zeke makes great preparations then with elaborate gestures - he hits out : yells : &nbsp; ZEKE " I'se knocked the Debbil out- " He stands over the devil - calls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down - never let him up again  --  " The congregation goes wild - shout : " Atta Brother , Zeke " , " De debbil am knocked out " , etc . Zeke stands over the devil - then lifts his arms in praise of the Lord . . He starts moving around in circles - goes around twice with arms uplifted - goes right off into a song : Swinging around the platform in hallalujah fashion : &nbsp; ZEKE " I got a robe . " This is a signal . Missy Rose starts playing the organ . Mammy leads off the singing - the congregation falling in : &nbsp; ALL " You got a robe . " 419 Zeke and Congregation :  --  99  --  &nbsp; ALL " All God 's chillun got a robe When I get to Heab'n Goin to put on my robe , Goin to shout all over God 's Heab'n . " &nbsp; MAMMY " Heab'n . " &nbsp; CONGREGATION " Heab'n . " &nbsp; BOTH " Goin to shout all over God 's Heab'n. " 420 AT THE ORGAN Missy Rose repeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heab'n . Goin to shout all over God 's Heab'n . " The congregation understands : chanting this over and over they begin pushing back the benches and chairs . There is a shuffling of feet as a ring is formed - men and women alternately . It moves round and round , slowly at first , then with quickening tempo as Missy Rose at the organ works it up . Around and around the ring moves , feet never leaving the floor - one foot beating the heel in a decided accent , two-four time . Missy Rose plays and Mammy sings the last line over and over . 421 422 IN THE RING People begin supplementing the music by a clapping of hands . As the ring goes round it begins to take on the signs of frenzy .  --  100  --  Mammy 's voice mounts to a wild , monotonous chant . Chick , in the ring , directs all her movements , all her ecstacy at Zeke who sits on the platform . Zeke sits there quietly , at first , then gradually falls under the spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor , exhausted by his emotion . He is carried out to : 423 THE WATER PUMP The exhausted sinners are carried in , laid down and big bucket of cold water thrown over them . 424 IN THE CHURCH THE RING The chant becomes an incoherent cry . Women scream and fall quivering to the floor , men shout and shake in wild savagery . Chick shivers and writhes into Zeke 's range of vision . 425 ON THE PLATFORM Zeke 's self-control snaps . Joining in the general ecstacy , he shuffles off the platform . 426 THE RING As Zeke joins in  --  encircling the ring , encouraging them by example , inciting them by vibrant cries  --  and quite involuntarily following Chick . Suddenly as he comes up to her , she turns and grabs his bare forearm.  --  101  --  427 CLOSEUP : ZEKE 'S ARM : CHICK 'S HAND Her nails dig fiercely into his flesh - then as her hand goes out , we can see the marks of her nails with perhaps several drops of blood . Chick , as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she maneouvers her way around to the door . Zeke , as he follows close upon Chick 's heels . 428 AT THE DOOR Chick reaches the opening . She darts one wild glance behind her - then rushes out into the night . Zeke dashes into the scene - runs out after her . 429 ON THE PLATFORM Missy Rose on the platform as she sees this - rises . Mammy , chanting monotonously , watching Missy Rose . 430 THE RING as it moves round , round , round . . . . . . . . 431 OUTSIDE THE CHURCH Chick dashes down the two steps , pauses for one wild second in the light from the door . Zeke 's big frame is silhouetted in the doorway .  --  102  --  Chick turns and with an abandoned fling of her arms , rushes into the woods . Zeke runs after her and is swallowed up in the darkness . An instant of suspense  - -   - -   - -   - -   - -   - -  -  Missy Rose appears in the doorway . She stumbles down the steps blindly , sobbing : &nbsp; MISSY ROSE " Zeke - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , then runs in the opposite direction from that taken by Chick and Zeke.  --  103  --  432 IN THE WOODS Missy Rose gropes uncertainly about - her soul-agony mounting as the darkness mocks her . She follows various courses - weeping - praying - running - stumbling : " Zeke , Oh , Brother Ezekiel ! The Lawd have mercy ! Oh , Lawd , look down - oh , Zeke  --  " 433 BEFORE THE CHURCH Once more Missy Rose comes into the light-square from the church . Half-crazed , almost demented , she rushes into the church . 434 IN THE CHURCH : THE RING Mammy has come down and joined the ring . Missy Rose rushes into the ring - breaks through-drops on her knees in the center . She lifts her hands to heaven and utters one wild scream like some animal mortally wounded . The others sense her sorrow . Mammy , as she realizes what has happened drops on her knees beside Missy Rose , raises her hands and begins wailing . The rest of the congregation as they drop on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocking back and forth , they wail their woes to God  --  moan their sorrow , shout their tragedy - their fantastic shadows leap and crouch upon the rough walls - their poignant , age-old plaints fill the dark night . FADE OUT  --  104  --  Section Details 435 RAILROAD STATION : DAY The evangelist train is about to pull out . Brother Ezekiel stands on the rear platform ; the Parson , Mammy , Missy Rose , the kids , the deacons and church workers are grouped behind him . Crowds of negroes cluster about the train , their voices all raised in song - a plaintive wail , a farewell song . The train starts moving . Zeke raises his hands in benediction . All hands are bowed to receive his blessing - then they begin singing again as the train disappears in the distance . 436 437 438 IN THE FIRST CAR Zeke drops onto a wooden bench and gazes moodily out over the landscape . He is struggling for strength to keep going - away from the fire and joy of Chick 's passion . Why had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched the throng for a glimpse of her face . He must summon his power-the Lord will give him strength ! He covers his eyes with his hands , struggling with himself , trying to get the best of his baser desires . Missy Rose comes in . She is more grown-up looking than previous sequences . It is as if her sorrow of the night before had changed her from a child into a woman . She looks at him - then looks away - pretends not to see him as she goes about busying herself with some task . Zeke hears her - takes his hands down and looks at her . He thinks about her - studying her as she moves about . It comes to him that she is the natural way out of his problem . She represents a sort of refuge for him . He calls to her . She turns and looks at him .  --  105  --  He asks her to come over to him - to come closer , She comes over reluctantly . He takes her hand - caresses it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover her emotion . He smoothes the plumpness of her arm - realizes afresh that she is now a woman . He says : &nbsp; ZEKE " You like me , do n't you , Missy Rose ? " She is frightened - afraid to speak - afraid that her voice will betray her emotion as she just nods her head . He is relieved - he smiles happily . 439 Mammy and the Parson come in - they stop - look at Zeke questioningly , then turn away to settle themselves for the journey . Zeke feels he has been shown the light , the way to peace . Addressing his parents , he tells them : &nbsp; ZEKE " Missy Rose and I want to get married at the next town . " Missy Rose is dumb with happiness . The old folks are overjoyed . The Parson comes forward - joins their hands together and blesses them impressively . Mammy is pleased but she watches them narrowly - she realizes he is forcing himself to play a part and sympathizes with him . Missy Rose is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he comforts Missy who clings to him . The situation becomes so embarrassing for him that he finally dis-entangles himself from Missy and turns her over to Mammy . He is winning in his fight , but he must pray for strength . He tries to smile at them , then goes out of the car .  --  106  --  The old Parson is thanking the Lord for the boy 's return to the fold . Missy Rose is sniffling happily on Mammy 's shoulder . Mammy is looking after Zeke - the only one who really understands the fight he is putting up . 441 442 IN THE ANIMAL CAR The little donkey is dozing in one corner . The door at the further end of the car opens and Zeke appears . He closes the door behind him , stands for a moment , then moving to the stack of hay in the opposite corner , he sinks upon his knees . Pressing his trembling hands together , he lifts them on high and prays : &nbsp; ZEKE " Oh , Lawd ! Relieve my soul of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves  --  two slim brown arms are thrust forth . . . . a wild brown face pops up before the startled Zeke. . . . a hushed , gleeful laugh . . . . Chick clasps him about the neck . Zeke is dumbfounded . He can hardly believe this reality . . . . Chick showers his face with kisses . . . and he succumbs. . . grabs her to him passionately . They are so enthralled in their embrace that they do not notice the door opening slowly  --  they do not see Mammy standing there .  --  107  --  443 Mammy 's face is calm and sympathetic . She has obviously come to comfort the harassed Zeke . As she sees the two of them before her , her expression changes to cold fury and hatred . She steps inside the car and slams the door violently behind her . Zeke and Chick realize her presence - they turn - see her - break apart and scramble ingominously to their feet . Mammy realizes she has prayed too long - that she must be a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 444 THE THREE Mammy ignores Zeke - advances toward Chick , her mouth working , her eyes blazing hatred . As she passes the donkey stall , her hand seizes upon a long blacksnake whip which hangs curled upon a nail . Like a flash , she unfurls it and strikes out at Chick. 445 Chick , backing into a corner as the whip curls across her cheek . 446 Zeke springs forward toward Mammy . Mammy strikes out again and again , Zeke comes in to her and grabs her wrists and struggles with her . 447 The little donkey tugs at the halter , frightened and excited . Chick lies on the floor . Zeke is struggling with Mammy who manages to strike out in spite of his efforts . At last he wrests the whip from her grasp and drags her toward the door  --  108  --  448 Mammy is half-crazed . She tries to pull away from Zeke . She curses and weeps - she spats out imprecations upon Chick who lies in the corner . Zeke drags Mammy to the door - pushes her outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it for a moment . He looks over at : 450 Chick lying in the corner half-conscious , moaning . Zeke 's expression changes to one of fierce tenderness , passionate yearning . He crosses over to her - drops on his knees beside her - lifts her up in his arms . A thin trickle of blood curls across her cheek . Zeke 's passionate tenderness mounts as he wipes it away - he kisses her eyelids - administers to her wounds - she stirs and clings to him weeping - he comforts her - they sink back into the hay as FADE OUT  --  109  --  Section Details FADE IN 451 MAIN COMPARTMENT : NIGHT Missy Rose sits at a table beside a lamp . She is reading the Bible , praying , weeping , waiting for Zeke. 452 453 Zeke comes from the other end of the compartment . He has been gathering his things together ; he carries a bandanna handkerchief in which a few belongings are wrapped . As he starts to pass through the compartment , he sees Missy . He hesitates a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Missy Rose looks at him hopefully . Zeke says : &nbsp; ZEKE " I ca n't go on with it , Missy Rose ,  --  " Her look of hope freezes into despair . She did n't expect this . She watches him , terrified , as he goes on : &nbsp; MISSY ROSE " It would n't be fair to you  --  when every thought , every breath  --  my very soul belongs  --  to her  --  " She is horrified , numb with despondency . He is nervous - driven , ridden by his desire for Chick . It sweeps everything before it , leaving him helpless , unable to determine his actions . Abruptly he turns and hurries out . Missy Rose looks after him - then rushes toward the door . 454 ON THE REAR PLATFORM OF THE CAR Chick is waiting . She , too , is obviously dressed for a quick departure . The welt on her cheek stands out boldly during a flash of lightning . She glances toward the door nervously - a worried expression on her face . Then her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph as :  --  110  --  Zeke comes hurrying toward her . 455 LONG SHOT Swamp at the side of the tracks . The lighted train thunders into view - the whistle shrills out mornfully - the rain beats down - the thunder rumbles . The train slows down to take a curve . 456 ON THE PLATFORM Zeke stands with his arm around Chick breathlessly waiting for the right second in which to jump . Suddenly he calls to her above the thunder of the storm and the train . They leap . 457 ON THE GROUND As Chick and Zeke come hurtling down upon the ground - lie there . 458 ON THE PLATFORM Missy Rose rushes out through the door - stands gazing off into the storm . ON THE GROUND Zeke scrambles to his feet - comes over to Chick - helps her up - she clings to him .

Mammy understands - she drops upon her knees beside Missy Rose and joins the hollow chant of sorrow . The Parson drops down and begins rocking . One by one the children run in - rubbing their eyes then sensing the tragedy in the air , they join the circle on the floor , their long , trailing night-gowns adding to the wierdness of the scene . 462 The Parson extends his arms to heaven in supplication : &nbsp; PARSONOh , Lawd , gather on high  --  Hear our plea , The Debil , - that low-down Debbil Has taken our brother away Show him the light , Lawd  --  Soothe our aching soul  --  " The train rumbles on - the lightning flashes - the thunder crashes - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 65-89 &nbsp; pp. 112-142 FADE IN 463 EXT .

Steam is coming out of the roof . 464 INT . OF CARRIAGE MEDIUM LONG SHOT This includes the steam carriage and saw . The carriage shoots out with terrific force and then comes back with the band-saw whining its way through the log . This process is repeated several times . On the carriage are three men who push the log out as the boards fall of . 465 CLOSE UP THE BAND SAW It cuts its way through the log . As it goes through the log , the musical whine mounts up and down the scale . 466 CLOSEUP STEAM NIGGER It comes up out of the floor and , almost as if it were human , swings the log around . 467 CLOSEUP STEAM CROSS CUT SAW It saws the tree into pieces short enough to be handled by the carriage .  --  113  --  468 CLOSEUP ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunging carriage . This is real labor - sweat - toil . Like the other two men , he is stripped to the waist . Around his forehead is a white cloth which keeps the sweat from filling his eyes . It is all that they can do to keep their balance on the carriage . The mood here is that of hard toil - almost as if Zeke were doing penance for his wrong-doing . He is no longer the carefree , jovial Zeke of the first sequences . 469 MEDIUM LONG SHOT INCLUDING ZEKE AND OTHER TWO MEN As the carriage returns to its starting position , the men pull down on the levers , pushing the log out an inch and the carriage immediately starts forward . It takes all of their strength to keep on the narrow step . 470 CLOSEUP SIREN The quiting siren blows . 471 INT . SAWMILL LONG SHOT The whine of the saws dies down .

With such prosperity , a crap game is immediately in progress . Just around the corner of the pay booth the bones start to roll . Zeke comes up to the window and receives his envelope . As he walks away from the window , one of the men walks beside him . He hears the crap game and grabs Zeke by the arm , trying to persuade him to join in . Zeke is very definite - he fingers his money and says to the man , Oscar : &nbsp; ZEKE " Uh-uh ! I'se taking this money home to my woman . " Without looking at Oscar again , he starts away . Oscar breaks out into wild , negro laughter and turns toward the crap game . Zeke hears Oscar 's wild laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catching up with Oscar , he puts his hand quickly on Oscar 's shoulder and swings him around . Oscar keeps on with his raucous laughter . Zeke , half-puzzled , half-suspicious , demands : &nbsp; ZEKE " Why are you laughing ? " Oscar laughs uproariously , jeering - says : &nbsp; OSCAR " Your woman ! " 473 There is a sharp impact between Zeke 's fist and Oscar 's jaw and Oscar goes stumbling backwards landing flat on the ground . The men around including those at the nearby crap game jump up and gather around . They help Oscar up from the ground . He is dazed and stunned . Zeke , seeing what he has done , is taken aback by his impulsive action . He goes over to Oscar and gruffly contrite says :  --  115  --  &nbsp; ZEKE " I did n't mean to hit you so hard , buddie . " Even as he talks , his mind seems to leave the incident and becomes busy on some other , more depressing thought . He is brooding , thoughtful as he hurries away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says : &nbsp; OSCAR " I 'd hate for you to hit me when you meant it ! " 474 475 RESIDENCE STREET NEGRO SECTION Dark , tired , bent men coming home for work . Big men bent over with fatigue . Zeke straggles along at the rear , morose , brooding , forboding in manner . His arms swing in an animal-like , threatening attitude . Men are turning into houses . Zeke watches them . One man turns into his house - he stops inside the gate and whistles . Six or seven of his kids come running to greet him . They all swing onto his shoulders , his legs , his arms and he walks into the house carrying them all . Just as he reaches the top step , his wife appears in the doorway with a big cake in one hand and a spoon with frosting in the other . She says : &nbsp; WOMAN " Look here , Henry - what I done baked for you . " They greet each other and go on into the house with a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks on - a tender smile softening the dull brooding of his expression .  --  116  --  476 NEGRO STREET Across the street , Zeke can see a fat , old Mammy sitting in a rocking chair watering the lawn . A young lad comes in from the mill . He sits down on his Mammy 's lap - takes the hose and waters the small patch of lawn for her . They laugh about it - get great fun out of it . Zeke smiles and trudges on - lonesome , forlorn , a solitary figure . 477 EXT . ZEKE 'S SHACK Zeke is still watching the boy on his mother 's lap and before he knows it he is in front of his own shack . Suddenly , he notices a buckboard and single horse standing in front of the shack . His suspicions are again kindled . He looks toward the house and goes somewhat stealthily to the door . Reaching the steps , his tread becomes lighter . He prepares to open the door cautiously . At this moment a phonograph on the inside starts playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens the door and steps into the room . 478 479 480 INT . SHACK The cheap phonograph is screaching out - Chick is doing some of her old-time strutting and scrunchin while she carelessly sets the table . She goes on dancing , and shows by her lack of warmth in greeting Zeke that she is a little bit guilty or is covering something up . She waves her hand at him . He watches her - a sort of smouldering tension in the air . Her dancing makes him furious and before the piece is finished , he goes over and stops it . Then he walks right up to her and says :  --  117  --  &nbsp; ZEKE " What 's that buckboard doing out in front of my door ? " She is all innocence - over-exaggerated surprise . She says : &nbsp; CHICK " I do n't know anything about a buckboard - where - come show me . " He leads her to the do orflings it open quickly . 481 EXT . HOUSE There is no sign of a buckboard or horse anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOORWAY CHICK AND ZEKE He is amazed &nbsp; CHICK says : " What buckboard - where is a buckboard ? " Zeke steps out of the door and looks both ways up the street . Then he goes back into the room . 483 484 485 INT . HOUSE Chick goes about setting the food on the table as if Zeke were plumb crazy . She ignores his moroseness and suspicious attitude . But the disappearance of the buckboard has not calmed Zeke - only mystified him . He slides into a big , old chair by the table and starts to chew on the cold , unappetizing supper that Chick has flung on the table ; possibly just bread and butter with sugar on it and some water sweetened with molasses . Nor does Chich enter into the spirit of the meal very heartily . She looks  --  118  --  around nervously as if she were trying to kid herself and her man into a belief in her innocence . She flings one leg on the table and leans back in her chair . Zeke watches her body - chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening to come around to him and sit on his lap . This physical contact and the warmth of her nearness gives Zeke temporary relief from his suspicions - almost allays his doubts . She says coaxingly : " Do n't look at me like that , Honey . Here I been waiting for you to come home and put your big strong arms around me and here you neglect me like I was a step-child . " She slithers down off his knee and dropping down , takes off his shoes . Then she sits on his lap again , runs her hand over his forehead , gently pulls his head down upon her soft bosom . Zeke is temporarily scothed . Exhausted by continual mental and physical strain , he now relaxes - his head pillowed on her soft , warm breast . She strokes his head - his back and arm and gives him a few friendly affectionate pats . Gradually he succumbs to the peace of the moment - he drops off to sleep . When she is sure he is asleep , Chick slips off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chair . She strokes his head again . Then she quickly removes the few utensils from the table and slips into the other room . 486 ADJOINING BEDROOM Chick comes in - she spreads a big bandana handkerchief on the dresser and begins putting things into it , preparatory to going away . All the while she hums softly to herself . 487 EXT . SHACK The figure of a man is silhouetted in the carkness . He stoops and picks up a handful of pebbles which  --  119  --  he throws at the window . There is a sharp crack as the pebbles hit the pane . 488 INT . SHACK Zeke is startled out of his sleep by the noise . He remains motionless , listening he rolls his eyes at the window . Then he closes them again . 489 INT . BEDROOM Chick stands motionless . She slowly peeps around the corner of the door to see if Zeke has heard the pebbles . 490 INT . SHACK Zeke is apparently asleep . He snores. 491 DOORWAY Chick wants to make sure . She whispers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is reassured . She slowly and quietly closes the door . 492 CLOSEUP ZEKE He is snoring , breathing heavily . After a few moments of this , he opens his eyes , revealing  --  120  --  that he has only been pretending to be asleep . He turns slowly without making any noise and sees that the door is closed . He waits - watches - thinks about his next move . Then he slowly gets up and goes over to the door on tip-toe . He turns the knob slowly and opens the door . 493 BEDROOM Zeke 's head comes slowly into the room . He looks around but there is no Chick - only the curtains fluttering at the open window . He hurries to the window and looks out but there is no sign of Chick . He walks quickly back to the other room and puts on his shoes and his coat and hat as if he were going out on some errand from which he wo n't return . 494 495 496 497 498 EXT . SAWMILL ROAD Chick and Slickum are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to go along with him . Chick is holding back - she is nervous , afraid - says : &nbsp; CHICK " I ca n't - I ca n't go tonight  --  he 's suspicious  --  he 'll follow us . " While they are arguing they hear footsteps coming . Slickum tries to persuade her to get into the buckboard . She breaks away from him and runs out - Slickum runs after her , leaving the horse and buckboard . He catches up with her and they hide behind piles of lumber . While they are hiding , Zeke comes up and sees the buckboard . He looks around - calls out in a hoarse whisper : " Chick ! Chick " There is no answer  --  121  --  Slickum and Chick hide behind lumber , watching him furtively , hardly daring to breath . Zeke crawls under a fence . He comes through several piles of lumber - comes to the end of one pile . A hand with a 2x4 reaches out and hits him on the head . Zeke goes down - writhing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buck-board and jump in . Slickum whips up the horse and they drive away . They dash past Zeke on the ground . He has never lost consciousness completely - he writhes there trying to get up - trying to clear his head . He hears the buckboard dash past him up the road . With a mighty effort , he struggles to his knees then to his feet and staggers blindly a few paces . Then he pulls himself together by sheer will power and stumbling out of the piles of lumber , he makes the road . He sees them going in the distance - and he starts after them - enraged , like a wild animal stalking down its prey .  --  122  --  499 500 501 A CORDUROY ROAD The buckboard tears down the rough corduroy road that leads toward the swamp - Zeke racing after them . The undertone of sawmill noises - the flare of sawmill fires . Zeke slowly gains on the buckboard as they are slowed down by the rough road . Slickum lashes the horse furiously - Chick clinging to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The narrow road leads through a cypress swamp , tall trees loom threateningly on either side . The noises of the swamp mingle with those of the mill in an ominous dirge . The distance between the pursued and the persuer increases , but Zeke follows on , breathless , dogged . Slickum lashes the horse anew . Suddenly a front axel is shattered by a sudden impact with the rough road and Chick is hurled headlong from her seat , her head crashing against a stump beside the road . 502 BESIDE THE ROAD Chick lies partly immersed in a swampy pool at the edge of the road . 503 IN THE BUCKBOARD Slickum frantically pulls on the reins but the horse , frightened , lunges on . A few hundred yards farther on , Slickum succeeds in bringing the horse to a stop . He gets out - starts back - stops as he sees :  --  123  --  504 BESIDE THE ROAD Zeke runs up to Chick . He bends over her - he is in a passion of fury - he seizes her shoulders , passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ZEKE " I baptized you once with the Holy Spirit  --  now I 'll baptize you  - -  -  with Death ! " Chick , as with agony , conviction of death , she replies in a whisper : &nbsp; CHICK " You do n't have to kill me , Zeke  --  I 'm done for anyway ! " 505 A sudden transition comes over Zeke . He lifts her up from the water - holds her tenderly in his arms as she dies . When he realizes she is dead , he slowly lays her down - lifts his eyes . 506 DOWN THE ROAD Slickum stands halfway between the buckboard and Zeke . He is watching Zeke - 507 BESIDE THE ROAD As Zeke slowly gets to his feet - starts toward Slickum. 508 THE ROAD Slickum realizes his danger - rushes back to the wagon . Zeke bearing down upon him .  --  124  --  509 AT THE BUCKBOARD Slickum as he tries to unhitch the horse as though to get on its back - he fumbles miserably with the harness , ca n't get it loose - sobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Slickum. 511 AT THE BUCKBOARD Slickum as he sees Zeke almost upon him and abandons his effort . He turns and dashes desperately into the gloom of the swamp . Zeke follows . 512 513 514 IN THE SWAMP The steady rhythmic bappity-clunk of the sawmill becomes more and more like the beat of an African tom-tom . Slickum plunges wildly through the depths of the swamp . Zeke follows on - steadily , evenly , inevitably . Invisible hands seem to reach out and rip his fancy clothing as Slickum reels through the briars - the black night seems to such him down as he sprawls in pools of ooze - untold horrors snap out at him as he narrowly averts snakes and alligators . His veneer of civilization is stripped from him - he is the luckless savage hunted down by a ruthless force . He reverts to his African instincts - he yowls - he screams . He is surrounded by the spirits of the Voodoo as he plunges on with blind , heartbreaking despair . Behind him , Zeke ploughs steadily on , craching through brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ooze . He , too , is a savage - but a savage hunting down its prey .  --  125  --  Slickum , pitiful , abject , terrorized , as he trips and falls into the ooze . Zeke , triumphant , gloating , as he reaches down and picks the helpless Slickum up in his arms - a savage gone wild , as he slowly bends him ower a tree stump until the poor wretch 's back breaks with a snap  --  a man , suddenly sane , as he lifts his arms to God in agonized supplication. 515 ON THE ROAD A car loaded with men from the mill comes down the road . Its headlights penetrate the darkness and reveal : 516 IN THE SWAMP Zeke , in the double spot of lights ; his figure is guant , his face is tragic , his spirit is broken . FADE OUT .  --  126  --  Section Details NA &nbsp; NARRATIONFor one year just a number in the Pen . For two , a soulless clod working on the chain-gang. 517 518 519 520 521 FADE IN STONE QUARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the rock pile . One scraggly little tree under which a drowsy guard sits with an alert rifle . A couple of guards moving among the convicts urging them on in their work . Zeke toiling at one of the drills with a young boy --  Zeke , broken in spirit , listless , despondent . All about ; black bodies glistening with sweat  --  dazzling heat - back-breaking toil . The convicts working on rhythmically , singing ; punctuating their song with soft explosive " hunh " as they work with the drills : &nbsp; CHAIR GANG " Go down , Moses - Hunh ! Way down in Egypt land - hunh ! Tell old Pharioh to let my people go - Hunh ! Suddenly the boy with Zeke drops to the ground , sun-struck . The other convicts go right on working and singing , never missing a beat , as the tragedy of the boy is enacted . &nbsp; OHIsreal was in Egypt land - hunh ! Let my people go - hunh ! A guard looks over , jerks his head at Zeke , calls : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bucket of water close at hand and throws it over the boy . &nbsp; CH " Oppressed so hard he could not stand - hunh !

Tell old Pharoh to let my people go-hunh !  --  127  --  Zeke is bitter , cynical as he says : &nbsp; ZEKE " The Lawd ai n't helpin ' nobody out of his trouble . A guard comes over and menaces the boy who struggles to his feet desperately . Zeke and the boy resume their drilling . &nbsp; CH " Go down Moses - hunh ! Way down in Egypt land - hunh ! Tell old Pharoh to let my people go - hunh ! 522 UNDER THE TREE The guard is half-dozing . Suddenly he opens his eyes , cocks his rifle . 523 THE ROAD A man comes down the road , driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 524 UNDER THE TREE The guard gets to his feet as the man drives in to him , crashes on his brakes . The man jumps down - he is breathless - says : 525 &nbsp; MAN " The crest of the flood is sweeping down  --  the levee 's giving way  --  rush all your men over  --  " The guard barks out an order or two . The other guards yell at the convicts - herd them like so many cattle toward the truck .  --  128  --  526 527 AT THE TRUCK Zeke is in the midst of the convicts . He climbs into one of the trucks . The boy who fainted ca n't make it - he struggles weakly to pull himself up . Zeke watches him apathetically - indifferent to his efforts  --  sunk in his own brooding . One of the guards hoists the boy into the truck with brutal indifference . The boy falls beside Zeke - lies there panting and exhausted . Zeke just looks at him , makes no move to help him . Other convicts pile into the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 529 530 531 532 FADE IN LONG SHOT THE RIVER A full expanse of the river flooded . About five shots of the river - swirling , flooding , rushing . 533 AT THE LEVEE A gang of convicts is working . They are carrying sandbags from a truck over to the weak spot in the levee . They move mechanically , patiently - grimy , exhausted , staggering under their loads . 534 Zeke , in the line of convicts , as he staggers along under a sandbag . A guard comes down the line prodding the men into greater activity . He comes up to Zeke - yells out : &nbsp; ZEKE " Hey  --  get a move on  --  " 535 Zeke looks at him - starts to respond mechanically and work faster . Then suddenly , the futility of it bursts over him . Hurling the bag he carries from him , he crosses his powerful arms on his chest and yells defiantly : &nbsp; ZEKE " Let the flood come - let it drown us - what we got to live for anyway ? " 536 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances a pace . Zeke backs a little , his arms come down - reach out toward the guard in a half-circle . He bares his teeth and snarls : &nbsp; ZEKE " Why should I sweat to save somebody else ? What 's it to me if the whole  --  130  --  &nbsp; ZEKEworld drowns ? " 537 The man in the line gaze at Zeke and the guard in awe - tense - eager - terrified at this unheard-of outburst . 538 The guard advances another pace - his gun trained on Zeke measuringly - He snaps : &nbsp; GUARD " Pick up that bag . " Zeke crouches - makes no move to pick up the bag . The guard advances another pace - commands : &nbsp; GUARD " Pick it up ! " 539 Zeke 's bravado crumples as suddenly as it came to life . He seems to wither - to shrink as he reaches down and lifts up the bag . His eyes are once more dumb and apathetic as he once more starts plodding on . The guard eases back a pace - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at them - they stumble over each other to obey his commands . 540 LONG SHOT - THE LEVEE As the line of men files along with the sandbags . 541 THE FLOOD Several shots of the flood , including one of hogs and other animals fighting their way upstream . 542 THE LEVEE  --  131  --  543 The line of men still moving along Another gang of convicts files up and stands at attention near the trucks . Zeke 's gang files up on the other side of the tracks . They are marched off with the guards at either end . The new gang starts filing from the sand bag truck to the levee , carrying on the endless labor the other began . Section Details 544 IN THE WOODS - NIGHTFALL A temporary camp has been mapped out . A bonfire blazes at one end of a small clearing . A big pot steams over it , suspended from a tripod . Straw has been spread over the ground . Down the middle of the clearing , fastened to a tree at one end , a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular intervals . At the ends of the short chains are iron bands . 545 546 The men file in and stand in a double row on either side of the master chain . One of the guards stands at the end of the chain . He barks out a command . The men all lie down on the straw on either side of the chain . The guard takes out a bunch of keys from a strap hanging at his waist . He goes up to the first man who happens to be Zeke . Zeke lifts his leg high in the air . / The guard reaches down , takes up the ackle iron and clamps it around Zeke 's leg - locks it - then goes on to the next man and repeats the operation . 547 AT THE FIRE The other guard ladels out some of the mess from the pot into a rusty bucket . He hangs it over his arm - picks up a bunch of battered tin plates and goes out .  --  132  --  548 549 THE ROW OF CONVICTS The first guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second guard comes in to Zeke . The second guard throws the tin plates at Zeke , Zeke takes one and passes the rest on , then holds up his plate eagerly . The guard dishes out a couple of spoonfuls of the mess from the bucket - then passes on down the line for all the world as if he were feeding a pack of hound dogs . FADE OUT .  --  133  --  550 FADE IN NIGHT Stock shots of the river rising . 551 THE LEVEE NIGHT The relief gang is working by torch light - lugging cement sacks from the trucks to the levee - piling them in place . 552 ANOTHER PLACE IN THE LEVEE The levee is beginning to break - the water seeps through . Then as the wall crumples with amazing rapidity , the flood waters begin pouring through in a heavy stream . 553 TEMPORARY CAMP IN THE WOODS NIGHT The men are lying on the ground chained to the master chain - the fire has burned low - the two negro guards sit beside it . Suddenly , they hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same instant , water begins coming into camp . It moves fairly slowly but steadily . The convicts all leap to their feet but stand submissive and quiet . 554 AT THE FIRE The guards confer a second - then one of them rushes away . The other stands guard over the men . 555 THE LINE OF MEN  --  134  --  556 As the water rises , they begin to stir . The bell tolls mournfully . Wild and domestic animals begin running through the camp , scurrying ahead of the flood that is bearing down upon them . The men begin tugging at their chains - the water swirls about their legs halfway between their ankles and their knees . They call to the guard , begging , pleading .  --  135  --  557 THE GUARD As he sees the water mounting . He is undecided what to do . Then , decisively , he takes his keys and starts toward the line . 558 559 560 THE LINE Zeke is in the foreground - the first in line . The guard comes in to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keys . The water is now about up to their knees . The guard has a hard time unlocking the iron hand . The rest of the men are yelling - whining like dogs . The bell tolls as if already sounding a funeral dirge . The guard manages to get Zeke unlocked - starts on to the second man . Then the general panic communicates itself to him - he goes wild and turning flees from the line . He bumps into Zeke and orders him to march on ahead - together they start making their way through the woods . 561 THE CONVICTS They realize they are trapped , deserted , chained like dogs with the flood bearing down upon them . They begin howling , struggling in the water - tugging at their chains - cursing - praying . 562 IN THE WOODS Zeke leads the way - the guard trails close behind him . The water is up to their waists now . Throughout the forest rings the howls of the frantic men - mournful toll of the bell .  --  136  --  563 Suddenly Zeke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeke , as he hears the men - he ca n't go on - he ca n't leave them to perish like trapped animals . He begins pleading with the guard to go back to the men . The guard refuses - prods Zeke - tells him to get along . Zeke begs to be allowed to go back alone . The guard says : &nbsp; GUARD " You 're not going to escape that way . I 'm not going to let you out of my sight . " 565 Zeke realizes it is hopeless to beg further . As the guard starts to push him forward . Zeke suddenly turns and leaps upon him - pulls him down under the water . They disappear together . The water churns about as they struggle - then Zeke comes up with the keys in his hand - he starts away . 566 THE GUARD 'S BODY FLOATING IN THE WATER Zeke , as he sees the body and hesitates . A raft is floating a short distance away - Zeke grabs it , drags the guard onto it . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws it away . He lets go of the raft which floats away . Zeke turns back and starts making his laborious way back to the camp . 567 THE MEN IN THE CAMP They are screaming , praying , tugging - half- crazed with fear , almost maniacal in their terror .  --  137  --  568 IN THE WOODS Zeke fighting his way along - dragging himself from stump to stump , grabbing hold of bushes that give way , stumbling , sinking to his knees . He is wading waist-deep now and going against the current of the flood .  --  138  --  569 570 571 THE CHAIN-GANG As Zeke fights his way to the first man , fumbles and manages to unlock him . He struggles on to the next . Debris knocks against him but he thrusts it away and unlocks the next man . He is under the water most of the time as he struggles along . He grabs hold of the master chain and pulls himself along to the next man . The current is getting stronger and Zeke is getting weaker . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comes at last to the boy who was sun-struck . The current is too strong now - the dark water is swirling with trash and debris and the dead bodies of helpless animals . It does n't seem possible that Zeke can make it to the boy . He reaches him at last and grabs hold of the binding chain . Together they disappear under the water as Zeke tries to unlock the iron . A long moment of suspense - then the boy comes up alone and starts swimming away frantically . Again a moment of suspense when we think Zeke is lost - then he comes up and begins striking out with long strokes . 572 573 574 BROAD EXPANSE OF THE FLOOD The flooded waters as Zeke fights his way - he is almost exhausted - can hardly reach one arm before the other . His breath comes in long , agonizing gasps - he swallows water - chokes . He is about to give up - his eyes roll around weakly - unconsciously and involuntarily he begins to pray : &nbsp; ZEKE " Oh , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way  --  Give strength to my arms  --  " And his prayer seems to be answered . He strikes out with renewed strength - he prays more fervently- from an abject supplication it begins to take on the tone of a triumphant declaration , weak but exhilarated he swims and prays . He comes upon a little dog frantically paddling in the water . It sees him and tries to paddle over to him - the waters swirl over it - it comes up choking and panting .  --  139  --  Zeke reaches out and seizes the little dog with one hand - swims on a few paces holding it out of the water ahead of him - looking around for some means of saving the little cur. 575 A piece of wood swirls in and Zeke grabs it - puts the little cur on it - swims along with the wood clasped in his teeth . The little dog on the wood gratefully reaches out a pink tongue and licks Zeke 's face as he pushes the wood along . Zeke ca n't help laughing and the little dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head - then onto his neck where he clings . Zeke swims on - dodging debris and dead animals and chickens - struggling - fighting - sputtering - calling on the Lord . 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 MOUND IN THE RIVER This is a small high spot of land which is completely surrounded by water . Many darkies have taken refuge here as well as chickens , dogs , cows , mules and other animals . They are all huddled together , human beings , and animals indiscriminately  --  all dominated by an instinctive fear of the flood . The darkies wail and moan - they crowd together as the water creeps up on the outer edges of the mound . There is still a little expanse of land between them and the water but it is obvious that the water will soon engulf them all . Then Zeke fights his way in to the mound and beings wading ashore . The little dog follows him . The pople stare at the approaching figure , some indifferently , some half-aggressively  --  one more person to take up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eerie cry is all the pathos of their plight ; they 've lost their homes , their families , their goods  --  everything . They are a tragic , helpless , hopeless lot .  --  140  --  Even as Zeke makes his way toward them , we can see the water rising . As Zeke approaches the wailing group , he feels the old call stirring within him  --  the old power to encourage the hopeless , to comfort the mourners , to inspire the despairing . Once again he knows he can be a leader .  --  that it is his duty to show his fellow men the way . It is almost with exultation that he moves into the middle of the group and lifts his arms on high and prays :  --  141  --  &nbsp; ZEKE " Oh , Lawd , we come to you now , knee-bowed and body bent Before thy throne of mercy  --  " The wails subside as the darkies look up at him  --  awe-struck , spell-bound by the resonant , sincere voice . Zeke continues : &nbsp; ZEKE "  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To wipe us from the face of the world  --  Down we 'll go a-singin ' and a-shoutin ' your Name  --  " Catching his fire , his inspiration , his courage , several echo his prayer with " Amen " and " Praise the Lawd " . Zeke continues : &nbsp; ZEKE " But , Lawd , if you can see fit to stop these angry waters  --  An let us be  --  " All are with him now  --  they plead : " Oh , yes Laed " " Stop the waters " Let us be , Lawd " &nbsp; ZEKE " Then , Lawd , we 'll spend our days , In Heavenly praise  --  In reflecting the everlasting mercy of Thy Name . " He lifts his quivering arms to Heaven . He hears the chorus of " Amen " " Hallelujah " " Praise the Lawd " . He feels once again the comfort of the Heavenly Spirit . Then : Illusion or Faith  --  no matter  --  the flood waters reach their height  --  stop  --  stand still/ And the fear-ridden mounders know they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bend low , touch the ground , watering it with their grateful tears . Then a plaintive , feminine voice rings out : &nbsp; WOMAN " Goin ' home , goin ' home , I 'm a-goin ' home . Quietlike , some still day , I 'm jes ' goin ' home . "  --  142  --  The others join in . The song continues without lapse through the FADE OUT and on into the next scenes as indicated by the marginal verses : pp. 90-111 &nbsp; pp. 143-145 583 FADE IN A STREET CORNER Zeke stands at the corner of a building , a guitar slung across his shoulder . The little dog sits beside him . Zeke strums and sings . &nbsp; CH " It 's not far , Jes close by , Through an open door " Impressionistic effect as shadows of passersby fall across Zeke  --  coins roll in at his feet . He thanks them appreciatively . LAP DISSOLVE TO : 584 BACK END OF A RIVER BOAT : NIGHT Amid the freight , Zeke is perched on a bale of cotton . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle about him .

She looks around  --  runs to the edge of the house  --  &nbsp; CH " Dere 's no break , Jes ' a-livin on , Wide awake , with a smile Goin ' on and on . "  --  144  --  589 THE LANE LEADING TO THE SHANTY Zeke turns off the main road and onto the lane that leads  --  home . Mammy sees him , runs a few paces to greet him . He looks at her and smiles  --  his voice quivering slightly . She dances along beside him as he goes over toward the tree . &nbsp; CH " Goin ' home , goin ' home , I 'm jes goin ' home  --  It 's not far , jes ' close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' home  --  Goin ' home . " 590 AT THE TREE Mammy sits down in a big rocker , trembling with joy . Zeke takes his guitar off and then like a little boy , he sits in his mammy 's lap . He feels the soft warmth of her bosom as he snuggles close to her  --  and he knows that his wanderings are over  --  that he is forever protected from the hazards and pitfalls of the world . 591 592 593 594 595 THE WHOLE YARD All the other members of the family come in from the cotton field with big bags of cotton slung over with their shoulders . Zeke rises to greet them  --  they are glad to see him  --  he is glad to be home  --  but the mood is characteristically casual , simple , naive . The person places a chair for the prodigal . One of the kids drops down and begins unlacing his ragged , worn shoes . Another kid drags in a tub of cold water and puts his tired feet into it .  --  145  --  Missy Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food which she gives to him . Another kid runs up with a dipper of water . Zeke looks around happily , laughs , Missy Rose , standing beside him , laughs too . He looks at her  --  his eyes soften  --  then the old teasing glint appears and he reaches down  --  takes up a boll of cotton and throws it in the air . He tilts back his head and blows , keeping the cotton boll suspended in the air for a moment  --  then opening his mouth , he lets it drop inside and snaps his jaws shut and licks his chops . Missy Rose and all the rest are laughing delightedly . Zeke reaches out , and from behind Missy Rose 's head , pulls out a cotton boll . It is the climax they all have been waiting for  --  they shout and laugh . Zeke has come home . FADE OUT END pp. 112-142 &nbsp;
