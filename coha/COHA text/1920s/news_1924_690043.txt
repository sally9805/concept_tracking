txt Fewer and Better Congressmen . To the Editor of The New York Times : The way to make it possible to get men of first-class ability to serve at Washington as Senators and Representatives is - to double their present salaries and reduce their numbers by one-half . All men in the prime of life feel that it is their first duty to provide for the future of their families , and it goes without saying that the salaries now paid our Washington lawmakers are not even sufficient to meet their living expenses there , to say nothing of putting by a surplus . There are too many of them any way . One Senator from each State would be sufficient , and the whole country knows that among the small army or mediocrities who compose the Holum there are but ' few who could be classed as men of outstanding ability . Think of the absurdity of It all  --  the greatest nation in the world , whose stupendous affairs are in the hands of men who are not highly ' regarded by their neighbors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take part in the management of local institutions . And such are the men who have the direction of the affairs of this great nation . The right sort of man wo n't come out and say he would be willing to run for Congress if the salary were adequate . But if - the salary were made really adequate we should be sure of having a Government in Washington that all men would respect . A. T. H. BROWER . Chicago , April 4. 1924.
