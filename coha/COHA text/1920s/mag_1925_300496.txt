At 133 East 61st St. , Manhattan , home of the New York Junior League , there was a debate . The judges were Ethel Barrymore , Alice Duer Miller and Frank Crowninshield , editor of Vanity Fair . The question was : Should a Woman Keep her Maiden Name after Marriage ? <P> The two debaters were Mrs. Heywood Broun , who upheld the affirmative , and Mrs. J. Hartley Manners , who opposed her . Mrs Broun said : " When you are a girl of 21 or maybe 30 and get married , your past life flashes behind you as you are pronounced Mrs. So-and-So and you realize that you are ' Miss ' no more . And this is n't legal , for the law says that you can keep your born name if you want to . " <P> Mrs. Manners said : " I 'm wondering just what we would do if we all demanded the right to keep our own names and the men said : ' Why , yes ! go ahead and be a miss if you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest woman of you . <P> " I asked Mary Pickford how she felt about it and she said , ' You see , Laurette , I 'm so little and our house is so big that I prefer to be called Mrs. Fairbanks at home . It makes me feel more important when I have to speak to the butler . " <P> The judges returned and delivered the following verdict : 1 ) that both the ladies were arguing for the affirmative ; 2 ) that Mrs. Broun won ; 3 ) that Mrs. Manners was the more persuasive .
