Blond Murray Murdock , forward of the Ranger 's New York hockey club , is one of the fastest , most graceful skaters in professional hockey . He seldom scores . Usually , when he has got past the defense and tried a shot he does not follow the puck like his bald teammate , Ivan ( " Ching " ) Johnson , but skates gracefully back , content that he has made an effort . Last Saturday in Boston young Murdock got angry when Indian-faced Hitchman of Boston , wearing a patch of plaster over each eye , had thrown him against the boards . Three times Murdock went down the ice , scored twice in thirty-two seconds , earned his team a tie with Boston , 3-3.
