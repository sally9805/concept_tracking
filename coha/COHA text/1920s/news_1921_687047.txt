txt The Senate late this afternoon , by a vote of 47 to 37 , passed the Borah bill giving to vessels in the American coastwise trade the right of free passage through the Panama Canal . Five hours of debate , much of it spirited , preceded the final vote . It was a defeat for the Administration , party lines being broken , with thirtyfive Republicans and twelve Democrats voting for the bill and twenty Democrats and seventeen Republicans against it . Senator Lodge , the Republican floor leader , fought the bill , while Senator Underwood , the Democratic leader , and Mr. Lodge 's colleague on the delegation to the disarmament conference , supported Mr. Borah . Mr. Lodge told the Senate that in his opinion the enactment of the Borah bill in view of the approaching conference for the limitation of armaments was neither- the part of wisdom nor sound policy . America , he said , had the " legal right " to grant free passage to his vessels , but even the assertion of a " 16a1 rigliC. was unwise when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . " The defense of the bill was led by Senators Borah and Reed , who contended that the purposes sought were largely domestic . in character and for that reason should not be of great concern to other nations . Senator Borah said that Great Britain , if she saw fit , could ask to have the question submitted to arbitration , a course that was suggested by Senators Lodge and John Sharp Williams . Without a roll call the Senate voted . down proposals by Senator King , Democrat , to authorize the President to seek arbitration of the tolls question and appropriating $.2,000,000 subsidy for Amerlean vessels using the canal . Senators Warren and Dillingham , who voted for free tolls in 1914 , voted today against them , while Senator Lenroot who , as a member of the House , voted against in 1914 , recorded himself In their favor . Expected to Be Held tip In House . The bill now goes to the House , where , in the opinion of well-informed members of Congress , it mill probably remain in committee for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way , if not concluded . It is believed that theAdmin- ' istration will exert its full influence to that end . The setback to the Administration was more apparent than real . It was well understood that the bill . iwould Pass the Senate by about the majority that was obtained , and the Administration had taken this into account in its attitude . The President has not been opposed to the restoration of free tolls for American coastwise shipping passing through the Canal , but he feels that this can best be accomplished by diplomatic negotiation with Great Britain . A previous effort of the Administration to adjust the matter diplomatically failed because the British Government refused the American plan to permit the restoration of free tolls for American vestels in consideration of granting the same exemption to Canadian coastwise shipping . Senator . Cummins , supporting the bill . Opened the debate . He said that the United States had the right to pass its vessels through the Canal free of toll . At some future day , he added , it might become the imperative duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on terms more favorable than those accorded to foreign countries . " The possession of a legal right , " said Senator Lodge , who followed the Iowa Senator , " does not necessitate the exercise of that right if there are compelling reasons against such exercise . " Mr. Lodge expressed the opinion that the matter was one for arbitration or negotiation , and he cited the approach of the Conference for the Limitation of Armaments as one of the strong reasons for not exercising the " legal right " at this time . Senator Sterling of South Dakota also spoke against the bill , arguing that the Senate had no right to pass legislation that repealed a contract entered into by treaty with a foreign country . Senator Pomerene of Ohio in opposing the bill said that " after this bill is passes it will be said that we have bartered away the honor of the country for a ship subsidy . " Borah Defends the Bill . " Let us , " said Senator Borah. in the course of his final plea for passage . " understand ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the only way I know of , placing a construction upon this treaty . It may result in a construction favorable to those who are opposed to Ulla bill . I do not know . On the other hand , it may result in a construction in favor of free tolls ; but , however it may result . It is the construction which the American Senate is placing upon the treaty , and in doing se the Senate is engaging in no other kind of an enterprise than that which Great Britain is engaging ? in when she places the opposite construction upon it . " We ' have been criticised today for even assuming to debate this side of the question or to place upon it a construction favorable to free tolls , as If that of itself were a matter of dishonor . " No man upon this floor is going to vote for free tolls who believes that the treaty does not permit it , and the question of honor or dishonor is not involved in this debate at all . Unquestionably , if free tolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty . we have a right to provide for free tolls , and it is in the belief that that is true that we are advocating free tolls . In doing so we are doing nothing different from what the advocates of the other side of the matter are doing , or what Great Britain is doing , in instating that it is not incorporated in the treaty . " " May I ask the Senator , " said Senator Colt . ' If we are not doing something more in the Senate than voting in favor of free tolls ? Is not our action the passing of a statute making the free tolls provision the law of the land ? " Forecasts Arbitration of Question . " It is , " replied Senator Borah . " The subjseet of arbitration has been presented , and with some force . It is a matter upon which the Senator from Rhode Island ( Mr. Colt ) dwelt with his usual earnestness and ability . I have not any doubt but that at some time we shall be called upon to arbitrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considera- ' tion of the Senate this.proposition : " Suppose that it were a matter now proceeding to arbitration . and before the arbitral tribunal it should appear that the last and final construction of this treaty by the American Congress or . by tita ilLmorican Gel/eminent was in. favor of the British contention . What chance would the American representatives have in contending- against a construction which was unchallenged and undisturbed , placed upon the treaty by the American Senate and by the American President ? " I contend that if we are finally going to arbitration , we ought not to go there as we would to a moot court , with the question already decided by both sides , the British contention being that we can not send coastwise vessels through free , and the final construction unchallenged of the American Government that we can not . What would there be to arbi-trate ? " The question of arbitration was before the representativea of this Government just before we began to discuss the act of 1914 . It was being insisted- that we should arbitrate . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Congress , the only official body which could speak upon the subject , had declared in accord with Great Britain 's views , the Ambassador of Great Britain immediately notified our Government that they regarded the question of arbitration as superfluous , arid that there was no occasion for Great Britain to arbitrate anything . " Now I ask the Senator from Rhode Island , if he were presenting as a lawyer our rights under the treaty before an arbitral tribunal , would he not feel considerably handicapped and embarrassed if behind him was an unchallenged construction by the American Senate and the American President that he was wrong in his contention ? " Colt Assails Method Ifsed . " May I say to the Senator , " replied Senator Colt , " that that is not the question before the Senate as to the merits of this question . The only question before the Senate is whether we will pass a statute making our own construction the supreme law of the land. , , I concede the right of the United States to endorse its own construction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are two sides , and that the question Is a doubtful one . I deny the right of the Senate to pass a bill , its own construction of a contract , into the supreme law of the United States . " " It has been said , " Senator Borah resumed , " that it is most unfortunate that this bill should come up at thla time when the great disarmament conference is ahead of us . I should count myself very unfortunate indeed , if by reason of any bad judgment , I should in any way embarrass the work of that disarmament conference . / have never supposed that the disarmament conference would involve the question of the United States bartering away any substantial right which belongs to her domestic affairs . ' It Was rather a new doctrine to me that we could be considered as defending the situation by contending for the construction of the treaty which would give- us control of our domestic commerce . I thought the matter over before I urged the bill , and I talked to those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did not urge the bill net ' ask fora day for voting without a full consideration , a full discussion and a. full under . standing with those who are now primarily responsible for ' what that conference shall do , so far as this country is concerned . I have not gone into this blindly or stubbornly or in disregard of other people 's views . I have endeavored , although some people mean seem to think that that is rather a pe- , culler course for me to pursue , to get the views of those who would be most embarrassed , and I succeeded ill getting them . " I desire to say , therefore , that to my lucrauent the reties which are 411I pressed here are not entertained elsewhere with regard to that matter . " Senator McCormick of Illinois said that the " sole immediate result " of the passage of the measure would be to " give offense to certain of the conferees " who will assemble at Washington at the invitation of this Government to seek a way to bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , " added Mr. McCormick , " it will rebuff the good-will , chill the friendly and generous feeling of peoples who perhaps are readier to join their efforts to ours than are the mere skeptical statesmen who will assemble at the council ' table in Washington . " Senator Watson of Indiana , replying , pointed out that Mr. McCormick was Chairman of the subcommittee that drafted the free tolls plank in the 1920 Republican platform , and that committee , he added , voted the plank into the platform without a dissenting voice . Senator Reed vigorously supported Senator Borah . Ire said that the United States had paid $40,000,000 to the original French concessionaires of the Canal strip . $10,000,000 to Panama and $25,000,090 to Colombia , in addition to a construction cost of about $400 , - 000,000 , It was an American canal , he added . and America had a right to determine how and under what conditions it should be operated . The debate was closed by Senators Kellogg and Willis , both of whom supported the bill .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
