txt Economic depression is one of the reasons for the action of the Irish Government in dissolving the Dublin City Council and replacing it with three appointive Commissioners . Dublin . is staggering under a heavy burden of mass poverty and unemployment , the latter chiefly due to the demobilization of something like thirty thousand soldiers . The Government has managed to find a considerable numIber of jobs for the idle at lower than union wages , but its efforts have been I frustrated by the Labor and Republican factions in the City Council , . who place " principle " above dire necessity . The men themselves are reported willing enough to take work for less I pay , and presumably they will now be / at liberty to do so . If conditions in Dublin are paralleled anywhere else in the British Isles , it would be in Glasgow . The " wild men " from the Clyde . so prominent in the House of Commons , have some excuse for being wild . Glasgow ? has ' been worse hit than any other British city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament last March that while the miners showed an unemployment rate of 2.4 per cent . and the steel mills 3.6 per cent. , in shipbuilding the rate was : 34 per cent. , in marine engineering 22 per cent . and in shipping 21 per cent . Those are truly ? " terrible " figures , as the Minister of Labor called them ; and they are in the , industries by which Glasgow chiefly lives . There is one offset . Dr. MARA pointed out in Parliament last March that while more then 1,000,000 men at that time were registered as unemployed , there were as many men at work as in 1914 . In other words , the unemployment statistics  --  and the British Treasury  --  now take cognizance of large numbers of men who before the war escaped notice , and who in considerable degree are today described as unemployables . They are the unskilled men for whom only the tremendous exigencies of war found employment and who would remain a problem even under a notable revival of trade But obviously the fact that they represent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition reflected in statistics does not lighten the prob lem of the Government or the taxpayer . The main hope of relief lies in. a restoration of Britain 's foreign trade . Relief through emigration , at one time much discussed , has not been noticeable . Under the Empire Settlement act , which came into force in June , 1922 , the Government could have expended , by last March , about ? 4,000,000 . It actually did expend less than ? 400,000 , and succeeded in sending overseas 47,500 persons . This is not " peopling the empire " at a rate commensurate with the needs of the empire or with the situation at home . Canada does expect a larger immigration this year than in any year since 1914 , but the opportunities are chiefly for the agricultural worker . Families taking up lands in Canada under the Empire Settlement act receive a Government grant of f300 , but they must show ? 200 of their own capital , a condition that can hardly be met by the slum dwellers of Glasgow.0 And yet emigration ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. BALDWIN declared two months ago that in his opinion large-scale unemployment had become endemic in Great Britain . A large-scale plan for transferring Britain 's surplus population to the colonies , would seem to be a task worthy of England 's best statesmanship.
