THRESE-Franois Mauriac-Translated by Eric Sutton-Boni &; Liveright ( $2.50 ) . Thrse has just been acquitted of attempt to poison her husband , and on the dismal train jolting homeward she reviews the drab story . True , her husband saved her from conviction , but only for the sake of family reputation , and not because he loved her or ever could understand . How could she explain to him , fat , complacent ? She had welcomed the matter-of-fact marriage that had united her beautiful pine forest so profitably with his . And she had not hated him until her friend Anne fell passionately in love , and showed Therese all that she had missed . Then , fierce in jealousy , she had contrived to ruin Anne 's affair , and slowly , maliciously attempted freedom for herself . With uncanny accuracy French Author Mauriac depicts the passions of a modern woman chafing under the restrictions of old-world landed gentry .
