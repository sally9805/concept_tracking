An investor with $5,000 cash can buy outright about 55 shares of the ' ' average " stock , since the price of all the issues on the Exchange board averages about $90 . Yet this same investor could not purchase even a single share of Manhattan 's First National Bank , which last week rose 1,200 points in two days and reached a quotation of $7,300 a share . As George F. Baker , board chairman of First National , is said to hold 20,000 shares ( there are only 100,000 outstanding ) the 1,200-point rise gave him a paper profit of 24 million dollars . Meanwhile shares in Chase , Equitable , and many another Manhattan bank also enjoyed sensational rises . The bull movement in bank stocks was based on the official ratification of the Guaranty Trust Co. - National Bank of Commerce merger ( TIME , March 4 ) and the resultant activity of rumor-spreaders who busily reasserted and consolidated Manhattan 's banking map . <P> Rumors . Most frequently repeated stories were : That the Guaranty Trust Co. and National Bank of Commerce combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that First National would merge with Bankers ' Trust ; that National City would merge with Equitable Trust Co. ; that Chase National would unite with Brooklyn Trust Co . Then there was a truly robust rumor that linked Guaranty Trust Co. , National Bank of Commerce , Bankers ' Trust and First National in a Morgan-group merger that would be the super bank of all the world . The rumors were all denied and seemed to consist of smoke rather than fire . <P> Guaranty-Commerce . Merger of Guaranty Trust and National Bank of Commerce , however , was officially established with announcement of officers of the combined institution . No name has been given to the combination , though it was reported that the new bank might be known simply as Guaranty Trust Co. , a procedure which would cause Bank of Commerce to pass out of existence in the goth year of its age . As far as merger officers are concerned , Commerce gets the board chairmanship , Guaranty Trust the presidency , as James Strange Alexander , chairman of the board of National Bank of Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will retain their positions with the merged bank . Charles H. Sabin , board chairman of Guaranty , becomes vice-chairman of the board in the new organization . He will also be full board chairman of Guaranty Co. ( the investment subsidiary of Guaranty Trust Co. ) which will function for the combined institutions . The merger appears to have swallowed up 49-year-old Stevenson Ward , Commerce president , who figures in the merged bank only as one of a long list of directors . Morgan influence in Guaranty-Commerce is emphasized by the appointment of Thomas William Lament as chairman of the Executive Committee . In some quarters Mr. Lament ( whose Morgan label alone prevents him from being entitled foremost U. S. banker ) is credited with having virtually arranged the Guaranty-Commerce merger before sailing for Europe to serve on the Reparations Committee. *
