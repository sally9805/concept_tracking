txt // with sulphur was termed , is the one essential process even to-day . Without vulcanization , rubber as we know it would not be possible . A little later , in Mugland , and by wholly different means of experiment , Thomas Ilancock in 1843 discovered the same charaelerislie displayed by sulphur and rubber ; thus about sirriulIaueonrsly in I ; ngl ; urd and America the moderns ma urfaclun of rubber goods began . A. complete change had been brought about by Goodyear  --  a basic process discovered . How he did it and what he did are left for a later chapter . Yet so fundamental was this effect , and so intense his activity that for twenty-five years , from 1835 , the history of the rubber industry is little else than the personal history of Charles Goodyear . An industry based upon a far-reaching idea now took shape . These enterprises that men create measure their periods by ideas and grow with mankind , provided the products they offer render useful service . Rubber could now capably serve ; therefore growth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reap where others sowed . I shall not here discuss Goodyear 's troubles . Some mein were pirates . His patent was infringed , but finally sustained . Then came many companies . Boots and shoes claimed almost exclusive attention of inventors and organizers for years . The first rubber overshoes delivered into this country , in 1800 , were made by the Indians on the banks of the Amazon River ; but to-day the old shoes have given way to the new , and we are protected from the weather by " rubbers . " Rubber boots have come to be a part // of the fisherman 's outfit , and short ones are used by lumbermen ; the liveliness of our tennis matches is in no small part due to the flexibility , lightness , and firm grip of the rubber-soled tennis-shoe . Through vulcanization , rain-coats have changed from tin armor in winter and the melted clothing in summer to a permanent , light , flexible , water-proof , useful commodity . In 1858 the trade in rubber products amounted to between four and five million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise . The Roxbury company was reincorporated as the Goodyear Manufacturing Co. , later to become , as it is still called , the Boston Belting Co . There were many keen men of high purpose and a few pirates . But some notable companies were formed , and many of them are still producing . Three great rubber manufacturing centers slowly developed . There was the New England district where Goodyear began , and the New Jersey centers where several footwear factories began . A number of these companies combined in 1892 to form the United States Rubber Co . The district of Akron , Ohio , began in an equally small way in 1870 . The start resulted from the belief in rubber of Dr. B. F. Goodrich and the enterprise of the business men of the district . Were I at this point to trace the history of rubber goods development , the reader would observe a profusion of inventions offered to the Patent Office ; and , characteristically , many of them were ahead of their time . Ideas were written down , disclosed , or kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades later . // Up to 1879 , however , the industry strengthened ; the value of the products amounted in that year to $25,310,000 . It was truly an era of inventions and business development , for this chemical change called vulcanization had succeeded in making rubber sufficiently permanent to warrant labor by iuvcut.ive genius here and abroad in the creation of articles . In this period were developed the conveyor belts , which to-day are hundreds of feet , long , serving to carry ore from crushers to furnaces for a large number of different purposes . These , together with the elevator belts , have become as essential a part of mining operations as the crushing machinery used in reducing ore to a state ready for furnaces . Rubber has paralleled other inventions . To-day , in the trains which carry us from point to point rapidly and safely , we find rubber in the insulated wire for the lighting , in the air brake , and in the steam-hose between the cars themselves . The " hose pipe " invented by Hancock in England to replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this creative stage , and now the fire-hose has become a most essential development . We might well stop to think what would happen when fire-engines go shrieking down the street if there were no vulcanized rubber in the hose so necessary in the distribution of water to the conflagration . Fire prevention is one thing ; but when a fire is started , hose that will not burst is an essential feature for rapid extinction . One need not run through a catalogue to show how these early ideas have been carried down and improved // for our use ; that will be done with more detail in later chapters . I wish merely to anticipate and to mention , further , how large a part is played by rubber in sport , with its base-balls , golf-balls , tennis-balls , and billiard cushions ; how in the home , floor-coverings , jar rings , garden-hose , fountain-pens , and other articles make life more comfortable . Even in 1899 , these articles were so numerous that the industry had grown to the stature of $49,212,000 in the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid change . Since nothing has quite so greatly stimulated the imagination of business men as the possibilities of the automobile , there is no period of the rubber industry quite so filled with competition and with bubbles that have been blown and burst as the period from 1899 to the present time . When you drive your automobile into the mountains , you give little attention to the part that rubber is playing in making your trip interesting and comfortable . If , however , a tire blows out and you are found fifteen miles from the nearest service station , you consider how necessary a commodity rubber has become at least to that particular expedition . The rubber-tire part of the industry is now a giant ; it serves to carry ten million automobiles upon forty million tires . Figures now astonish us , particularly as we look back and mark the change after even this short period of seventy-five years ; for in 1914 the value of the products of the rubber industry had jumped to $300,994,000 , and it produced in 1919 products to the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period of Akron 's rapid advance . The enterprise of her business men expanded the B. F. Goodrich Co. , and organized in 1898 the Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. , and in 1900 the Firestone ' fire &; Rubber Co. , each of which has now grown to tremendous size , until into this city , to he used by over twenty rubber companies , conies more than one third of the total raw rubber consumed in the world . During these stages of development the indnsl ry prepared for the world war , into which it threw itself with whole-hearted abandon . It is strange how war reacts upon the soldier in the interests of a common cause . The sensitiveness and secretiveness of youth gnVP way before the broader views of maturity . Competitive strife disappeared ; the units of this maturing industry made balloons and compared notes upon the met hods of construction . And it was rubber between two plies of thin fabric that held the hydrogen and kept the balloons aloft . Even in the big guns rubber gaskets were necessary in the recoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves , ea diet ers , tubing , and water-bottles greatly assisted the skilled surgeons in the care of the wounded . Possibly the most notable service performed by rubber products lay in the gas-mask development ? a romance in itself . The gas mask bids fair to become a defensive commodity of the greatest moment in the future . You may find this industrial man not quite " the justice , in fair round belly with good capon lin 'd , " as after a large Thanksgiving dinner . We all enjoyed in the year 1919 the comfortable feeling of satiation . We have suffered the indigestion of youth from overTHE // indulgence . Money flowed into buildings and mate-rials ; however , that stage of growth is happily passing . The factories are ably managed , they have survived the shock of depression , and they go forward to a greater service to mankind . The rubber industry is distinct in its principles of manufacture from any other . We are familiar with the metal group , such as steel and copper , in which chemical changes are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , such as iron , copper , or zinc , is produced . We know that each of them goes to the world in a variety of forms . This group is different from leather , for in that industry an animal product is altered by chemical change in a way that produces a tougher and more serviceable commodity , which later is worked up into a variety of forms . The manifold uses of cotton and the textiles come about from the mechanical purification of vege-table products and the weaving of them into sheets from which artisans create final forms without alteration of the substance which they modify . The great chemical industry , with its dye-stuffs , its caustic soda and sulphuric acid , its nitrogen products , begins its operations with two or more fundamental ma-terials ; and by the proper relations of time ; tempera-ture , and concentration it brings forth to us a great variety of new , different , and pure substances , each of which , as such , is used in a multitude of different ways . The rubber industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different animal , vegetable , mineral , and chemical materials . It chooses a num16 THE REIGN OF RUBBER ber of these to be scientifically acted upon mechanically to produce a mixture . It then forms those mechanical mixtures into the approximate shape of a new and useful commodity . This then is heated to bring about the chemical change , vulcanization . As a result of vulcanization , each of these articles is capable of service . Since by common practice the word " rubber " is not used in its original meaning , as describing the product from a tree , there has arisen a confusion in terminology . Most books and articles upon this subject have begun the story with a description of the preparation of the raw product , the early word for which technically came from the Indian term for the tree : can , meaning wood , and o-chu , meaning to weep ; hence , the word " caoutchouc . " It is probably the rapid growth of caoutchouc products , called rubber before the discovery of vulcanization , which has led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been vulcanized as " rubber . " We also speak of rubber as meaning the raw unvulcanized material . Technically , therefore , " caoutchouc " means raw rubber ; and " rubber " to-day means vulcanized rubber . Throughout this book the meaning will be evident in each case . The rubber industry usually groups its products under the names : mechanical rubber goods , tires , footwear , clothing and proofed materials , druggists ' sundries , and hard rubber . These classes will not be discussed , but rather the story will be written about certain particular ones , representative of the classes most frequently known and used . Each has a story // ciI. ts own ; each is interwoven with a romantic history from the old days down to the present . Since raw rubber exists in a variety of forms and comes from a large number of different places in the world , since also its method of preparation and the story of its growth are chapters by themselves , since , likewise , vulcanization is the one fundamental process necessary to an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not follow the order of chronology , but plunge at once into a discussion of the fundamental processes which have made the rubber industry possible . This will give us a basis of understanding , and the series of short stories of different rubber products will assume that the idea of vulcanization is known to the reader . Our eyes are holden that we can not see the things that stare us in the face until the hour when the mind is ripened . ? Emerson . The struggles of inventors in attempts so to change the properties of raw rubber as to avoid hardening in winter and softening in summer are truly the stories of men who burned their fingers without realizing that fire was the cause . Several of them were close to the solution of the problem , and yet they passed it by . Their failures make one believe that " our eyes are holden that we can not see " until discoveries may properly coordinate with others . A knife cut into the bark of certain evergreen tropi cal trees permits a milky sap to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a dandelion . When it dries , there is left a brownish mass of a firm , tough substance . This is the same stuff that came to Priestley 's labo ratory and was called " Indian rubber . " Frenchmen brought it to Europe , where many enterprising Eng lishmen studied it and the great Faraday analyzed it . Germans experimented . Thomas Hancock writes in 1856 : " It is a singular fact that although this sub-stance had attracted the notice of chemists from the earliest date of its importation into Europe , they 18 // failed to discover any means of manufacturing it into solid masses or to facilitate its solution . " That is a damaging arraignment of chemistry , but we must remember that the era of the chemical engineer had not arrived . In those days the chemist was an analyst whose chief aim in life was to find out what things were made of , not to develop their uses . The grand old man of rubber , Thomas Hancock , owned a private laboratory . Not satisfied with a day 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber in turpentine , and made many rubber articles . Charles Mackintosh , in 1823 , at Glasgow , invented a process for spreading a rubber solution on two pieces of fabric and bringing them together under pressure ; he thus created the double-texture , water-proof garment known even to-day as the mackintosh . Hancock developed a machine for softening raw rubber . He called it a " masticator , " and his first experimental machine held one pound . He invented iron molds ; and , with a brick oven constructed by a bakery-oven builder , he formed blocks of rubber under heat and pressure . A little later , in 1822 , he developed steam-heated vessels and , several years after , a masticator capable of holding two hundred pounds . It is fate that heat was used by him , and that a little later sulphur played its part , but that he did not connect the two . In his most interesting description called " Personal Narrative of the Origin and Progress of the Caoutchouc or IndiaRubber Manufacture in England , " there were many difficulties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Despite the losses and the worries suffered through the effect // of light in decomposing the caoutchouc , he continued to invent new uses for rubber and patented them . He made artificial leather by a combination of cotton and other fibers in a rubber mixture . N uch trouble was occasioned when the tailors sewed rubberized garments together , for water crept through the holes made by the needles . Then , too , because the grease in the woolen cloth was absorbed into the raw rubber and destroyed it , many were returned . IIancock was fortunate in living in England with its equable climate ; for the heat was not great ii- slimmer , or was the cold severe in winter . Consequently , the numerous products from his real inventive genius did not seriously interrupt his profits . I have wondered why he did not employ a research laboratory . Although research in those ( lays was not conceived of as in our generation , he was so far ahead of others that he might well have begun the practice . He may have reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business men do , who seem to feel it advisable to reduce the appropriation for research laboratories during periods of depression . As a result , discoveries have been delayed and opportunities lost because of the lack of a little money expended for research at the right time . Hancock was on the verge of a great discovery , but he lacked just the necessary something possessed by another . While Hancock worked in England , there was some activity in America . In 1833 , in consequence of goods returned because they had melted in the heat of summer , the Roxbury India Rubber Co. was on the verge of dissolution . The firm had sent out products // with nothing done to prove their value except the test of actual service ; it has taken years to develop in the minds of men the fact that in fairness to the consumer tests of quality should precede sale . In the hot rains of August , rain-coats oozed rubber , while mailbags fell apart , and letters were scattered . During zero weather the shoes sent from the Amazon became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An unreliable article was the suspender in those days ; perhaps that is why Americans came to prefer the belt to " galluses . " One day Charles Goodyear of New Haven , Connecticut , a man of thirty-three , passed by the New York store of the Roxbury company . He was not a business man , for he had failed in the hardware and farm implement business . He saw some life preservers . Because he could not help inventing , he designed a new one and returned a few months later to submit his sample to the clerk in the store . The clerk , wishing to do the enterprising Goodyear a service , confided to him the troubles of the Roxbury company . Placing a difficulty in the way of a genius creates the stimulus that ever has brought forth latent activity . Goodyear set to work . Cast into prison for debt , he shaped small test samples of raw rubber with a rolling-pin from the family kitchen . He mixed rubber with lampblack , magnesia , and turpentine . With true research spirit , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open air . A " presentiment of the future " spurred him on , until he became shabby and emaciated . His hands and clothing seemed to be covered continually with India // rubber , and many of his friends tried to dissuade him by telling him that the India rubber business was now below par . At this time some one in New York was asked how he might recognize Mr. Goodyear . The reply was : " If you meet a nnui who has on an India rubber cap , stock , coat , vest , and shoes , with an India rubber purse without a cent or money in it , that is he . " The friends who had backed hiin were ruined in the panic of 1836-37 . I3y treating eiiontelioiic Witli nitric acid , he nearly suffocated himself in 1837 . But nothing can stop genius . When the officials of the Iloxbury company offered to help him with the use of the machinery at their plant , he removed to Roxbury . Although his inventive genius was used in the production of better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1838 , when he became acquainted with Nathaniel Hayward of Woburn , Massachusetts , who was the foreman of the factory of a rubber company that had just failed . Hayward was a practical man . I l e had approached the discovery of vulcanization , but , he had not found it . His contribution to Goodyear was a process for partly hardening rubber by spreading a small quantity of sulphur over the surface of the raw rubber article . Then the mixture was put in the sun to dry . His patent , which was taken out in 1839 , was purchased by Goodyear ; and Goodyear used it in the manufacture of life-preservers . Goodyear was approaching the solution of the problem that so far had seemed the doom of the rubber industry . Several different tales have been told , each of which sets forth the accidental nature of his great // discovery . Possibly the best way to bring to light the truth is to let Goodyear himself explain ; this he does that rare old book " Gum Elastic , " published in 1853 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I shall quote him sufficiently to indicate the creativeness of his mind and the research character of his efforts . He was on a visit to the factory at Woburn , where he had met Hayward . At the dwelling there where Goodyear resided , he made some experiments to ascertain the effect of heat upon the same compound that had decomposed in the mail-bags and other articles . He was surprised to find that the specimens , being carelessly brought in contact with a hot stove , charred like leather . He , however , directly inferred that if the process of charring could be stopped at the right point , it might divest the gum of its natural adhesiveness throughout , which would make it better than the native gum . He was further convinced of the correctness of this inference by finding that India rubber could not be melted by boiling in sulphur at any heat ever so great , but always charred . Other trials were made in which similar fabrics were heated before an open fire ; and the same effect , that of charring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications of ultimate success in producing the desired results , as upon the edge of the charred portions of the fabric there appeared a line or border that was not charred but perfectly cured . " With characteristic ability , he then tried other methods of heating , including steam . That this discovery of curing rubber was no accident , he himself makes // evident when he says : " While the inventor admits that these discoveries were not the result of scientific chemical investigations , he is not willing to admit that they were the result of what is commonly termed accident ; he claims them to be the . remit , of the closest application and observation . " The discovery of rubber vulcanization was made in January , 1839 . Possibly the season was fortunate , because of the ease of performing heat tests near stoves on the inside ; uul because of the severe cold for the weathering tests outside . But Goodyear had by no means finished ; for after his years of want and misery , discouragement and lack of support , he then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the value of his invention and of protecting it from the aggressions of those who now claimed that it was not his invention at all . Dr. Baekeland has well written : " I believe it was George Westinghouse who reminded us that every successful invention passes through three stages : The first , when it is said : Such a thing is absurd or impossible . ' The second stage , after the patent descriptions have become public and have given others the means to imitate and try to find loopholes in the patent claims , begins when it is said : The thing is not new . ' And finally , after the usefulness of the invention has become so obvious and the details connected therewith have penetrated through the hard skulls of the laggards , then it sounds : There is no invention at all . ' " So human inertia held back Goodyear : it was 1841 before he convinced men with money , William Rider // and William DeForest of New York , of the value of his discovery . Shortly thereafter the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was started in Springfield , Massachusetts . Ever secretive , Goodyear was afraid of losing his rights ; and while he obtained protection under a deposition of discovery in December , 1841 , it was not until June , 1844 , that the specification for his original patent was granted by the Patent Office at Washington . Meanwhile , he had sent to England a representative to learn if the secret could be sold to the rubber manufacturers there . Thomas Hancock here takes up the story , in which he describes how in the early part of the autumn of 1842 an assistant of his named Brockedon showed him some sample bits of rubber that had been brought over by a person from America . It was said that cold would not stiffen them and that they were not much affected by solvents , heat , or oils . But business men feared the idea of an inventor : the Mackintosh company told the agent that , as he could give no information , they could not judge of the merits of the invention and they were afraid that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , without a fresh outlay of money . Meanwhile , Brockedon , being interested in stoppers for beer-barrels , was impressed with the suggestion ; he gave samples to Hancock , who at that very time was engaged in a study of methods by which rubber goods could be divested of their adhesiveness and made more permanent . Hancock took the usual industrial competitive point of view and set to work " to match the competitor 's // samples . " Those of my readers who are chemists in the rubber business , will recognize this as one of the daily demands made upon them ; they may be cheered in realizing how this system has been handed down from the early days . We rubber men are victims of our circumstances ; every one of us pulls , bites , and smells new samples . Hancock was no exception . He found in the samples strength , resistance to heat and cold , and a slight ; odor of sulphur . To solve the secret of the new compound , he heated raw rubber in molten sulphur . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hancock promptly patented his discovery in England in November , 1843 . His assistant , Brockedon , termed the process " vulcanization . " Thus , an American discovered the process ; an Englishman named it ; all the world has come to use it . Goodyear had made the short indispensable step in rubber manufacture ; yet his discovery was the objective of pirates , infringers , and guerrilla warfare . His claims , however , were sustained by litigation ; Daniel Webster was his counsel , and Rufus Choate was the lawyer for the defendant . These legal controversies resulted in establishing clearly Goodyear 's priority and led to the extension of his patent for seven years from June , 1858 . As Judge Grier , in giving judgment in 1864 , stated : " Envy robs him of the honor , while speculators , swindlers , and pirates , rob him of the profits . Every unsuccessful experimenter who did , or did not , come very near making the discovery , now claims it . . . . Every man who has made experiments with India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance ; who has heated them in a stove or furnace ; who has annoyed his family and his neighbors with sulphurous gas ; who has set up a rubber factory and failed ; who has made India Rubber goods that no one would buy , or if bought , were returned as worthless , are now paraded forth as the inventors and discoverers of vulcanized India Rubber . . . . We are of the opinion , that the defendant has most signally failed in the attempt to show that himself , or any other person , discovered and perfected the process of manufacturing vulcanized India Rubber before Charles Goodyear . " Poor man , he died in New York in 1860 with debts of more than $191,000 . A brilliant mind , a persistent worker he was , but a life of trouble was his . He was not a money-maker but an investigator . He never belonged to any of the so-called " Goodyear companies , " or has any member of the Goodyear family since his death ever been in the rubber business . The name became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debts were paid and a comfortable fortune was left to his family . But , despite that , there ended pathetically one of the greatest names in inventive history . Emerson has written : " Every action is measured by the depth of the sentiments from which it is produced . " Goodyear 's persistence and his ability , the depth of his driving force , gave to the world the basis from which has sprung this tremendous industrial development of rubber . Thomas Ilancock , with that fairness so characteristic of the English , acknowledged him to be the discoverer . Goodyear was a persistent investigator . He not // only discovered the fact of the rubber-sulphur union with heat , but he developed the range of temperatures from 212 ? to 350 ? Fahrenheit , within which vulcanization can occur . Further , he observed the necessity for removing the material at the end of a suitable time . And to-day the properties of rubber obtained from vulcanization depend upon the amount of sulphur and other substances in the mixture , the temperature at which the mixture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of heat . The whole of rubber compounding practice , which will be discussed in another chapter , is purely one of adapting different materials , different amounts , different times , and different temperatures to accomplish definitely sought properties . Sulphur is as important to the rubber industry as rubber . For while other substances have been found which , adding themselves to rubber , vulcanize it , sulphur is the only one that combines cheapness with the ability to produce high qualities in the resultant vulcanized mixtures . 2641 1 CHAPTER III FUNDAMENTAL METHODS AND MACHINERY The entire rubber industry can be summed up thus : It is the business of making and vulcanizing mixtures the chief ingredient of which is raw rubber . Cotton fabric is necessary to give strength and shape to particular articles , but there would be no rubber goods without rubber mixtures . Mechanical processes serve to form the articles with speed and precision , but mixing is the fundamental process . Even were rubber and sulphur the only substances employed , it would be necessary to have machinery of some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tough raw rubber . Rubber is a plastic ; it is a body that when pushed does not break , but yields slowly . If a block of raw rubber is placed upon a table under a heavy weight , it gradually settles to a position of balance ; that is , it settles until the resisting forces of the rubber counterbalance the downward pressure of the weight . This plastic nature of rubber makes it possible for us to mix substances into it . The earliest known machine used in any type of rubber manufacture was a mixer , called a " pickle " by its inventor , Thomas Hancock . In his early days , about 1820 , Hancock was engaged in the matter of elastic fastenings for garments . He made springy stockings and elastic gloves . 29 // In the course of his work , he accumulated considerable quantities of scraps . He also made elastic bands of rubber by cutting up small thin bottles imported from South America . These bottles had been made by evaporation of the latex upon forms . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of forming them into uniform pieces . His first step was to procure a hollow punch an inch square and to cut out squares of rubber . He then tried pressing the pieces with a plunger in an iron mold . These ideas seeming not to succeed , he invented the first mixing machine . This machine was simply a hollow , round box of wood , with a crank for a handle and spikes upon a cylinder revolving between spikes in the wood about it . By these means , he was able to tear the rubber into small threads . If the cuttings were previously heated and the action was continued long enough , they gradually worked up into a homogeneous mass . Seeing the success of his experiment he went to a firm of machinery builders in England and had them make for him an iron machine of the same character . The improved apparatus he kept a deep secret until about 1832 . Continuously the active Hancock improved and developed this hollow cylinder affair , making it larger and larger and driving it by horse-power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more expressive designation of masticator or masticating machine . The old pickle was slow . Hancock had one made to hold 180 to 200 pounds , but it did not mix dry powders and raw rubber with speed and accuracy . But let us go on to the processes of the modern // rubber factory and follow them along . To-day raw rubber comes chiefly from plantations , clean and ready for the first step in the manufacturing operation . There are , though , scraps from the trees and " wild " rubber from South America . These grades are dirty and wet . Therefore each factory needs a wash-room where the dirty raw rubber may be cleaned . The clean raw rubber needs only inspection . As each sheet is separated from the other sheets in the box , it is easily brushed free from any chips or foreign matter that may have been picked up in the course of transportation . Because the wash-room employs heavy machines , hot and cold water , and steam , it is a sloppy , wet , dirty department . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid bales or lumps of crude rubber into tanks , slightly to soften it with warm water . Then pulling apart the sheets of baled plantation rubber , they pass them between the two rolls of the washing machine known as a cracker . The two steel rolls , placed horizontally and parallel to each other , are corrugated ; and they , to loosen the dirt , grind the sheets in contact with water . The washer , the next machine , has smaller corrugations cut into the rolls , which bite into the rubber and bring to the surface any foreign particles , which are washed out in the stream of water that constantly runs upon the mill . A step at a time , the sheet is corrugated more and more finely , or " creped , " while new surfaces are exposed to the washing action . There are several different kinds of washers , such as two-roll washers and three-roll washers , inclosed // washers , tub washers , beater washers , and various others . But let us go along from the washing room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before any other saubst ; uaee can be mixed with rubber , it must be dry . The wet sheets , which are probably one sixteenth to one eighth of an inch thick , about twenty-four inches wide , and vary in length from six to fifteen feet , are taken on trucks to the dry room . Several different methods of ( trying are used . In the old days , these sheets of rough-surfaced rubber were simply hung up in a room and allowed to dry over a period of time varying from two to six weeks , since raw rubber does not lose its water so rapidly as cotton cloth . They were never hung in the sunlight as we do clothing . In bright light , raw rubber oxidizes and spoils ; therefore the dry room must be dark and free from smoke and dust . Because inventors dislike any six-weeks long process , to speed up drying they forced the air in by fans and carried it out by exhaust . Six weeks dwindled to one . Then came a German invention , the vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe drying . The vacuum apparatus is nothing but a metal chamber with hollow steam-heated shelves in it . The rubber is laid upon trays , slid in upon these shelves , and the door closed . By means of a powerful vacuum pump the air is exhausted . Steam is turned into the plates , and the rubber is heated to a much higher temperature than that used in the air drying rooms . In the presence of a vacuum , though , the danger of deterioration by oxygen is avoided . The temperature // may now be raised considerably higher ; and since water evaporates more rapidly in a vacuum than in the open air , the time required to remove the water from the rubber is reduced to two or three hours . But the vacuum drier did not seem wholly satisfactory for all types and kinds of rubber and for all purposes . In recent years , there has been another method that has entered into rubber manufacture , that of drying in the presence of moist air . It seems a bit singular to dry anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several systems of rooms in which rubber is placed on racks or trays , has been successfully used . The raw rubber dries in twenty-four hours . Really the air is only relatively wet . The water passes to the air because the air is drier . Many advocates of each of these systems of drying are found in the rubber industry . Each system is valuable for different types and grades of rubber to be used for various purposes . We are , however , here interested more in the fact that after the rubber comes out of the sloppy wash-room , it is dried before it goes into the next stage in the process of its manufacture . Now our rubber , whether of one grade or several , is ready for the weighing-out of the mixture . Here we step into the holy of holies of the rubber factory . From the beginning of the industry , rubber plants have carefully guarded the composition of their mixtures ; they are the recipes of the business . Each one of them is made for a particular purpose . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the formulas of any other , each guards its // recipes as something sacred . So careful are they , that the recipe , as it issues from the laboratory to this weighing-out or compounding room , must needs be divided up into different parts by the chief compounder or confidential man . The grades and quality of rubber to be used are written on one card , the dry pigments on another , the reclaimed rubbers on still another , and the sulphur on a last one . In the compounding room the final work of the chemists really conies into play . In this part of the factory great accuracy is required . To be sure , if the manufacturer happens to be a rubber man of the old school , he may call his chemist into the private office and tell him how in the early days there were no chemists and no laboratories . He may even try to convince him that powders were measured by the bucket and rubber by the yardstick . But because the demands made upon rubber goods have become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time . Care is necessary in preparing these various substances other than crude rubber . The dry pigments must be sifted through fine silk screens free from foreign ingredients . The coarse particles , the chips from the bales , or any other accidental substances are thrown into the scrap-heap . The compounding room is one of the places in the rubber factory where purity of substance is accomplished . Obviously , there would be tremendous irregularities in rubber composition were the scales not exact upon which these substances are weighed . At regular intervals , standard weights are taken about the compounding room ; and each set // of scales is adjusted . Although there have been some efforts made to develop automatic scales to weigh the right quantity of a single substance for each of a large number of batches , up to the present time none of them seems to have come into sufficient use to warrant its being considered as accurate or reliable . In the best of the compound rooms , the powders , after sifting , are automatically dropped through the floor into metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bins , which are placed side by side , the operator weighs out the proper ingredients . Conveyor systems are used for handling the boxes , so that the pigment boxes and the rubber boxes move systematically from one end of the room to the other , each receiving the correct quantity of the right substances . When these various substances are accurately weighed and placed in their respective boxes , they are conveyed down to the mixing room , or , as the rubber man terms it , the mill-room . We speak of the masticator , the mixer , or the mill . By common consent , a rubber mill is considered to be that particular piece of machinery upon which the various ingredients of a compound are mixed together in form for the next step in the operation . Edwin M. Chaffee , one of the pioneers of the American rubber industry and a co-worker with Charles Goodyear , was the inventor , in 1836 , of the first iron-roll , steamheated rubber mixer . It was a different machine from Hancock 's , for Hancock kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , but in such fashion that it was compressed between two rollers . From the original Chaffee mixer to the mod36 THE REIGN OF RUBBER ern mixing machine is not a great step in fundamental principle , and Chaffee may be considered the father of rubber factory machinery . , Of different sizes , the largest of these machines today consists of two mixing rolls , twenty-four inches in diameter and eighty-four inches long , set in a heavy frame , and made front either chilled or dry sand iron . One roll has a driving gear operated by a pinion on the shaft underneath , on one side . On the other end of the drive-roll is a gear which meshes into another gear on the end of the front roll . These gears are of different sizes , to give friction or different speeds to the rolls , so that there is a wiping action upon the rubber as it passes between them . This wiping action seems to be efficient in forcing the dry powders into the plastic rubber . Set beneath each of the mixers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masticated and mixed , not all of the dry pigments remain on top or go immediately into the rubber . A good deal falls through into the pan ; and the operator , with a brush and a shovel , gathers this up and shovels it from time to time to the top of the mill . Let us go down into the mixing room and see how a batch of material is mixed . Stand in front of this piece of machinery . The speed of the rollers is not high , ? only a matter of fifteen to twenty revolutions a minute , ? but one gets the impression of great power . Our operator , standing in front of his mill , picks the rubber out of the boxes ; and , placing it in position on the upper side of the moving rolls , pushes it so that it is caught and drawn in between them . With a powerful action , with grinding and screeching , with // the bursting of little blisters as they form , the rubber is carried between these two rolls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as an " apron " brings the rubber that falls between the rolls up again to the top , where the operator pushes it once more over into the space between them . He is protected against accident by an automatic tripper . If he leans his hand against the tripper , the motor will be disconnected from the mill and the resistance of the several mills on the same shaft will cause them all to stop . So our workman , without danger , protected by the best of safety devices , continues to see that the tough , cold rubber is sent back through the rolls . You observe how the rubber gradually softens ; it begins to smooth out in spots . The noise and creaking of it subsides , until , after ten or twelve minutes , it is smooth and clings to one of the rolls sufficiently so that it goes around in the form of a sheet the thickness of the space between the rolls , usually about three quarters of an inch . A little excess of rubber known as a " bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubber is masticated . It has been softened by the friction developed by the two rolls running at different speeds , by the heat generated , and by the mechanical working . When it is thus softened , it is ready to have the dry pigments added . The operator now shovels the dry pigments from the compound box , in which the mixture was brought down from the compounding room , upon the upper parts of the rolls . Some day all rubber mixing apparatus will be equipped with automatic mixers . The workman shovels the // other substances upon the rubber , without knowing what they are , where they came from , or their quantities . Quickly the masticated rubber , as it comes around , catches up a coat of dry pigments . Since it takes a little time for the rubber to absorb these substances , much of the pigments slips through and is not pressed into the rubber . Rubber is a peculiar material ; it can not be quickly forced as machines can force brass or steel ; it yields , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperament ; it can be guided , but only slowly driven . Therefore the workman shovels on the pigments at about the rate that the rubber wishes to eat them up . The sheet on the rollers looks streaked and irregular . After five or ten minutes more have elapsed , though , all the dry pigments will have disappeared ; but the rubber still seems grainy , like wood . At this point it is probably in its most critical state , so far as uniformity is concerned . If this batch in its present condition were to be taken from the mill , it could not yield a product of good quality . There would be more powder in one part of it than another . The sulphur would probably be concentrated at one end . ' The workman is obliged now to perform the final but most necessary operation , that of true mixing , which he does by what we call " cutting back and forth . " With a sharp knife and the skill born of experience , he cuts his rotating , thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably a foot wide is removed from one end of the roll . This strip he quickly throws over across the roll ; thus he transfers // a portion of the rubber from one end over to the other end . When that has passed around , he cuts from the other end a similar long strip and throws it back in the opposite direction . In this way , different parts of the batch are removed from the places where they were and are put in contact with rubber in other parts of the batch . The operator is now a busy man , for he cuts and throws these big ribbons over against the sheet . Back and forth , back and forth , on a large-scale operation , he acts as the druggist when he mixes his pill powders , or the housewife when she mixes bread ; he intermingles all parts of the batch . The rubber is now soft and hot . Temperatures of 180 ? to 200 ? Farenheit are generated by the heat of friction , despite the fact that a stream of cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the express purpose of regulating the temperature of the mixture . So high is the heat of friction that if the rolls were not cooled , the composition would partly vulcanize while mixing . We call this " semi-vulcanization " or " scorching . " Because the mill-room operators must constantly guard against scorching , cold water has come to be a necessity in the rubber industry . I do not mean icecold water . That would be too cold . In the economics of the rubber industry , the location of a rubber factory where good , cool , water , and plenty of it , is found , is as fundamental as that of a location upon a railroad . The technique of mixing is varied ; it is one of the skilled operations of the rubber industry , compositions of different character requiring variation in handling ; // and the temperature of some naturally rising higher than that of others . It is interesting to those who follow the details of the history of the rubber industry to observe how within the last few years inclosed mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hancock masticator was an internal machine , and the Chaffee was made on the external principle . In a limited way , we now again mix in chambers by the internal action of the rotating parts ; this action softens the rubber by working it against the side of the shell that incloses it . When our workman is finally satisfied that the rubber is thoroughly mixed with the pigments , his next step is to remove it from the mixing machine . This he does by cutting a large sheet from the masticator as it rotates in front of him ; he then throws it by a quick movement upon a cooling-table . Here it is allowed to stand for an hour or two until it is cooled sufficiently to avoid a scorching tendency . From this place , it is transported to the storage room , or into the factory where the next operation is performed . It we take a trip around the plant , we logically go from the mixing room to the department where the rubber is made ready for the forming operation . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied upon fabric by means of a spreading machine . This machine was constructed to permit a sheet of cloth to pass over a rotating cylinder , above which hung a flat metal bar called a knife or doctor blade . The blade was accurately adjustable . So close could it be set to the fabric that it permitted only a thin film of solution to pass between it and the fabric . // Thus a thin layer of rubber cement could be applied to cloth . One day in 1835 , Mr. Chaffee went to the directors of the Roxbury company , saying he could save them the expense of the solvent that they had been using by the old process , which , by the way , cost them about fifty thousand dollars a year . He was instructed to build the necessary machinery . The invention of the calender machine resulted . His coating machine was called the " monster " or the " mammoth , " on account of its dimensions . It weighed about thirty tons , and was finished toward the end of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxbury India Rubber factory purchased from Mr. Chaffee his entire interest in the " monster . " But during the month of October , 1843 , the huge machine was sold at a public auction for only $525 to John Haskins , who at the same time purchased a patent on it for $1.50 ! During the year following , 1844 , Haskins disposed of the " monster " to Charles Goodyear , who later transferred it to the Naugatuck India Rubber Co . A calender is simply a machine with three or more heavy steel rolls set parallel to each other , in such a way that when the soft , warm , unvulcanized rubber mixture is fed against the space between two of the rolls it will be forced between them in a thin sheet . This is called a sheeting calender . Likewise , when it is desired to apply rubber to cloth , cloth is drawn between the rolls , which are separated far enough so as in no way to crush the fabric , and which push the soft rubber into and around the threads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " friction calender , " and the operation " frictioning . " In the parlance of the trade , we speak of the compound as the " friction " and the cloth as " frictioned fabric . " In other machines , the cloth , after frictioning , can have a coat or layer of rubber applied upon it . For tire fabric purposes , we are accustomed to speak of " friction and coated fabric , " or " friction and skin coat . " If in the calender room we stand in front of one of these machines , which are from seven to ten feet high , we find masses of rubber compound , as they run from the rolls , taking the shape of sheets . To keep them from sticking to each other , they are wound up with cloth or " liners " to separate them . The sheets issue from the machines at considerable speed , and are whirled into rolls , which are carried to the various other parts of the factory on hand-pushed or electric trucks . Many other machines are employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those described are the essential ones . The manufacture of rubber goods may be likened to a tree . Thousands of materials ? raw rubber , powders , sulphur ? are the roots . These are combined in the trunk , through a few basic methods . The millroom , where mixing is done ; the calender room , where the first process of forming is accomplished , are the steps essential to manufacture . The final step of forming and , last of all , vulcanization , are carried on in the several divisions of the factory within which the special articles are produced . They are the branches of our tree . // Rubber mixtures are the basic materials ; the chemist formulates them ; cotton cloth and these mixtures are put together in forms and shapes by the designing engineer who creates articles ; and , to manufacture them expeditiously and uniformly , the inventor and production engineer must invent and use many kinds of machinery . The rubber industry , therefore , stands on three legs ; the mixture , the design , and the machine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , 1 am a cook and a captain bold , And the mate of the Nancy brig , And a bo'sun tight , and a midshipmite , And the crew of the captain 's gig . ? Gilbert : " The Yarn of the Nancy Bell . " The old-fashioned rubber superintendent was a versatile chap . From dawn on , there came to him for decision essentially all the manifold problems of the rubber factory . Personally he selected the laboring men ; he was the power engineer , and if the coal was bad , it was his duty to keep the plant running . He figured costs and made prices . A chemist also , he wrote the formulas or recipes for the various mixtures used in the goods manfactured . He was even the first-aid doctor ; since in the early days machinery was not surrounded by the safeguards that we find to-day , and many a man whose hand was caught in the mixing mill was carried to the superintendent 's office for first-aid dressing . In many cases , he was a salesman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inventor and a promoter , he labored . Truly those were strenuous days for the superintendent . I once talked to one of those men , long since retired from active participation in rubber factory work . He 44 // told me how the mixtures of rubber , which we call by the name of " compound , " were studied in his office . By means of a little piece cut from a sheet with a pair of shears , he tested the quality . This fragment he twisted , pulled , and worked in his fingers . Finally allowing it to come to rest , he examined it , to see how much longer it was than the original piece from which it was cut . The ease of pulling , the " feel , " and the additional length were prime factors in determining the quality of a particular mixture . Even teeth were trained to bite pieces from a specimen , the resistance to the bite being a measure of its strength . A testing laboratory was ever with him in the form of fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the compounding room were employed only most reliable men , known for honesty and loyalty . A recipe was a great secret of master importance . Before long , however , ambitious youths came to realize that quality as produced by good formulas was the basic principle on which the success of a given rubber plant was built . Therefore many of them left , taking with them the secrets ; and competition rapidly grew . To-day , with the coming of the chemist , a different tone has been given the industry ; no longer does the rule of thumb method apply . No longer is it necessary for competing institutions to worry much about the compositions used in the factories of each other . There has come in these recent years a fuller understanding of why various materials act in particular ways when used in rubber mixtures . The chemist , the physicist , and the engineer have brought real // knowledge into rubber making . To promote such knowledge , each of the larger rubber companies has organized laboratories , in which highly trained chemists study new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn how each material performs in a rubber mixture . There are testing laboratories , too , where each rubber composition may be studied and where each new product may be tested in terms of actual service . The rubber that you see in the form of a rubber band , the heel that you wear upon your shoe , or the tread of a pneumatic tire , is not just a simple vulcanized mixture of rubber and sulphur or is it so simple a composition as the combination of rubber , sulphur , and white lead used by Goodyear . The compositions are much more complicated than they formerly were . In the course of the evolution of this industry has come a revised point of view , so that to-day each substance used in a mixture is there for a particular purpose . The field of substances from which the rubber chemist chooses those for any desired compound is extensive . In one of the large rubber factories , five hundred raw materials , known as pigments are used . Pigments are dried powders , such as zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various types , carbon black from natural gas , and so on through the long list . Even crude rubber has ceased to be of one or two grades . It has become fifty different types , with different sources , methods of preparation , degrees of hardness , physical properties , and workability . The factories use between fifty and one hundred grades known as reclaimed rubber , which is the result of procTHE // essing previously vulcanized rubber products that have ceased to perform their usefulness ? scrap tires , old shoes , and the like . The rubber chemist , therefore , has come to know intimately many thousands of materials . Like a good cook , he must understand by experi ? nce what each one will do in his mixtures ; and , like a highly scientific investigator , he must know accurately if the results will be worthy of production and sale . In the refinement of his business , he has become , therefore , a sort of highly sublimated chef ; and his formula books are the cook-books of rubber . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite differently from the cook in the home ; for , if she has something new to make , she works it out in the form of a real mixture on the kitchen table , putting in a pinch of this and a little of that , using her experience as a guide . In the rubber laboratories , systems have been developed so that the chemist does not himself weigh out his mixings ; instead , he writes his formula or recipe in his office . Here are his books of reference , his samples of raw materials . If we follow the formula written by this chemist from his office through the various changes of its manufacture and test , we shall go to a laboratory , in which are little machines the same in principle as those in the great factory . Here we obtain the fundamental information that is expressed on larger scales in tires , shoes , and other articles . Our chemist may show us how he would make an inner tube for an automobile tire . Inner tubes must hold air , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease without tearing . A typical formula would probably be : rubber of the highest grade , one hundred parts by weight ; sulphur powder , five parts by weight ; zinc oxide , three parts by weight ; and an accelerator such as hexamethylenetetramine or , as the doctor knows it , urotropin , one half of one part by weight . Written on a card , this formula is sent into the laboratory compounding room . In this room works the reliable old employee , who accurately weighs these ingredients and places them in a tin box that is carried out into a room where operate a number of little mills , calenders , and vulcanizers . Were our formula to be mixed on the full factory scale , it would have appeared , before that process , very much as it does in the photograph . For purpose of test , it is customary in the laboratory to vulcanize such a compound in the form of a sheet . In the photograph of the hydraulic press you will notice two flat plates or platens with a little table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down by hydraulic pressure . Upon the table lies a mold , which is , in point of fact , a simple metal frame , made to retain within a definite length , width , and thickness the rubber to be vulcanized . The workman removes the rubber from the mixing mill for testing purposes in the form of a sheet of fixed thickness a little more than that required in the mold . After he places the cover upon it and slides it in between the two press plates , he turns on the hydraulic pressure ; then the mold is squeezed , and the soft rubber compound fills the cavity of the mold . Rubber , being a soft plastic and flowing slowly under pressure , is not melted as // iron is melted when cast into various shapes in the foundry . If we were to try to melt it , a useless product would result . In the mold there is always a little extra volume of rubber , which flows out into grooves and which we call the overflow , rind , or flash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid , unblemished piece . To furnish heat , steam is passed through the hollow platens or the plates of the press . The particular composition that we are discussing would probably vulcanize in forty-five minutes , with press plates at a temperature of 290 ? Fahrenheit . To be sure , an inner tube would not be cured between plates in this way ; the formation of a tube we shall discuss in another part of the book . In performing a test to determine the properties of this composition after vulcanization , the chemist would not simply pull it by hand , as the old-time superintendent did . He might , it is true , observe differences in the amount of force necessary to pull out such a piece a definite distance ; but such a test would not give data accurate enough to distinguish between compositions of various kinds , with materials in different proportions . Therefore the rubber chemist , after removing the vulcanized rind , takes his cured piece into the testing laboratory . Here are machines and apparatus designed particularly to test rubber . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance , we must allow for length of pull in our test machinery . Steel stretches but fractions of inches before it breaks ; rubber , six , eight , to ten times its original length . It thins down as it elongates . Specially made // jaws automatically contract against the piece of rubber to be tested and prevent it from slipping out . Let us watch the test piece in the laboratory . On the machine there is a dial to indicate the number of pounds required to pull the piece a definite distance . The operator marks lines two inches apart upon the piece . When the rubber breaks , the distance of separation of these two marks gives him a definite figure that he calls elongation , or stretch . Of late years , the chemist has been accustomed to draw a picture of the course of this testing . As you stand in front of the machine , you will notice at once that the rubber piece stretches considerably with but little increase in the number of pounds indicated on the dial or the chart ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it resists more and more further distortion . The little picture being drawn will show us the force required to do the stretching . Known to the chemist as the " stress-strain , " or " force-stretch " curve , it portrays the relation inch by inch between the elongation of the rubber and the force producing it . Thus rubber writes its own autobiography , from the reading of which our rubber chemist is able to determine a good deal of its value ; he is able to determine particularly the differences in the values of substances to be used in the mixings . In the formula an " accelerator " is used . Let us concentrate our attention upon this substance for a moment . Charles Goodyear might not have succeeded in taming rubber had he not used in his mixture a mineral powder known as white lead . Without white lead , the mixture would have taken so much longer a // time to vulcanize that he might not have observed , at least so quickly as he did , the change in the properties of the rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortens the time of vulcanization , we call it an accelerator . The combination of raw rubber and sulphur by themselves would require several hours under heat before enough sulphur would be com bined to give snappiness and the other properties of vulcanized rubber . When white lead is used with the rubber and sulphur , however , this time is reduced // to a short period . It happens in this particular case that white lead itself changes in the presence of sul phur from a white to a black substance because , as the chemist will tell us , of the formation of lead sulphide , which is black . These accelerators seem to serve as stimulants to the combination of sulphur and rubber , just as when you place your foot , on the accelerator of your automo bile , you permit more gas to flow into the cylinders , and your automobile increases its speed . In a like manner , when accelerators are used in the rubber mix ture , a more rapid flow or combination of sulphur with the rubber takes place . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are widely used in chem ical processes . The making of sulphuric acid re-quires the use of catalysts in order that the combina tion of sulphur dioxide and oxygen may take place not only within reasonable lengths of time , but with suf ficient completeness to make the process one of com mercial value . In the rubber process , the catalysts themselves change somewhat ; yet the definition is broad enough to include any substance which facil itates the course of vulcanization . The first cat alyst , or accelerator , was the white lead used by Good-year . For many years only such mineral substances were used . Litharge or lead oxide aided in making many of the best tires produced in this country . Lime , magnesium oxide , and others have been and still are common in rubber manufacturing practice . Within the last few years publications have been setting forth the details of this ultra-secret phase of rubber compounding . The better-trained chemists // have come to use synthetic organic chemicals as accelerators , for they have found them remarkable in powers of action and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dreamed of before . The organic compounds are , in the majority of cases , products derived from chemical processes upon coal-tar . They are related to the organic dyes , many of which are good accelerators . Some of them are drugs , the one used in this formula being of that type . Only a small amount of these organic accelerators is necessary . Of the old inorganic , or mineral , ones , such as white lead , formulas required from 5 to 15 per cent . by weight ; these new substances employed so largely in later years , however , require less than 1 per cent . to give even more active acceleration . They seem also to increase the strength of the rubber and its resistance to abrasion , to heat , and to oxidation and aging . The discovery and first use of the organic accelerator was nearly as great a step forward as that of vulcanization . To make history reliable , one must mention at this point the name of a most able man of the younger generation , Mr. Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To them goes the credit for the first introduction of a typical organic accelerator in commercial rubber manufacturing practice . In 1906 the records of the Diamond Rubber Co. , of Akron , Ohio , later combined with the B. F. Goodrich Co. , show that they first employed aniline oil as an accelerator of vulcanization . Because of its poisonnou.s nature , this substance had one disadvantage . It is quite natural , once Mr. Mark 's mind turned in this direction , // to find him making every effort to determine the properties of other organic substances that might vulcanize rubber with equal speed , furnish equal strengthening properties , and be free from poisonous characteristics . This was too secret a matter to permit of publication . As a result , these men have up to now never received public credit for this tremendously potent advance step in rubber manufacture . In 1912 , however , some Germans patented in this country a considerable number of organic substances for this purpose . Once these disclosures were made , chemists in the rubber business went ahead with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic accelerators in current use . It is safe to say that there is scarcely a rubber mixture that does not contain as an essential ingredient some such substance . Of the many processes and substances that have increased the efficiency of automobile tires , no one of them deserves greater credit than the organic accelerator ; it has so greatly improved the quality of rubber mixtures that tires run much longer by virtue of it . The autobiographies , called curves , strikingly show the gains attained by these substances . Without an accelerator , a time of two hours is needed to vulcanize a rubber-sulphur mixture ; the strength attained is but 1150 pounds per square inch ; the piece stretches 6 ? times . Add one half of 1 per cent . of accelerator and a little zinc oxide to hustle the accelerator , and the mixture vulcanizes in one hour , the finished product showing a strength of 2760 pounds and a stretch of 63/4 times . If these tests of mixtures were the only ones used // in making rubber products , the operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be simple . The current belief probably is that any substance other than rubber and sulphur used in tires or rubber shoes is employed to make them cheaper . This is far from the case . Hardness and resistance to abrasion are properties needed for some articles and not for others . If a solid tire for truck service were to be created by vulcanizing the composition that I have just given , it would be soft and flexible ; it would tear with ease and be of slight value as a tire . Subject to choice , for the purpose of increasing the resistance of finished rubber to abrasion , are a large number of substances ; but I shall use , as an illustration , zinc oxide . This substance is a dry , white powder that has for years been used in the manufacture of white paints . In one form or another , milady uses it for whitening her summer sport shoes . It has some use as a mild , non-acid base for ointments . Despite the large number of zinc ores throughout the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield good zinc oxide for use in rubber compounds . Peculiarly , there are but few zinc ore deposits in which lead ores are not mixed with the zinc . Freedom from lead is an important chemical characteristic of the zinc oxide to be used in the rubber trade . So important is zinc oxide in rubber mixtures , so valuable are the properties given to rubber compounds by it , that the industry in 1919 consumed 71,000 tons of this substance . Let us write another formula , in this case consisting of zinc oxide one hundred parts by weight , sulphur five r // parts , plantation raw rubber one hundred parts , and the accelerator hexamethylenetetramine one part . The photograph shows the relative volumes of these substances after they had been weighed out . The new compound cures in about the same length of time , forty-five minutes , at a temperature of 290 ? Fahrenheit , as did the other . The autobiography of the test specimen though , is quite different . It is harder ; more force is needed to stretch it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 3400 pounds to the square inch is required to break it . It resists abrasion better . The chemist and physicist , who must really be the same individual in the rubber testing laboratory , measures another property , the energy stored in rubber when it is stretched . Engineers compute work in terms of resistance to lifting weights- against the force of gravity . If one pound of a material of any kind be lifted one foot the engineer and physicist call the work done the foot-pound . When our rubber test piece was stretched in the machine , it was necessary for the machine to perform work upon it . From the autobiography or stress-strain curve , a definite meaning regarding an interesting property of rubber is obtained . This stretched piece has a strong desire to return to its original length . That is why it is rubber . If you stretch wood and steel , they also have a desire to return ; but the distance you can stretch them without destroying that desire is very small . Rubber , however , is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windmill . He goes up quickly at first ; and then much slower as he gets near the top . His feet // lag toward the end ; his enthusiasm seems to die . Rubber acts in much that way . Yielding easily to a light load in the beginning , more and more force must be exerted to perform the work of stretching it to its maximum distance . Engineers say that whenever any substance is lifted above the ground against the force of gravity , there is stored in it a certain amount of energy some of which can be regained in the form of useful work by machinery properly designed . Although rubber is not stretched against the resistance of gravity , the work performed is done against the desire on the part of the rubber to return to its original length . From our chart we are able to measure the amount of this work or energy in the engineer 's unit of foot-pounds and to compare the amount of stored energy in the rubber with the amount that may be stored in other substances . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal condition . Steel , for instance , may be stretched but a short distance and still return nearly to its original length . If steel be stretched beyond that short distance , which is measured in small fractions of inches , it can not return . This limit of stretch beyond which substances can not return has been called , in our books of physics , the elastic limit . Thus , if a bar of ordinary steel one inch square and of a length sufficient to be placed easily in a testing machine have applied upon it a force of 40,000 pounds , it can be pulled out only about one-hundredth of an inch ; from this extension it will return to its original length . To break the piece , however , would require // 68,000 pounds ; the same force would stretch it about four one-hundredths of an inch . Thus , any load upon this test piece of steel between 40,000 and 68,000 pounds is too great for it to bear and still return to its original dimensions . For almost all metals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to break the piece . Rubber is singular and different from other substances in the fast , that its elastic limit and breaking point coincide . One can stretch a piece of rubber to any distance under its breaking point ; and when the load is removed , it promptly returns to approximately its original length . This slight increase in the elongation after stretch and release , known as the " permanent recovery " or " permanent set " or " permanent elongation , " is a characteristic of all rubber articles . On long standing , this permanent recovery gradually becomes less and less ; and it varies widely in rubber mixtures of different composition . The ability of rubber to store energy is great ; that is , we may pull rubber to nearly its breaking point . If it were possible to harness this energy so that useful work could be performed , we should find a relatively large amount of it stored in rubber . If , in a machine , one pound of tempered spring steel be stretched just to the elastic limit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in section and weighing one pound to be loaded with 82,000 pounds , one can store in it 95.3 foot-pounds of energy . Hickory wood when pulled along the grain is elastic enough to permit the storing of 122.5 foot-pounds at its elastic limit . In this way , our pure gum rubber compound , // without the accelerator that we have already described , would permit us to store in it a matter of 3186 footpounds . However , with the accelerator , we can store 7633 foot-pounds ; the zinc oxide composition , on the other hand , would store 7988 foot-pounds . But , you protest to the chemist compounder , most rubber articles are not white ! Tire treads are black ; at least , they are that color when the gray bloom is rubbed off . Heels and shoes are usually black . If zinc oxide is so valuable a material , why use any other dry powder ? Then all articles would be white except those articles where other colors were desired . But you would not be quite happy were the rubbers you wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are deliberately made black . However , a discovery in this field was made which brought into use a material that was formerly well known , but that entered rubber in a new way . Carbon-black is a soot made by incomplete combustion of natural gas ; it is composed of very fine , light particles . Let us now make a new formula in which this black dust is used , to see how it compares in physical properties with the others . This will lead us to the reason for its wide use in the rubber industry . A formula composed of rubber one hundred parts by weight , zinc oxide three parts , gas-black thirty-five parts , sulphur five parts , and the same accelerator one part , is a good one . If this composition be vulcanized , we find relatively little change in the time of vulcanization . When its autobiography is inscribed on the chart , we find that with a cure of seventy-five minutes at 290 ? Fahrenheit , a load of // twelve hundred pounds has stretched the piece only a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly four thousand pounds to the square inch is needed to break it ; and under this load , it has stretched to 5.5 times its length . The mixture is therefore stiffer and stronger . The piece stores 14,887 foot-pounds . In weight it is very much lighter than the zinc oxide mixture ; as we find , on measurement , that the specific gravity of this particular mixture is only 1.09 , a figure which means that the weight of a cubic foot is sixtyeight pounds ; the zinc oxide mixture with a specific gravity of 1.56 shows a weight of a cubic foot to be ninety-seven pounds . In the formulas approximately the same volume of zinc oxide and carbon-black was specified . Zinc oxide is heavy and dense , and so a cubic foot of the compound weighs more than that which contains black . The gas-black formula will wear away less readily than the others . Since this substance produces radical improvement in the physical properties required for wearing qualities , it is valuable in the treads of automobile tires . The gas-black tread has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon-black composition would be worthless ; it generates heat as it is stretched back and forth . In masses of rubber it becomes a heat insulator , and compositions in which it is used become very hot in service . Without organic accelerators , though , gas-black compositions are too " dead " for practical use ; with the accelerator and with zinc oxide , they are valuable and economical . Zinc oxide alone gives a strong but more resilient composition . // Each of these two substances then has its own particular properties , and the chemist uses them to improve the compositions . We could not do without either of them . They are the royal family of the rubber pigments . Each rubber chemist chooses which one of them is to be the king . One thing is perfectly sure : the addition of dry mineral powders is necessary to obtain valuable properties in rubber mixtures for different uses . It would not be wise to say that all dry pigments used in rubber mixtures should be only zinc oxide and gas-black . If that were the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less service than they now do , as each pigment has its own particular value and each one is used in rubber for the service that it renders . We may mention other materials : such as mineral rubber , a material derived from pitch and soft , flexible , mineral hydrocarbons ; rubber " substitutes , " resins and many others . I shall not at this point discuss reclaimed rubber , a valuable substance made in the recovery of old vulcanized tires , shoes , and so on . Since the saving of waste is a most vital part of industry and human management , it would be folly for a great industry to permit the total loss of these waste products . Old iron goes back into the melting pot and is reworked into various articles . So the rubber industry has succeeded in reclaiming its vulcanized products after they have performed all the service possible . Colored goods introduce another phase of rubber compounding . It seems that the human race demands // artistic products . To meet this demand , our waterbottles are made red by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ultramarine blue , greens by chrome greens , and white by proper quantities of zinc oxide or lithophone . So I might decribe probably fifteen hundred different materials that go to make up the twenty to thirty thousand articles that are the result of rubber manufacture . A versatile individual must be the rubber chemist ; for he must understand their sources , composition , and properties . He must know a great deal about how each of them affects rubber mixtures . In the choice of substances , he combines them to give valuable properties . He must make compositions to withstand the action of heat , as in the layers which separate the plies of cotton in automobile tires ; and , too , he must make them to contain air , as in inner tubes , to resist abrasion , as in solid tires and pneumatic tire treads , and to be permanent in balloons under the action of light and oxidation . Some must not swell in oil . He develops special mixtures for steam-hose and steam-packing . Throughout the whole line , it is special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber necessary for the best service to the consumer . CHAPTER V RAW RUBBER The ups and downs of rubber during its history convince us of its elasticity . Until approximately four hundred years ago , litf ( ( . as Israox , i of it in the economy of human life . With relative rapidity it rose into an important position ; it ascended to heights of speculation . Rubber booms came , and rubber bubbles burst . It has dropped to the depths of economic depression , but again rebounded ? a varied history and an interesting one . Columbus seems to be the European who first saw in the Americas a peculiar elastic substance . On returning to Europe after his second voyage , he told about it . Subsequent travelers made records of the substance . Antonio de Herrera Tordesillas , one of the most prominent historians of Spain , writing in 1615 " The General History of the Voyages of the Castilians in the Islands of America , " evidently loved a ball-game , for he says : - The ball was made of the gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having holes made in it distils great white drops that soon harden , and being worked and moulded together turn as black as pitch . The balls made thereof , though hard and heavy to the hand , did bound and fly as our 63 // foot-balls , there being no need to blow them . . . . They might strike it every time it rebounded , which it would do several times one after another , in so much that it looked as if it had been alive . He alludes to the natives of Tierra Firme , who " on their festivals , painted or daub 'd themselves with a sort of clammy gum , sticking on it feathers of several colors . " F. Juan de ' 1orcyucmacla , in tli , third volume of his " De La Monarquia Indiana , " of which the first edition appeared in 1615 , describes the Mexican Indians as making shoes , head-gear , clothing , and other watertight articles of the gum of a tree . The actual introduction of any useful articles into Europe seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixteenth century by the Portuguese . In 1736 , in company with Bouguer and Godin , La Condamine , a French savant , was sent by the king of France to South America for the purpose of measuring a degree of the meridian . On their return journey to Europe , these men brought the first specimen of caoutchouc from Peru , by way of the Amazon River . La Condamine reported having also found this " most singular resin " to the north of Quito in Ecuador , exuding from a tree named hove or hyeve . It was called pao de xyringa by the Portuguese colonists . The result of his observations was published in the " Transactions de 1 ' Academie des Sciences , " wherein he described the various methods of collecting the juice and // of treating it for the production of many useful articles . Herissant and Macquer published in 1761 , in the Memoires de l'Academie , " the results of the first chemical investigations of India rubber solutions . hive years later , Macquer reported fully on the means of dissolving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coating forms , so that they retained a covering of the gum after the evaporation of the ether . In 1759 the government of Para presented to the king of Portugal a suit of rubber clothes ; four years previously he had sent several pairs of his boots to Brazil to be waterproofed . One of the Portuguese drank some of the milk , but his stomach did not care to be waterproofed and he passed on to his fathers . An Italian engineer suggested in 1791 the suitability of petroleum as a solvent ; but he was ahead of his time , for that substance did not come into general use until as late as 1860 , with the exploitation of the American oil-fields . But on May 2 , 1791 , Samuel Peal was granted in England the first known caoutchouc patent . It was for a method of rendering " perfectly waterproof all kinds of leather , cotton , linen , and woolen cloths , etc . " His coating consisted of India rubber dissolved " by distillation or by infusion in a small quantity of turpentine over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in most kinds of oil ; or of Indian rubber used in its native fluid state . " Samples of this crude rubber coming into England found their way into various laboratories , where // the great chemist Priestley examined them in 1770 . What is this raw rubber ' ? If you were so to travel around the world as to allow yourself journeys into tropical countries , at almost any point 250 miles on either side of the equator you would find growing wild in the jungles certain evergreen trees , vines , and even shrubs which , when the bark is broken , give forth a whit ( milk This milk , which we might naturally call sap , or technically latex , if allowed to stand in the air and evaporate , leaves a brown residue . The residue is raw rubber . The milk comes from glands in the inner layers of ? the bark . From more than five hun-dred individual species in this great group of milk-producing trees can be obtained , after evaporation or other treatment , the brown , elastic substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those mentioned by La Condamine ; the botanist named the species Hevea brasiliensis , a modification of the original . Naturally , after the discovery of the trees in South America and the knowledge of the wonderful properties of the rubber left after evaporation on shoes and fabrics , the South Americans pushed forward the making of rubber for export to Europe , where com-mercial development of the product was progressing . So in 1825 Brazil exported thirty tons of this dark brown material from the rubber-trees . In 1850 the exportation had jumped to 1467 tons , and in 1897 to 21,260 tons . In the jungle these wild trees of the Hevea brasili-ensis species grow to a height of seventy-six to one hundred feet and measure from lour unu one half to twelve feet in circumference . The restriction of the // branches , which are small , largely to the crown of the tree gives , as do the pine-trees from which turpentine is obtained in our Southland , a large area of bark for tapping . Where the temperature averages about sev-enty degrees Fahrenheit and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish . The natural transportation lines in these aboriginal countries are along the rivers ; consequently , the areas exploited in collecting rubber in South America have been along the Amazon River and its tributaries . Here , the native rubber tapper leads anything but an easy life . The jungles are dense , overrun by in-numerable vines and creepers , and filled with snakes , tarantulas , and poisonous ants . Since the flood sea-son occurs from November to May , during which time the rivers overflow their banks , the rubber tapper is obliged to spend his time in his hut , which is built on piles above the water . During the rest of the year or the dry season , vegetation is luxuriant . Innumerable swamps from which fevers and disease come , though , add to the discomforts of this poor native . He rises about four in the morning , while it is still dark , and starts out into the forest , with a small hatchet and a tin bucket . On the first of two trips around his territory , with the hatchet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting flow of sap or latex runs down the tree and into a little tin cup below the gash . In order to make his living , it is necessary for the rubber tapper to cover a large ter-ritory by winding paths . Breaking his way through the rapidly growing vegetation in the jungle , he taps and collects latex from seventy to one hundred trees iu // the course of a day . After he has properly tapped the trees in his territory , he goes back over it and pours the milk from the little cups into his tin bucket . His milk collected , he comes back to his hut which , during the dry season , is usually a temporary one on the ground . While he prepares his meal , he lights a fire made from wood and specially collected palm nuts . Over this fire he places a conical , baked clay flue to concentrate the smoke . Obtaining a dense , hot smoke , he begins the work of preparing the raw rubber for market . He warms a long stick or a paddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This he rotates in the smoke until the milk has dried on the stick . Again he pours the milk and again he dries it over the fire . If he is not a yxia ed at the outset of the performance , he keeps at it , building up layer after layer of evaporated rubber until a mass is obtained nine or ten inches in diameter and about eighteen inches to two feet in length . This forms the biscuit of wild rubber called " fine path " seen in our markets . Weighing about sixty to eighty pounds , it constitutes a day 's work for the tapper . It smells like fine old Virginia ham . At the end of the day , which for him is about three in the afternoon , he may be found in his hammock , with sore eyes , parched and smoked face , bitten by insects , and covered with soot . It is no wonder that we find a high death-rate in the Brazilian swamps and that there has been from the beginning a steady deterioration in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dry season , for the tapper can not work at all during the wet or rainy season , he collects // and binds together the product of a year 's work , and floats it down the river to the nearest chief , who accepts it in payment for money previously advanced . The Brazilian rubber industry was important for ? a considerable number of years , but the history of it is dark and morbid . The prevailing practice has been to make peons , mere slaves , out of these poor Indians . Couple this with the heavy government taxes and fees , the high freight-rates , the dishonest gradings of rubber , and you will not wonder that the collection of raw rubber in Brazil has sagged during recent years . Attempts have been made to import farmers ; but because of unhealthy conditions , the lack of proper food , the absence of business ability on the part of the-Brazilians , their indifference to progress , and the damp air and lands , the attempts came to naught . The slowness of evaporating the several coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up step by step into the biscuit , together possibly with the chemical constituents of the smoke , served to yield a tough , high-quality raw rubber . Although the native lost his health and life , he succeeded in producing the finest grade of crude rubber that came into the market . This was known as " fine hard para . " It is singular how a name is preserved , for Para was the original port of shipment . In later years the port became Manaus , although the name " pares " rubber was still given to the best grade from Brazil . Not only that , but all high-grade rubber is colloquially known as " path " rubber . If the workman is not skilled , the layers on his biscuit are apt to be thick and soft ; the grade " medium " is the result . When the tapper // collects the little strips of rubber that have gathered on the trees , and on the leaves on the ground , he rolls them , full of dirt and bark , into balls known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the cups are always little cakes of rubber ; these come in mass form into the market under the name " cameta . " These are but a few of the many grades , each distinct from the other , produced from this exudation from the wild trees in the Amazon Valley . Therefore the rubber manufacturers ' problem during the days when wild rubber was at its ascendancy , was one of making the correct selection for many different products . Because all the grades were wet , it was necessary , and still is , to wash these wild crude rubbers free from sand and other particles of foreign matter and to dry them before they are ready for use in the factories . In washing and drying there is a loss of weight called " shrinkage , " from both dirt and moisture . In the highest grade the shrinkage is about 17 per cent. ; in the softer , weaker grade , such as the cameta , it runs as high as 48 per cent . Rubber-trees in different distric seem to be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly differing methods of production , results in many grades . Names of different rivers are used in designating grades ? Acre , Tapajos , Madeira , and so on . Since the best trees and the best rubbers from them come from the upper reaches of the Amazon River , it has been natural for the trade to call these products " up-river . " So " up-river fine path " is the highest grade known , except " beni , " which is the best of the up-river grades . // Men somehow are never satisfied . No sooner was wild rubber known than suggestions came to plant the trees . Dr. James Howison , an English surgeon at Pullopinang , in 1789 discovered a vine giving a milk that possessed the properties of the South American caoutchouc . He wrote about it in 1800 : " Should it ever be deemed an object to attempt plantations of the elastic-gum vine in Bengal , I would recommend the foot of the Chittagong , Rajmahal , and Bauglipore Hills , as situations where there is every probability of succeeding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its growth on Prince of Wales ' Island . " Howison thus originated the plantation idea . Later Thomas Hancock , in 1834 , expressed in the " Gardener 's Chronical " the probability of cultivating the best kind of caoutchouc-bearing plant of the East and West Indies . The supply at that time ? two to three tons weekly ? did not seem great enough ! It came to England in poor condition , wet , sticky , and dirty . Fortunately , in the early sixties one man saw a vis-ion of the future and carried it out . Henry A. Wick-ham of London had spent several years in the Brazil-ian forests . A man of keen mind , intrepid force of character , and vision , he studied the rubber-trees and went so far as to plant trees on the Tapajos Plateau in Brazil . He posted himself thoroughly on the botany , the method of growth , soils , water supplies , and every other possible question connected with the Hevea tree . He proposed to London that seeds from the Hevea brasiliensis tree be gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried // it but failed ; they had chosen the wrong species . Mark-ham had sent Collins to investigate . Cross had brought back Castilloa seedlings ; but the plants never thrived , and the rubber gained was of low grade . Sir Joseph Hooker , then director of Kew Botanic Gardens , believed in Wickham 's plan and interested Sir Clem-ents Markham of the India Office . Luckily , Wick-ham was given the responsibility of making the exper-iment , and by rare good fortune lie was left unham-pered by instructions . We must commend the English for one thing ; when once their minds are made up , they see a thing through . Setting out again then for Brazil , Wickham went immediately to the territory on the Tapajos Plateau , well up the Amazon River , where he had been con-sidering a plantation enterprise . He writes a roman-tic story of his experiences . Singularly , discouraging circumstances were turned into success by an accident . While he was in the district , word came to him of the arrival of the steamship Amazonas , Captain Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new " Inman line of Steamships ? Liverpool to the Alto-Amazon direct . " A few days later the information arrived that this fine steamship , through a mix-up , had been abandoned by the supercargoes and left on the captain 's hands , with nothing to take back for the return voyage to Liverpool . Wickham was nothing if not an opportunist . He had neither cash nor credit . The seed was just ripen-ing on the trees . But he boldly wrote to Captain Murray , chartered the ship on behalf of the Govern-ment of India , and made an appointment to meet him // at the junction of the Tapajos and Amazon rivers . Here he was in the jungle , with an impatient captain waiting at port on an empty steamship . Jumping into an Indian canoe , he paddled up the Tapajos , a dangerous trip , particularly in that season , and struck back into the woods where he knew the full-grown Hevca trees to be . Out of seventeen varieties , he chose seeds from the black or best grade of the tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed pannier baskets with loads of seed . It was a delicate operation , for the seed is rich in a heavy oil that quickly becomes rancid , a condition that destroys the power of germination . With remarkable astuteness he did what no other had done ? packed the seed to avoid decay . Once on board the steamer he went to the city of Para , from which port clearance papers were necessary before he could go to sea with his cargo . Wickham says in his narrative : " It was perfectly certain in my mind that if the authorities guessed the purpose of what I had on board , we should be detained under the plea of instructions from the Central Government at Rio , if not interdicted altogether . " Any such delay would have rendered his seeds useless . He had , however , a friend in the person of Consul Green , who entered into the spirit of the occasion and made a special call with him upon the chief of that district . They represented that they had " exceedingly delicate botanical specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal : Gardens at Kew . " This seems to have been impressive ; and , after the usual complimentary interview in the best Portuguese manner , they were permitted to clear port . // On the voyage Wickham took exceeding care of his precious seeds . During June , 1876 , he arrived in England . A special train was sent down to meet him at Liverpool , and the seven thousand young seeds were promptly planted in the Botanical Gardens at Kew . A fortnight later they had sprouted . Then an equally great problem eon ! routed the experimenters , for no plans had been made to send the shoots to any of the English colonies . They were originally intended for southern Borneo ; but because of the depression in business at the time , the government forestry appropriation had been decreased . Governments cut down the amount for research in those days as now . As a result of this decrease , the seeds were sent to the Eastern Tropic Botanical Gardens in Ceylon . Thus the plantation industry was started . Wickham was knighted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ceylon were sent to Singapore in the Straits Settlements south of the Malay Peninsula . Some were planted in Singapore gardens and the rest taken to Perak . A few of these original trees are still standing . One of them is said to be the biggest plantation tree in girth yet recorded . They bore fruit in Singapore first in 1881 , and seed was sent to Borneo and Malaya . Because they had been making good profits from the growing of tea , the planters in Ceylon did not take hold of rubber planting with the same aggressiveness as did the planters of Malaya . But in Malaya , backed by financial interests in Europe and tired of the struggle to make a living out of coffee , rubber appealed to them , and they planted trees wherever possible . The first trees of // the Ceylon plantation bloomed in 1881 at Heneratgoda , sixteen miles from Colombo . That year the first ex-periment in tapping began . Problems of how to tap and when to tap , of how many trees to plant to the acre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the proper handling of latex , have filled volumes of literature . It is , in a marked degree , due to the enterprise of the English and Dutch scientists and business men that the plantation industry has succeeded and has become so tremendously important in the world 's markets . From the wilds of Brazil to the cleanliness and uni-formity of the plantations of the East necessitates a change of picture . Here the trees are laid out in or-chards as even , regular , and well cultivated as apple orchards . There are little Chinese and native rubber farms and big ones , owned by corporations with head-quarters in London , Amsterdam , and America . On the plantations the health of the workers is taken care of . Because there is not labor enough in these districts , it has become necessary to bring in coolies from China and India . In order to make the conditions as corn-fortable for them as their natural state of living re-quires , the health , the food , and the life of these people are watched , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To start a plantation , the jungle must be cleared in a location where drainage and soil are right . It is a long , expensive task to prepare land for the reception of the rubber-tree sprouts , which are set out in rows , usually about one hundred to two hundred to an acre . Then begins the important problem of exterminating // weeds , which in these moist , tropical regions grow at a discouraging rate . The tapping of a rubber-tree is an art that requires a delicate touch and a sure hand . By tapping is meant the cutting of the tree so that the latex will flow freely in a clean , uncontaminated condition , into a properly placed cup . Scientists spend their time in improving the yields by processes of tapping at proper intervals , by care of the trees , by selecting seeds for future plantations from those that give the greatest yield of rubber . Rubber-trees are being scientifically bred and trained , like cows , to give greater quantities of milk . A diagonal cut extending one third or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of many methods . This is made with a razor-sharp knife of special construction , whose blade is so thin that twenty tappings may be made side by side in one inch of bark . If the cut be not sufficiently deep , the full quantity of latex is not obtained ; if the cut be too deep , the tree is injured . Tapping is therefore so important that only a skilled laborer is permitted to do it . Because the latex is found in milk ducts , it is necessary to tap a tree daily . These glands seem to rebuild themselves after a few days ' rest . By noon , when he has tapped 450 trees , the tapper 's work is finished ; at eight or eight-thirty in the morning , the work of collecting the latex from the little cups begins . Usually on Be large plantations metal milk cans are used ; and when the collector has filled his cans , he takes them to a collecting shed where his latex is weighed . The plantations are milk factories . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk is // even something like cow 's milk . Both contain finely divided particles suspended in water ; but in one case it is 3 to 5 per cent . of fat and in the other 25 to 35 per cent . of rubber . The farmer centrifuges milk and gets cream , but milk separators do not work on Hevea latex . Since the rubber will not rise as a cream , the planters add acetic acid to it to congeal or coagulate it . On large plantations , the first operation is to strain the latex carefully in order to free it from dirt and from the curds or flocks that have been formed during transportation . Into appointed vats of correct size the latex is then poured , and with it is intimately mixed a dilute solution of acetic acid . This causes immediate coagulation into a mass of soft , white dough . The acid must be added within twenty-four hours , or spontaneous coagulation will set in , caused probably by the rapid action of bacteria that seem to sour the rubber milk just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white dough has formed , it is put into a ma-chine which tears it up into small pieces and presses out the excess of water and chemicals . It then goes through a washing machine , where it is washed with clean , filtered water ; during this process it gradually hardens by the simple matting together of the rubber particles that had previously existed in the latex . On the larger plantations , it is usually coagulated in bulk , either in a big tank or in glazed earthenware jars of 200 to 250 quarts capacity . In order to produce the light yellow crepe rubber , there is mixed with the acetic acid a small quan tity of what the chemist knows as sodium bisul78 THE REIGN OF RUBBER phite . The rubber comes from the rolls of the washer in a rough irregular sheet . This wet rubber is hung in dry rooms , like clothes on a line . Before it is dry , the rubber is white from the presence of water . From the dry room , the sodium bisulphite having bleached it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale crepe . " The Amazon fine parr ' smells smoky , like ham . , So older rubber men thought smoked rubber to be the best . The planters met the demand for the smoked product with the grade known as " smoked sheets . " To make this , the method of coagulation is essentially the same , but without the sodium bisulphite . The coagulum is then rolled between washing rolls . When clean , it is passed between rollers that have been cut in such a way as to produce a pattern known usually as " ribs " upon the soft , wet mass . Less time is required in washing and handling smoked sheets than in producing crepe , but there is danger that all the impurities and serum are not removed . The Rubber Growers ' Association of Great Britain , and similar associations among the Dutch , have worked out methods to produce " even size , even weight , even thickness " of sheets . After the rolled sheets with the pattern or ribs come from the mills , they are hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much as we smoke hams . Great care is taken that the smoking be uniform , that it be not too hot , and that the color be regular ; for by irregularity of handling the smoked sheets comes a large variety of defects that grade down quality . There are ten or a dozen different types of smoked sheets produced by // different conditions of coagulating and smoking . There are bubbly sheets , moldy sheets , tacky sheets , dark colors , and light colors . To the farmer , milk is milk and cream is cream ; he disposes of it all in one grade . The problem is not so simple for the rubber planter . Besides pale crepe and smoked sheets , there are clots in the strainers , bark scrap , and cup film , which are often worked together and called " compo . " The natives , too , on their little farms grow rubber-trees . They , however , follow the simple plan of pour-ing latex into pans , permitting it to evaporate until it has coagulated . Then they roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra water out , and hang it on the fence to dry . This process yields a softer product , one that is wet , somewhat oxidized , and not of a high quality . The enterprising China-men trade rice and clothing for the rubber produced by these natives , and take it to central stations , where it is washed and dried . We call it " amber sheets , " which are rated according to color . One might think the rubber planter to have finished when he takes his sheet from the dry room . This is far from the case ; for then a number of different forces begin to act upon it . Because sunlight causes rapid oxidation , the rubber must be kept from it ; be-cause heat causes a chemical change that renders rubber less useful , it must be kept as cool as possible . Care must be taken in packing and storage . Bacteria affect the rubber . Oil from machines produces soft spots . If it is packed in the rain or if it is not properly dried , mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proper kind of boxes in which to pack the // rubber has been the subject of much study ; for if the box , which holds about two hundred pounds and is approximately cubical in shape , be weak and break , the rubber may be contaminated with chips . Chips in inner tubes of automobile tires might affect one 's good humor . A glance at the map will show you the areas from which plantation rubber chiefly comes . The vicinity of the Malay Straits seems to offer that peculiar combination of soil , climate , and labor around which the successful development of the plantations has grown . 11rom the little experimental trees set out in Ceylon , there was not a great or rapid development until the automobile brought a demand for rubber tires . This demand induced further planting . Statistics show that in 1900 there were four long tons of plantation rubber recorded , with 26,750 tons of wild rubber from Brazil and 27,136 tons from the rest of the world , or a total of 53,890 tons . For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked it as permanent and large enough a product to warrant the attention of the world . The industry then rapidly grew , so that in 1907 one thousand tons of plantation rubber are recorded , with 38,000 of wild rubber from Brazil and 30,000 tons from the rest of the world . In the same year , there were a total of 506,550 acres of ground under rubber cultivation . The automobile in those years became a potent factor , and the demand for tires rapidly increased . Consequently predictions of the optimists became realized : in 1909 , plantation rubber had jumped to 3600 tons and wild rubber to a total of about 66,000 // tons . The area under cultivation had grown to 861,000 acres . Then occurred the famous and spectacular " rubber boom " that has gone down into history like the many speculative entanglements . Never has there been a more memorable year in the history of rubber than that of 1910 . Men went as wild in England during this period of over-speculation as they did at the time of the South Sea Bubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that crude rubber prices varied from a low point of about forty cents in the year 1878 to a high one of $3.12 a pound in New York in April , 1910 . During those exciting days in London , investors even paid as much as 4600 per cent . premium for shares in rubber plantations . Speculators who knew little of rubber besieged bank doors when the list of a new company was opened . Waitresses , hair-dressers , elevator-boys speculated and made , at least on paper , money enough to retire to the ranks of the " bloated bondholders . " Then came the break , and rubber prices have steadily declined ever since . The stimulus to planting , however , was permanent , the total area under cultivation rapidly increasing , until in 1915 it had reached 2,293,000 acres , and in the next five years , 3,020,750 acres . The production of plantation rubber likewise kept increasing , as did the production of Brazilian and other wild rubber , but less rapidly . As a result , in 1915 there were 107,860 tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world yielded only 13,616 tons . In 1920 the plantations put into the market 304,816 tons , Brazil had fallen to 30,790 , and // the remainder of the world , to 8125 tons . Seventy-five per cent . of all this ? rubber came to America , and about 70 per cent . went into tires manufactured here and elsewhere . The far-sighted planter had won . During the boom of 1919 and the depression of 1920 we again notice rubber 's elasticity . For while millions were made in the boom of 1910 , millions were lost in the depression of 1920 . In this depression , over-production played the star part . After the World War the demand for automobile tires and rubber products rapidly increased ; the supply of crude rubber increased in about the same ratio . But with the depression , the planters were in a difficult situation . The larger number of estates were owned by the English , who consequently felt the slump most keenly . Singapore , instead of Para or Manaus , had become the world 's shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The end of December , 1921 , showed a total acreage under cultivation in British Malaya of 1,760,000 acres ; in the Dutch East Indies of 875,000 acres ; in Ceylon of 410,000 acres ; and in the other countries of 276,000 acres , making a . total of 3,321,000 acres . The total amount in bearing and still solvent amounted to approximately 2,200,000 acres . These estates gave an average yield of 316 pounds to the acre , so that the production in 1920 was 309,100 tons , The demand for use could not possibly be more than 180,000 tons . With a visible supply of well over 300,000 tons , there was little hope for a profitable market . Since a selling price of eightpence per pound was under the cost of production , strenuous efRAW // forts were required to maintain the solvency of the rubber plantation companies . The real needs of the plantation industry may be summed up thus : Prices must be sufficiently low to maintain the economic balance of supply and demand ; cheaper production must come from efficient and economical management . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal , the plantation industry will keep alive , growing , and successful . From the rapidity with which unattended estates in the tropics become overrun by weeds , there is , though , a serious condition confronting the plantation industry and the world 's use of rubber . The maintenance of a rubber plantation in good bearing condition requires labor to be expended in removing weeds and treating tree disease , regardless of any tapping or profitable output . When there is no money to be realized , or so little that what is realized is less than the cost of production , it is natural to let young orchards lie unattended . The result is an outgrowth of weeds which rapidly chokes the young trees . The care and money that have been spent in clearing the jungle are thus Iost , and years will be required to bring many thousands of these acres back into good condition . It is still too early to prophesy the extent of the labor problem in the Malay Straits . Every estate is cutting down its labor . Coolies are returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When production is required , it will take a long time and an expensive process to recruit these coolies again and train them for the work . On large // estates and on small ones the cost of production , however , must be brought down low enough to permit profits to be made at prevailing prices . I have thus far spoken but little of the wild rubber produced outside South America ; and but little need be said , in view of its declining quantity . Rubber has been produced in Africa . The qualities were as variable as the climate and the peoples of that great country . The majority of processes for obtaining rubber from the latex were crude in the extreme . Much of it was obtained by spontaneous coagulation on standing , some by heating of the latex , and some by the use of juices from trees and vines . Foul smelling , it all needed washing ; and the rubber man soon learned to recognize the grade of rubber by the odor . Experiments have been tried in the Philippine Islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow rapidly and come into bearing under cultivation in from three to ten years . Crop conditions are favorable in the southern part of the Philippines outside of the typhoon belt , but no forward strides have been made . Development probably is retarded by the laws prohibiting a corporation from engaging in cultivation or control of more than twenty-five hundred acres of land . The Far East has the start , therefore , in plantation rubber production , and it is doubtful if any other country will for many years catch up with it . There is one country , though , in which rubber has had a spectacular rise and fall ; namely , Mexico . In 1852 Dr. J. M. Bigelow discovered a plant in the form of a small shrub that contained rubber in the wood . It // was called guayule by the Mexican peon . No utilization of it , however , except by natives had been made until 1888 , when a company went to Mexico and obtained a large quantity of the shrub , from which to extract the rubber . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry became a large commercial enterprise with many millions of dollars invested in it . Large supplies of the shrub were used , many thousand tons of the product being employed in the rubber industry . But the rise in volume of the plantation grades , the decrease in the cost of those grades , and the political conditions in Mexico have led to a gradual decrease of guayule in the markets . Booms in the industry have led also to a study of every possible plant from which rubber might be obtained . In late years surveys have been made of western North American shrubs ; even the Carnegie Institution and the University of California have published documents giving the rubber content of some species . The work was originally undertaken as a war measure for emergency supplies . Energetic Americans studied about 225 species of western North American plants , which they grouped into two classes : one in which rubber occurs in solid particles , as in the Chrysothamnus ; the other in which it occurs in sap , as in the milkweed and Indian hemp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States in commercial quantities , it will come from plants the maceration of which will result in the isolation of small quantites of rubber from much extraneous material . The cultivation will require large // areas , and therefore cheap land . But the belief is that these plants can be profitably handled only by machinery , and that they will yield , in addition to the rubber obtained , paper pulp or by-products of value . The investigators seem to think that the desert milkweed promises most . However , the quantity of rubber seems to vary largely , ranging from about 1 per cent . up to 8 per cent . in the stern and leaves . This project , I think , may be left as something for future consideration , but not of particular moment to us at the present time . Much has been written about synthetic rubber , and there was a time when the chemists of the world seemed to feel that Old Mother Nature could be pushed out of commission so far as rubber was concerned . Because every rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigo from coal-tar , every chemist has been led to believe that if he be but diligent enough he will find it possible to make any substance known in nature by the method of synthetic organic chemistry . The " race for rubber " was a merry one while it lasted , but Nature won . To be sure , she was aided by intrepid Englishmen and Dutchmen , so that it is probably safer to say that in the race between chemistry and the planters , the planters won . Grades of synthetic rubber were produced in some quantity in Germany during the war . Although this material could be vulcanized , artificial rubber , by whatever means made , has , up to the present time , never been produced in quality of a finished product equal to that of Mother Nature 's first attempt . There are some cousins of rubber . Three of these // are of marked Importance : gutta-percha , balata , and chicle . Gutta-percha has high electrical resistance , and is easy to handle in factory production . This has given it great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is used as an insulating material of permanent nature . The chief use of balata is somewhat the same as that of gutta-percha ; although in the form of the ad hesive layers between plies of fabric in belting , it has come to have a considerable commercial value . Used in the covers of golf-balls , gutta-percha and balata have found much use of a daily and intimate character . Chewing-gum is of interest to us , since the base that gives it its resilient properties when masticated , is chicle . Chicle is a resilient gum derived from a milky latex . The bulk of the world 's supply comes from Mexico and British Honduras , although there is an-other variety exploited in Colombia that is softer and less valuable . Chicle seems to play a pretty large part in our lives when one considers that 9,859,000 pounds were im ported in the year 1920 . Virtually the total amount of these importations is utilized by the American chew ing-gum industry , the value or manufactured output of which in 1920 represented a retail business of $100 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a wasteful nation . The lumberman has from the beginning of our occupation of this country followed pretty generally the practice of skimming the cream . Out of the millions of cubic feet of wood in the forests an appallingly small percentage of it is finally worked up into useful products . Contrariwise , almost all of the old iron is collected and remelted ; the steel industry utilizes its waste products . There is a difference between the old or scrap products and the by-products from industry . Many industries produce substances other than the chief ones , which are sold to advantage . The dye industry is built upon coal-tar , a by-product in the manufacture of coke . Coke is necessary to steel manufacture , but steel has no use for tar . The rubber industry has few by-products . It does , though , have its scrap products , The treads of tires wear down , the soles of shoes become thin , but both articles still contain a large proportion of vulcanized rubber . By getting rid of the sulphur , can we recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inventors . Because the shoes , tires , hose , belting , water-bottles , and other types of rubber goods are partly oxidized , somewhat hardened , broken , and 88 // impregnated with sand , the enterprise is difficult . Where the tire has rusted against the metal rim , it contains cakes of hard rust . The scrap-pile is certainly unattractive . At the beginning of this scrap industry , your old tire case is sold to the dealer at about half a cent a pound . He throws it into his back yard . After he has accumulated enough of them , a junk dealer comes along and buys these old tires from him . What fun it used to be to gather old junk and trade with the peddler ! In the back country he was an integral part of life . He came about with his load of pots , kettles , pans , and brooms , and traded with us for the old rags , old gum shoes , and other used-up products , which he , as in the present day , sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , market value . Finally the junk was shipped to the dealer who handled larger quantities ; he , in turn , sold it to the factories , where it could be worked up into new products . In the same way our old hose , our tires , and our rubberized shoes are collected now . The business of buying rubber scrap and selling it to the reclaiming mill is one of considerable proportions . In a consideration of what to do to bring this rubber into usable condition , we are at once faced with a fundamental fact : most rubber articles contain cotton fabric in some form , others contain wool , and a few , linen . It is a relatively small proportion of the total tonnage that is free from fabric of any kind . Now , this fabric is weakened by the service it has undergone : in many cases , it has been wet and is partly decayed . It therefore has little value as fabric // or as cotton . In any event , whether it is good or bad , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first operation necessary before these old articles can be put through any process , is to free them from foreign materials , such as sand and metals . Rubber mixtures must be clean and free from any hard materials . Consequently , in the reclaiming factory all material is first sorted into classes , such as tires , shoes , and hose . After sorting , each of them is finely ground . In the course of this fine grinding , which consists of two or three separate steps , the tire is passed over screens and over a piece of apparatus known as a magnetic separator . Here the slow-moving ground mixture of vulcanized rubber and fabric is allowed to drop in close proximity to a magnet , which deflects the iron particles , causing them to fall off by themselves , and freeing the rubber from the metal . The next step is one that has to do primarily with the removal of fabric . In the old days , each little rubber factory utilized what scrap came to it in its own way . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the so-called mechanical method . This removal was accomplished by grinding the rubber and blowing the fabric in finely-divided form out of the mass by means of an air-blast . The rubber was then subjected to the action of live steam at relatively high heat ; the resulting product became known as " shoddy . " This process left much to be desired . In the first place , because more or less ground rubber - adhered to the particles of cotton and were blown away with it , the yield was low . In the second place , // some of the fiber always remained with the rubber and accordingly made its appearance in the finished product . In other words , the " shoddy " was not clean , and it was not much more than a filler . The first attempts at the use of old rubber are said to have been made many years ago . From 1865 to 1870 but few people used old rubber . One company sent old shoes to the women in the country , who tore them apart by hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be stripped from the cloth in the shoes . At this time Austin Day of Ansonia , Connecticut , commenced to grind rubber , using at first car springs and afterward old shoes . Since in 1871 there was a demand for rubber free of fiber , E. H. Clapp hit upon the method of subjecting the ground material to an air-blast , the process separat-ing fiber and rubber . For several years this method was used . A number of men , though , tried to free the rubber from fiber more completely . Much secrecy sur-rounded factory practice . Rubber men , like snails , preferred their shells ; therefore who really discovered first the acid process may never be known . But it takes more than dreams and secret chambers to bring about commercial results . Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman Mitchell , a younger brother of the eminent physician and author , S. Weir Mitchell , after the Civil War went into the sugar busi-ness with Harrison , Havemeyer &; Co. , in Philadelphia . He had a keen perception . Accosted in the street one day by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could he get the rubber back without injury ? He saw a future and experimented , and a // new industry in the reclamation of rubber waste was born . This was in the early eighties . The finely ground mixture of rubber and cotton was immersed in dilute sulphuric acid and steam was blown into it through lead pipes , the steam warming it to the temperature which permitted the acid to attack and destroy the cotton . As the chemist would say , his process hydrolyzed the cellulose into a form soluble in water . After the cotton was destroyed , the entire mass was removed into a wooden circular tub or washer with a large rotating wooden wheel in the middle , so designed as to permit the wheel to churn the mixture in water . After it was partially washed in this big vat , the entire mass was allowed to flow down an inclined wooden chute called a rifller , which contained crosspieces or baffles about two to four inches in height and spaced about a foot apart . The heavy particles of sand subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber would run on down the rifer into a settling tank . This was a sort of adaptation of the metallurgical ore-washing methods . After this washing process the rubber was in a condition of relative fineness , although it was still not fit for use ; for it was firm , tough , vulcanized rubber , free from cotton . The acid process part of it , therefore , was simply a cotton remover . Consequently , the rubber men conceived the idea of placing the rubber in trays , in a large open cylindrical tank , about six feet in diameter and twenty-five feet long , made of heavy boiler-plates and known as a devulcanizer . When the rubber was put in these trays or placed in the devulcanizer in mass , steam was forced // into the tank . The rubber was heated usually to a temperature around 300 ? Fahrenheit and for a length of time depending upon the type of scrap to be heated . Frequently oils , to assist in the process , were mixed with the vulcanized rubber before placing it in the devulcanizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubber . There was no removal of sulphur : in point of fact , vulcanization went on a little further ; but in the presence of steam and oil , the rubber became plastic enough to permit its final mixture with fresh rubber . In time , devulcanizing usually lasted about twenty-four hours . After devulcamzation the rubber was removed , dried in air driers , massed on a mixing mill , and thus prepared for reworking . An acid process from which nothing ever came had been patented in 1863 by C. II . Hayward and D. E. Hayward of Massachusetts . Colonel Mitchell , however , made the process work , and continued in the invention of apparatus until 1889 . He instituted a commercially efficient process and organized an industry ; for his company , the Philadelphia Rubber Works , was the first commercial enterprise which had exclusively for its purpose the recovery of rubber in the form of the usable product that we call reclaimed rubber . Because the Mitchell method was particularly applicable to the treatment of scrap in a relatively low state of vulcanization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective with old boots and shoes . The soundness of the process is evidenced in the fact that even to-day it is still the standard method of treating boot and shoe scrap . But since hose , belting , THE REIGN OF RUBBER and tire scrap are more highly vulcanized and in addition contain varying but always appreciable quantities of free sulphur , this method leaves much to be desired . It was not until the development of the Marks process , the patent for which was issued in 1899 , that it was possible to obtain an acceptable product on the devulcanization of these grades of scrap . Before this date , mechanical scraps and tires were of virtually no commercial value . Arthur I L Marks invented what we to-day know as the alkali process for reclaiming , the most advanced step that had been taken or that has since been taken in making old scrap useful in rubber mixtures . His process consisted in subjecting the ground rubber waste when submerged in a dilute alkaline solution , as for example a 3 per cent . solution of caustic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 344 ? to 370 ? Farenheit for about twenty hours , while the entire mass was contained in a closed vessel . The finely divided waste being placed in a large horizontal tank within which paddles or other stirring apparatus rotated , the ground rubber with its cotton fiber was constantly agitated in the presence of the caustic soda solution , heat being supplied from a hollow jacket outside the inner container . After about twenty hours of heating , the entire mass was " blown off , " as the practical men say , into a large washing vat , where it was washed in running water , the overflow being screened to prevent the reclaimed rubber from running away . The cotton , made into water-soluble or hydrolyzed form , was washed out . The usual processes for removing metals and sand by the magnetic separator and the riffler // were carried out ; and finally , the mass being dried by warm air on large screens , it was worked into sheets on mills similar to the mixing mills . Marks 's first application for a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1889 , to the examiner , who recognized that something different had been produced ? at least , something different from the product of the Hoffer process of ordinary boiling in caustic soda solution , for the plasticity of the rubber had been restored . In the Marks process the combined sulphur is not removed , but a change has taken place . A certain relation of the combination of sulphur and rubber constitutes vulcanized rubber , a material that is tough and elastic , not plastic . After vulcanized rubber has gone through the Marks process , this toughness disappears and plasticity returns ; some fundamental change has occurred . By this process , reclaimed rubber , for the first time , came to be , under the same conditions , similar in character to crude rubber . It was plastic on the rolls ; the combining ingredients would absorb readily ; it would vulcanize easily with sulphur . It over-vulcanized and under-vulcanized as crude rubber did . The differences between the reclaimed rubber from the acid and from the alkali processes are great . Reclaimed rubber that has simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , possesses two great disadvan tages : small traces of acid , which cause rapid deterioration , now and then are left in the rubber ; the tensile strength and other physical properties are poor . The alkali-reclaimed rubber is strong . It mixes well with crude rubber . For many purposes , it // // possesses all the necessary properties of crude rubber ; for other purposes , it is vastly better than crude rubber . Owing to a slight alkaline character that adds to the length of life of the rubber mixture , it has an advantage . Thus has developed reclaimed rubber , no longer shoddy . Chemists and inventors , trying to reverse the vulcanization process , and attempting to split off the sulphur atoms in the vulcanized rubber molecules , called the process " devulcanization . " One could scarcely wade through the mass of patent literature . There have been many hundred patents taken out on different modifications of the alkali process alone . Numerous other substances have been and still are used in connection with it , to soften and give other valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been modified and is to-day the one process by which the greatest tonnages of rubber scrap are reclaimed and made usable . Extremely interesting are the methods by which men have attempted to dissolve vulcanized rubber in various solvents in order to remove the sulphur . I have in front of me a list of 156 different substances that have been tried , either to dissolve or withdraw the sulphur ; they have all failed , and to-day the removal of sulphur from vulcanized rubber is probably one of the great unsolved problems in the rubber industry . Perhaps some of these processes do definitely take the sulphur out ; but when the sulphur is all removed , the substance left is not rubber but an oil . Rubber is so complex , its affinity for sulphur is so strong , that any known reagent powerful enough to remove the combined sulphur makes the rubber unfit for commercial use . The development of the Marks process resulted in a large increase in the use of reclaimed rubber by rubber manufacturers . By resrearch in the last twenty years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubber compound , the reclaiming industry has eliminated shoddy . Reclaimed rubber has brought about a saving in mixing time and costs and also a decrease in the time of cure . That its use is fundamental in the manufacture of rubber goods has been clearly demonstrated in the last year by the fact that the production of reclaimed rubber has been in approximately direct ratio to the production of the classes of goods in which it has been used . The industry to-day rests upon the Mitchell patent and the Marks patent . Scores of other patents have been granted , but the processes have lacked some essential feature ; either they were too expensive , or the agent used caused the rubber to deteriorate , or the resultant product was not so good as that already on the market . This does not mean , though , that future developments may not be as revolutionary and sound as the two patents already mentioned . For the year 1921 . the amount of crude rubber used in the United States was 345,599,000 pounds , and of reclaimed rubber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and necessity in our economy . There is no question of its value ; articles made from it age well . Like any other material used in this coin98 THE REIGN OF RUBBER plex and intricate industry , though , reclaimed rubber is one that requires a knowledge of it and of the purpose for which the resulting article is intended , in order to make its use justified . Even raw rubber must be used with some degree of care . Reclaimed rubber , therefore , plays a large and valuable part . Just stiff enough when in an unvulcanized condition , it makes manufacturing of many articles more easy . Reclaimed rubber is not used where the maximum tensile strengths are required , any more than pure crude rubber alone is used where toughness or resistance to abrasion are required . For the tough , resisting service in a rubber heel , in footwear , in rubber bumpers , in wire insulation , in carriage cloth , reclaimed rubber serves , and serves well . Many people seem to feel , usually without a knowledge of the facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rubber mixtures . If it were not used , there would be a tremendous waste that rubber users should not sustain . If this little story frees the reader 's mind from any idea that reclaimed rubber is something inferior , it would be well . Reclaimed rubber is not inferior ; it is just different . It is true that one can make inferior products from the best of materials ; therefore in the handling of reclaimed rubber , intelligence is required . That during the period of low-priced crude rubber so large a tonnage of reclaimed rubber has been used is one of the best arguments in favor of its value and quality . The utilization of scrap rubber through reclaiming is an economic achievement . CHAPTER VII THE CHEMISTRY OF RUBBER MIXTURES This is a chapter of details . But chemistry is a science of details , of little things , of explanations . In Malaya we could go into the orchard and gather a quart of milk from a rubber-tree , and then bring it back to the laboratory and ask the chemist to look it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would say , " I know what that is , and how it is put together . " He would know only some facts and theorize on the rest . As it runs out of the trees , the latex is a milky fluid consisting of water in which are suspended minute globules of rubber . These globules are solid , not liquid . Very fine in subdivision , they measure from five ten-thousandths to three ten-thousandths of a millimeter . It is stated that they are so numerous that one gallon of latex contains more than two hundred billion of them . If we were to lay out these little globules side by side , we should find that those in one gallon would make a minute rubber thread 372 miles long . When observed under the microscope , they seem to be somewhat irregular in shape . Since they are solid , we term the latex a suspension of solid particles . If the rubber were liquid , we should call the latex an emulsion . Milk as it comes from the cow is an emulsion . 99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain on the average 28 per cent . of the chemically pure rubber ; resins , which are substances soluble in the chemical known as acetone , 2 per cent . ; mineral substance from 0.3 to 0.7 per cent. ; components containing nitrogen , which the chemist calls by the general name of proteins , 1 to 2 per cent. ; sugars dissolved in the water of the latex , 1.1 to 2.3 per cent. ; and water , about 60 per cent . From the latex may be obtained 30 to 35 per cent . of commercial raw rubber , which contains various of these substances . Proteins or nitrogen substances play an important part in the latex . Modern chemistry has learned how small quantites of them assist in the formation of emulsions and suspensions because they seem to prevent the separation of the emulsified substance from the water . When you buy cod-liver oil as a medicine , as most people do at one time or other , you see a nice white emulsion . It would be quite possible for the druggist to make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking together the oil and water ; but , on standing in the bottle , the oil would separate in a layer by itself . Physicians have found it wise to give cod-liver oil finely divided with water in the form of an emulsion , because it digests readily . In order to keep the preparation , therefore , from separating into two layers , casein is added to it , which has the peculiar property of protecting the globules of oil and keeping them away from each other . Nature has prepared for us a suspension in which she has put in a substance , namely , the protein , that // permits a high degree of dispersion of these fine particles and prevents their rapid coalescence into a layer separate from the water . The substances that play this part in preventing the coalescence of suspended or emulsified globules are known as protective colloids . Different rubber-trees seem to have different protective colloids . Because the latex of the Hevea tree is very stable , the rubber from it does not tend to separate or float to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African trees and the latex from the Central American trees seem to have in them different protective colloids ; for , on standing , the rubber floats to the top . A gallon of latex weighs 8.17 pounds and contains from 2.45 to 2.85 pounds of raw rubber . To supply the world with 250,000 long tons of rubber requires , therefore , in the neighborhood of 224 million gallons of latex . The difference in composition between rubber latex and milk is striking , for the cow has nothing like the efficiency in production of the substance most desired from it , namely the fat , cow 's milk showing only 3 to 6 per cent . of butter fat . These two milks , the vegetable milk and the animal milk are , therefore , radically different . On the plantations , it has become necessary to handle latex as rapidly as possible , in any event , to limit to certain reasonable and well-known lengths the time between its collection at the tree and its coagulation in the shed or factory , because as soon as it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be acted upon by bacteria . Coagulation , the change that is required chemically in the latex , is the alteration of // the protective colloid . The addition of acids changes . the latex in such a way that the proteins are no longer able to prevent the globules of rubber from running to-gether . The first step in the chemical change of latex is to add acetic acid in dilute solution . It is used in dilute solution because the quantity of protective colloid is small and but little acid is required to alter it . Strictly speaking from the chemical point of view , the nature of its alteration is unknown . It is evident , though , that acetic and other acids will cause coagu-lation . We know that when latex is allowed to stand it grad-ually becomes acid from the action of bacteria on the proteins ; just as when a glue and water solution is allowed to stand , it changes to acids through the action of bacteria and fungus growth . By any kind of coagulation , though , the rubber itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart in the water solution simply mass together . If latex is allowed to coagulate spontaneously , a dis-agreeable odor develops , which persists until vulcan-ization . When coagulation occurs by acetic acid , how-ever , the rubber is odorless . Although other acids , such as formic acid and sulphuric acid , have been used , more than 95 per cent . of the raw rubber is now prepared on the plantations by the use of acetic acid . It in no way injures the quality of the raw rubber . Let us now turn to the raw rubber itself and exam-ine the facts that chemists have learned regarding its characteristics and properties . The first and most im-portant one is the variety of substances contained in // it . Rubber itself , free from these substances , is a hydrocarbon . An interpretation of this chemical term means that it is composed of only the chemical elements carbon and hydrogen . Raw rubber contains from 92 to 94 per cent . of the rubber hydrocarbon . Besides this , it contains moisture , mineral substances , resins , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acetone , ? and the proteins . The composition is about the same as that of the latex , with the water and the ingredients dissolved in the water , or serum , removed . In the laboratory the chemist , who with beaker and combustion furnace analyzes the hydrocarbon , finds it to be made of five carbon and eight hydrogen atoms . But there are several other hydrocarbons that show the same constituents on analysis . The rubber hydrocarbon is a distinct one . Therefore he has come to believe that several of these C , H , groups are united physically ( he says " polymerized " ) , and he expresses the composition ( C , II8 ) x . But the chemist is a singular fellow . He has learned that the terpenes , of which turpentine is one , have a composition C10II , ( ; . So he calls rubber ( C1o1310 ) Among his technical friends , he goes further and draws a picture of the hydrocarbon , in which the exact relation of each element to the other is shown . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . They belong to the most intricate field of organic chemistry , and the rubber structure to the most intricate of them all . Rubber may be made artificially by heating the oil " isoprene . " The chemical process , which consists // in the addition of one molecule to another , forming a succession of these groups linked together into a ring of uncertain dimensions , we call " polymerization . " How far the chemical composition , the state of polymerization , or the state of aggregation of the polymerized masses , affects the properties of crude rubber as we know them , and how far the hydrocarbons from trees of various ages differ chemically and physically , are all unknown phases of an interesting problem . We do not know the part played by mineral substances or the exact condition of the nitrogenous matter , although the proteins have a most important influence upon the characteristics of the rubber . The other substances in raw rubber after coagulation are not deleterious impurities . They are of wonderful advantage by assisting in resistance to oxidation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acetone-soluble matter , much study has been done by some chemists in the analysis of rubber . Rubber from different botanical species varies largely in resins . The plantation rubber coming from the Hevea tree seems to produce the smallest amount of any . The Ceara rubber , the Ficus rubber , that is , those from Central America and Africa , on extraction in acetone yield resinous matter as high as 7 to 10 per cent . The guayule rubber shows 20 per cent . of a liquid resin . Lower grades , such as the scrap , the rubber that has fallen upon the ground , and those grades that have been allowed to dry in the bright , hot sunlight , seem to have decomposed a little ; as a result , the amount of substance to be extracted by acetone has increased . The rubber resins // are highly complex , and whether they are the original source of rubber in the tree or whether they have been produced from the rubber we do not know . Probably to-day the " acetone extract " is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades , and the fresh from the deteriorated rubber ; although the control of quality in a finished article can be carried on irrespective of the origin of the rubber . The amount of resin extracted by acetone is not , as some have believed , a guide to the quality of a vulcanized rubber mixture . A chemical property of the rubber hydrocarbon is unsaturation . It adds directly halogens , halogen acids , sulphur , and sulphur chloride , as well as certain other substances . The story of synthetic rubber has been much discussed . Artificial rubber is well-known . During the World War much work was ( lone upon it in Germany , where considerable quantities were produced ; but it was not the same hydrocarbon as that derived from the tree . It was a close relative , known as methyl rubber . But the tires and other soft rubber articles made from it were decidedly inferior in service . It was , however , valuable in hard rubber or ebonite . After its coagulation , one can think of rubber as a body made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of microscopic mass of fine shot , each of which is surrounded by a thin film of protective colloid , the protein substance . Thus , raw rubber has a structure . It is not like glass , which is homogeneous ; not like leather , which is a mass of fibers ; or like wood , which is a mass of short , thick fibers . // The probability of this structure is interestingly proved by the action of rubber when it is softened or masticated , as we call it , on a mixing mill . If our theory be correct , some of the toughness of rubber in its raw state is due to the harder nature of the sur-rounding protective colloid . The use of this term , protective colloid , when one is speaking of rubber in the mass is not exact ; for it really is a protective col-loid only when the rubber is dispersed through the latex . Nevertheless it still surrounds the particles of rubber . These proteins are probably stiff like glue ; because when masticated on a mixing mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of this structure . After prolonged masti-cation , it is not so tough as before . The rubber , when mixed , is passed through a ma-chine known as a calender in such a way that it issues in the form of a thin sheet . Even after vulcanization , the rubber is found to show a difference in strength in the direction of the passage through the calender from that at right angles to it . For years the rubber man has observed this property , which is known as " grain . " It is quite possible that the little rubber particles are stretched during the process of calendering , so that we may imagine them in the form of elongated fibers very minute in size , rather than as little spheres . Since they probably overlap each other in somewhat the same way as fibers of cotton during the twisting of cotton fiber into thread , one may readily picture them a series of little rubber threads , naturally tougher in the direction in which the fibers have been stretched . In another way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber , which structure is changed and broken by the process of mastication . Raw rubber , in a sense , does not dissolve in solvents . One may say , rather , that the solvents dissolve in rubber . If a piece of rubber is allowed to stand several hours , for instance , in benzol , in gasoline , or in carbon bisulphide , it swells to several times its original size . The solvent has , therefore , penetrated and dissolved in the rubber . When , however , in the regular course of cement making , the rubber is beaten or stirred so that mechanical action is applied upon it , a cement is obtained which is really a distribution of the swollen and softened rubber in the balance of the solvent that has been used ; that is , a colloidal solution has been obtained . The difference between a colloidal solution and a true solution lies in this fact ; a true solution , such as salt in water , is one in which the solid has passed into the liquid in such a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make this colloidal solution in benzol , using only 2 per cent . of rubber that has never been passed through between the rolls of a mixing mill , and compare that with a liquid of the same strength but which has been softened or masticated by a mixing mill for about twenty minutes , we observe a distinct difference . The solution that contained unmasticated rubber is thicker and more viscous than that containing the masticated rubber . This has led to a belief in raw rubber structure , which structure has been broken down by mastication , so that the little films of protein are broken up and distributed into the rubber mass . Just what the structure is , what it means , and // how to change it , are problems yet to be solved by the research chemist . After all , what is vulcanization ? Ever since the discovery of the process , chemists have worked upon this question . There are numerous theories . One thing we do know , however , that sulphur in some way actually combines with the rubber molecule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has taken sul-phur on , there is no divorce court known that can separate them . Probably divorces never leave the parties thereto in just the same mental state ; there-fore , while by drastic chemical methods sulphur has been removed from rubber , the rubber is never the same in physical properties as it was before its union with sulphur . When only about 2 per cent . by weight of sulphur is added to rubber , it serves to produce a soft , strong , stretchy composition . During a study of the basic principles of vulcanization , when a sample of rubber containing 10 per cent . of sulphur was heated even for a long period of time , all the sulphur did not combine . Some of it remained as free sul-phur . Investigators analyzed samples regularly over a period of several hours , and found that the sulphur combined with the rubber steadily . There is no chem-ical compound formed during the vulcanization of soft rubber ; the process is continuous . The amount of sul-phur that enters into combination with rubber in-creases with time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are constant , the amount of sul-phur entering into combination with rubber is depend-ent upon the quantity of sulphur originally present . Once it was believed that sulphur did not combine // with rubber until the temperature had passed the melting point of sulphur ; but this was definitely disproved a few years ago by a chemist who permitted a mixture of rubber and sulphur to stand at relatively low temperatures , one sample at 122 ? Fahrenheit , over periods of days up to eighty . He found the same regular combination of sulphur with the rubber . So vulcanization does go on at ordinary temperatures , but slowly . When small amounts of about 3 per cent of sulphur are combined , as we say , with rubber there results the soft rubber of commerce . During the time of heating , while the essential process of vulcanization occurs , all the sulphur is not combined ; there is an excess called " free sulphur . " Shortly after the rubber is removed from the mold at the end of the vulcanization , the color at the surface is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little while , however , an interesting change takes place ; for this excess sulphur , or " free sulphur , " begins to crystalize and separate itself from the rubber . Probably dissolved in the rubber during vulcanization , on cooling and standing it separates . At the surface , we find it coming out in the form of a gray powder called " bloom . " Essentially all rubber articles show bloom , or " sulphuring up , " on the surface . To be . sure , there are some of them such as boots and shoes and colored water-bottles wherein a freedom from this gray powder is desired . It is very difficult for the rubber chemist so to design his composition that bloom will not occur . In doing this , in order to combine all the sulphur , he // uses the minimum quantity and vulcanizes for as long a time as quality permits . Even then , there is a small quantity of uncombined sulphur that may , under particular conditions , come to the surface as bloom . The sulphur crystallizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after standing twenty-four hours shows under a microscope beautiful crystals of sulphur . The photograph shows this internal crystallization . Bloom , though , does no harm . In point of fact , up to the limit of our knowledge at the moment , the strongest , toughest articles show bloom . Some day , however , we may find means of overcoming it ; although it is not deleterious . It is singular , too , how sulphur , which was a yellow powder mixed into the rubber in the beginning , comes out on the surface as a gray one . Sulphur is one of those interesting chemical elements that seems to have the power of existing , like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , in more than one form . The chemist calls them allotropic forms . Interested in what the form is , the crystallographer finds that each is a different crystal , with edges and faces variant . The rubber man finds the yellow sulphur that he originally mixed comes out on the surface as a gray bloom ; the casual notice of that change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature of vulcanization are the two necessary outside factors giving the proper quality to the rubber composition . The rubber man must observe these in just about the way the cook must observe the time and temperature of cooking different cakes . When the young housewife puts the wrong // substances or the incorrect proportions into her biscuits , she bakes soggy ones . If she leaves them in the oven too short a time , they are underdone . Likewise , if the rubber man removes his mixture from the press and the mold too soon , he finds the rubber to be weak , somewhat sticky , or , as he calls it , " undercured . " If he leaves it in the right length of time ( there is a large leeway usually ) , he finds it strong , not tacky , and resilient . If he leaves it in too long , it becomes like overdone roast beef , dry . On breaking , it is found to be short , that is , it breaks at a shorter elongation than it should . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is burned . By long , sad experience , he has also learned that it does not age well , but gradually becomes harder and harder , taking on oxygen from the air with much greater rapidity when over-cured than when either under or correctly cured . The time and temperature of cure for each composition , or the adjustment of the composition to cure at a time and temperature for some factory practice , is one of the most essential of the rubber chemist 's duties . There are wide and , to the manufacturer and consumer , vitally important differences in physical properties between under-cured , properly cured , and overcured rubber articles . Still we have as yet only theories of a general character to explain the nature of these products of vulcanization . The amount of combined sulphur , when expressed as a percentage figure in terms of rubber as 100 per cent. , is known as the coefficient of vulcanization . No chemical individual of the rubber hydrocarbon and sulphur has been isolated from soft , vulcanized rubber mixtures . // When a large excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a maximum of 32 per cent . of combined sulphur ; and there results the only chemical compound that yet has been isolated ? a mono-sulphide C5H , S , or , as usually written , C10H16S2 . It is , in the laboratory , a brown , dry powder . In the factory and in commerce we know it as hard rubber or ebonite , used in battery jars , sheets , fountain-pens , and the like . It is highly resistant to the action of chemicals . Around hard rubber has developed a sort of separate industry , to be discussed in a later chapter . It is a rubber industry , to be sure , but an industry wherein stiffness , strength , freedom from action of chemicals , and a high degree of resistance to penetration by electrical charges are required . Many discussions have arisen between two camps of chemists ; those who expound the sulphur absorption theory of Ostwald and those who stand by a chemical theory . The great rubber chemist Weber was an exponent of the chemical theory . Chemists to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as most reasonable for the explanation of vulcanization . The fact that no compounds have yet been isolated in the soft rubber range of vulcanization is no reason for us to believe that a purely physical theory alone will account for it . Carl Otto Weber will ever remain in the minds of rubber chemists as the most notable leader . Born in 1860 , of German-Scotch ancestry , he studied chemistry in Germany and migrated to England , where for some years he was a managing chemist in a rubber factory . A prolific contributor to technical literature , an indefatigable research chemist , // he became a leader in things rubber . He finally came to America , where he died in 1905 . Weber may truly be called the father of rubber chemistry . Besides the one described , there are other methods of vulcanization . Shortly after a knowledge of sulphur or " hot " vulcanization was obtained , Alexander Parkes , a chemist of Birmingham , England , having seen the result of Hancock 's work and his patent specifications , immediately went to work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sulphur that he knew . At length , in 1846 , he succeeded in obtaining a vulcanized rubber by immersing a sheet of raw rubber in a mixture of 100 parts carbon bisulphide in which had been dissolved two and one half parts of sulphur chloride . After immersing it for about one and a half minutes to three minutes and drying it , he found his material to be stronger than it had been and resistant to heat and cold . Thus the discovery of vulcanization by a different method was made known . Chemists have found by further study the significant fact that sulphur chloride , which is expressed chemically S2C127 like sulphur , combines with the rubber molecule . Even though the results are essentially the same as in the first process , because of the highly corrosive character of salphur chloride , the use of this material has been limited to combination with raw rubber into which no other substance has been mixed . But that discovery has been important to you ; since you probably use it when sitting in the dentist 's chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavities that have been opened by the dentist is one of its products . The rubber is cured , however , at low // temperature ; that is , the ordinary room temperature . No more is known of the real chemistry of this process so far as soft rubber is concerned than is known of the hot or pure sulphur vulcanization . We do know that when an excess of sulphur chloride is used , a chemical compound approximating ( C1oH16 ) S2C12 is obtained . This is a dry powder with no valuable properties . It corresponds chemically to the product obtained in hard rubber . In recent years two new processes of vulcanization have been developed . One of them was first discovered by a Russian named Ostromislensky , who discovered how certain complicated organic compositions , derivatives of coal-tar , when mixed with rubber and heated , cause a stiffening , an increase in strength , and a resistance to temperature change quite similar to that obtained when sulphur is used . He has not , however , succeeded in producing any substances that have the tensile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting from a chemical point of view . It may lead us ultimately to a clearer knowledge of what vulcanization is , although the field is a large one and will probably take years for a complete solution of its problems . Within the last few years an Englishman , S. J. Peachey , patented a method of vulcanization at ordinary temperatures . When crude rubber in a form such as sheets , clothing , etc. , is treated with sulphur dioxide gas , it is rapidly absorbed into the rubber much as vapor of solvents is absorbed . When this absorption is complete , the rubber is saturated with hydrogen sulphide . These two gases interact , with the formation // of sulphur in a very active or , as the chemist calls it , nascent condition . It is so active , in fact , that it adds itself to rubber very easily at room temperatures , giving thus a process of vulcanization that is different from any of the others , although the basic principle is that of addition of sulphur to rubber . These processes are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country ; but they have not yet become a large factor in our rubber markets . The most striking advance in the chemistry of vulcanization has been made with the use of organic accelerators . The first inorganic accelerator was white lead , used by Goodyear in 1839 . The chemistry of this type of accelerator , so far as known up to recent years , was that of the old idea of the carrier . Serving to attach to itself sulphur , and then letting go of it , white lead gave the sulphur to the rubber in a shorter time than the rubber could take it up alone . Without knowing exactly the condition in which the sulphur was when given to the rubber by white lead , the chemist supposed , in any event , that the sulphur was made more active by the use of this catalyst . With the coming of the organic accelerator , many chemists have tried to find out exactly why it acts so rapidly . Despite the large number of these organic substances , the idea was prevalent for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical use . Thus , the derivatives of aniline , or , as it is known to the chemist , aminobenzene , were employed , and various more intricate modifications and derivatives of aniline . Lately , however , chemical compounds that contain sulphur have been employed . // These facts have led chemists to search for the cause . To make a long story sufficiently short , these investigators have learned that vulcanization occurs most actively when the accelerator first adds sulphur to itself , and then separates off the sulphur in a particularly active condition . The accelerator with its extra sulphur chemists call a polysulphide . It acts like a dumpcart ? quickly loaded , quickly unloaded . The real chemistry of the properties possessed by vulcanized rubber when in contact with oils such as benzol , gasolene , or heavier lubricating oils , is not known . Raw rubber absorbs these oils and swells ; vulcanized rubber likewise absorbs them and swells . Some substances cause vulcanized rubber to swell more largely than others ; and some cause vulcanized rubber to shrink . Methyl alchohol , wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some substances produce no change . The derivative of benzol known as toluol swells vulcanized rubber slightly ; benzol swells it to nearly double its size , but carbon bisulphide to more than double . But this swelling is the end of the effect ; it is not possible by heating or by any other method to make vulcanized rubber into a colloidal solution . Oiled roads , therefore , are not particularly good for tires . In an earlier chapter we have considered powders and their effect in rubber mixtures . Why do these substances act as they do ? It is a most interesting question , and one that is probably not yet wholly solved . Let the microscope tell its story . An examination of the photomicrograph of zinc oxide and some other substances used in compounds shows these subCHEMISTRY // stances to be very small . It is doubtful whether the ultimate particle of carbon-black has ever been seen under the microscope . It is probable that the larger particles shown are aggregations , and that even the smaller ones may be minute aggregations . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can the particle-size expressed in diameters , as though these little particles were spherical in shape . The diameter of carbon-black is less than two tenthousandths of a millimeter ; that of zinc oxide is about five ten-thousandths . Other dry pigments are all larger in size . Not only do the photpgraphs show the particles of carbon-black and zinc oxide to be finer in size than those of the barytes , but they vary in structure and do not seem to have the sharp angles and faces evident in the barytes . Here the chemist has made good use of the microscope , as you see in the photographs . These finer-grained materials may be classed in two groups : finely divided colloidal particles and all others . Colloidal particles are those of gas-black , zinc oxide , lithopone , some grades of clay , magnesium carbonate , and many others . The " all others " include barytes , asbestine , whiting , and a large number of mineral substances . There is no clear line of division between these groups , except in the process of manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber mixture . After all , rubber , as the consumer gets it , is not a simple mixture of rubber , sulphur , accelerator , zinc oxide , and carbon-black ; but , to meet the demands of numerous physical properties required for service in the form of shoes , adhesive layers , treads , and belt covers , // other materials must be used . We have found in recent years how these materials serve practical purposes and are not simply cheapening fillers . In point of fact , many powders now cost more than crude rubber . The rule-of-thumb methods are gone from the leading laboratories , but the variables are so extended that the service test has become the final criterion of the value of any mixture . While we have developed research laboratories to show us why , development departments to show us how , testing machinery to give us results , we , nevertheless , are constantly faced with the question : Will rubber age ? Rubber is a perishable product . For any purpose , a knowledge of the rate of deterioration is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer and consumer . Heat , light , oxygen , and sulphur play their parts in the tragedy ; but , as yet , no definite theory to account for the varied rate of aging has been proposed . In the vast majority of cases , too rapid decay is due to over-cure of the mixture , or improper conditions of storage . Differing in practice from that of the old days , chemists have determined means of testing the rate of aging . Various types of apparatus have been developed , until to-day it is possible within a space of two weeks to predict fairly confidently the length of life of any given composition ; at least , the prediction can be made by comparison with compositions of a known length of life . All rubber goods should be stored in the dark and kept as cool as possible . Both these factors are under the control of the user . Even though the rubber chemist makes his compositions the best he can , it still is // necessary for the consumer to cooperate with him by keeping away these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the consumer , desires to maintain his rubber products for the maximum time . How long should they remain strong and serviceable ? That depends upon storage conditions , because over-cure has pretty generally disappeared . In hot climates one should expect trouble ; under temperate and cold conditions , very little . CHAPTER VIII THE BICYCLE TIRE When Nancy flanks in 1892 trotted a mile in 2 : 04 and clipped over four seconds from the best previous record , she not only established a mark for horse racing , but she earned a place in the hall of rubber fame . For the first time in history , pneumatic-tired wheels were used successfully on vehicles other than bicycles . She drew the bicycle-wheeled sulky . Her performance announced to the world that pneumatic tires on wheels were speedy . In a few months the steel tires disappeared from sulkies and the solid tires from bicycles . As the forerunner of the automobile , the bicycle expressed a human desire for faster and more comfortable transportation . The history of the bicycle began in Germany in 1816 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A year or so later , the old dandy-horse or hobby-horse was developed in England and introduced into America . The bone-shaker ( a descriptive name ) , driven by the feet alone , and steered by hand , was exhibited in Paris in 1865 . It was a two-wheel velocipede with foot cranks and two wooden wheels equipped with iron tires . For several years this was quite popular , but it was too uncomfortable to serve for long . About 1870 C. K. Bradford suggested rubber tires , 120 // and so for a time solid , round tires were used . By 1877 the tire had evidently given sufficient relief from discomfort to warrant the organization of the Pope Manufacturing Co. , to make bicycles with solid rubber tires . Riders shook themselves upon these until 1888 , when John Boyd Dunlop of England , in an attempt to satisfy the cravings of his small boy , in-vented a type of tire that was the first practical ap-plication of the pneumatic tire . He had , to be sure , been antedated in principle , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomson in his idea of a carriage wheel as early as 1845 . Thom-son , an Englishman , wished to make carriages easier to draw , noiseless , and more comfortable . He made the first single-tube tire of several plies of canvas covered with rubber ? " sulphurized India rubber and each fold connected to the one below it by a solution of India rubber . " He blew it up with air . The af-fair was crude , but the inventor was far ahead of his time . Dunlop , a veterinary surgeon in Belfast , Ireland , unlike Thomson , brought out his idea opportunely ; but it might have been neglected , except for the foresight of Du Cros , prominent enthusiast in Irish racing . Du Cros organized the Dunlop Co. , doing much to make the Dunlop tire practicable . This is another one of these instances where mere invention has not signi-fied application . Many inventors are so far ahead of their times that their work falls into the discard ; and it remains for others really to develop . the ideas and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ser-vice . That inventor who fits his work to an immediate // heed and combines it with business acumen and manufacturing facilities is he who makes the greatest success . From Dunlop down to the present , the bicycle tire has been continually improved , filling the changing needs of service . This first Dunlop tire was an outer casing of several plies of rubberized canvas , with means of inflation . Bound about each of the wheels of a tricycle owned by a young son of the inventor , it was held to the rim by wrappings of tape . Thus the bicycle tire came into being , to fill the needs of youth . It was called the " pudding tire " and was generally ridiculed . It was , however , faster on the road and more resilient than the solid tires of that day . The patents granted resulted in the formation then of one of the world 's most important tire companies , the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. , Limited , of England . Living until October 23 , 1921 , Dunlop came to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , and to see his invention used on millions of bicycles and automobiles . Tape wrappings to hold a tire on a felloe did not last long enough . To improve them , there came several inventors ; among them , Pardon W. Tillinghast , in 1892 , with a perfected single-tube tire , a valve , and a method of attaching the tire to the rim . He had vulcanized into the form of an annular ring , an inner tube , a supporting layer of fabric , and an outer wear-resisting cover . He endeavored to improve Dunlop 's tire , because he thought the tube would chafe against the casing . His invention was put on the market under // the name of the Hartford Tire , manufactured by the Hartford Rubber Co . It is stated that the pneumatic tire factory of George R. Bidwell Cycle Co. , of New York City , in April , 1891 , turned out the first pneumatic tires on this side of the Atlantic . Probably the one other patent of most interest is that of Thomas B. Jeffery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a specially designed clincher tire of a double-tube character . He worked out new means of securing the tire to the wheel , of diminishing danger of puncture , and of preventing a leakage of air that would occur with a puncture . Even though the prevention of leakage was not highly successful , the idea of a clincher rim was quickly taken up in cooperation with a Mr. Gormully . The Gormully and Jeffrey tire , or the G. &; J. , as it was called , was for many years one of the most prominent and widely used types of bicycle tires . In fact , upon this clincher rim principle as almost simultaneously developed in France , the original pneumatic tires for automobiles were based . Morgan &; Wright of Detroit also invented modifications of value . In these years , the bicycle became increasingly popular , so much so in fact that many a rubber company making tires may oe said to owe its survival in the panic of 1893 to the popularity of this means of locomotion . Tire making progressed rapidly in Europe simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original pneumatic tire made by the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth 's Cycle Agency , // Limited , and commonly known as the " Dunlop " from tile name of the inventor , holds the place of honor . Not only this , but the patents had been admitted by nearly all the tire makers ; and these were paying royalty . The 1893 pattern consisted of an air tube and an outer cover backed with strong canvas . Through the edges of this canvas continuous wire rings passed . These rings were smaller in circumference than the edge of the rim , but greater than the center ; and when the tire was inflated , they rested midway be-tween the two and could not slip off . The tire was fast , comfortable , and tough . Then there was the Scott tire ; and next came the Michelin tire , which was secured to a nearly flat rim by steel rings . The Sed-don tire was another pattern . Another group of tires may be described as the clincher variety , the cover be-ing secured to the rim by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North British Rubber Co. , was the originator of this class . There were several others . The Philadelphia Cycle Show in February , 1893 , marked a turning point of moment in tire history , for there the first cord tire was shown . The inventor was John F. Palmer of Chicago , and the manufacturer , the B. F. Goodrich Co. , of Akron . He attempted to embody a principle that secured the closure of any ordinary puncture that might occur in the tread . But it did not close punctures . Have we ever seen a tire that did ? Bicycles were soon everywhere . Bicycle racing be-came a sport of parts . In Europe , where the automobile development has not progressed in proportion to population so rapidly as in this country , the bicycle // is to-day seen upon the public road to a very much greater degree than here . In France in 1921 there were over 4,000,000 bicycles ; in England , about 5,000,000 ; and in America about 5,000,000 . The bicycle tire of the single-tube variety is made today in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bicycle tire in the United States is simply a tube , round in section and circular to fit the wheel , made of several layers of light fabric , proportioned to the degree of load that it must carry , with an inside layer of rubber to hold air , an outside layer of rubber to resist abrasion , and layers of rubber between the plies of cotton to hold them together , and the whole thing vulcanized in one process . If we were to go over into the bicycle tire department of any of the several manufacturers , we should find a process about like this : Frictioned and coated fabric to make up the plies giving strength to the tire has been previously prepared in the calendar room , where compounds are used that experience has proved good for the purpose . The rubber inner tube is laid upon the bias-cut fabric . These layers are as long as the circumference of the tire and as wide as the length around the section of it . A little extra is used to overlap or splice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edges of tube and fabric together from end to end around a . short , curved , hickory form , while the fabric lies upon a sheet-iron drum . Then he attaches the valve-stem , the form is pulled out , and the opening closed . The outside rubber parts , tread and side wall , are applied in sheet form , after which process a drum a little larger is // pulled over the now formed tire , and air is blown into it to press it between the drums . The outer drum by a quick motion is pushed along the inner , an action which serves to roll the inflated tire between the two drums and thus force all parts to stick together . The unvulcanized tire is formed in the same shape and size in which it comes into the market . It is taken to the vulcanizing or curing room , where it is laid in a two-part mold or doughnut of metal that has been hollowed to the exact size of the outside of the tire , the valve projecting out through an opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mold having been laid on , the mold is put into a hydraulic press , where pressure upon the mold closes it . Steam is then applied inside the tire , inflating it against the resistance of the heated mold and causing the rubber to flow into the markings that give form to the tread . Because of the heat of the steam inside and the heat of the mold from the steam in the press plates outside , the rubber composition quickly vulcanizes . This is the simple method of making a bicycle tire composed of square-woven fabric . There are , however , bicycle tires of cord construction . The first cord tire , the Palmer cord bicycle tire , showed so much greater resiliency than the square-woven fabric bicycle tire that many a race was won by means of it . It was an expensive tire to build , for it was before the days of the conception of a loom-prepared fabric made of cord . Nowadays , cord bicycle tires are made from the same type of fabric , although lighter in weight , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different weights : there are those // made of heavy fabric , suitable for all commercial and utility purposes ; there are medium-weight tires , which should be the choice of the average rider who uses his machine for general purposes ; and there are the light-weight tires for the man who wishes to go at the highest speed or to enter races . Here , the quality of rubber and the construction of the fabric make great differences in the resiliency and speed . As in the case of all articles , the rubber chemist designs his compositions each for a particular purpose ; thus the tread is carefully worked out to give resistance to abrasion , and the friction or layers of rubber which hold the plies of fabric together are designed to do that particular thing during the life of the tire . The bicycle has come into our lives to stay . It is a light , convenient little machine , which transports people easily and quickly and at the same time gives them some exercise . But as the boy , so may the man become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire . It set men thinking , too , about good roads . We owe much to Colonel Alfred A. Pope , who in 1893 sent out to the newspapers a circular letter urging the people of the country to petition Congress for the establishment of a Road Department and Institute of Road Engineering . He was the pioneer in this country for good roads . If the bicycle tire did nothing else it stimulated highway construction . CHAPTER IX THE PNEUMATIC AUTOMOBILE TIRE In China there was a horseless vehicle before 1600 . Vehicles propelled by foot and hand were known in Europe in the seventeenth century . A French physician made a mechanical vehicle in 1710 . Carriages with sails were early known in England . The period from 1800 to 1835 was a vastly busy one for steam engineers , and about that time the steam vehicle became fairly well established in England . The old Hancock steam carriage of England , called " the infant , " making regular trips between London and 6h-afford , was a forerunner of the modern interurban passenger bus . To its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first passenger automobile in the world , because he manufactured for himself a steam phaeton , used extensively about London , that was equipped with seats for three persons . Upon the internal combustion engine and the experiments of Daimler , Benz , and Selden the automotive industry to-day really rests . All the first cars , and particularly the steam ones , lacked strength and sturdiness ; they jarred themselves to pieces in a comparatively short time after being put into service . To be sure , the metals were not so good as 128 // those of to-day , for modern metallurgy is of relatively recent development ; but the main difficulty lay in the vibration caused by bad roads and lack of cushioning . True , the use of rubber for cushioning vehicles had been planned by Thomas Hancock in England . That , though , was before the days of vulcanization ; consequently his idea had no real value . It was therefore the discovery of the art of vulcanizing rubber and the making of tires from it that made possible the extended development of the automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States : the Duryea , the Ford , the Haynes , American cars , and the imported Benz . They were all experimental machines ; there was no market , and it was 1898 before the first bona-fide sale was consummated . Alexander Winton , who ranks almost with the pioneers from the point of view of experimentation , sold a one-cylinder Winton automobile ; he received payment for it and shipped the car April 1 , 1898 . Curious old things , they would make as much of a sensation on the road to-day as they did then , but for quite a different reason . The next time one of your tires blows out or is otherwise incapacitated for service , you might find it interesting if , instead of passing it on to the junk dealer , you would spend an hour in an examination of its construction . Whether your tire be " cord " or " squarewoven fabric , " cut a two-inch section out of it with a sharp knife from tread to bead , so that the edges will be smooth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are three necessary parts of a tire : the casing , // the tube , and the rim . By common consent the casing is called the tire . Without regard to the refinements of tire design , which may differ slightly with tires made by different manufacturing companies , one observes several parts , each of which is essential to the use and the serviceability of the tire . The bead , which is the part in immediate contact with the rim , serves to hold the tire in place ; without a bead or stiff part at the base of the tire , it would , under the strain of driving , quickly separate itself from the rim . In the early days drivers had many harrowing experiences with badly designed , primitive rims and beads that came off , left the car , and ran on ahead as though to point the way . In general use there are two types of beads : one , the clincher ; the other , the straight bead . The clincher bead was the first type and is hook-like at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three and three and one half inch sizes . In Europe it is still largely used in all sizes . Later development found in the straight bead a better type , which , by virtue of the metal strips within the bead , is inextensible ; it can not slip over the rim when expanded under air pressure . The straight bead or straight side tire has proved itself by tests and experience to be the best one in construction and service . This type of tire , other things being equal , lasts longer than any other ; for the stresses and strains set up in the fabric , which is the next basic element of tire construction , are less irregular when the plies are folded around a straight bead than when they are curved as sharply as in the clincher type . Europeans will come after a time to // r the more convenient demountable rim with its straight side tire . In a tire , we depend not alone upon the bead but also upon fabric . There are many niceties in the construction of cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cord fabric . Particularly must the cloth be processed in the rubber factory in such a way as to allow each layer or ply to work harmoniously under the bendings incident to service . When a thirty-two by four inch cord tire is inflated to sixty pounds of air pressure , there is exerted within it an outward force of thirty tons . When loaded to twelve hundred pounds , it is pressed in nearly three quarters of an inch ; and every time the wheel revolves , each part of the tire is deflected by that amount . It is constantly bent back and forth in service . VATire bent this way quickly breaks ; but the fabric bends over six million times in each ten thousand miles . The remarkable increase in tire service during the last five years , is due to the scientific adjustment of the threads that make up the fabric and cord , as well as to the greater resistance of the rubber layers to flexion and heat . This rubber layer called " friction and coat " holds the plies of fabric together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not rub against each other ; it is another of the essential elements in tire construction . The fabric moves over very small distances , yet sufficiently to develop heat . This rubber must serve as a permanent lubricant ; not temporarily , like the oil that is put in between the leaves of springs or into the transmission or the differential housing , for that can be changed every few hundred // miles , but permanently , because the rubber in the layers between the cords is put in at the time of manufacture and stays there until the tire is gone . There is no other substance yet found that will remain so permanent as vulcanized rubber under the heat and bending . But the cotton is equally important with rubber ; it is the backbone of the tire . The fabric of the so-called square-woven type is manufactured by those operations generally used for ordinary cotton cloth . That is to say , the fibers are twisted into yarn and the yarn into threads , and the threads are then woven into cloth upon a loom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and twist ; one set known as " warp " is interwoven with another set called " filling , " and each runs under and over the one adjacent to it . Because as the tire bends , these interlocked threads wear against each other , the fabric tire gives a shorter mileage than the cord tire . A study of a tire section or of a piece of fabric shows this wavy condition . The cord tire is made from thread fabric . The warp is constructed of cords of the right number of fibres , twisted to the proper size and woven on a loom with relatively few filling threads of a light nature to hold the cords together in manufacture . Usually there are only five filling threads in two inches of cord fabric . During frictioning , the warp threads straighten out into approximately parallel lines , no one of which is in contact with its adjacent partner . In the cord tire each cord or layer of cords is separated from every other by rubber ; in the fabric tire each thread overlaps the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between cord and fabric tires . The repeated flexing a tire is subjected to is one of the elements of wear , indeed a major element , which cotton resists and other materials do not . In various parts of the tire there are several different weaves used . The breaker fabric with its peculiar construction permits the strength and the resistance to motion necessary to maintain the tread upon the closely woven body-fabric . The thinner , smaller weaves , in lapping the bead , play a most important part in the quality of the ultimate product ; but , in themselves , they are relatively simple , both in grade of cotton fiber and method of weave . The tire designer must select his cotton , for the cotton fiber or staple varies greatly in length . The diameter of one fiber is so small that if you were to lay two thousand of them side by side , they would measure only one inch . Tiny and fragile as they are , these fibers , when properly chosen with respect to length and twisted together , become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty by three and one half inch cord tire there are over 1700 miles of fiber if placed end to end ; but in a cord tire thirty-five by five there are more than 5700 miles . The builder 's choice of fibers of the proper length gives strength and service to the tire fabric . Yet , as is the case with men in the army , it is not necessarily the largest ones that we depend upon for the most work . Fibers vary in length up to one and three quarters inches . How important a part is played by organization ! In the case of the tire , the fibers are organized by cottonmill operations into fabric and then built up by the // rubber maker into a tire , to the end that each ply , each thread , and each fiber work in unison . The manufacturer who is able so to control his millions of little staples that they will act as one is the Marshal Foch of tire service . When tires are run under-inflated or overloaded , the harmony of this organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector , which throws too much strain on the inside plies . As a consequence , breaking begins . In tread design a cue is taken from Mother Nature , who grows tough skin on the bottom of a dog 's foot and furthermore cushions it by pads of soft flesh . The tread of the tire is the wearing surface , a tough composition ; but under it is a yielding foundation , soft , flexible , and snappy . The black tread has been evolved after a painstaking , intricate study , and the chemists have worked long and diligently in their laboratories to produce such a highly resilient rubber mixture . When tested on machines built for the purpose against the abrasive action of carborundum , these treads outwear dry leather by about two and one half times ; with both materials wet , they outwear leather more than ten times . An interesting test was run some years ago to compare sheet-iron and several rubber compositions . This black rubber mixture resisted the action of a powerful sand blast three times as long as iron . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire is the material most resistant to road abrasion that the chemist in his laboratory has been able to produce . A tire is not a tire until it has air in it . The inner tube has one purpose ? to hold air . Although there // have been various attempts to substitute other things than air ( and far be it from me to condemn research in this direction ) , thus far no substance with which to support the tire has been found equal to air . It is the most easily obtained ; it is the most springy substance known ; and its only weakness is the ease with which it escapes through a very small hole . Despite the study of puncture-proofing and the substitution of other substances , none of them has met with sufficient popular service to call it important to the tire industry . The tube , made of a very extensible rubber mixture , is the simplest part of a tire . Stretch a piece of an old one . Notice how the part next to the tread has deteriorated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim is still strong . In designing tube thicknesses and sizes , tire designers try to choose the correct thickness , length , and diameter to permit the tube to run many miles beyond the distance that the casing will run . A trick here lies in the design , in the compounding , and in the type of vulcanization , which gives to the tube such resistance to heat that it does not become weakened or assume a permanently large size , a condition making it impossible to put the tube back into another casing after the original one has been used up . The flap of the straight-side tire is a little article that is often overlooked . It is a piece of formed fabric and rubber used only in straight-side tires , for the purpose of preventing this soft rubber tube from forcing itself down underneath the bead . Many of the troubles of motorists are due to the flap , which , during the hasty application of the tire , flap , and tube figure // to inflate with any means at hand in those days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . The history of the cord tire has been somewhat obscured . John F. Palmer patented it for bicycles in America in 1892 . He took his patents to England , where the new tires were so much faster in bicycle racing that the officials handicapped the riders who used them . It was a gift of free advertising which led to the prompt adoption by all riders and the extended use of the " Palmer Tyre " made by Mr. C. H. Gray at the India Rubber Works , Silvertown , near London . Mr. Thomas Sloper , however , in 1891 had conceived the cord idea and filed a provisional specification in the British Patent Office . Manufacturers would not listen to him when he sought their interest with his germ of a great idea . So the final specification was not filed , and the aggressive Palmer captured the English market . Palmer adapted his principle to the automobile tire in 1895 but his web tire failed . His all-warp fabric with fine weft threads , however , was the forerunner and basis of the thread fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed by Mr. C. H. Gray , who foresaw the value of the idea for automobiles and developed a successful cord tire , called the Palmer Tyre , which was later taken to America and made by the Diamond Rubber Co. and the B. F. Goodrich Co. , with many improvements , as the Silvertown Cord Tire . How ideas travel ! The cord idea began in America , // went to England a bicycle tire , and returned grownup into the automobile tire . But the English tire contained two plies of heavy cord , like rope . To attain simplicity of manufacture , Americans took the lead again . The M.organ and Wright Co . ( U. S. Tire Co. ) and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. almost simultaneously came forth with tires made of woven thread fabric . It was not a success at first . When the tires came to be inflated upon a bag during cure , and the methods improved , the nearly perfect cord tires as we know them were the result . Let us take a trip into the factory and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been mixed in the mill-room , is delivered into another room ; the beads are formed in still a different part of the factory ; and the side walls , which have been rolled out on the sheeting calenders , go into still a different room : it is a huge plant in all , turning out thirty-thousand tires every day , fifteen miles of them rolling out every twenty-four hours . The tire factory is , to say the least , a lively place . A visitor finds a seeming confusion of men , machinery , fabric , and rubber , with tires the outcome . It is not easy to picture the making of a tire , for each part is made in a different part of the plant and assembled at the building machine . Cord fabric is frictioned and coated with a resilient compound on the three-roll calenders of the calender room . Here the steel wipes or frictions rubber around the threads . All cotton in a tire mill is called fabric . Since the threads of the fabric run at an angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire , the fabric must be cut on the bias . And so large , heavy rolls of this rubberized fabric are conveyed by the truck system into the bias cutting room , where they are carried through rapidly operating bias cutters that shear off certain widths . Operators roll them up , keeping plain fabric , known as " liners , " between them , so that the adjacent layers of unvulcanized rubber may not stick to itself and make the building of the tire impossible . These bias blocks are then conveyed to a table where workmen overlap the edges , using the proper width for the different sizes and different plies . After being thus spliced , they are rolled up into bundles , each separated by liners , in the proper length to make a given number of tires of a certain size . The same cutting to width and length of the breaker fabric is done in different places , as is the cutting of the side-wall sheet rubber . The tread rubber is carried to the tread-forming room , where the rubber is softened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubing machine , coming out of this die at a definite thickness and width for each different size of tire . In some factories these treads are formed on a calender , and in some by a tubing machine ; but , in any event , the exact width and thickness at each point is controlled by measurement . The operations are conducted by skilled men , to make certain that the exact weight , necessary not only for economy but for quality , is gained . Meanwhile , by an operation that would take a chapter in itself to describe fully , the bead is prepared . If it is a rubber bead , it has been formed on a tubing maTHE // chine and pressed in a hot mold to a defined size , with a layer of fabric around it . At the building machine , one sees the operators fit in the proper place a metal core . This core is designed to be of the size that is correct for the inside of the tire , depending upon the process by which it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finally to be finished in a mold , this core is of exactly the size ; if it is a cord tire , however , the core is a little smaller , for the mold operation in making a cord tire consists of stretching it , while being vulcanized , upon an airor water-bag . According to the construction of the tire , the plies of canvas are wound on this core by a machine in the order in which they have been laid up by those who spliced the bias strips together . The operator places the end of the canvas roll carefully upon the core , and sets the machine in motion . The tackiness of the rubber makes it stick to the metal ; and the fabric is stretched at exactly the necessary tension as it is wound on the core . Meanwhile , rollers are pressed by weights or springs upon the fabric in order to join the plies to each other firmly . Half the fabric previously having been put on the machine , the earlier formed bead is applied on top of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the building the bead is wrapped about by the body plies . After the necessary plies have thus been built up , and the previously formed combination of tread , breaker-fabric , and cushion have been laid on and rolled down under pressure , the tire is taken to what is known as a finishing stand . Here the side walls are applied and the tire inspected . // To gain accuracy and speed , much nice inventive work has been done in the making of tire-building machinery . Machine-built tires are more precise and uniform than those built by hand . Before the tire is modeled to its approximate shape and ready for the final step of molding , there are a number of operations to be performed by these machines . If it be a fabric tire , the operators who work on the finishing stand lift it to a rack on a truck . If it be a cord tire , on the other hand , it is sent to a stripping table , where the core is removed , the tire is dusted on the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick rubber , which has been previously painted with soapstone solution to prevent it from curing to the fabric , is inserted . If it be a fabric tire , it then must go down to the vulcanizing room , where there are long rows of heaters . The tire is trucked to these heaters ; and a mold , in two halves , is brought by a powerful conveyor , in front of the workmen , who lift the tire and its core and place it in the lower half of this mold . The mold has been designed so that it is of exactly the exterior shape that the tire is to have when finished , including all the lettering and other features . As the tire travels along a metal belt , the top half of the mold comes down from an automatic conveyor that has carried it out of the way above the operators , and is carefully guided into place on the tire . The mold gaps open , for the tire in this form does not fit it exactly . In the mold are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the tire away from the mold until pressure forces it into place . Carried away on the automatic conveyor , the tire , // together with many others , is loaded into the shell of the vulcanizer , in the bottom of which is a plate or platen , which , before the mold was filled , rested in a position nearly at the top of the heater . This platen is fixed upon a plunger moved by water pressure in a cylinder below . The lowering is . done by simply pushing the molds down a short inclined plane upon the platen , until there has been made a stack of twenty to twenty-five molds in the heater . After this , the cover is placed on this open vulcanizer ; by a simple device it is locked in place so that no steam can escape . The molds are then forced together by hydraulic pressure and the soft rubber takes the form of the mold , after which process steam is applied and the vulcanization is begun . Great accuracy has been gained in recent years from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to turn but one valve to maintain an exact temperature during the desired time . At the end of the time , it automatically turns the heat off and gives a signal by which the operators know that the vulcanizer is ready to be discharged . In the discharge the hydraulic ram raises the molds to a height where the men can pull them by a rope and a winch upon the traveling conveyor , along which they are carried . The two halves of each mold are separated , the tire removed , and the mold again filled . These are to the production man beautiful operations that give rapidity and accuracy to the vulcanization of tires . ? In the case of a cord tire , a somewhat different process is used ; for , as stated , an air- or water-bag is // placed in the tire . The tire is then put in the lower half of the mold ; the upper half is lowered on it . Air or water connections are made to proper pipes . When the tire is in the vulcanizer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch the tire and drive it by internal pressure against the mold . The object desired in cord tire vulcanizing , is so to design and mold tires that the fabric will not be displaced . After vulcanization , the casing is lifted from the mold , removed from the core or water-bag , and sent to the inspection room , where it is coated on the inside with mica paint to prevent the inner tube from sticking to it . Then it is wrapped for distribution . The manufacture of inner tubes is very simple when compared with the manufacture of the tire case . The tube , with the exception of the reinforcement around the valve , is made of one composition , sheeted on a sheeting calender to the proper thickness to make a tube of a given size . This sheeted rubber is then transferred from the central calender room to the tube department , having been previously cut to a width desired for each size . Then it is unrolled and separated from the liner upon a zinc-topped table , where it is cut to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each particular size . Carefully , it is rolled upon a former or mandrel , which is simply an iron pipe carefully polished and of the correct diameter to give the inside size of the tube . In some factories the tube is formed on a tubing machine , in which case it is extruded from the die of the machine , round in section . Then it is cut to the length required ; after which process it is carefully stretched upon the manTHE // drel . Once , however , upon the mandrel , whether sheeted or extruded , it is wrapped with fabric . After this operation , it is stacked on trucks , the units being separated by iron plates at the end ; and the truck-load of mandrels with their rubber tubes upon them are pushed into long horizontal vulcanizers , the doors closed , and steam turned in . Sometimes the valve-pad reinforcement , which is a combination of rubber and fabric cut to an oval shape , is applied be-fore vulcanizing ; at others it is applied after vulcaniz-ing . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mandrel by the simple process of blowing air between the tube and the mandrel . Taken to another room the tubes have , by a skilfully used bit of apparatus , the two ends buffed , cemented , and vulcanized together . From here , the tubes are sent to a table where the valve stem is applied , if it has not been applied , as in some plants , before the splicing operation . They are then inspected in water for leaks , and packed for shipment . How should we take care of a tire , The principle developed in the field of engineering of only loading a beam to within a reasonable factor of safety applies here . If you build a house , you make certain that the beams underneath your floor are large enough to carry many times the greatest load that you ever expect to assemble upon that floor . Look at the picture of a tire section under no load , normal load , and overload . The inside of the tire has become flattened with over-load or under-inflation , conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside layers or plies , slightly shorter than the outside layers from bead to // bead , then carry too great a proportion of the load . As a result , when that tire is driven over a stone , it is liable to take a shape that seriously distorts it . And , too , because of greater internal friction , the amount of heat is increased . Hence , the fabric weakens , the rubber deteriorates rapidly , and the little fibers one by one begin to break ; until some day , when least expected , one of the plies will break through Then , instead of a six- or eight-ply tire , there will be only five or six . As in the case of a rope with one strand broken , the load becomes excessive for the other strands ; and some time thereafter they will break down with the usual blow-out . A tire is really a suspension-bridge , the cords being fixed at the two beads and shaped by air pressure . The air is not much compressed during service , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary tension and to permit them to work in the most natural way . Of the total power of the motor in an automobile , part is absorbed in the mechanism of the car and the remainder , estimated to be more than 80 per cent. , is transmitted to the rear tires to be expended in pushing the machine against the wind , up hill , and against other resistances . Driving over bricks and bumps , dodging around automobiles at the side of the road , our tires are subjected to power as well as dead load and to sudden changes in strain . These jerks , bumps , and cuts by rough stones on the road 's edge , that let water into the fabric , are the killing forces that destroy tires . If tires were treated as most of our property is , we should carefully examine them month by // month . The older ones should be shifted from the position of greatest work , namely , the rear , to the front ; for we should think of them as old faithful horses gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones are called upon to carry the heaviest burdens . How much work does a tire do , If one thirty-two by four inch tire on the rear wheel of a car carrying a load of fifteen hundred pounds runs ten thousand miles up a 4.4 per cent . grade , the work it has to do , engineers tell us , is 2026 horse-power hours . This is equivalent to lifting more than four billion pounds of stone up one foot . The computation , to be sure , assumes the tire to be on the up-grade all the way ; but if it goes up-grade only one quarter of the time , the work done would lift the Washington Monument about twelve feet . When your tire goes one hundred miles , it does as much work as you would do if you shoveled 220 tons of coal into your second-story window . During such a job you would perspire pretty freely ; the tire heats , too . We have learned by experiment that when this four-inch tire was run for an hour at twenty miles per hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had increased 37 ? degrees ; at forty miles an hour , the increase was 75 degrees . In the hot days with the thermometer ninety-five degrees in the shade , and 110 degrees on the road surface , imagine the tire heated to 180 degrees , or nearly enough to boil water . Is it any wonder that the rubber wears rapidly then ? These figures of temperature show that the motorist has considerable to fear if he rides at excessive speed // in hot weather , or if he permits his air inflation to be reduced to the point where there is maximum flexing and consequently increased rise in temperature . Regardless of that , rubber tires resist just such wear to a greater degree than any other known structure . Motoring is not wholly a matter of engines and chassis . " Bone-shaker " vehicles are gone forever . To the pneumatic tire may be given credit for the astounding growth of the automobile , for it has permitted both speed and comfort . CHAPTER X TRANSPORTATION BY TRUCK Transportation is a mighty word . Indeed , civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and materials . The change from the days when each household was self-sustaining and all life was agricultural is a history of transportation . The Neanderthal man killed his meat in the forest and carried it to his cave . He lived from day to day . The barter principle of trade was given up only as transportation made possible the movement of commodities from distant fields of origin to centers of use . Banks , warehouses , and exchange systems depend upon movements of goods over the world 's highways . After human effort came the ox-team , after that the horse-drawn wagon , then the railroad , and finally the improved highway for motor transportation . In fact , if one looks over the world as it is now , he finds each of these ancient and modern methods of movement realized in different parts of it . The measure of the intelligence of peoples , in any event the standard by which they are rated in the family of nations , is pretty largely that of the efficiency of their transportation systems . The famines in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were provinces filled with starving people , and but a few short miles 149 // away , as we in the United States measure distance , there was plenty of food ; yet the lack of highways made it impossible to move the food to those who needed it most . Our great railways are main lines of travel , requiring secondary lines with fast and prompt service to feed them with the products of the soil and industry . For this purpose the motor-truck , developed during the last two decades , constitutes at once the most spectacular and efficient means . The tourist does not enjoy the crowded thoroughfare ; his horn too often fails to stir the truck driver ahead to yield half of the pavement . Yet the very freight the truck carries means the prosperity that makes touring possible . The motor-truck takes its value from certain characteristics that may be termed fundamental . It can move goods at relatively high speed ; its power is sufficient to permit its carrying loads of any size to meet the demands of industrial and commercial enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle , to various service requirements . The milk-truck in early dawn rushes its supply from the farm dairies to the centers from which babies are fed ; dirt from excavations for sky-scrapers is hauled away in dump-trucks ; the department-store delivers its merchandise for miles into the country . Through the efficiency of the truck , regularity of service is habitual , although still the condition of roads affects seriously the movement and life of the vehicles . There is , to be sure , some difference of opinion among students of motor transportation as to how far the range of trucking may be considered efficient . The railroad , however , is the main // line and the motor-truck the feeder , or the rapid means of communication between adjacent industries or cities . Motor transportation is economical , for the cost per ton mile has been reduced to a point making the extension and use of trucks possible . Probably the truck will never be able to compete with the railroad on long hauls . Recent years have witnessed a striking change and development in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious competitor of the trolley-car . Both the bus and the street-car have their definite places ; each has its advantages . I would not wish to say that either will displace the other . The motor omnibus systems in New York , London , and Paris as well enough known to support a conception that they would not be conducted upon so extended a scale were not the cost of transportation low and the profits unmistakable . Freedom of movement ; ability to follow the lines of growth of the community and so give service where the laying of tracks for trolley-cars would be highly expensive ; avoiding obstacles , as in the case of parades , fires , or temporary obstructions ? this fundamental principle of flexibility , without doubt , renders the motor-bus a means of passenger transportation that has come to stay and that will develop in the future . Recently some busses have been run on rails , but they are still in an experimental form . There is no one of these different types of motor-trucks , busses , or cars in which rubber or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential . Indeed , a feature of the latest addition to this family is the cushion driving wheel of the rail car , in which , underneath the usual // steel wheel and protected from the weather by side flanges , is a special rubber cushion to give comfort to the rider . The rubber tire , therefore , is a commodity without which it is doubtful if any of these transportation schemes would serve . From the time when Sir Isaac Newton , in 1680 , suggested the steam-driven wagon , down through the years , attempts have been made to revolutionize transportation by sell - propelled vehicles . The early disappointments and failures of the steam wagon in its various forms were due to the lack of a soft cushion to smooth out road inequalities and to reduce vibration . Probably for this reason more than any other , these early rapid-transit enthusiasts came to the invention of the solid road-bed and the smooth rails that we associate with the railroad . The first plan to avoid shocks was to cushion the wheels with tires of solid rubber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . The electric vehicle pioneered by Colonel A. L. Riker in 1898 was one of the earliest truck developments , although the steam truck was more fully worked out in England and the gasolene internal combustion engine was developed in France and America . One still sees on the English streets steam-driven trucks . For all of these heavy services the solid motor tire , which was a natural offshoot of the solid carriage tire , has proved to be the most logical medium by which cushioning , long life , and efficiency can be gained . The solid tire differs from the pneumatic tire , which is so vital to passenger-car transportation , in being rubber all the way through . The inventor of the original solid rubber tire is unTRANSPORTATION // known . The history of tires in England seems to give credit to Thomas Ilancock who , in his book written in 1856 , suggests solid rubber tires to relieve vibration . They were , however , manufactured before 1856 , for the records show the firm of Charles Mackintosh &; Co. , to have manufactured such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " These tires are about an inch and a half wide and one and a quarter thick . Wheels shod with them make no noise and they greatly relieve concussion of pavements and rough roads ; they have lately been patronized by Her Majesty . " But because of their sticky qualities and the property of softening readily with heat , these early tires gave a relatively short service . There is a patent on record in England , granted to Thomas Smith in 1845 , the principle of which was spokes set within a felloe of metal in a trough-like form , the open part be-ing outward and containing a tire . No mention , how-ever , is made of rubber in connection with this patent . During 1856 , in England , M. Coles Fuller brought out a combination solid tire composed of cloth , canvas , or other fibrous materials . The first introduction of solid tires for cabs in Lon-don was in 1861 , but difficulties were experienced in attaching the rubber to the wheels . In 1863 N. H. Carmont took out a patent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dovetailed section to receive the rubber tires , which were grooved to fit the channel . Later , another company , known as the Noise-less Tyre . Co. , was formed to furnish tires for the Shrewsbury Cab Co. , the first firm to introduce the use of solid rubber tires in England . Upon the invention // of the bicycle in England in 1867 , it was found necessary to relieve the vibrations of the old " boneshaker " ; and solid rubber tires were manufactured that were cemented into a groove in the rim of the machine . These tires were followed in 1879 by cushion tires , which , although no larger in diameter , possessed increased resiliency produced by a small hole running through the center . They were specially devised for what was then known as the " safety " machine , which followed the old high bicycle . The introduction of the motor-bus in England necessitated a further departure with regard to rubber tires . Not only were pneumatic tires out of the question , but it was found impossible to retain solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seven tons was imposed upon it . Therefore , it was necessary to vulcanize some sort of a retaining band in the bed of the rubber . Now , it is a very difficult matter to unite thoroughly a non-yielding body like steel with an elastic body of the nature of rubber . In time , this has been effected . So metal rings of various sections were used for this purpose , and detachable rims enabled these ring sections to be fitted on the felloe of the wheel . But the Scotland Yard authorities prohibited the use of sectional tires for use on public vehicles in England ; and this action , to some extent , checked the development of this class of tire . The Shrewsbury &; Talbot tire , the trade name of the Carmont tire , was introduced into New York . It at once gained approval , and it remained until later development drove it from the market . It is interesting how the point of view of the public has changed in the // last fifty years , for the early solid tire offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received with the unfailing skepticism then ready for anything in the nature of an innovation . Because rubber wheels made no noise , they were considered detrimental to the safety of pedestrians ; and the inventors were deterred from taking out patents by the authorities , who warned the manufacturers that vehicles equipped with such tires were a menace to public safety . We even find the rubber sole and the rubber heel catalogued under the name of " sneakers , " even though the safety and comfort of the user , as well as economy , are increased by their use . The most practical development of the solid tire for carriage purposes was one invented by Arthur W. Grant , later known as the Kelly-Springfield tire , which probably more than any other one invention led to the popularity of rubber on horse-drawn vehicles . The rubber was held in place on the wheel by means of longitudinal wires running through the tire and forming circles of smaller circumference than the rim flanges . Built of long-lived rubber mixtures , this tire was capable of positive attachment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was modified by the socalled " side-wire " carriage tire , invented by James A. 1Swinehart of Akron , in which the wires were passed outside the rubber body . The automobile has so completely dominated the field that the horse-drawn vehicle has become only a means of wagon transportation , and the internal wire or any other type of carriage tire has essentially disappeared . We need not , therefore , describe the nu156 THE REIGN OF RUBBER merous other methods of holding a piece of solid vulcanized rubber on a wheel for carriage purposes . After years of development and trial , the solid truck tire of to-day has come down to us in one form : a steel base upon which is a layer of hard rubber , and , upon that , the mass of soft rubber giving comfort , cushioning , and resistance to wear . The function of the motor-truck tire is to provide traction for the wheels , and , as a protection to the mechanism of the truck and load upon it , to cushion them . The first idea of the metal-base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of dovetails . Into these grooves was forced a layer of rubber mixture that would become hard rubber on vulcanization . This served as a stiff base impossible to remove from the steel , although chemically not united with it . Before vulcanization of the hard rubber , a layer of a resilient tread composition was applied , and the whole vulcanized in a mold under pressure , so as to form the shape desired . Thus was developed the wireless tire introduced into the market in 1909 . To-day the steel-base tire is universally used on motor-trucks and is called the truck tire . The steel base on which this solid truck tire is built is a continuous band of channel-steel , the lower surface of which is smooth and the surface between the flanges machined with a series of circumferential slots that in cross-section have the appearance of dovetailed depressions . Because accuracy of measurement is important , that they fit the wheels , the manufacture of these bases is a specialized process in steel mills . They must also be made to fit exactly into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the vulcanization process . In the course of manufacture , the surface of the steel is roughened ' by numerous corrugations . In some factories fine , sharp , flint-sand is blown against the base with a powerful air-blast ; in others , it is copperplated ; in others , it is treated with acid to pit the surface with an infinite number of fine depressions . The purpose of this work is to give a surface to which the hard rubber mixture may hold in innumerable little points of attachment , these points making the security of the hard rubber base certain . In the operation of manufacture in the rubber mill , after the metal base is thus cleaned , in order to fill these little depressions with a hard rubber composition , it is coated with cement . After drying , this base or permanent band is mounted upon a horizontal shaft placed in front of a special calender . The hard rubber compound containing an amount of sulphur approximating 32 per cent . by weight of the crude rubber has previously been mixed in the mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that serve to vulcanize it simultaneously with the wearing part . This hard rubber compound is softened and passed through the rolls of the calender , which form a sheet of unvulcanized hard rubber mixture , the precise width of that part of the base between the flanges . When the proper amount adheres to this steel band , the base , with its layer of unvulcanized hard rubber , is taken to another calender , where a continuous sheet of a soft rubber mixture is run , until the right thickness , depending upon the size of the tire , is rolled up upon it . At this point , the cal158 THE REIGN OF RUBBER endering operation is stopped , and the tire is removed from the support of the wheel . Rectangular in section , it then is taken to the trimming machine , where the excess of soft rubber is removed . By this process the shape in section of the tire is made as nearly as possible to conform to the shape desired after vulcanization . The soft or wearing rubber may be applied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened upon a warming-up mill . After softening it the workmen feed it into the opening in a heavy tubing machine , where it is forced by great pressure through a die . From the die the rubber issues as a long , solid mass . The die is the shape in section that the finished tire is expected to be . Different sized tires ? four-inch , five-inch , six-inch , seven-inch , etc. , ? require dies corresponding approximately to the size desired . The mass of rubber is forced through this die until a strip a little longer than the circumference of the tire has been passed out of the machine . It is then cut off and laid away to cool . Finally , when ready for building up on the hard rubber base that has been run on the calender , this mass of soft rubber is roughened on the surface where it will be in contact with the hard rubber . After being carefully cemented with a rubber cement and dried , it is placed in what is known as an up-setting machine capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds . This long mass of rubber is there applied carefully to the hard rubber ; and after preliminary pressing and the fitting together of the two ends , it is in the approximate form in which it will issue from the mold . // By either of these two processes , the calendering process or tubing-machine process , we have a steel base with a hard rubber layer upon it , and upon that the mass of soft rubber of the size and form of the final truck tire . This tire is then taken to the vulcanizing or curing room , ready for the final operation of vulcanizing . The vulcanizing process is similar in principle to that used with a pneumatic tire ; that is , the doughnuts , with their tires in them , are placed upon a movable plate or platen held at the top of a hollow , cylindrical shell known as the " heater " or " vulcanizer . " By mechanical devices the molds are pushed on top of the plate , the plate is lowered by letting out a little water through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the first . The tires then are pressed by hydraulic pressure into the exact shape and conformation of the inside of the moulds . When the steam is turned into the vulcanizer around the molds , the vulcanizing operation begins . There is probably no part of rubber operation that requires greater care in manufacture than this one of vulcanizing or curing a solid tire . Not only are we dealing here with rubber that is to be vulcanized , but with a thick mass of rubber . The thermal conductivity of rubber is very low ; in other words , it is a very good heat-insulating material . Furthermore , various compounds are different in their resistance to the passage of heat through them . It requires from one to two hours to bring the temperature of the center of an ordinary-sized solid tire up to that of vulcanization . For this reason , solid-tire curing temperatures have // usually been kept relatively low and the time of vulcanization relatively long . After the vulcanization is completed , cold water in some plants is run into the heater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal and rubber . The control of steam has been maintained by automatic temperature-controlling apparatus , the materials have been carefully examined , and every possible precaution necessary to insure uniformity of one of the most delicate products made has been taken ? a ppoduet that is submitted to tremendous variations in service . After the tire comes from the mould , it is inspected , the little extra amount of rubber that has flowed out of the mold and which is known as rind , or overflow , is cut off , and the tire is ready for sale . The solid tire of the permanent-band type is then ready to be applied to the wheel , and much of its service depends upon proper application . To apply the tire , the wheel is removed from the truck and laid upon a heavy press operated by hydraulic power . The tire , which fits the felloe band of the wheel tightly , is placed in position ; then the two plates are brought together , the action forcing the band or base of the tire upon the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in any event , far more pressure than any tire will ever be subjected to in service . There have been several types of demountable tires made which are capable of application in a garage or on the road ; but they are gradually disappearing because they work loose . Since the tire itself is so heavy , one or two men can scarcely apply it while the wheel is still on the truck . Therefore , the permanent bandTRANSPORTATION // pressed-on type has come to be the most largely used truck tire . We see some wheels equipped with two tires in the rear ; these tires or " duals " have a wide use because two tires radiate the heat more readily than one . Since there is not so heavy a mass of rubber to absorb the heat , there is consequently not so much difficulty of radiation . And there seems to be a somewhat greater gasolene efficiency from the truck when there is a relatively small amount of rubber in actual contact with the road . Skidding , too , is reduced by the dual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible for a fleet of trucks to carry the same size of tires in front and in rear , using them singly on the front wheels and in pairs on the rear ones . The large single tire , however , has its field ; and it would be scarcely wise to say that . any one type of tire , single , dual , or any other , has an unlimited field of usefulness . The solid tire is . prohahly subject to more abuse than any other rubber article , loaded as it often is to double the amount the tests have proved advisable . Run at speeds by which a high degree of heat is generated , the mass of rubber being unable to radiate its heat so easily as a pneumatic tire , truck tires have been known to absorb heat until the temperature inside them has become so great that the rubber decomposed with a generation of gases , and the tires blew out . In all the data that have been gained about blow-outs it is a safe statement that they rarely occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is beyond the ability of tires to stand it . This raises one of the vital questions for the truck user ; // namely , the relation of size of tire to the load he expects to carry . Despite all arguments to the contrary , it is economy for him in the long run , whether he uses one make of tire or another , to put on his truck that tire proportioned in size to the loads that he wishes to carry , to the speed the truck will stand or the law allows , and to the road conditions . By so doing , he will gain a service before the tire is broken down that will make additional cost for the larger tire an economy rather than an expense . Non-skid devices on solid tires , such as chains , cause some trouble , and there is a certain amount of confusion among users about them . While on the pneumatic tire the chain is capable of movement , on the solid tire there usually is but one place where it sets itself against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is true that wherever rubber comes in contact with an inflexible body , such as metal , it will wear out rapidly . Thus the chain wears out the solid tire at its points of contact . This has led the manufacturers to develop non-skid tires , which have served to hinder slipping upon wet pavement , snow , or ice . There is still a great field , however , for improvement in devices which will resist the slipping tendency and yet in no way injure the product . Many trucks are equipped with large pneumatic cord tires , some of them as much as nine inches in sectional diameter . These extra large ones have found their way into extended practical use , although the sixinch , seven-inch , and eight-inch tires are the usual sizes . The fundamental advantages resulting from the use of pneumatic tires on trucks are cushioning and // traction greater than can be obtained from the solid tire . The cushioning ability of a pneumatic tire , when not inflated too highly , is about four times that df a solid tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of the truck is faster , with consequent economy of operation ; there is less injury to a fragile load , for the riding is easier ; but there is grave danger from blow-outs and punctures . Generally , pneumatic tires have been used only on the smaller trucks , namely , those up to three tons in carrying capacity ; for the four and five-ton trucks the solid tire still leads . Technical men still discuss the practicability of pneumatic tires , on trucks . There are delays caused by the changing of tires even when demountable rims are used . Since the rim and the tire are heavy , and the rim is generally rusted on , the time required to make a change is often a serious matter . Furthermore , the air pressure carried , from ninety pounds in a sixinch size up to 130 pounds in the nine-inch size , is much higher than for the smaller tires . Most garages are not equipped with pumps capable of maintaining these higher pressures . And , too , the center of gravity of the trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid tire . This has led to a few accidents when blow-outs have occurred and trucks have toppled over on the road . As a rule though , such difficulties have not been numerous ; and the pneumatic tire on trucks is probably here to stay . Such beautiful products are these big pneumatic tires that it is always a pity when a puncture does occur , to see them ruined before the truck can be stopped . // Although some wonderful long-distance hauling from the rubber metropolis , Akron , to Boston and to San Francisco has been done on trucks equipped with pneumatic tires , experience differs . Many seem to believe that the pneumatic tire spares the trucks numerous jars and strains ; and , therefore , the truck itself can be made lighter . But , and this is important , if the truck be spared jars , it is because of the air-cushion . Because these cord tires contain eight to sixteen plies of cord fabric , they are stiff . To attain long life for them enough air pressure must be used to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elasticity of air enables the tire to absorb jars ; therefore , when air pressure is high , the tire is hard ? indeed , more so than a solid tire . Then the purpose is defeated . Highway engineers realize that when the pneumatic tire is inflated as it should be , the pressure to the square inch of road contact is the same regardless of the load carried , and is based entirely on the necessary inflation pressure . If in obtaining wider area of contact the inflation pressure is reduced , the tire will become unduly flattened ? a condition which will lead to rapid deterioration . To balance low air pressure for softness against high pressure for mileage is not possible in large pneumatic tires . The solid tire , being made completely of rubber , bulges out under load , because it can not be compressed , but it is sufficiently plastic to flow . If you place a pencil with the soft eraser upright on the desk and push it downward , the eraser will bulge at the sides ; it is not compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way ; and as it spreads on the pavement , this so-called traction wave flows around continually through various sections of the tire and causes internal action . The designers , however , have so arranged the shape of the tire that even if it does flow , only internal heat results , which , if the tire is used properly with respect to the load carried , does not become sufficiently excessive to have a serious effect upon its life . Since there is no danger from punctures , cuts , and so on , the average mileage of the solid tire is greater than that of the pneumatic tire . Of recent years , a new idea has been expressed in the building of tires that combine the softness of the pneumatic under low inflation and the length of life of the solid . Resilient solid tires capable of service under heavy trucks will solve the truck tire problem ; for these permit speed , ease of riding , freedom from changes on the road , and longer mileage than is possible from the large pneumatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In truck transportation heavy loads are demanded . Can the roads stand the pressure ? A road is , after all , nothing more or less than a hard layer of material , brick , concrete , macadam , upon native soil . If this layer is made thick enough , heavy loads may be carried over it without danger of breaking through . But when , as has been the case in too many instances , the highway engineers have simply floated a thin layer of brick and concrete upon clay without drainage to remove water , the trucks have actually broken through . Increased speed of a vehicle tremendously increases the impact that its wheels make on the roadway where // there is any unevenness . However , the answer to the maintenance of roads probably lies less in a limitation either of the type of tire or of the width of contact with the road than in road construction . Roads should be heavy enough to carry the future motor transport . Since motor transportation on highways is here to stay , would it not be wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traffic with safety ; of a construction sufficiently deep to carry increased tonnages at low cost per ton-mile ; with a drainage system to carry off the water ? Roads should permit permanence and flexibility to the development of motor transportation . Even as they are , streams of trucks carry goods and people over hundreds of routes . Statistics may be dry , but they stimulate the imagination . In the economics of truck use , railroad men recognize the advantage of the motor-truck in short branch-line operation , trap-car service , suburban distribution , terminal distribution , and the utilization of outlying yards in lieu of yards in congested districts . In the handling of food supplies from farm to city the radius has been extended by about fifty miles , a matter of vital moment for milk and other perishables , which serves to save time for the farmer and to reduce the cost of living . Education is affected . Consolidated schools in country communities , with the improvements thereby obvious , have been made possible through the speed and safety of the motor-bus for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent to which motor-truck haulage has progressed is well set forth in a census by the United // States Bureau of Public Roads for the eastbound traffic only on the Boston Post Road at the New York-Connecticut line in October , 1921 , which shows nearly every type of commodity and many million tons being carried . For such transportation the total number of public express lines is probably about one thousand , says the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce ; and a Senate committee has estimated the annual motor-truck tonnage hauled in the United States over the highways at 1,438,000,000 tons . In the motor-bus field 108 cities were using motor-bus lines at the beginning of 1922 . But truck tires contribute to the esthetic as well as the economic welfare of a nation . In England , the char-a-banc is changing the life of its people . No longer are the delightful , picturesque little places inaccessible . The railroad is never a good tourist route . The highways , hedge-lined , are beautiful . A trip from London between the rows of brilliant rhododendrons down to Salisbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forgotten . Where the automobile has shown these beauties of England to hundreds , the char-a bane carries thousands . The English people are discovering England , and they are doing it on truck tires . CHAPTER XI WATER-PROOF FOOTWEAR AND CLOTHING Men , like cats , abhor wet feet . No substance , however , was successfully made into a water-proof shoe until rubber came to be used for that purpose . The South American Indians were the pioneer rubber shoe makers of the world . Pouring the latex from trees on their feet , they permitted it to dry ; it became an unvulcanized , water-proof " rubber , " as we should call it , or a " galosh " as it would be called in England , exactly fitted to the foot . Since it was doubtless uncomfortable to hold feet over a flame to dry the milk , the Indians made clay lasts or forms of the shape and size of the foot , each constructing his own . Over these they poured latex , to be evaporated in the smoke of a palm-nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from South America in 1820 ? a pair of very elaborate , gilded rubbers , which a Boston sea-captain brought home as a curiosity . The first serious importation for selling purposes was made five years later . At that time , Salem , Massachusetts , one of the most aggressive business centers , exported to South America maple lasts , to which the natives took very kindly . Dipped shoes , about equally thick in all parts , were the only kind that proved serviceable up to the time 168 // of Goodyear 's discovery of vulcanization . In shape , the first American shoes were simply overshoes . The first lot of these Amazon India rubber shoes made of pure gum was sold in Boston in 1825 by Thomas Wales . These were made to fit a shoe of any size : there were no rights or lefts ; they stretched over the leather shoes . The first domestic vulcanized rubber shoe was made by Goodyear in 1840 . The L. Candee Shoe Factory at Hampden , Connecticut , was organized in 1845 , under licenses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. at Naugatuck . The demand became so great that by 1860 there were 1,200,000 pairs of rubber shoes made in this country . In the late fifties a new overshoe came into vogue , which , with various modifications , was the arctic , invented and patented by T. C. Wales . It consisted of a shoe with a layer of rubber between a cloth outside and a cloth lining . The rubber boot is an American product , there being no record that mfy rubber boot was imported from South American countries . Nathaniel Hayward introduced the hard heel in the forties ; and from that day to this the rubber boot has been a popular article . The lumbermen 's shoe is an outgrowth of the old women 's buskin made in the fifties ? a laced shoe lined with Canton flannel and made to wear directly over the stocking . George Watkinson , then president of the old Colchester Rubber Co. , wrote : " In 1860 there were only eight companies making rubber shoes in this country .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
