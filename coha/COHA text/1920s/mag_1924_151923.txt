While London was reveling in the adventures of Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle , was enjoying dalliance with Tom Jones , was boasting its two-bottle men , was attending the School for Scandal-while , in short , fashionable England was doing all the things which Queen Victoria soon put a stop to- there blossomed in the Parish of Olney a more godly literature . <P> John Newton , after 20 years at sea , had taken Holy Orders , had become curate of the parish . <P> William Cowper* , poet , after a few years of insanity , had come to Olney with a Mrs. Unwin , whose sweet influence calmed his troubled spirit . Curate Newton and Poet Cowper were as David and Jonathan . <P> Curate Newton acquired facility in hymn-writing , decided to publish . Poet Cowper agreed to help . So , in the glorious year 1779 , appeared the Olney Hymns , containing dozens of hymns which English-singing people were destined to sing ever after . Some of them : Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken , How Sweet the Name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meet , There is a Fountain Filled with Blood . <P> Poet Cowper , intermittently insane , lived to translate Homer . Curate Newton was advanced to a better " living . " <P> Now , Mrs. Fannie Barrett Browning , daughter-in-law of Poet Robert Browning and Poet Elizabeth Barrett , is collecting from all English-singing peoples a fund to place a memorial in the Olney parish church . <P> So is the union of Religion and Poetry apostrophized by the Catholic Poet Thompson : <P> " Ah , let the sweet birds of the Lord With earth 's waters make accord : The Muses ' sacred grove be wet With the red dew of Olivet , And Sappho lay her burning brows In white Cecilia 's lap of snows ! " <P> * His most famous work is the story of John Gilpin 's ride : <P> " John Gilpin at his horse 's side Seized fast the flowing mane , And up he got in haste to ride But soon came down again . . . . <P> " Now let us sing ' Long live the King ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next doth ride abroad May I be there to see .
