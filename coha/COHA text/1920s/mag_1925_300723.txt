Wrenn , four times National Tennis Champion . <P> In the days when the late Reginald Vanderbilt , as a rakish Yale student , entertained the citizens of New Haven with nocturnal thunderings from his red racing car , his classmates remembered with respect a Harvard athlete who , a few years before , had stormed their fort with every crimson team-one Wrenn , Robert .

Wrenn got the typhoid fever . Coming home , he bought a Stock Exchange Seat in 1900 for $50,500 , the highest price then on record .
