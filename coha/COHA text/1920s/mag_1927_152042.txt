Running Wild ( W. C. Fields ) . Ever since Herr Freud took to unsnarling the human mind , playwrights have reveled in the possibilities of Jeff 's suddenly out-mutting Mutt . Not the least amusing of such fancies is this film in which Finch , the browbeaten , stumbles into an experiment in hypnotism and emerges Mr. Finch , brow-beater . Whereas his wife used to nag him , his son jeer at him , his boss sit on him , he now throws china at the picture of his wife 's first husband , thrashes his son , bullies his boss , roars like a lion , and kicks the bleating lambs of whom he was once the gentlest . <P> The Unknown ( Lon Chaney ) . Although his penchant for weird roles has occasioned many a jest , * audiences are beginning to realize that Lon Chaney stands on a pedestal of Hollywood , the one actor dedicated to the serious grotesque . His most recent incarnation is Alonzo , armless wonder of a traveling circus . In reality a full-bodied man , Alonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hounding police that the double-thumbed hand identified with a notorious murder is his own . So accustomed is he to eating , drinking , smoking with his toes , that even when free from the straps , his hands dangle idle . Later , after being provoked to a second murder , he amputates the tell-tale arms . Impetuous Youth ( Elizabeth Bergner , Conrad Veidt ) . Ufa , German producers famed for Variety , Siegfried , The Last Laugh , Faust and other inspired ventures , have bogged this time . Their heroine is a girl jealous of her stepmother 's affection for her father . She leaves home , later flees school , to wander gypsy-like in the dress of a boy . The disguise is doubly efficient , for it conceals her femininity from the other actors , yet carefully keeps the audience apprised . <P> The Secret Studio ( Olive Borden , Clifford Holland ) is a room in the guts of the slums , where Artist Larry Kane paints beauteous model Rosemary with lust in his eye . The hero destroys the painting , thrashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Front ( Charles Murray , George Sidney ) . From Manhattan at the beginning of the War sail a German and an Irishman ; the first to join the German army , the second the Russian , because of his love for a Muscovite sculptress . Meeting on the muddy Eastern front , they decide to quit the War , and , dressed as women , march off into dark Russia . Embarrassing complications ensue when they blunder into the feminine Battalion of Death and are ordered to strip . Vanity ( Leatrice Joy , Charles Ray ) . A characteristic of De Mille productions is that all display must be super-grand . Is it a ball ? The room spreads as vast as Grand Central Terminal . Is the heroine a social lioness ? Her train covers as much ground as the hall rug . The plot substance , by compensation , is minute . In this instance , the heroine visits a onetime admirer aboard his ship on the eve of her wedding to the hero . The admirer wants too much for his flattery , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't step on that spider ! It might be Lon Chaney ! "
