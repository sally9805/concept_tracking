At a wooded spot , somewhere between the villages of Scrofano and Andriano , a dog howled dismally , became excited , started to scratch furiously . <P> The master of the dog peered into a culvert at his foaming canine , started , peered more closely , drew back , crossed himself , exclaimed : Santa , Madre di Gesu Christo , rushed off for the Carabinieri . <P> To the spot swaggered three gorgeous Carabinieri , capes a-flowing , swords a-rattling , hearts a-thumping . Near the thicket their pace slowed down . Once the dog moaned , his master prayed fervently . Once the wind tipped the trees and they shivered ; the sun hid itself behind a cloud . All the time the master of the dog prayed and crossed himself repeatedly . Carabinieri stopped , hesitated , went on . <P> In the culvert the Carabinieri saw a decomposed body , a file sticking in its breast . The corps was pulled out , and by the contour of a speccialy treated gold tooth , the shape of the head and the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Giacomo Matteotti , reported murdered some two months ago ( TIME , June 23 et seq ) . <P> The finding of the body followed the discovery of a bloodstained gray jacket pierced by daggers , with one sleeve missing . The missing sleeve was later found . It was the coat worn by Matteotti on the day he was murdered . <P> Official confirmation of the find was lacking , but most of the Rome news papers stated positively that the body had been discovered and identified . <P> The Public Prosecutor stroked his mustacios and ordered the transportation of the corps to Rome for an official autopsy .
