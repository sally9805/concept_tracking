Intermediary In Irish Question History will remember former Governor Glynn not only as an American editor and politician but also as the intermediary between Lloyd George and De Valera in the settlement of the Irish question . Mr. Glynn himself regarded his part in bringing the long-standing controversy between England and Ireland to an amicable conclusion to be the greatest accomplishment of his life , overs mclowing everything that he had done in American public life . It was while Mr. Glynn was abroad early in 1921 that he performed his services in aid of peace between Ireland and England . He gave the following account of his work in December . 1921 , when he returned to his home in Albany : " My work in the matter , " he said , o'started in Rome in a meeting with Bishop Mannix. of Australia and others .

' He said that if Mr. De Valera would accept the invitation on these terms , the Irish question could be settled , not In one meeting , but in a series of meetings . Mr. De Valera accepted , and it turned out that Lloyd George was right . " The Prime Minister held that a ' series of conferences would lead to a settlement without Ireland going out of the British Empire and yet taking her place . among the nations of the world . Lloyd George told me that the ambition of his life was to settle the Irish question with the same pen with which he signed the armistice .

" Lloyd George 's Tribute to Glynn . When Lloyd George visited America after the war he paid this tribute to Mr. Glynn 's part in the Irish negotiations in a speech at Albany on Oct. 6 , 1923 : " Governor Glynn and I in a dingy . room in London , the office of the Prime Minister , had most unusual conferences of momentous results . He told me very frankly how the Irish people viewed the feud of centuries and what they desired in the way of liberty ; how the American people felt on the subject . And I told bim , equally frankly , what I believed to be the purpose of Great Britain . " At the end of those interviews he took MY views to the Irish leaders and he brought their hopes and aspirations . ' clarified , to me . Out of this exchange sprang the new Ireland . the Irish Free State . " The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly honored , because no man did more to bring a settlement of the Irish question , no man did more to end the feud that had existed for seven hundred years . than your distinguished fellow-citizen , Martin H. Glynn . And I am glad to be in your city to bear testimony to you of the great help he brought to me . " An editorial in THE NEW " YORK TIMES of Oct. 7 , 1923 , commenting on Mr. Lloyd George 's tribute , spoke of Mr. Glynn in the following terms : " Without official position he did what no Ambassador could have done . His Irish lineage and sympathy helped him . Ilie unusual acquaintance with Irish and English history equipped him to meet Englishmen and Irishmen alike . His knowledge of American sentiment was particularly clarifying . And in the task of persuading those between whom a feud had existed for 700 years his gift of speech doubtless counted for much .

Orator of National Reputation . Mr. Glynn 's " gift of speech . " referred to in the editorial on the Irish settlement , made him an orator of national reputation . Ills greatest forensic feat was his keynote speech at the 1916 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis , when Woodrow Wilson was renominated for the Presidency . Mr. Glynn was temporary chairman of the convention . it was in this speech that Mr. Glynn originated ; the phrase " He kept us out of war , " which many persons believe was responsible for the re-election of President Wilson . Theodore Roosevelt was quoted as saying that Mr. Glynn 's speech was the most effective contribution to the literature of the campaign , and was the greatest single factor in Mr. Wilson 's re-election . In the speech Mr. Glynn took an advanced position on pacifism , declaring that it was not the custom of the United States to go to war over prbvocations that admitted of an honorable settlement .

Although he was Governor of New York State for only a little more than a year , filling out the unexpired term of the impeached Governor Sulzer and being defeated by Governor Whitman , Mr. Glynn was highly commended for the large amount of progressive legislation placed upon the statute books while he was in office . Governor Glynn gave New York State its first workmen 's compensation act . His signature enacted the law providing for the establishment of a land bank system to aid the farmers in financing the operation of their farms . The statute doing away with party conventions and providing for State-wide direct primaries was signed by him . Other important statutes that were enacted through the recommendation of Governor Glynn were measures providing for the use of the Massachusetts form of ballot in New York ; the election of United States Senators directly by the people ; an optional city charter act ; appropriation of $217,000 to pay the farmers for diseased cattle destroyed ; establishment of a marketing commission and a State employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which aids many thousands of persons yearly to obtain employment , and many other bills , including measures designed to promote the construction of highways in the State . In , iris record as Governor , Mr. Glynn was as proud of his economy in managing the finances of the State and of his common sense methods of administration as of any of his acts . He maintained that he had saved the State $11 , - 000,000 during ht 's short term of office . His reform of the finances of the State , according to Francis Lynde " Stetson.1 Made him one of the four greatest Gov-1 ernors New York State had had up to that time .

" Samuel Gonmers , whose death preceded Mr. Glynn 's by only two days , said that Governor Glynn had enacted " the best workmen 's compensation law on the statute books of any State in the United States or of any country in the world . " Nathan Straus said that Governor Glynn in his short term of office had secured " constructive legislation that places our State in the front rank of progressive States . " Mr. Straus particularly praised him for his success in getting the Legislature to pass the direct primary law . Subjected to Same Attack as Smith . As a Democratic Governor and a Catholic , Mr. Glynn was subjected to the same kind of attack by his Republican opponents as was Governor Smith in the recent campaign . It was charged that Governor Glynn , although he came from up-State. was dominated by Tammany Hall , and that he was under the influence of the Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He denied both these charges most emphatically , declaring that he was his own master , that he was not a Tammany man , that he was opposed to any church interfering with the State and that he was against the use of State money for religious schools . The attack on Governor Glynn as Tammany-controlled was partly caused by the circumstances under which he became Governor . He had been elected Lieutenant Governor under Governor Sulzer in 1912 , having been nominated by the Democratic Party and William R. Hearst 's Independence League and having defeated James W. Wadsworth , ReMiplican candidate for Lieutenant Governor and now United States Senator . When Governor . Sulzer was impeached , many persons believed that he had been humiliated because he had refused to bow to the will of Charles F. Murphy , and that Mr. Glynn , who automatically became Governor , would be more tractable . Subsequent events , however , proved that Governor Glynn was never under the Tammany leader 's thumb .

Before he became Lieutenant Governor and then Governor Mr. Glynn had made an excellent record as Controller of New York State and as a member of the United States Congress . He was nominated for Controller in 1906 by the Democratic Party and the Independence League , and defeated Morton E. Lewis of Rochester . During the panic of 1907 Mr. Glynn displayed great executive and financial ability as Controller . New York State had 822.000,000 in banks and trust companies at that time .
