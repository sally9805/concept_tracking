Turning to the Left to promise them a discussion on the Ruhr policy , M. Poincar , the Premier , said : " Were I only sure of your wisdom . . . " " We are sure your policy in the Ruhr is folly ! " said M. Vailliant-Courturier , communist deputy . " You are a prisoner of Daudet royalist leader . I would like to know what chantage political blackmail he exercises on you ! " cried communist Deputy Berthon . " That word shall be your shame ! " retorted Poincar . " No agent of Germany can insult me , " yelled Daudet ; and the air was rent with cries of " Slacker ! " " Liar ! " " Traitor ! ' " Blackmailer ! " <P> Then Berthon addressed Poincar : " Knowing the habits of Daudet , are n't you afraid he will renew the campaign he led against you when you were candidate for President ? " Poincar : " You are an abominable scoundrel ! " Pandemonium broke loose , and it was some time before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dared to say that there exist against me letters which I fear may be published . He is a liar ! " At this point the President of the Chamber was obliged to suspend the session . <P> Half an hour later the Deputies reassembled and Berthon , in stating that he did not mean to insult the Premier , unfortunately brought the name of Paul Deschanel into his invective against the royalists . A storm of protest broke out the moment the dead President was mentioned . When this outburst had been quieted the communists framed a motion to censure Poincare , and he left the Government Bench . <P> The defence was now taken up by M. Maginot , War Minister , who questioned Berthon about the letters . Berthon denied that he had ever mentioned them . " You lie ! " hissed the Minister of Mars . This was the signal for a general rush of the communists to the Government Bench . An usher venturing to interfere received a black eye . The attack was repulsed by the President of the Chamber , who again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members Berthon apologized , and the incident closed . The Governors of the Banks of England and France are conferring in Paris over the $310,000,000 debt owed by France to England .
