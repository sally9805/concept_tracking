Chinafolk in Manhattan 's famed China Town were continuing resolutely , last week , a boycott of all Japanese wares which they began when Japan recently sent troops to occupy the Chinese province of Shantung ( TIME , April 30 ) . Potent Editor Seto Chen of the Chinatown Nationalist Daily said , last week : " I know a Chinese merchant here who has a stock of Japanese goods worth $15,000 on his shelves . He has consented to let our Chinese Citizens League decide what to do with it . If I am not mistaken there will be a big bonfire in Mott Street one of these days . " <P> Logically-minded persons thought that since the Japanese goods have already been paid for the only person about to be hurt by destroying these particular goods is the Chinaman owner . They recalled that a shrewder thrust against Japan is being made by rich Chinamen in many parts of the world who are reported to be speculating again the Japanese yen in such fashion as may cause it to become seriously depressed on international exchange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
