Now on trial at Athens for high treason is General Theodore Pangalos , recently the efficient Dictator of ungrateful Greeks ( 1925-26 ) . Today Pangalos seems a ruined man , his body wasted by imprisonment , his hair turned prematurely white ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . Yet he rallied , last week , sufficiently to state crisply to correspondents his views on dictatorship and war , as follows : <P> " In Athens the dictatorial governments of Solon , Pisistratus and Pericles marked the most brilliant stations in the evolution of democracy . ... As I repeatedly said , even when I was in power , I never believed that dictatorial rule could ever be a permanent and durable political regime . . . . I consider that by means of favorable conditions created through a temporary disregard of formalities , it is possible to solve problems and render such service as no parliamentary government would be able to achieve despite its good will . I wish that Greece may prosper in peace and happiness and may never again need my services . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier : <P> " War is more than a necessary evil . It is a great law of nature . . . . War has always accompanied life and will not disappear until life on this planet becomes extinct . "
