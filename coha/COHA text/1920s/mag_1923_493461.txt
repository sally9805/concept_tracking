THE high gods of irony must have smiled wryly as they looked , down upon the fifth an ? niversary of the end of the war to end war . At the end of the fifth year since hostilities terminated the world is worse off in almost every way than When they began in 1914 ; and in the last half-decade the likelihood of war has not been dimin ? ished but has greatly increased . The German Re ? public which , when it was born five years ago , was hailed with such j'ibilation , is on the point of corn ? plete economic and political collapse . Its govern ? rnent , as impotent as that of China , can only look helplessly on while two groups of Monarchist re 4ctionaries fight among themselves over the ques ? tion whether the throne which they expect soon to be restored shall be occupied by a Hohenzollern or a Wittelsbach . That same Crown Prince who shared with his father an ignoble flight for life five Years ago now returns triumphantly to fight for the dynasty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious France dominates the Con ? tinent and continues to pursue her fixed plan of destroying her hereditary enemy . She remains inthe Ruhr ; she still hopes for the success of her patently artificial " Rhineland Republic : " and she has succeeded in destroying ' the project for a new international conference which should at this late date make a fair investigation of Germany 's cap acity to pay . THAT the American government would refuse to accept the Poincare conditions was a foregone con ? clusion : in fact , M. Poincare drew them with pre ? cisely that purpose in view . A conference which must consider only how much Germany can pay before 193o and must assume a continued French occupation of the Ruhr would not be a conference , but a farce . M. Poincare has got himself cleverly out of an awkward predicament . If he had refused the Curzon-Hughes invitation out of hand , the pub ? lic opinion of the world would have been weighted heavily against him . By accepting " in principle " but with impossible conditions he has forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely that Great Britain will follow the advice of the Im ? perial Conference and , if the cooperation of Italy and Belgium can be secured , will invite America to join an inquiry from which France will be excluded . Whether Italy and Belgium could be persuaded to make such a final break with the mistress of Europe , whether Messrs . Coolidge and Hughes , harried as they already are by the isolationists at home , would come in , and whether an inquiry op ? posed by France from the beginning could have any useful effects , are all , questions which the future must decide . .. THE NEW YORK WORLD , by way of com ? memorating Armistice Day , indulged in an interest ? ing piece of journalistic enterprise . It asked scores of the leading men of all nations whether in their opinion the nations are now in closer accord than five years ago , whether they are coming closer , what is their greatest need , and how may it best be secured ? Many replies were , received , including some from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viviani , Theunis , Arthur Bal ? four , Nitti and Philip Snowden , and such Americans as Borah , House , Dulles , Baruch and Eliot . The views expressed are fairly summarized in the World 's headlines : " ' Foreign statesmen and men of affairs believe generally that Europe is in worse plight than before the war ; " - " Americans of na ? tional prominence take dark view of situation ; " " Italian statesmen take pessimistic view ; " " U. S. senators fear result to world in racial hatred ; " " Big business men pessimistic over Europe 's out ? look ; " " Europe 's condition becoming worse to grave degree , says ex-premier Giolitti ; " " Nations never more apart , says Gerard ; " " Churchmen see little advance in half decade . " Not all the partici ? pants in the symposium are as gloomy as these headlines indicate , and a number of them express high faith in the League of Nations , or in Amer ? ica 's reentry ; into European affairs , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one to make the angels weep , In the opinion of a major ? ity of these eminent gentlemen , the inhabitants of large portions of the globe have not only for ? gotten the technique of peace but have lost the desire for such a state . FORMER PRESIDENT WOODROW WIL ? SON is one man whose views have altered not at all in the five years since the war ended . In his first formal public address since his illness , a radio speech on the eve of Armistice Day , he declared that America has withdrawn into a " sullen and selfish " isolation , to which he applied the words " ignoble , " " cowardly " and " dishonorable . " He asks us to return to " the true conditions of Amer ? ica " by " resolving to put self-interest away and once more formulate and act upon the highest ideals and purposes of international policy . " France and Italy , he believes , " between them have made waste paper of the Treaty of Versailles " ? a state ? ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by the amount of recent history it ignores . Mr. Wilson 's position entitles him to a respectful hearing ; but candor compels one to admit that there seems no possibility that his appeal can suc ? ceed . Millions of his fellow citizens indicated by their votes in 1920 that they believed.him wrong ? 2 and the events of the past three years have as ? suredly given more corroboration to them than to him . SCARCELY any of the recommendations of the Coal Commission exhibit greater courage and open-mindedness than that of a differential tax , falling lightly on the low profit operator and more heavily on the ; operators making larger ones . The differences in profits in such an industry as coal mining result chiefly from the relative diffi- culty of working the various seams . It is absurd that private operators and owners should be per ? mitted to pocket the whole benefit arising from the natural superiority of the richer mines . The ? public ought to take its snare of the beneht through taxation . The commission evidently contemplates a federal tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem is a differential tax levied by the State of Pennsylvania in lieu of the existing flat-rate mining tax . Such a solution would have an immediate effect in reducing the cost of coal to the consumer and could be made to provide an increased revenue for the state . I F it is desirable to reduce our national revenues the proposals of Secretary Mellon have much to recommend them . The distribution of the reduc ? tions among several classes is fair , assuming that the original distribution of burdens was fair ? the most generous assumption a conservative like Sec ? retary Mellon could have been expected to make . The smaller incomes , which can not obtain relief through the refuge of tax exempt investments , would make the gain that counts most . Secretary Mellon shows himself unexpectedly liberal in his argument for distinguishing between earned and unearned income and for lightening the burden on the former . This used to be regarded as socialistic doctrine . In his discussion of relief for the higher classes of the surtax he takes his stand on the purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run increase the revenue . We are not sure about that , and we are not ready to believe that Secretary Mellon has the facts to prove it beyond doubt . WE question the advisability of reducing the revenue at the present time . It is true that We have made good progress in the payment of our debt . It stands more than four billions under the peak , and at our present rate of payment it can be wholly extinguished within a generation . It can be extinguished if we do not run into any period ' of extraordinary expenditures , such as would be volved if we found ourselves compelled to take over the railways and pay their owners in cash . , We may run into such a period , and for that rea ? son it would be prudent to make as much sPeed with our debt extinction as we can . We are pros ? perous and can afford to pay taxes liberally . Ir it seems desirable to reduce the burden of the in ? come tax , the loss ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Secretary Mellon reconsider his old and fallacious " argument ? ments against the excess profits tax . Here is a source from which we could obtain three or four hundred million dollars without placing a handicap on any enterprise . If Secretary Mellon thinks the public interest in this tax is gone forever he has something to learn when the western Senators and Congressmen come back to Washington . SOME of W. R. Hearst 's journalistic competitors in New York City have been commenting , not without a trace of discreet satisfaction , on the ter rific jolt he is supposed to have received in the recent election . Hearst had split with his long- time ally , Tammany , in regard to a group of judiciary candidates , and had conducted against the organization and its slate one of his typical campaigns , plastering over his New York Amer ? ican and Evening Journal ( which now have a corn ? bin'ed circulation of 1,041,000 a day ) with car ? toons , full page editorials , and " news articles , " designed to show that the Tammany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil . The result was a stunning defeat for Mr. Hearst . Tammany won by a huge vote and the publisher 's candidates were at the tail of the procession . I T is easy to declare that this rings down the curtain on Hearst 's political power in New York ; but it is probably more accurate to say that his strength has never been as large as his friends and most of his enemies have assumed . In recent years , Tammany has won several victories against the combined strength of the whole metropolitan press except the Hearst sheets ; and it has been argued , by a post hoc , propter hoc process , that he has an unusual grip upon his readers . We doubt it We believe a more accurate analysis would declare that Hearst readers are drawn by the scandal and crime of the news , columns , and read the editorials , if at all , because they are so violent and cocksure , not because they are convinc ? ing . In the long run , Hearst after all has noth ? ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day but not from year to year . If our analysis is correct , he creates readers but not followers ; and only followers of the blindest de ? votion could be expected to perform such a right-about-face as he recently dem'anded . THERE is a lesson which some of the leading powers might well take to heart , in the peaceful termination of the recent dispute between Bulgaria and Jugoslavia . A Jugoslav military attache , Colonel Krastitch , was set upon and beaten in the Bulgarian capital by a group of thugs . This is Just the sort of incident to produce a very pretty little war ; but instead of mobilizing its troops , the Bulgarian government has promptly disavowed the action , and has apologized formally and pub licly . An indemnity is to be paid the Jugoslays , the amount of which is to be determined by the World Court . In view of the fact that Colonel Krastitch was not seriously injured , the indemnity demand seems unnecessary ; but with world affairs going as they are at present any action by anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cause enough for jubilation . LUDENDORFF 'S espousal of the pseudo-revo ? lution is interesting chiefly for the light it throws on the militarist character . Unquestionably Luden dorff is an extremely able man in the field cf his professional training . The victory of Tannenberg , which permanently lamed the Russian army , was won under Ludendorff 's strategy , and his conduct of the fighting on the western front , though not so brilliant , stands comparison with the performance of any other general down to the time when Foch was given the supreme command of the Allied armies . , Where Ludendorff was hopelessly weak was in his judgment of civil forces . He could never get it through his head that it is only in theory that the whole civil population can be sub ? ordinated to the military . Assuming as he did that the will of the German people could be made as rigid as his own he threw , all his weight against every movement for " peace without victory . " More than any one else , he was responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where utter defeat confronted her His recent exploit is of a piece with his past . It ex ? hibits courage , and absolute incapacity to form a sound judgment on the civil forces involved in his problem . ACCORDING to an article by Francis Delaisi in the NewYorkWorld the economic objectives of the French industrialists have shifted decisively in the last four years . At the outset they entertained the notion of effecting a union between the inter ? ests of Lorraine and those of the Ruhr , under French domination , of course . But since that time they have come around to the view that the French metallurgical industry is capable of such expansion as to ' make unnecessary any cooperation with the Ruhr metal works . The French industry can pro ? duce several million tons of steel in excess of any possible French consumption . This surplus must be marketed abroad , and it can be marketed to advantage only if Germany is prevented from com ? peting . The logic of the position is that the Ruhr metallurgical industry must be destroyed , not helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French are a logical people . NEW YORK CITY theatrical managers lately , rejoiced to find the horrors of one type of censor ? ship somewhat mitigated , only to have their spirits dampened next day by the announcement of a new type of inquisition more dreadful than the last . Augustus Thomas , on behalf of the Producing Managers ' Association , succeeded in having a curb put on the activities of John S. Sumner , successor to the late lamented Anthony Comstock as head of the Society for the Suppression of Vice . In the future , complaints against the theatre will not be investigated by the New York City Department of Licenses solely on the testimony of Mr. Sumner or any other professional immorality hunter . Charges must be corroborated by the indignation of at least a few private citizens before action is T FIE NE W // taken . No sooner had this good news been cele ? brated , however , than Police Commissioner En ? right announced a new censorship committee of his own consisting , incredible as it seems , of one deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective . Naturally , the managers object to this committee , which they consider superfluous . A syscem was worked out last year , and is still in force , whereby three hundred respectable citizens formed themselves into a panel from which a jury of twelve chosen by lot would visit any theatrical , i ya performance suspectea of m- propriety . A vote of nine of these twelve could enforce alteration in dialogue or the withdrawal of a whole performance . Why , the managers ask with reason , is n't this good enough ? MUCH as one would like at this juncture to take a whole hearted stand in favor of freedom of utter- ance and against all censorship , it is difficult to do so in view of the present facts . The efforts of the censors are usually directed against earnest-minded plays which , when they discuss sexual problems , do so only to drive home a most virtuous moral . The action is generally silly and almost always uncalled for . It is a fact , however , that a few New York managers , emboldened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , have lately taken to mak ? ing presentations which are flagrantly indecent . However much you may be in favor of abolishing restraint and destroying inhibitions , you must agree that such exhibitions contribute nothing to the campaign for greater freedom . Thus far , the noble committee ' of three hundred appears to have done little toward cleaning up the spots where prophylactic work is most needed . If it delays , the managers must not be surprised if they find them ? selves reaping . the Sumner-Enright whirlwind . SRAEL ZANGWILL , who seems to have been engaged in one furious battle or another from the moment he lately landed on our sometimes hos ? pitable shores , has lately been indulging in the greatest of a public man 's luxuries , by saying for publication not only everything he thinkS , but even more than that . America , he declares in effect , is a perfectly terrible place good enough only for i the perfectly terrible people who inhabit t . He does n't like prohibition , our restaurant service , safety razors , Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . Americans are " lazy but lovable " and " thee best half educated people in the world . " We have little honor , jusdignity , , tice or but by way of compensation we have an incredible number of cranks . Evidently it did Mr. Zangwill good to unburden himself and since it is clear that the things he criticizes are partly those little national idiosyncrasies which so often irritate a Londoner , and partly the normal result of geographical and biological factors , no one need take offence at our visitor 's plain speech . AMERICAN public opinion has with /lioignifi- cant exceptions sustained Secretary Hughes in his refusal to participate in a reparations confer ? ence limited according to the prescriptions of M. Poincare . If his prohibitions had been loyally ac ? cepted by the conference , it would necessarily have become a creature of French policy , whereas its major purpose from the British and American point of view was to formulate a radically different alternative to the policy of France . M. Poincare consented to the proposed assemblage , as he had consented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to frustrate its objects more effectively by pretending than by refusing to participate in it . The incident is only one more illustration of the inflexible determination of the rulers of France to keep a free hand in dealing with Germany and in restricting the participation of other nations in the drama of Germany 's fate to the role of aid and comforter to France . Is there any positive action which Great Britain and the United States can now take which will be immediately effective in rescuing Germany , in curb ? ing France and in checking the rising tide of social anarchy in continental Europe ? We doubt whether there is . A general conference on the condition of Europe is not yet possible . The French govern ? ment would oppose it or shackle it more relentless ... , ly than it did a conference of experts , and if an American administration took part in its delibera ? tions , it would run a grave risk of having its agree ments repudiated . A diplomatic offensive against France by the British and American governments would depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it were politically possible - for Great Britain and this country to utter such a threat ( which it is n't ) that kind of diplomacy is for the present , abhorrent to the conscience of both the British and American nations . If . France is to be frustrated , her opponents must invoke a method of coercion which does not involve the threat of war . Is such a method conceivable and practicable ? There is , we believe , such a method although British and American public opinion does not dear ? ly see it and is far from ready to invoke it . The method does not consist , as has been suggestecl , in : a demand for a funding of the debt which France owes to the British and American governments . That to our mind would be a futile as well as a doubtful method of trying to coerce France . If the French government refused to fund , as it cer ? tainly would , they could not take any effective steps to collect the debt ; and in refusing to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that payment by France would impose an intoler ? able and unjust burden on the French people .
