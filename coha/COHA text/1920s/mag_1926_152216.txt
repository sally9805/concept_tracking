The Reichstag definitely rejected last week by a vote of 242 to 236 a bill , sponsored by Socialists and Communists , which provided that property originally belonging to the former German nobility and seized from them by the Republic should be retained without compensation . <P> The purpose of the bill , which admittedly never stood the slightest chance of passing , was merely to record publicly the Reichstag 's opposition to all such proposals , thereby clearing the way for a national referendum on this highly important question . <P> Thoroughgoing Germans have already cast over ten million ballots in a preliminary " referendum referendum " ( TIME , March 29 ) , as a result of which the issue itself must be submitted to referendum within four weeks . <P> In order to deprive the Hohenzollerns and other German nobles of their property , 20 million ballots must be cast . Such a victory for the Left parties would result at least in the inevitable inclusion of several Socialists and Communists in the Cabinet , if it were not actually turned over to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthcoming , the Right parties may expect a somewhat similar aggrandizement . <P> The Reichstag proceedings upon this point last week were , however , of such a routine nature that only Deputy Scheidemann ( Socialist ) spoke . He accused Wilhelm of Doorn of high treason , charging that he betrayed secrets of importance to the late Tsar Nicholas . During Herr Scheidemann 's tirade , many Deputies of the Right quietly left the hall-heeded not when he went on to accuse Wilhelm 's sympathizers of " deception , corruption , and doglike servility.
