T FIE NE W // taken . No sooner had this good news been celebrated , however , than Police Commissioner Enright announced a new censorship committee of his own consisting , incredible as it seems , of one deputy commissioner , one commissioner 's secretary , and one lady detective . Naturally , the managers object to this committee , which they consider superfluous . A syscem was worked out last year , and is still in force , whereby three hundred respectable citizens formed themselves into a panel from which a jury of twelve chosen by lot would visit any theatrical , i ya performance suspectea of m-propriety . A vote of nine of these twelve could enforce alteration in dialogue or the withdrawal of a whole performance . Why , the managers ask with reason , is n't this good enough ? MUCH as one would like at this juncture to take a whole hearted stand in favor of freedom of utter- ance and against all censorship , it is difficult to do so in view of the present facts . The efforts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they discuss sexual problems , do so only to drive home a most virtuous moral . The action is generally silly and almost always uncalled for . It is a fact , however , that a few New York managers , emboldened perhaps by the free manners of the post-war era , have lately taken to making presentations which are flagrantly indecent . However much you may be in favor of abolishing restraint and destroying inhibitions , you must agree that such exhibitions contribute nothing to the campaign for greater freedom . Thus far , the noble committee ' of three hundred appears to have done little toward cleaning up the spots where prophylactic work is most needed . If it delays , the managers must not be surprised if they find themselves reaping . the Sumner-Enright whirlwind . SRAEL ZANGWILL , who seems to have been engaged in one furious battle or another from the moment he lately landed on our sometimes hospitable shores , has lately been indulging in the greatest of a public man 's luxuries , by saying for publication not only everything he thinkS , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , is a perfectly terrible place good enough only for i the perfectly terrible people who inhabit t . He does n't like prohibition , our restaurant service , safety razors , Christian Science , Sunday newspapers , or our immigration policy . Americans are " lazy but lovable " and " thee best half educated people in the world . " We have little honor , jusdignity , , tice or but by way of compensation we have an incredible number of cranks . Evidently it did Mr. Zangwill good to unburden himself and since it is clear that the things he criticizes are partly those little national idiosyncrasies which so often irritate a Londoner , and partly the normal result of geographical and biological factors , no one need take offence at our visitor 's plain speech . The Obstacle Europe A MERICAN public opinion has with /lioignifi- cant exceptions sustained Secretary Hughes in his refusal to participate in a reparations conference limited according to the prescriptions of M. Poincare . If his prohibitions had been loyally accepted by the conference , it would necessarily have become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British and American point of view was to formulate a radically different alternative to the policy of France . M. Poincare consented to the proposed assemblage , as he had consented to the Genoa conference , because he hoped , to frustrate its objects more effectively by pretending than by refusing to participate in it . The incident is only one more illustration of the inflexible determination of the rulers of France to keep a free hand in dealing with Germany and in restricting the participation of other nations in the drama of Germany 's fate to the role of aid and comforter to France . Is there any positive action which Great Britain and the United States can now take which will be immediately effective in rescuing Germany , in curbing France and in checking the rising tide of social anarchy in continental Europe ? We doubt whether there is . A general conference on the condition of Europe is not yet possible . The French government would oppose it or shackle it more relentless ... , ly than it did a conference of experts , and if an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a grave risk of having its agree ments repudiated . A diplomatic offensive against France by the British and American governments would depend for its effectiveness upon the threat of war , and even if it were politically possible - for Great Britain and this country to utter such a threat ( which it is n't ) that kind of diplomacy is for the present , abhorrent to the conscience of both the British and American nations . If . France is to be frustrated , her opponents must invoke a method of coercion which does not involve the threat of war . Is such a method conceivable and practicable ? There is , we believe , such a method although British and American public opinion does not dearly see it and is far from ready to invoke it . The method does not consist , as has been suggestecl , in : a demand for a funding of the debt which France owes to the British and American governments . That to our mind would be a futile as well as a doubtful method of trying to coerce France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly would , they could not take any effective steps to collect the debt ; and in refusing to pay the French could allege with a large amount of truth that payment by France would impose an intolerable and unjust burden on the French people . The November 21 , 1923 N E W only other suggested method is that of going on with a conference on Germany 's , " capacity to pay " even though France will not participate . There is much to be said in favor of adopting this course , assuming that Italy and perhaps Belgium will agree . It provides a means of keeping the subject under agitation and of educating public opinion in Europe and America as to the meaning of the reparations problem and to the need of isolating France . But it would be only a diplomatic makeshift whose value would depend not upon what it was and did but upon how it was followed up . A conference of economic experts on Germany 's " capacity to pay " is bound to be more or less a lie . The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic machinery of Germany and is making it morally and physically impossible for Germany to pay anything . It does not require a conference of economic experts to establish this obvious truth . Such a conference would in all probability be loath to admit this truth and to emphasize its full significance , for by so doing it would implicitly deny its own competence to contribute anything essential towards the solution of the problem . It would say in effect that German reparations had become a political and a moral rather than an economic predieament , and that a way out would be found by acting in the light of relevant political and ethical rather than economic principles . What is the political and ethical affirmation which is peculiarly relevant to the crisis ? It is the affirmation that the danger to civilization in Europe is directly traceable to the politics of force and to the ; perfidious and vindictive punishment of the vanquished which the Treaty of Versailles embodied . Other treaties , such as those of Berlin and Vienna , gave the sanction of law to international agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Versailles for the first time authorized the continuation of the destructive operations of war as a part of the legal processes of peace . That is why it has so quickly resulted in economic disaster and in such perilous moral and political confusion . If the European peoples are to reach any pacification except a precarious French dictatorship or a ghastly peace of physical and moral exhaustion , they must recognize the impossibility of recovery as long as the Treaty is supposed to be the foundation of European order . And if Great Britain and the United States are to intervene effectively in Europe on behalf of political as well as moral , reconstruction , their common policy must tend towards the abandonment of the Versailles compromise and the substitution for it of a settlement which will give back to the German people the right to dispose of their own lives . President Wilson deprived his address on Armistice Day of relevance and reality by his inability , natural though it was , to understand what has taken place since his retirement . The military victory , which he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gradually lost much of its former glamor . Even Mr. Lloyd Qeorge now attributes a large part of the prevailing misery and uncertainty of Europe to the complete success of the knock-out blow . Victory did not bring peace to Europe , because the peace-makers in Paris could not refrain from abusing their unlimited power . The possession of that power did not increase their sense - of responsibility for the welfare of a vanquished foe whom they had deprived of all possi bility of protecting himself . It drugged their consciences and provided them with plausible excuses for granting to the people who proposed to destroy Germany a sufficiently clear right of way . Mr. Wilson has reproached France for breaking the Treaty and there is an apparent justification for the reproach , but the calamities of Europe are caused more by loyalty to the Treaty than by disloyalty to it . If he had not accepted a compromise which encouraged the existing French mixture of legalism and lawlessness , the Poincare policy would have been impossible . Inasmuch as the vindictive treatment of Germany , authorized by the Treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the American people that the Senate did not ratify it . The refusal to ratify was , indeed , equivalent to a reversal of the decision which the American people made when they entered the war , but it was not the ignoble and cowardly repudiation which Mr. Wilson makes it out to be . He himself rendered inevitable the ultimate resumption by the United States of freedom of action by associating American responsibility to Europe with the enforcement of a Treaty which , consecrated more completely than ever before the reign of force in European politics . Ultimately Great Britain will have to follow the example of the United States and free herself from any further responsibility for enforcing the Treaty of Versailles . As long as the British government is bound by the provisions of that document , it is fatally embarrassed in carrying out any policy which will have a fair chance of bringing peace to the Continent of Europe . It is aiming now at the establishment in Germany of an international government which would administer what is left of German credit resources and good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tried in good faith , it has no doubt a fighting chance of pulling Germany through ; but France as usual stands in the way . Her ratification of the Treaty binds Great Britain to obtain French consent to the execution of any plan which is intended to rescue Germany and save ' Europe . She will never obtain that consent ; and in the course of the next few months , British public opinion will recognize the inexorable character of this barrier . It will then understand that the only remaining chance , of THE NEW ultimately appeasing Europe is to denounce the Treaty and to concentrate on France the sole responsibility for the consequences of French policy . That is the method of coercing France that meas. ures up to the needs of the crisis . It is a grim and hideously costly method ; but once the Treaty gave to France the opportunity of destroying Germany by due process of law , it became the only adequate method .                   @ @
