" Mr. Butler reiterated his confidence that the manoeuvre would prove a boomerang , adding that he looks forward with the utmost degree of confidence to the election of ?

" " I do not wish to indicate what they are , but I think they are apparent to most people who are active in any way in this campaign . " Mr. Butler said that many Democrats are dissatisfied with the attitude of John W. Davis , who , he said . had followed , to some extent , the trail blazed by the Bryans rather than his own . " I do not want . to discuss the campaign addresses Of Mr. Davis , " he said , " but it looks to me as if he had gone from one end , of the line to the other .

" I believe , as -1 always have , that , the people of Iowa will give their electoral vote to President Coolidge and the Republican Party . " " Do you find the Democrats laying down ? " ? . - " I would not like to answer that in just that way , but I find that in many States there is no Democratic sentiment to speak of , " Mr. Butler replied .

" In these States I am convinced that the situation for President Coolidge has materially improved . I feel ' that La Follette sentiment is on the wane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Butler expressed the belief , that on the whole the tariff is not so much to the fore as an issue as other questions , as , for example , the attack of the third party on the Supreme Court and the Constitution and the dangers that would result from failure to elect a President . ... - The President , he said , had no plans tor a campaign. - He intends , as here -- tofore announced , to stay on the job in Washington . There is no tour In contemplation for the Chief Executive , although he will probably have an opportunity to address the country over the radio , " This is news , indeed , " said Mr. Nelson . " I think somebody is consulting his fears for his facts . Perhaps the Republican headquarters is getting the same reports from the West that we are receiving , but- we see no combination on the part of the leaders .

We agree with both the Democratic and Republican leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on between Coolidge and La Follette for election . " Shaver Ridicules Charge . When Clem L.
