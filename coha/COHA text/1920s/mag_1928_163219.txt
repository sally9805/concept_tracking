From 16 nations there converged upon Cassel , Germany , last week , furtive delegates to an ominous convention . Most entered Germany on forged passports . All were agents of the Third International : the Communist bureau at Moscow devoted to fomenting " The World Revolution of The World Proletariat " ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) . As the delegates filtered into Cassel , several were recognized by the German secret police . Shrewd , the police officials allowed the convention of professional seditionists to proceed in apparent deadly secrecy but contrived to overhear all that passed by means of dictaphones . <P> Presiding and directly representing the Third International sat Comrade Rykov , said to be a relative of Prime Minister of the Soviet Union , Alexei Ivanovich Rykov . To him the assembled agents reported their activities and successes of the past twelvemonth , particularly with reference to the establishment of " Communist Cells " or nuclei in the principal armies and navies of the world . <P> Reported U. S. Comrade John ( " Jack " ) Wilson : " The Red Cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard as showing considerable progress since last year , when there were only three . " <P> Thereafter English Comrade James Button claimed that 13 cells have been established in the British Navy ; and French Comrade Barbrot not only credited himself and colleagues with a score of 14 , but said that in case of need the Communist banner could be hoisted on no less than ten French warships . <P> When similar encouraging reports had been received concerning cells in the armies of Great Britain , France and Poland , Chairman Rykov enthusiastically predicted : " The last months of 1928 and the first months of 1929 will constitute a period of mutinies and seditions in the armies of Capitalist Powers ! " <P> After supplementary reports had been made , covering Italy , Turkey , Rumania , Bulgaria , Hungary , Austria , Czechoslovakia , Latvia , Belgium and Argentina , the agents listened to a high pressure , inspirational harangue by Chairman Rykov . He threatened a general curtailment of salaries , unless they produce in the near future " more impressive disturbances . . . such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 100 Austrians were killed and the Ministry of Justice was burned ( TIME , July 27 ) . Even this potent disturbance , stormed Comrade Rykov , had been partially bungled . Secondly the agents were ordered to work for a general liaison between Red Cells so that these may form an international Communist force in time of war . The Red Army of Soviet Russia can not , admitted Chairman Rykov , attack the Capitalist powers of Europe with immediate prospect of success . Finally the agents were cautioned not to convey instructions to the Cells by circulars " which always fall into the hands of the police , " and were told to keep their records and reports to Moscow " as concise as possible . " Though authority for the above accounts rests solely upon a statement issued , last week , by the German secret police , their version of the seditious proceedings at Cassel smacks strongly of the typical , half naive and half ruthless methods of the Third International . <P> When U. S. Secretary of the Navy Curtis Dwight Wilbur was confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. tars and marines , he smugly said :
