The Week THE statement which the members of the Fac ? ulty of Political Science of Columbia Univer ? sity has recently issued in favor of a revision of the foreign debt settlements emphasizes a desirable improvement in American fiscal policy . It is unwise for the American government to negotiate with the Allied governments contracts which involve the pay ? ments of many millions of dollars over a period of sixty years . Either the debtors will not live up to their contracts , or if they do , the effort to pay will cost them so dear that they will cherish bitter resent ? ment against their common creditor . The debts were created under wholly abnormal conditions of international barter , and they can not be paid under normal conditions without grievous and wasteful stresses ? both financial and psychological . The ex ? i ; ting and proposed settlements will have to be re ? vised eventually . The statesmanlike course for the Arnerican government is to recognize the expedi ? ency of revision , and to use it as an excuse for thecalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE form in which the Columbia political scien ? tists have cast their statement is not , however , as un ? exceptionable as its object . Its arguments will re ? lieve the feelings of its authors and of the European peoples whose cause they are pleading , but if its object is to convert the American opponents of the proposed revision , it is poorly phrased and prepared to accomplish the purpose . Its fundamental argument ? ment is that when the debts were incurred the United States and its European associates were fighting in a common cause , and that this fact gave to France , Great Britain , Belgium and Italy the moral right to call upon the United States for un ? limited assistance in furnishing them with munitions and means of subsistence . This argument which has been used so frequently in Europe has always seemed to us unrealistic and unsound . It was in ? vented in Europe for the purpose of proving that the debtor nations are morally justified in protesting against paying the debt and that the creditor is morally contemptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of European soldiers . This contention simply is not fair and Americans who do not continue to be hypnotized by Allied propaganda know that it is unfair . THROUGHOUT the War individuals and na ? tions universally sacrificed human lives for the ben ? efit of victory , but whenever they spent or borrowed one another 's money for the same purpose , a care ? ful account was kept of the transaction and , if pos ? sible , the debt or the interest was collected . This was true of the transactions among the Allies . No one nation was supposed to be under any obliga ? tion to place its economic resources at the service of its associates without compensation . Japan was one of the Allied nations from the start , but we have yet to hear that she placed or was asked to contribute a pound of rice or a three-inch gun with ? out being paid . All during the War the British government bought large quantities of food , muni ? tions and equipment in Canada , but the Canadians were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada has never been considered a moral reprobate for exacting remuneration . The American government required hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of supplies and services from its Allies , but it always paid for them in full . If any American fighting or charitable organization ever asked for or received anything in Europe for noth ? ing , it has successfully concealed the fact . Many Europeans seem sincerely to believe that in inter ? national transactions it is the function of America to give without compensation and it is the right of Europe to receive without obligation . American popular opinion vaguely realizes the prevalence in Europe of this view of America 's international mis ? sion , and the fact accounts for the indisposition of the American people to entangle themselves any further in European political quarrels and respon ? sibilities . IN ANOTHER respect also the statement of the Columbia professors proves too much and does less than justice to the official attitude of the United States . It criticizes and condemns the practice of basing the debt settlements on the principle of " cap ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle which the Allies have applied or could apply to the debts which are owed to them . They have estimated the German capacity to pay at anywhere from $500 , ? 000,000 to $1,000,000,000 a year , and they have never admitted that they would let her off a dollar of this amount unless they had to . They also place and rightly place an extremely high estimate on America 's capacity to pay . A large part of their in ? dignation against this country is traceable to their belief that America is able to pay for more of the War than she is legally liable to pay.and consequent ? ly that she should pay to the limit . They apply the capacity-to-pay principle to their enemy Germany and to their friend the United States , but they do not apply it to themselves . They are emancipated from it by some higher moral law which entitles them to collect in full from Germany and at the same time to be delivered from paying the United States . We are sorry that the Columbia statement connived at this interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt settlements concerns the extent to which they tend to ignore it . What France , Italy and Great Britain should pay either in money or in sacrifice of national interest must obviously be de ? termined in part by what they are able to pay . For that reason it is indefensible to spread the payments over sixty years . A trustworthy calculation of what any of them can pay twenty or twenty-five years from now is impossible . In so far as the Allies re ? turn to America any part of the war loans , the pay ? ments should be confined to twenty-five years at the outside . Within these limits it is possible , accidents apart , to place a fair estimate on capacity to pay . FINALLY there is another objection to the ten ? dency of the Columbia statement to base the de ? mand for revision on abstract right rather than on statesmanship and expediency . It proposes and looks forward to " an international conference which is to review the entire problem of debt payments and make proposals for readjustment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference almost in the same breath tries to deprive the United States of all the negotiable assets with which its government might enter such a congress . If it has no moral right to ask for the repayment of the debts , it can urge no valid reason for asking the Allies to give up anything of value to themselves in order to obtain a release . Such a conference might be able to provide an answer for the world 's most grievous practical need if it were called upon to liquidate all the ab ? normal liabilities of the War and the peace , but there is something far more abnormal and danger ? ous to future peace in the claims which the Allies have against Germany than in the claims which the United States has against the Allies . Yet the Columbia statement morally abolishes the claim of the United States against the Allies without saying a word to place the claims of the Allies against Ger ? many in a similar class . If the general contentions of the Columbia Faculty of Political Science were admitted previous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be impossible for even the shrewdest of American negotiators to make it serve as the basis of a general or a permanent settlement . It could only result in the celebration of a public con ? fession by this country that it had been morally wrong in trying to make the Allies pay and that they themselves have incurred no obligation to purchase a release by reducing to a tolerable sum their own mortgage on the future welfare of Germany . PRESIDENT Coolidge has reversed himself with startling suddenness on the matter of additional cruisers for our navy . A fortnight ago in his bud ? get message he was against any increase in the naval forces of the United States . He did not even pro ? pose to ask for funds to build three cruisers already authorized but not yet financed by Congress . But presto and behold He now appears endorsing a bill introduced in the House by its naval affairs committee calling not for three additional cruisers , but ten . These would cost $140,000,000 to con ? struct and many millions more each year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the three vessels which he scorned a few days earlier , as well as three others for which funds have been voted and two more now being built . IT IS reasonable to suppose that this bill is in tended to produce , not ships but a new conference . It is known that our government views with great seriousness the present building of cruisers by Eng land , France , Italy and Japan . Such construction is not technically a violation of the Washington treaty , which did not include vessels of 10,000 tons or less , but actually the powers have gone back to the old armament race , merely excluding battleships and substituting cruisers , destroyers , submarines and air planes . If our new program were carried out , ac cording to Chairman Butler of the House Naval Affairs Committee , we should have 225,000 tons of cruisers as against Great Britain 's 340,000 and Jap ? an 's 193,000 and should still be a long way behind the 5-5-3 ratio which was fixed for capital ships . There is something to be said for maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agi ? tation of our own ultramilitarists who , if we remain substantially below the 5-5-3 ratio , will use that fact as fresh and effective fuel for their own flames . IT WOULD be far better , of course , to persuade the other nations to stop building ; and this is the real purpose of President Coolidge . He has long desired to bring about a new conference to supple ? ment the Washington treaty , and he believes the other nations will be more inclined to listen to rea ? son if faced by the alternative that if they do n't , the United States will proceed to outbuild them . On this point it must be said that the President has played his cards rather clumsily ; and that the hope of obtaining further armament reduction is at pre ? sent a slender one . France and Italy arc in no mood to accept another invitation to Washington . The only real chance for agreement lies in the proposed disarmament meeting under League auspices in 1927 or 1928 ; and the history of the preliminary conference shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial measure of success . THAT the European skies are clearing is shown by the calmness with which the overthrow of the Ger ? Man cabinet has been received . it is generally agreed that when the Reichstag reassembles on Jan. 19 and a new ministry is formed , the Stresemann foreign policies will be followed out , and that he will almost certainly remain at his post . Luther is likely to suceed Marx as Chancellor . The main question unsettled is whether Gessler , the Minister of De ? fense , will come back . It was because of him that the Marx cabinet fell . The Socialists were angered by the charges that he had built up the Reichs ? wehr as an organ of reaction , was in an illegal rela ? tionship with Russia , and was secretly buying moni ? tions from the Soviet government . The National ? ists might have saved the Marx regime , but when their proposal for a reorganization of the cabinet with more places for themselves was rejected , they refused to do so . Germany has been suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor has had to turn to the Socialists or Na ? tionalists for support on various measures , and has been greatly hampered by this necessity . It is hoped that when the Reichstag reassembles a new coalition may be achieved on a broader basis , probably bring ? ing- in the Socialists who approve of Stresemann 's all-important foreign policies . THE poetry of Robert Frost is one of our most important national assets . It is not only a public treasury for the use of the discerning among our citizenry , but rich enough to pay back in sound native mintage some of our cultural indebtedness abroad . Though indigenous in stamp , Frost 's out ? put proves that he has mined deeply and brings up his wealth from the authentic sources which underlie the world . A steadily widening circle of Frost 's appreciators not only at home , but among critical foreign observers , should gratify his coun ? trymen , for we may all share the reward . The group of poems which the New Republic is now publishing at intervals of two weeks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost two years . He is never in haste and he does not need to be . He is sure and so are his admiring readers , for he brings up the true gold from be ? neath the appearance of things . ON the technical aspects of the Fall-Doheny case the New Republic will comment at length in the near future . In the meantime we need only say that the outcome , while in our judgment regrettable , need not surprise anyone familiar with the circum ? stances . The case on which a Washington jury was asked to pass was one in which the defendants were charged with conspiracy , always a difficult thing to prove ; the bribery charge against the same defendants is still pending . The trial came more than four years after the acts complained of , a situation which usually operates to the advantage of the defendant . It is arguable that the jury may have shown a conscientious distinction between a " moral certainty " of conspiracy and conclusive legal proof of the same . They may also have been un ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both a multi-millionaire and a man whose personality is to the highest degree powerful and persuasive . Finally , they had to consider that whereas one branch of the government , represented in the prosecution , attacked the Elk Hills lease as fraudulent , another , represented in the Navy De ? partment , defended it . Admiral Robison took the stand and used the bogey of war with Japan to justify the transaction , despite the fact that the contract was signed in the spring of 1922 , just after the close of the Washington conference , when the tension between America and Japan was less than at any time for a generation . Secretary Wilbur ? who was for many years an inconspicuous citizen of Los Angeles , a town which Mr. Doheny domi ? nated then as now ? took the stand and confirmed the Admiral . Patriotism was invoked . The flag was waved . Such powerful pressure was created that it would be a miracle if any twelve citizens of Wash ? ington , selected at random , could withstand it . THE adverse decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of its resources . In the civil suit based on the same set of facts , the Federal Court of Los Angeles held a year and a half ago that the lease was made " in fraud and conspiracy . " This decision was upheld by the Cir ? cuit- Court of Appeals in San Francisco and the case is now pending before the United States Su- , preme Court . In the similar civil suit against the Sinclair interests to break the Teapot Dome lease , the decision of the Federal District Court of Wy ? oming against the government was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of St. Louis and this case is also pending in the Supreme Court . Next month begins the trial of Fall and Sinclair for conspiracy , in which the allegation will be made that Fall re ? ceived $230,500 in Liberty bonds from Sinclair . Decidedly , the books are not yet closed on this epi ? sode in our history . IT IS supposed to be a great triumph for Poincare that he secured-the passage of the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having to wait until several months of it had passed , as has recently been the custom in France . Whether promptitude alone will be of any lasting benefit , however , remains to be seen . France is now suffer ? ing in the pincers between a rising exchange value of the franc , which discourages exports and brings de ? pression to industry , and a rising internal price level , which increases the burdens of large sections of the population . With such incalculable factors it is a question whether any budget balanced on paper in December will stay balanced in fact until June . Tax yields may tend to rise on account of higher prices , but this tendency is likely to be overborne by the slackness of business activity . Meanwhile the cur ? rent expenses of the government increase . In the de ? pression of 1921 France went through a similar pe ? riod , in which it was said that all troubles of the franc were over , yet nothing permanent was achieved and subsequent inflation was worse than ever . IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends and the profit records of business con ? cerns , it appears that extraordinary prosperity is with us . These profits , however , reflect results of the past months rather than the present condition . Another picture is presented by the bank clearings , which show from week to week in what volume check payments are being made and hence what is the state of trade . Beginning with October , bank clearings have steadily run less than last year atthe same time . A decline in bank clearings is sometimes explained by weakness of the stock market , and is embodied merely in the New York City figures . These , however , for the week ending December 16 , showed a fall of 8 percent against a fall of 8.8 per ? cent for the rest of the country . Or the decline might be due merely to lower prices for specific agricultural products such as wheat or cotton . It is true that the largest reductions are shown in Min ? neapolis , Richmond and Atlanta-25.1 , 23.2 and 35.6 percent respectively . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle 15.3 percent , Chicago and Detroit 10.8 per ? cent . In fact only two out of twenty-three reporting cities showed gains ? Boston and Los Angeles . // They Want to Know Perhaps as you went along you did learn something . I did not care what it was all about . All I wanted to know was how to live in it . Maybe , if you found out how to live in it , you learned from that what it was all about. ? Ernest Hemingway , in The Sun illso Rises . FOR the most part human beings have , of course , cared enormously what it was all about . With ? out a certified plan of the universe and of their personal relation to it , they did not see how they could live in it loyally and adequately . This certi ? fied plan is what they have ordinarily meant by re ? ligion . Recently the newspapers have circulated a " religious " questionnaire which dealt entirely with beliefs about God , immortality and prayer and with specific acts such as church-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to church were classified as religious . People who did not were classified as irreligious . The test was supposed to divide the sheep from the goats . Yet the sophis ? ticated youth of today and many of their elders reject it . Religion concerns truth , but first of all it concerns life . We are not born with any knowledge which equips us to live adequately and truthfully in the world ? to synthesize truth with life . Our regular education has not - repaired the deficiency . Particularly in its higher forms it has subordinated life to achieved truth . It is our first business as human beings to find out how to live . It must be done by personal experiments in living . The people who believe in God and immortality and practice church-going and prayer are not of much help in this respect . Their religion is mixed up with verbal illusions and moral scruples or pretensions which disqualify its devotees from trusting themselves to life and profiting from the experience . Religious education from their point of view is much more a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discovery . The brethren have to choose between belonging either to the shepherds or to the sheep . Hard-boiled youth are justified in rejecting a re ? ligion of opinion or of conventional conduct . The bank whose checks religious tradition is still asking human credulity to cash is bankrupt . It was a ven ? erable institution , and many pious people still honor its paper . Yet its remaining assets are not sufficient to meet its increasing liabilities . The elders founded it early in recorded history when , as a way out of their perplexities , they jumped at a few bristling conclusions about the nature of the universe . These conclusions proved to be useful . Life was in those days an extremely chancy affair . It was not safe to travel except on highways whose signposts fur ? nished directions chiefly in the form of warnings . The lack of common religious convictions imperiled moral and social order . In order to discourage dis ? sent ? equivalent in their minds both to aberration and dissension ? the elders gradually built a temple   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
