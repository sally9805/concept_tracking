txt Treachery of the sea and Sir was the main factor in the wreck of seven of Uncle Sam 's sea hornets . destroyers of the Pacific Fleet , which pitched at twenty knots on to the nagged rocks at La Honda , seventyfive miles north of Santa Barbara , Saturday night , according to the belief of naval experts here . Twenty-two lives and seven warships paid the toll . Four hours previously the Pacific Mail liner Cuba had piled up on San Miguel island . thirty-five miles away , and the air was filled with radio messages telling of her plight and directing the work of rescue . In the meantime , Destroyer Squadron 21 of the fleet was cruising south in a heavy fog , nineteen clean-cut craft , breasting a choppy sea in column formation and steering behind their leader , the Delpy. by dead reckoning and wireless compass directions from shore . The shore directions are said to have became garbled with the flood of air messages on the Cuba wreck and the speedy destroyer squadron was left to the fog  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added its quota to the seafighters ' dilemma and cross currents swept the flotilla out of its course to fling seven of the leading vessels onto the La Honda cliffs . an estimated twenty miles from the ocean lane they believed they were following . Reports from Santa Barbara state that orders given in the belief that the destroyer squadron had passed Point Arguello , the north entrance to the Santa Barbara channel , caused the change of course that piled the vessels on the rocks . Delphy First to Crash . The Delphy crashed first and within a few moments six of her sister ships , Chauncey . Young , Woodbury , Fuller , Lee and Nicholas . were impaled with her on the rocks . A heavy surf swung them back and forth against the reefs . pounding the frail sides of the navy 's speed boats into sieves . The Young turned over and imprisoned nineteen of her crew below the decks in berths that became their tombs . Three of the Delphy  --  s company also went to sailor 's graves , while three more of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in doubt . The Woodbury rammed another crag and listed heavily . The Fuller joined her on the seaward side of the same rock . The Lee grounded close in shore and the Nicholas came to her end a few yards further out with her bow pointed landward . As the Delphy touched the bottom and a moment later crashed , her shrill siren split the fog in warning to the remainder of the squadron . The whistle blast probably saved eleven of the flotilla but six of the leaders of the column behind the Delphy were too close to avail themselves of the warning and plunged forward to their doom The other destroyers of the flotilla had Oaken a different course . With the grounding of the craft their fires were banked , searchlights were dark and the only illumination of their tilted decks were occasional hand flashlights . Chief Electrician Erckenberg of the Delphy swam forty feet to the nearestrock , with a lifeline and his shipmates came along it hand over hand . Erckenberg again jumped into the raging sea and carried the line ashore . Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feat . Peterson carried a line from his vessel to the Chauncey and gave his comrades a slim path of safety from their overturned ship . Tile crews of the Woodbury and Fuller . speared on two sides by the same cluster of crags , clung to their ships all through the night . They were the farthest out of the unfortunate seven ships and were taken off at daybreak by a fishing smack that loomed up a welcome rescuer through the fog . For those who reached the shore during the night the dark , cold hours in scant , wet clothing were almost as trying as for their squadron mates still aboard the wrecks . Later railroad ties were gathered and campfires were lit . Doctors came from Lompoc to attend the five-score injured , who were bruised and battered by the pounding surf . A special train with doctors , nurses and food started for the refugee camp from San Luis Obispo before 2 o'clock in the morning , and Santa Barbara . too . sent her quota of medical aid to the castaways . Thirteen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital . Opo Life Raft Picked Up . Two life rafts put off from the stranded flotilla and headed blindly for supposed safety through the black fog . One . ' with five men aboard , was picked up at slight . a naval wireless station , about three miles south of the wreck , this Inert/lag . Three men are still missing . - Oil from the overflowing tanks of - the i . wrecks coated the sea and added to the I , hances of death for the men of the I fleet . Moire fortunate comrades who E. i succeeded in gaining the shore or a foot ! . hold on adjacent rocks told of their I shipmates slipping from their grasp as they endeavored to drag them to safety . Seaman Pearson of the Delphy , went I to his death a victim of the oil . Blinded by the murky coating on the sea and crazed by the pain of his injuries . he I resisted efforts of his mates to rig a I breeches buoy to carry him to safety . I ( Then the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lash him to a mast as a last resort , but as the remainder of the crew went over the side the craft cracked in two and Pearson went down with his ship . The fog , treacherous currents and the air full of confused radio , tied the hands of the remainder of the destroyer squadron and prevented them from going to /the aid of the stricken seven . Standing out in the channel during the night , warned by the fate of the others that they were far off their course , and unIable in the darkness to correct their i bearings , they were unable to offer help j without the almost certain probability iof joining the others on the rocks . . The body of Fireman 's Mate Conroy , of Oklahoma was the first recovered last night . The dead sailor was the first Ito find a place on the rescue train . As approximately 000 of his surviving mates lined up with heads bared beside i the tracks , the body was placed aboard for transfer to Santa Barbara . All of the seven smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the equipment . Each was valued at approximately 51.500.000 . The group of rocks which stand now as the tombstones of these trim craft rise abrupt and jagged from the ocean . They extend out to sea approximately 500 yards from shore . Here the steamer Santa Rosa went down about twelve years ago and in past years other vessels have met their doore on this ragged reef . A special train carrying about 500 seamen , members of the crews of the seven destroyers wrecked Saturday night near Point Arguello , seventy-five miles north of Santa . Barbara , passed through Los Angeles last night bound for San Diego . Hardly a man in the train wore an entire uniform . The costume was limited to an undershirt and a pair of trousers , while some still wore their lifebelts as auxiliary covering . At every station along the route from Point Concepcion South , the wardrobes of the men were augmented by offerings from sympathetic civilians . One husky sailor strutted forth from the train at Santa Barbara clad in a blanket draped about his shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnant of trousers . Officers were as badly off as their men , and several who had escaped from their ships clad only in their pajamas , took advantage of the offers of kindly civilians , and wore civilian clothes of motely styles until they could replace them with more appropriate attire . The effect of the disaster upon the nerves of th a men could be noted at every sudden lurch or jerk of the train . many of them waking from fitful dozing and leaping to their feet glaring wildly about . Instances of individual heroism were on the lips of ev=ery one . Comrades told how Raymond Rhodehamel of the destroyer Delphy , at the risk of his life , stood on the listed deck of the ship , slippery with oil , and hauled threw men from the waters . I. T. Scott and John Stailman swam to a raft in the raging waters and rescued three shipmates , rowing them to a . Point near Arguello lighthouse , where they were hauled up a 110-foot cliff by ropes .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
