The musical season now closing has witnessed at least one singular novelty-hissing . It is common enough in Europe for people to hiss a piece of music that they do n't like , but Americans heretofore have been too decorous or too unconcerned to express their preferences in any such graphic manner . It is that cacophonious modernist , Schoenberg , who has brought hissing to America . In the height of the season the Philadelphia orchestra journeyed to New York , and gave Schoenberg 's Kammersymphonie . At the close some hand-clapping sounded in the audience , but also a far stranger sound-hissing . That was curious , for the Kammersmyphonie is one of the composer 's earlier works , and is not nearly so ear torturing as his later pieces , some of which had been given in former seasons without hissing . The next time a Schoenberg piece was given in New York it was hissed . The ice broken , audiences were getting up their nerve . It is now the custom to hiss Schoenberg . <P> In Europe , especially in Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted institutions . Audiences at La Scala have long been notorious for this . They tell how whenever Tamagno , who was personally unpopular , was billed to sing at La Scala , audiences went to the theatre determined to hiss him off the stage at his first phrase . When he sang , they applauded . <P> There is a famous story , vouched for as true , of a tenor in Venice who sang an aria so beautifully that the audience made him repeat the piece six times . The sixth time the weary fellow broke on the top note , and they hissed him off the stage . <P> They take music warmly in Italy . When the futurist Marinetti gives one of his " noise recitals " the people go armed with vegetables . A riot usually results . Fantastic stories are told of the famous Wagnerian riots in Bologna away back in the last century . The Wagnerian controversy ran loudly all over the world , but in Italy it reached the point of bloodshed . Lohengrin was given in Bologna , the first Wagnerian performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , and they manifested their feelings emphatically , shouting damnation . But there was a large element of advanced youth present , who were for Wagner . They expressed themselves vociferously . A fight broke out in the theatre . Pro-Wagnerian and anti-Wagnerian crowds in the streets took it up . There was a violent street fight all night , until the authorities had to call out the troops to suppress the disorders . <P> Certainly Americans are not going to ascend to such a peak of interest in music , but the unprecedented outbreak of hissing at a symphony concert , heretofore a most solemn and decorous affair , is a decided advance toward it .
