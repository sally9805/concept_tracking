At Salzburg , birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , rock of classicism , the Leningrad Operatic Studio , last week , ironically burlesqued his Bastien et Bastienne . That pastoral operetta he wrote when he was 12 ( he died in 1791 , at 35 ) . It has three characters-the shepherd sweethearts and a patriarch . The Russians last week added 13 more and played the piece with machinery of production grossly exposed . <P> Three prompters , prim and sarcastic , told the audience how ridiculous was the plot . Half a dozen ballet dancers sat in the audience and mocked . Directors , stage managers and scene shifters scuttled about the stage , instructing the singers in their parts . Bastienne was played as a brusque queen , Bastien a flopping weakling , the old man a dolt . <P> Tourists , scores of them from the U. S. , applauded the Russian burlesque . But Max Reinhardt walked out .
