txt the Mayflower Plymouth apartment hotel ; Morris White , owner of the Fifth Avenue Hotel and the Hotel White . Michael Kaufman , owner of an apartment hotel in Lexington Avenue , near Seventy-second Street , and Nathan Minskoff , owner of an apartment hotel in West Seventy-second Street , near Central Park West . Law on Tenements . The law described a tenement as " any house or building , or portion thereof , which is rented , leased , let or hired out , to be occupied , or is occupied as the home or residence of three families or more living independently of each other , and doing their cooking upon the premises , or by more than two families upon any floor , so living and cooking , but having a common right to the halls , stairways , yards , water closets or privies , or some of them . " Joseph Nemerov , who has offices at 362 Fifth Avemie , was chosen attorney for the new organization . It was understood that he and other lawyers later to be employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Commissioner Martin 's ruling will engage in extensive preparation to carry the case through all the courts of the State and to the United States Supreme Court in the event the Commissioner 's stand is upheld . Members of the new organization expressed the belief last night , however , that the Commissioner 's ruling will be set aside in the first court proceedings he is expected to institute on the basis of a specific case reported to him by his inspectors . It was understood that the principal contention of the apartment hotel owners in their fight on the ruling will be that the Tenement House law was not intended by the Legislature to apply to any but buildings occupied by families who had little choice as to where they would live because of lack of means . Much stress will be laid by the lawyers for the apartment hotel owners on the enormous expense that had been entailed in equipping the apartment hotels with fireproofing and other essentials not to be found in the tenement houses of the city . Another Point in Defense . Another important point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense will be that neither the Tenement House Department nor the Building Department in the two or more years in which the ' construction of apartment hotels has come into vogue in the fashionable residential sections of the city made the contention that such structures , with the vast investment involved , came under the provisions of the old Tenement House law . Aside from the direct conflict of the apartment hotel owners with the Tenement House Department in the Commissioner 's drastic ruling , another feature of Mr. Martin 's interpretation of the law which is expected to bring about much litigation in the event the Commissioner 's contention is upheld by the courts is the fact that many of the hotels were built merely for speculative purposes . In many instances these structures were sold while in process of construction or soon after they were ready for occupancy . The new owners took/them over with the understanding that their exclusive features of occupancy were in thorough accord with existing laws . Were the courts to rule that serving pantries brought the structures under the provisions of the Tenement House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to many of the occupants breaking their leases and thus bring about considerable loss to the new owners ,
