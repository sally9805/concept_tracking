The Jade God . When John Millicent stole a jade figurine out of a Hindoo temple , its baleful influence followed him to Sussex where , one evening , he was discovered lying across his desk , his throat slit . The figurine had disappeared as well as a Malay kriss which he used for a paper weight . Then Jack Derrick , who loved daughter Jean Millicent , set out to find the murderer of her father . During the process people peered through doors and curtains , a wall panel opened emitting smoke and a greenish glow , girls shrieked , the figurine shone and spoke in the darkness . Even the portrait of the late Millicent found a spectral voice . <P> Audience refuses to be horrified , insists on laughing . Margaret Wycherly plays the part of a red-headed servant who knows more than she tells . <P> Pansy , a Negro revue , lasted just three hissful performances . Said Dramacritic J. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times : ' ' Purely for purposes of historical record let this bema announce that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced . . . last evening . "
