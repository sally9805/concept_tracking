Let three men set out in a boat from Ireland and the consequences are their own . Let the three whirl a propeller in the dim mist of an Irish morning , eat nibbly breakfasts , wave carefully courageous goodbyes and set off into the West as though frightened by the rising sun , and the wheels of the world are set churning with their own . <P> Hope , adventure , romance , work , love &; hate , tragedy follow in the trail of their wake . The effect of their flight is felt in the farthest corners of civilization . To some it brings fame and money . To rivals it brings disappointment . To the daring it brings danger . To the glib it brings endless speeches . To one , needlessly , it brings death . To many , sorrow . <P> During those fretful days when two Germans and an Irishman bent over maps in the mess hall of Baldonnel Airdrome , little did they reck the possible consequences of their flight . Theirs at that moment must have been a single-tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York ; they were taking all the risks , facing the supreme danger with shining faces . They asked no man to do what they were doing . <P> Reporters , telegraphers , editors , printers were the first to feel the effect of their flight ; to them it meant just another day of newspapers . Skippers of steamships next craned their necks , scanning the leaden skies for some sign of this fleeting Bremen. * But when Baron Ehrenfried Gunther von Huenefeld , Capt . Hermann Koehl and Maj. James C. Fitzmaurice dropped onto the frozen waste of Greenly Island in Southern Labrador , far off their expected course , they gave Lighthouse Keeper Le Tempier a torch with which to light the fires of the world . <P> A hurried tramp through the snow , excited taps on the key at Point Armour , and William Barrett transmitted word that the flyers had landed safely , first to cross the Atlantic by airplane from east to west . Erwin Stuart Davis , an amateur wireless operator of Manchester , N. H. , caught the message , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commendable enterprise , newspapers fought for airplanes . In amazing time , the first got through ; C. A. ( " Duke " ) Schiller and Dr. Louis Cuisinier risked their lives in the flight , almost as dangerous in that stormy maelstrom as the plunge across the Atlantic . More planes started up , with insanely jealous cameramen , writers , mechanics , until the frozen corner of Canada began to bulge . <P> The Hotel Savard , in snowy Murray Bay ( La Malbaie , the French-Canadians call it ) became jammed with men &; women ; two slept in a bed and cots filled up the dinky corridors , just as though a notorious murderer were to be tried . Sleighs were requisitioned , as recklessly as planes . More men , more money , were poured into the northland . ... In New York , hawkers sold flags and buttons , carpenters started building grandstands . <P> . . . In Beauceville , Quebec , a young girl wrote her first mashnote , to an Irishman . <P> . . .
