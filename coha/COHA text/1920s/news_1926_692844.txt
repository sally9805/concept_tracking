txt Believers in historical continuity will be gratified by the unofficial State Convention of the New York Prohibitionists . The delegates are to " assemble , " if that is n't too large a word for the few but fit , in this town tomorrow . Evidently the stern and unbending Drys have lost hope of longer scaring the Republicans . Democrats are notorious heathen . It is time for the saving remnant to stand up and be counted . The immediate modest desire of the saints IS to secure a future place on the ballot for their candidates . To do this their man for Governor must get 25,000 votes next Fall . Surely prohibition , " betrayed " by false politicians , ought to be able to ? muster that number of the pure and trustworthy . The Anti-Saloon League candidate for Senator against Mr. WADSWORTH will be supported by these brethren who had a hand in discovering him in Herkimer : but this does n't seem to impress anybody . It is the promised revival of a long-beloved figure , the National Prohibition Party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years , amid the splendid successes of non- or bipartisan prohibition , Old . Faithful had seemed to vanish . The shop is shut up . The machinery is rusty . But the foreman is still ready for business . Mr. D. LEIGH CoLviti , National Chairman , is still in the chair . The reappearance of a Hunker or a Barnburner Chairman could n't give more surprise . He will strike the " keynote . " He has struck it already . The cruel war on the Eighteenthr ' Amendment and the Volstead act , he says , makes necessary a revival of the old Prohibition Party in every State : It is essential , as I see it , that we shall be in a position to function in State campaigns at this crisis as well as in the Presidential election of 1928 . I realize now that it was a grave error to disband the party , which must return to the job not only to insure that the Eighteenth Amendment remain in the Constitution and the teeth remain in the Volstead law but to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prohibition Commissioner HAYNES takes this as an unfriendly utterance , it is well said . The National Prohibition Party nominated its first candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency in 1872 and cast some 5,600 votes . In 1870 and 1580 it cast less than 10,000 . In its early days it had a platform with other " planks " than the one thing needful . In 1884 the still remembered ST . Jo NN ofKansas , proclaiming prohibition and nothing but prohibition , got 150,000 votes . In the next two national elections , with a miscellaneous platform , the party got from 250,000 to 270 ; 000 , the latter its " high . " Thereafter , whether driven single or in a team of issues , it seemed unable to poll more than from 200,000 to 250,000 votes . Then came the mistake of trying to make prohibition national . Now the facts are asserting themselves and many politicians are recovering their courage . The straitest sect of prohibitionists , seeing the time-servers falling away in multitudes , finds in its little self the sole hope for enforcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy race of politicians .
