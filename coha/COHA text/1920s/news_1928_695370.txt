txt Prior to Aug. 13 , 1922 , the city re . ceived $6,000 a year for the privilege of removing its dead animals . Now the city is paying $70,000 a year to get the animals carted away . 1 An amended bill was filed In the Circuit court yesterday by Attorneys John J. Healy and Chester E. Cleveland alleging that the $70,000 a year contract is illegal and void . The suit is in behalf of a taxpayer , Prank L. /Avery , whose further : identity is not disclosed . The bill asserts that the name of the present dead animal contractor is the Midwest Trading and Securities corporation , formerly known , accord-1 ing to one ordinance , as the Midwest Securities and Trading corporation . Regarding this company the bill says that it is a Delaware corporation ; but " after diligent inquiry this taxpayer has not been able to find that the said Midwest Trading and Securities corporation has or ever had any public place of business in the said city of Chicago and that the corporation is not listed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passed . However the city council passed an ordinance at its last regular meeting authorizing the commissioner of public ' works to enter into a contract with this company for five years at $70,000 a year " without advertising . " The previous live year contract , made in 1922 , was for $57,500 a year . The bill alleges that Mayor Thompson signed the ordinance for the present contract on July 16 , and that the Midwest Trading and Securities corporation was first licensed to do business in Illinois on July 6 of this year . It is charged that its charter does not confer the right to enter into a dead animal contract . Another defect in the " pretended contract , " according to the sult , ? - 'is that the contract approved by the city purported to repeal the city ordinances which prescribe the method by which the contract has been award ed. it is claimed that tho contract ordinance passed was not referred to any committee for consideration . Sundry other reasons are cited for alleging that the contract Is void . The taxpayer asks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Controller Designate Schmidt and City Treasurer Peterson be restrained from paying the Midwest Trading and Securities corporation any cash for removing dead animals . The award of the contract followed the advertising of bids on Feb. 1 last . These bids were considered and finally rejected . Inquires at the city hall yesterday brought the statement thoit no complaints have been received regarding the service of the Midwest company .
