It 18 a fact that he is resentful of the efforts to " get him out of stocks . " particularly issues that are showing uniformly good reports . strong balance sheets and big potentialities for the future . He does not understand why a speculative situation such as produced wild gyrations in certain issues some months ago , which has been partially corrected by breaks of from 50 to 100 points in those issues , should work in getting him out of National Biscuit . Chrysler . General Motors and other issues that are wellmanaged and alight easily enjoy increasing business in the future . This type of speculator. with his 30 , , t. and even 50 " margin , wonders why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sooner or later he must get out of his stocks because he can not afford to pay the interest rates even on a conservative market position .
