txt Immigration Commissioner Henry H. Curran yesterday recommended to the Department of Labor in Washington that the deportation proceedings against Luis Angel Firpo . Argentine heavyweight pugilist , be dropped . In a report forwarded to Secretary of Labor James J. Davis , Commissioner Curran urged cancellation of the warrant of arriset and issuance of an order , asserting that the charges that Firpo had imported a woman into the United States for immoral purposes were not borne out by the evidence . When Firpo arrived here last Summer to box Harry Wills , by whom he was defeated in Jersey City Sept. 11 , Canon Chase . as head of the New York Civic League , took steps to prevent the bout . Miss Bianca Lourdes Picart , who had come on the same steamship , was deported on the ground that her passport was for Cuba : Then ? irPn ! s arrest on a perjury charge was brought ? about . He is out on bail awaiting a hearing on this charge . He was arrested again . a. few days before the boxing contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was released on bail for a hearing which began a few days after the bout . Curran Explains In making known that he had come to a decision , Commissioner Curran issued this statement : " W. W. Brown , Inspector in charge of the law division at Ellis Island , who is also a capable attorney , has completed the hearing in the proceeding undertaken . by Canon Chase to secure the deportation of Firpo on . the ground that he brought a woman to the United States for immoral purposes in July , 1923 . Mr. Brown 's conclusion is that there is no evidence upon which recommendation to the Secretary of Labor to order deportation of the alien may be based . In this . conclusion 1 concur and the same conclusion has been reached by three other immigration officials here . " Five of us have been through the case wiith the greatest care , and each of the five has separately conic to this opinion . Therefore , I anl sending today to the Secretary of/Labor , who is the deciding official in such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deportation proceedings dropped . " An interesting revelation in connection with the publicity that has attended this case is the testimony under oath of Canon Chase . He said he took up this matter at the instigation of a New York newspaper , the name of which paper he refused to furnish . " After all the fuss and feathers of the publicity in the case had blown away and the matter had come down to an orderly hearin  --  conducted by the Government , - Canon Chase . adthitted under oath that he had stated to ' prospective witnesses ' at Ellis , Island that ' if Firpo had good friends they would tell him to get out of the United States before it was too late , because there are five years staring him in the face . ' This refers to the perjury 's proceedings instituted by Canon Chase and now before Commissioner Hitchcook . If ' Firpo 's friends ' had successfully ' followed the canon 's ' advice , the result would have been that Firpo would have jumped his bail .

Attorney Sandler made this comment last night : " Curran applied for- the warrant and now he makes a finding reversing himself . It 's a somersault . I believe this is the first time in the history of the Department of Labor- that a warrant was issued and that the Commissioner who issued the warrant reversed himself . It 's ' very strange . But the final decision rests ' with the Department of Labor in Washington . I never was paid in this . case by any newspaper . The complaint was made by Canon Chase in the publicinterest .. Pressuee from Washington ' compelled Curran to ask for a warrant . ' Canon Chase intends that at the perjury hearing , which .
