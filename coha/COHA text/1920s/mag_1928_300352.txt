" How will the Congress work with Hoover ? " The question was and is often asked . An inkling of an answer appeared last week while the House Appropriations Committee was considering the Budget Bureau 's figures for running the Department of Commerce next year . As a rule , if Congressmen have fault to find with Budget estimates it is that they are too large . But at this hearing , the Congressmen listened respectfully to Director Julius Klein of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce . Mr. Klein protested that the money set down for his Bureau in the Budget was too small . " The situation in South America , " he said , " is getting much more important , as you all know , in connection with the trip of the President-Elect and also , more particularly , in connection with the drive of Europeans for those markets . " <P> " South American markets will be closed to U. S. business within a year , " said Mr. Klein , " unless we capitalize the present opportunity . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America . But they cocked their ears at mention of the President-Elect and at " capitalize the present opportunity . " <P> Mr. Klein 's appropriation was raised to $88,500.
