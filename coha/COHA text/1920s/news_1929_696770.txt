txt The battle to upset the conviction of Albert B. Fall on a charge of accepting a $100,000 bribe from Edward L. Doheny in connection with the Elk Hills Naval Oil Reserve lease will be under way before the end of next week . Attorneys for Mr. Fall will file it motion Monday for an arrest of judgment and on Friday they will argue before Justice Hitz , in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia , the motion filed yesterday for a new trial . The fight for a reversal will be almost entirely based on Justice Hitz 's charge to the jury , which Frank J. Hogan , chief counsel for Mr. Fall , declares was in numerous specific instances " improper , erroneous and prejudicial . " Mr. Hogan in fact charges that the justice in his charge went so far as to " invade the province of the jury . " Stood for Acquittal 21 Hours . Mr. Hogan referred to the charge today as amounting to an " assault of the constitutional rights of trial by jury . " " When Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recommendation to mercy , " Mr. Hogan declared today , " it amounted to an unwarranted and an improper invitation to the jury to convict . " It was disclosed today that the three members of the jury who stood for conviction from the first to the last ballot were Thomas E Norris , a bank teller , who was the foreman ; Harvey I. Taylor , an interior decorator , and Barney 0 . Weitz , a coal dealer . The juror who held out for acquittal for more than twenty-one hours was reported to be Thomas C. Adkins. an engineer employed by the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad . " It was the juryroom arguments of Mr. Norris , Mr. Taylor and Mr. Weitz that turned a majority for acquittal to a verdict of guilty , " said one of the defense lawyers today . " Will Fight to Very- End . " Discussing the verdict today , Mr. Hogan , who directed the battle for the defense , said the verdict would be appealed , if necessary , to the Supreme Court of the United States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District of Columbia . would follow a denial by Justice Hitz of the motion which has been made for a new trial . " Of course , " said Mr. Hogan , " we will fight this case to the very end . We have already begun , and the first public move will be in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia next Friday , when we argue the motion , already filed , for a new trial . " " Will the admission by Justice Hits of the Sinclair payments to Fall he the basis of the fight to have the verdict of the jury reversed ? " Mr. Hogan was asked . .. , " It certainly will , " he replied . " We shall contend , " Mr. Hogan. continued . " that when Mr. Justice Hits admitted into evidence the testimony of Mahlon T. Everhart , a son-in-law of Mr. Fall , regarding the payments of Liberty bonds and cash by H. F. Sinclair to Mr. Fall , he brought into the case a matter distinct from it and in no way involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evidence Called Inadmissable . " We shall insist when the time comes that . Tustice Hits erred when he permitted government counsel to put the Mammoth oil lease , involving the Teapot Dome , into evidence . " Also It will be our position that the testimony of Mr. Everhart in which he told of cash payments by Sinclair at Three Rivers and subsequently here in Washington , in both instances the payments being subsequent to anything done in the Doheny case , was evidence which , under every legal rule , . was inadmissible in all cases or matters involving the leasing of the Elk Hills fields in California . " There was not one word of evidence to show that Fall personally knew anything about these subsequent payments . first of $10.000 and later of $211.000. by Sinclair to Everhart . This evidence I insist was unlawfully used by counsel for the government to Ur+ prejudice of Mr. Fall . - " Again it is our position that Justice Hits took an improper and erroneous position when in his general charge to the jury he directed the jury 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time stating to the jury that the Sinclair transaction was admitted into evidene because it was an act of the same Lind , at about the same time , upon a matter similar to that involving Mr. Doheny and Mr. Fall . " This was an erroneous improper and incorrect statement . It was a statement of alleged fact that the court had no right to single out and emphasize . It was an invasion of the province of the jury . " Mr. Hogan said he did not know when the government would ask the court to fix a date for the trial of Edward L. Doheny on the indictment which charges Mr. Doheny with the giving of a bribe to a public official of the United States . The present intention of the government is to ask that the date be set early in the new year , probably for the second Monday in January . In the Doheny case it is generally conceded that the government 's task will he much more difficult than it was in the Fall phase of the bribery elk:gallons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither can Mr. Fall 's boast , which was used with such telling effect on the trial that ended yesterday , that he , Fall , would personally handle the Teapot Dome transaction . This was what he said to his subordinates a short time before the Doheny lease was signed and while the Teapot Dome contracts were being drawn up . Physicians Attend Fall .
