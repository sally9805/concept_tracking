A hundred and fifty years ago , Capt . James Cook , British seadog , who had sailed the Pacific from the Antarctic and the South Sea Islands to Alaska , anchored his good ship Resolution in Kealakekua Bay , Hawaii . There was joy among the natives , for the Great White God and his crew of Demi-Gods had come at last . In the shade of the ohia-lehuas , the priests chewed the meat of coconuts . Then they removed the juice from their mouths and rubbed it on the face and arms of Capt . Cook . He was fed with the flesh of sacrificed animals , washed down by the remains of the juice . Every day there were new ceremonies , until Capt . Cook sailed away several weeks later . One of his crew had died ; the Hawaiians thought that rather peculiar , but otherwise they were satisfied with the visit of the Great White God . <P> When Capt . Cook returned a week later , they were already convinced that he was no god . Trouble brewed . Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture the king as hostage for a stolen cutter ; the natives attacked , stabbed Capt . Cook . . . . Years later , the breastbone of Capt . Cook was found among the sacred relics of one Hawaiian clan . <P> It was the coming and not the going of Capt . Cook that the U. S. territory of Hawaii prepared to celebrate last week . Grass huts were built on Waikiki beach , Honolulu , to show how the natives lived 150 years ago when white man first gazed upon them. * The peaceful tasks of weaving lauhala mats , pounding poi , fashioning tapa cloth were conspicuous in the pageant . <P> Governor Wallace Rider Farrington welcomed many a bigwig from Great Britain and the U.S. to his now contented islands , where the natives ride the waves with surf boards and where the weather is so good that nobody needs to write about it . Japanese make up the largest population group , but business is chiefly in the hands of people from the U. S. <P> Symbolic , indeed , is the giant pineapple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 gallons of water , which supplies the automatic sprinkler system of the largest fruit canning factory in the world- the James D. Dole 's Hawaiian Pineapple Co . Mr. Dole is perhaps the richest resident of Hawaii and its most ardent publicist . Another famed Dole , the late Sanford Ballard ( TIME , June 21 , 1926 ) , was responsible for stirring up the revolution which ousted Queen Liliuokalani , was the first and only President of Hawaii ( 1894-1900 ) , was a leader in getting the U. S. to annex the islands . <P> Who 's Who of Hawaii would not omit Riley H. Allen , editor of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin ; Frank Atherton , banker , sugar and shipping man ; Alexander Budge , director in pineapple , sugar , shipping and hotel firms . <P> * Unless the Spaniard Gaetano , who is thought to have sighted the Islands in 1555 , touched on the Hawaiian shore .
