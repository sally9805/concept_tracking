The announcement was made officially ; it remains only for the change to be made . C. Bascom Slemp gave his resignation to the President and it was accepted . That there was discord between the President and his Secretary was a well-credited rumor more than six months ago . Mr. Slemp and the President 's campaign manager , William M. Butler , clashed at the Cleveland Convention last June over the selection of the vice presidential candidate . Afterwards , Mr. Slemp would have resigned ( TIME , June 30 ) had not the President succeeded in pacifying him . <P> It is presumed that friction or perhaps " discordance " began because C. Bascom Slemp hoped to graduate from the position of Secretary to the President to that of Chairman of the Republican National Committee and campaign manager . Instead , William M. Butler was given the post . Some time later the above mentioned clash occurred . But Mr. Slemp stayed on through the campaign and election . He stayed on some time further . It was rumored that he hoped for a seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week , it was announced that Postmaster General New would continue in office . Whether or not there was any connection , it was coincidentally announced that Mr. Slemp would retire . So the tall man with high forehead , prominent eyes , long nose , large chin , he who stalked through the corridors of the White House Office so swingingly with silk hat , cutaway and cane , will depart thence-but not to a great distance . He is to resume law practice with the firm of Good , Childs , Bobb &; Westcott of Washington and Chicago ( James W. Good , head of the firm , is a onetime Congressman from Iowa , and Vice Chairman of the Republican National Committee ) . <P> Who after Slemp ? The question was answered at once , for the same announcement that told of Mr. Slemp 's retirement told of his successor chosen : Representative Everett Sanders of Terre Haute , Indiana . <P> When Mr. Coolidge went into office , he wanted a secretary who knew the ins and outs of the political game , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Senator Curtis , Republican Floor Leader Longworth , Speaker Gillett . They suggested Mr. Slemp of Virginia , who had retired from Congress shortly before . It is assumed that Mr. Sanders was chosen rather in the same fashion and for the same purposes . <P> Mr. Sanders , who is only 42 , is also about to retire from Congress . He did not stand for re-election in November , intending to resume his law practice . Unlike Mr. Slemp , he is not a man of independent means . He worked his way through college ( the University of Indiana ) , then got into law , finally into Congress , where he has been for eight years , an enthusiastic follower of Nicholas Longworth and the other Republican leaders . He was considered as a nominee for Vice President at the Cleveland Convention but complications in Indiana politics-where Senator James Watson was ambitious-overturned his chances . Now he goes forth upon another task .
