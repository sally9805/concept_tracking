How do the firefly and the glowworm blink their lights ? How does the jellyfish called ctenophore and the tiny , multitudinous noctiluca flash in the sea ? And two score other fish , insects , plants , and bacteria ? <P> To tell an inquisitive public , New York 's American Institute last week conducted another of its popular lectures on scientific topics . Speaker was Edmund Newton Harvey , professor of physiology at Princeton and authority on chemiluminescence for the National Research Council. * After explaining that luminescence in living matter is not phosphorescence and has nothing to do with phosphorus , he had a simple story to tell . <P> That is , about 40 living forms secrete a substance called luciferin . In the presence of moisture luciferin oxidizes , forming oxy-luciferin , the substance which actually glows . As oxy-luciferin glows it loses its oxygen and returns to luciferin , which after a short rest may be oxidized again . <P> The question of whether man shall ever be able to reproduce living light , which is at least twice as efficient as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be able to synthesize the protein luciferin . Dr. Harvey thought that " that will come in the future . We now synthesize fats , sugars , and some of the polypetides . " Luciferin seems to be either a peptone or a proteose . <P> * In 1913-14 he explored the Great Barrier Reef , 1,200-mi. coral band fringing northeast Australia , for the Carnegie Institution of Washington . Leader of the expedition was Dr. C. M. Yonge , Englishman , whose essays on marine science , Vueer Fish , Brentano 's has just published ( $2.50 ) . Mrs. Harvey , as Dr. Ethel Nicholson Browne , taught biology at Wellesley and Cornell until their marriage in 1916 . They live at Princeton , have two sons .
