The American Prix de Rome is not a horse race but a prize , valued at $8,000 , yearly awarded to one U. S. painter and one U. S. sculptor . If he wins the prize , an artist goes to Rome and lives there at the rate of $1,600 a year for three years ; his models , tuition and transportation are paid for . Last week , this year 's winners were announced ; one was Donald M. Mattison , student at the up-and-coming Yale School of Fine Arts , who won the prize for painting . The other was Sculptor David K. Rubins who works in the Manhattan studio of Sculptor James Earle Fraser . <P> Painter Mattison appeared to be an academician before his time . His was an old-fashioned mythology picture , called Ignis Fatuus . In the painting , there were the nymphs who , according to fable , lured reckless sensation-seekers across the bogs outside of Rome eager to discover the secret of the strange fires that burned upon them . Artist Mattison had included in his composition a man chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them but his hands were empty , the nymphs were laughing and the man was about to sink down in the bog . The background of the picture was mostly the entrance to a large sewer in which it was possible to distinguish rats jumping around . <P> Gazers-on were quite naturally surprised that so staid and lugubrious a representation should be the work of a 23-year-old native of Winston-Salem , N. C. With slow words , Donald Mattison explained about his picture . It was not intended as a sermon but only as " a remark upon life in New York . " <P> David Rubins , the 25-year-old prize-winning sculptor , chattered with pleasure when told of his good luck . He said that his father was a Minneapolis mural decorator , that he had learned most about sculpture from his present employer and that he had four years ago won the Beaux Arts Paris Prize , which had already given him one year 's study abroad .
