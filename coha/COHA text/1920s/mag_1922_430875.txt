FOR a hundred years we have been justly proud of what the American school system has accomplished . Tinder its influence we have developed a higher level of general knowledge than can be found in any of the larger countries of Europe . We have secured not only a greater breadth of intellectual interest , but a better understanding of the conditions which make for personal health and social order . We have trained vast numbers of immigrants to become a part of our own nation , mentally as well as politically . Nor have we forgotten the individual in our care for the mass . We have so multiplied opportunities for study that the high school pupil of to-day has far more chance for exercising his special tastes and aptitudes than had the college boy of one or two generations previous . But there is another side to the picture , which has not escaped the notice of keen observers . Foreign critics , while generally recognizing the high standard reached by a large part of our elementary schools , in teaching , in discipline , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colleges less favorably . Too much has been done for the pupils , too little has been expected of them . We have not recognized that education , the bringing out of a man 's powers , was a very different thing from pedagogy , the leading of children , and that great harm could be done by confusing the two . It is an unfortunate fact that a large majority of the American public tends to regard teachers of every grade as pedagogues rather than as trainers ; as men whose duty it is to provide their pupils with work which is interesting and easy at the moment , rather than to expect them to do things which are sometimes uninteresting and often fatiguing for the sake of a remote end . If a boy fails in his school or college examinations , there is a disposition to place the blame on the teacher for making the subject too dry or the paper too hard . In many sections of the country there is a tendency to treat examinations themselves as an evil ; and to excuse the scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of proving , to the satisfaction of others besides his teachers , that he can use his knowledge in an emergency . All this tends to keep the scholar in the position of a pupil ? a ward under an instructor 's care ; instead of making him a student in the true sense of the word ? one who applies his own mind to the mastery of a subject . The result is what always follows from keeping people under wardship for too long a period . There is a loss of intellectual independence , a failure to develop powers of leadership . The boy or girl leaves school well-informed as to the ground already covered by the course of study but not always well-equipped for facing an unknown future , and meeting its responsibilities in a spirit of clear-headed self-reliance . The experience of the American Expeditionary Force in 1918 illustrated at once the strength and weakness of our educational system . The men in the ranks averaged better than those of any other army ? not only in health and in general intelligence , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline , which was a surprise both to our allies and  | to our opponents . But the advantage was lost as one went higher up into positions where independent initiative was required in greater and greater degree . Company officers , though generally good , were not so conspicuously fitted to lead as the men under them were to follow . The work of field officers did not average so well as that of company officers ; that of regimental commanders and chiefs of staff , in spite of some honorable exceptions , was most disappointing . Nor was this lack of fitness for higher positions to be explained wholly by our lack of military experience ; for it showed itself among those engaged in the production of ships and aircraft no less than in the handling of combatant forces . And besides this loss of independence on the part of those who are taught , our present system involves a great loss of efficiency on the part of the teacher . Not only is the product of our schools one-sided ; the cost of production of what we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better product by present methods seems almost prohibitive . What would be thought of the directors of a manufacturing corporation which compelled its skilled workmen to furnish the power to drive their own machines ? They would be regarded , and justly regarded , as two centuries behind the times . They could neither afford to pay proper salaries to highgrade labor , nor get adequate product from it if they did ; for nine-tenths of the power which should go into the perfecting of the work would have to be spent in driving the machines . Yet the members of a school board or college corporation make precisely this mistake when they engage a first-rate man to teach arithmetic or history , under conditions which require him to use up a large part of his strength in making the scholars do their own work . To get the quantity and quality of education which the world to-day requires by the use of methods like these is as hopeless as would be the attempt to get the quantity and quality of clothing which the world requires by the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought this economic aspect of the educational problem very clearly before the public . A great many of our best teachers , particularly college teachers , were utilized in war work ? not only teachers of applied science , but teachers of history , economics , and languages . These men almost always did extremely well . Even in war time , they received somewhat higher pay for their services to the national government than they had previously obtained for their regular work in the schools ; and when the war was over , business firms were ready to offer them permanent employment at compensation two or three times as great as they had hitherto received . Of the older men who already held permanent positions as teachers , the number who changed their calling was not very large . They liked it for the sake of the opportunities of service which it offered and for the associations and ideals connected with it ; and they were ready to return to their chosen field at some pecuniary sacrifice . But with the men who were just entering or preparing to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business concern offered them higher pay and better conditions for utilizing their power than schools or colleges were likely to give , they abandoned teaching and used their ability in other directions . As a result there was a decided shortage of good teachers , particularly in the colleges ; and a rather keen competition arose within the lines of the teaching profession itself for the services of the men that were available . College salaries of every grade were advanced to meet the increased cost of living ; conditions of employment were arranged to give able men a greater chance of utilizing their powers to advantage . This process has not gone quite so far in our high schools , because outside business does not compete as actively for high-school teachers as it  | does for college teachers , and because taxpayers are reluctant to have highschool salaries increased , except in case of dire necessity . But in spite of all obstacles school salaries are moving in the same direction as college salaries . In every institution above the primary grade , the budget problem is a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeless one . It is hopeless , so long as we stick to present methods . We can not teach the existing number of high school and college students in the way their parents want them taught without spending more money than the community is willing to pay ? and perhaps more than it ought to pay . For there is a point beyond which further taxes cripple the life of the community more than further opportunities for education help it ; and in some districts it looks as though we had pretty nearly reached that point . We certainly should not ask for large increase of appropriations for teachers ' salaries until we have made sure that we have found the most efficient and economical methods of giving the public the teaching it needs . We must treat education as a problem in political economy , where it is as essential to keep down costs as to keep up values . We must approach the problem from the standpoint of the community , considering what it most requires in the way of education , how far this must be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left to other agencies . When we have thus learned to separate the essential from the nonessential , and the things the teacher ought to undertake from those which he ought not to undertake , we shall find the way to give better education than we now do at less cost ; utilizing a moderate staff of well-paid instructors to the best advantage , instead of paying lower salaries to a larger variety of teachers than the actual necessities of the case require . What is Education ? The answer to this question is not so simple as appears at first sight . In fact there are two different and somewhat conflicting answers . According to nearly all the dictionaries , both English and American , the primary meaning of the word , which underlies all others , is the imparting of knowledge . Education is treated as synonymous with instruction . The teacher is regarded as the active agent , busy in storing the pupil 's mind with the things he needs to know . In putting this meaning of the word first and giving it most prominence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probable that eighty per cent of the American school teachers , and ninety per cent of the American public , would approve of what the dictionaries have done . But there is another sense in which the word is employed , which is equally important and quite different . We may regard education as a training for the varied work of life ? industrial , social , and political ? in which knowledge is not an end but ' an incident ; in which the student is learning to do things ; in which the teacher is no longer the sole directing agency , but one among many co-operating agencies , for the attainment of this end . To set forth this meaning of education no better words can be found than those used by John Milton in his " Tractate " nearly three centuries ago : " I call therefore a compleat and generous Education that which fits a man to perform justly and magnanimously all the offices both private and publick of Peace and War . " Now the mere fact that the term Education is employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every word in the English language which deals with a complex conception has more than one meaning . What is unusual and surprising in this particular case is that two distinct meanings are regarded by almost everybody , dictionary-makers included , as being mere variations of the same meaning . Training is regarded as an incidental  | result of knowledge , rather than as a distinct process of learning to do things . When two meanings of an important word like education have become thus confused in the public mind , so that instruction and training are treated as pretty nearly synonymous , it results in much loose thinking ; and what is worse , in much misapplied power and profitless expense . We assume that we are necessarily training citizens when we are imparting knowledge , and vice versa . To check this sort of fallacious reasoning , and this waste of money and power , we must choose one sense of the word education as the basis of public discussion , and stick to it . We may either define education as the imparting of knowledge , and call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of training ; or we may follow John Milton in regarding education as preparation for citizenship , and call the imparting of knowledge by the name of instruction . Either method is good enough , provided we adhere to it consistently . The choice between the two must be determined by practical considerations . If we were considering education from the standpoint of the psychologist only , it would not make much difference which we chose . But we are considering it from the standpoint of the political economist . We are concerned to find out what a democratic and progressive community like ours requires of its citizens and how the schools can help them to get it . These requirements are admirably set forth in the passage of Milton which I have just quoted . Let us therefore accept this as the basis for our definition of education and call it preparation for the varied activities of citizenship . The process of imparting knowledge we shall then call instruction . Instruction is and always will be an important element in education ; knowledge is and always will be of exceptional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisition of knowledge is not the end of education as we are now using the terms ; it is simply an incident in the larger and more important process of training for citizenship . In thus expanding our definition of education , so as to view it from the public standpoint , we are really going back to the primary meaning of the word , instead of getting away from it . To educate is to educe ; to make something out of a man rather than to put something into him . Let us examine briefly how a modern commonwealth must go to work to bring out the qualities needed in its members , how far our present school system contributes to that end , and what we can do to make this contribution more effective . Let us view education provisionally as the process by which the human animal is fitted for membership in civilized society , and see where this way of looking at things leads us in the way of theoretical propositions and practical results . Every community , however rude , must develop certain habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certain habits of decency which serve to keep it safe in time of peace . Among communities which are at all civilized , the requirements of discipline take the form of a social order which affords some protection to the members of the tribe who are physically weak , and the requirements of decency make some provision for cleanness of body and mind ? at least at stated seasons . A civilized community must also develop certain habits of prudence , so that the labors of the present may serve to meet the needs of the future . Order , cleanness , and prudence seem to be the fundamental things which distinguish civilization from barbarism ; and for a community which is governed by an absolute monarch or by a religious oligarchy they seem to represent about all that is essential as a basis for citizenship . But a free commonwealth needs something more than this . If a community is to enjoy civil liberty it must develop habits of self-control among the great  | body of its members and habits of leadership among a considerable number of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure than habits of order , cleanness , and prudence . For order , cleanness , and prudence can be imposed and maintained by authority from above ; while self-control and leadership have their source and their sustenance in each man 's own soul . If we give a man liberty to do right we give him liberty to do wrong . The only security that the community has against the misuse of self-control or leadership lies in the vision and intelligence of its members . They must have the vision to see and feel what the community needs to have them see and feel ; so that ideals of order and cleanness and upbuilding which tend to carry them forward will have a stronger and more constant appeal than the mere animal instincts which tend to carry them backward . And they must have intelligence to know how these ideals are to be compassed ; so that the pursuit of their visions will lead them and their followers in the general direction in which they want to go ? not backward into the wilderness but forward into the promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give the name imagination ; to the habit by which intelligence is acquired we give the name of thinking . These habits are what the nations of Europe and America have had to learn , gradually and painfully ; these are what their individual members have had to learn , in order to fit themselves for citizenship in the free communities of the modern world . To help in the difficult process of learning these habits , nations have developed many kinds of educational agencies . For teaching habits of order or decency , we have the family and the police . For teaching habits of prudence we have private property . For teaching habits of imagination , in the largest and truest sense of the word , we have the theater , the press , and the church . And for teaching habits of thinking we have the schools . Of course these several fields of training are hard to define accurately ; and the separate agencies will often overlap one another in their educational work . The schools have a good deal to do in teaching order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from families which can not do their work as well as it needs to be done , and partly because there are some principles of social order and decency which can be learned more easily by large groups of children than by small ones . For somewhat similar reasons a good school will do a good deal of incidental work in training the imagination . But the primary duty of the school is to teach the habit and train the powers of thinking ; and if it neglects this for the sake of its secondary functions , it throws the whole educational system of society as completely out of gear as does the church when it is more occupied in teaching people what they should think than in inspiring them with its ideals , or as does the police when it is so overloaded with other duties that it fails to keep order effectively . But how shall we go to work to teach the habit and train the powers of thinking ? In answering this question American school boards and American public opinion have been constantly led astray by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word education . Nine people out of ten believe that the way to train a boy to think is to impart as much knowledge to him as possible . They do not distinguish between the possession of information and the power or habit of thought ; or at any rate they assume that if you can secure the former , the latter follows as a matter of course . In no other field of life do we meet this confusion . No sensible man could think that the way to train a boy to ride was to give him as many horses as possible , or that if you could secure the necessary horses the riding would follow as a matter of course . And yet this way of looking at things would be as near the truth about riding as it is about  | thinking . The impulse to ride is certainly quite as universal as the impulse to think . The horse furnishes the necessary basis for the rider , just as the knowledge furnishes the necessary basis for the thinker . But this does not mean that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , or as much knowledge , as he can possibly want . It is better to let him really learn to ride on one or two horses ? borrowed ones if necessary ? and fill his stable afterward withV such animals as best suit his purposes . It is better to let him really learn to think on one or two subjects ? subjects which he is very likely going to forget all about ? and afterward fill his mind , or even his library shelves , with the precise information which he is going to use . Perhaps I seem to be wasting time over this point ; but its importance has been brought home to me by personal experience . During each year of my life as a college president , scores of parents or guardians coming from the most intelligent classes of the community have asked me with apparent surprise whether the acquisition of knowledge was not the all-important end of a college course , for the sake of which the institution existed . These men knew enough to despise the futility of mere acquisition in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of scholarship the most learned man was often far from being the most useful man . But when it came to the training of their own children , they persisted in regarding the boy 's mind as a sort of reservoir , into which knowledge was to be poured by different teachers in proper proportion . What actually was the proper proportion was a question on which they differed a good deal . Some thought that their boys should learn about things they were going to use in after life , because these were what they needed to know ; others thought that they should learn about things which they were not going to use in after life , because these were what they would never learn except in college . But there was pretty nearly unanimous agreement in overvaluing the subject matter taught in the class-room , as compared with that which the boy would get for himself in college and in after life if he had formed right habits of reading or thinking . There was a discouraging failure to see that if the boy was to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he must work for it himself , and his father must expect him to work for it . A good teacher can show him how to work to the best advantage and save waste effort ; he can speed up the educational process by warning against false starts and unnecessary experiments ; but in learning to do anything , whether to ride or to think , the boy is the active agent ; the teacher is only the director or at best the inspirer . Doing can be learned only by doing . Through our failure to understand some of these cardinal principles , the history of American education represents the confused result of a series of cross-currents of opinion , in the teaching profession and outside of it , rather than a progressive approach toward a welldefined goal of public policy . In the early years of the republic , our American schools taught only a few things . Most of their pupils got no farther than the " three R 's " ? reading , writing , and arithmetic . Those who could add a little grammar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might count themselves fortunate . Even in college this limited scheme of studies was not very much widened . The only real change was that the reading lessons were in Latin or Greek instead of in English , and that " problems " in Algebra or Trigonometry took the place of " sums " in Arithmetic . To the modern critic , this curriculum seems poor and barren . Yet with all its poverty and barrenness , the education of our grandfathers had two great advantages which went far to balance its defects . In the first place it taught  | the boys habits of hard work . Whether they were writing English , or translating Greek , or solving problems in mathematics , they were doing something themselves , and usually something pretty hard , without getting very much help from the teacher ? unless you call it " help " to have a prospect of being punished if the work is not done . In this school of hardship , habits were formed which enabled men to do difficult things for the sake of a remote end . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said one of the best operating men in the country , " I prefer one who has had the old-fashioned training in Greek ; because he is accustomed to work hard to find exactly what a writer says . If he has handled a Greek dictionary to any purpose , he does not expect a book to be easy , or think that he can guess what it means with any chance of coming out right . " This was one thing which our grandfathers were taught ; and they were also taught to regard the school or college course as the beginning of their education rather than the end of it . The actual knowledge which they learned was moderate in amount and slight in human interest . What the school or college did for them was to place instruments in their hands by whose use they could teach themselves the things they needed to know . The man who could read could inform himself on public affairs . The man who could read , write , and reckon could do his share of the world 's business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the handling of property . The fact that the pursuit of practical knowledge was an " extra-curriculum activity " did not prevent our grandfathers from getting such knowledge . For a boy with a taste for books , under a teacher who knew how to reward as well as to punish , the old system was a good one . Many of the academies of Central New York in the early years of the nineteenth century developed among their pupils a proportion trained for the successful pursuit of science or letters which a modern high school with wider curriculum and larger appliances might well envy . But there are unfortunately a great many boys with little taste for books as books ; and with such boys it took a very good teacher indeed to prevent the old system from degenerating into a treadmill , where the scholars hated the work so much that it never helped them to form a habit of reading or study . To meet the needs of this wider group of students was the goal of most of our educational reformers of the nineteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of professional schools of medicine , theology , law , and applied science , where a man could be taught some of the things which he needed for the practice of his calling . The second step was the introduction of similar subjects into the curriculum of the colleges themselves ? usually in the form of brief lecture courses or recitations from a text-book ? so that the student might get a taste of as many kinds of knowledge as possible . The third step was the extension of these ideas downward into the high schools , and in some degree into the common schools , so that every pupil had the chance to learn something of the results of modern science , and to ground himself in subjects of practical value like bookkeeping. , The fourth step was the development of the laboratory method in its varied forms , in which the student gained his knowledge and his habits of thought by seeing and handling things instead of reading about them . The fifth step was the acceptance of the elective system . The numbers of subjects introduced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible to allow adequate time for the thorough mastery of any . The student was therefore given constantly increasing opportunity to make a choice of a few subjects out of the large numbers offered , and was encouraged to select those which he liked best .  | The order in which these steps were taken differed somewhat in different places ; but the general movement , and its results for good or for evil , were felt in pretty much the same way throughout the whole country . On the whole , the good vastly outweighed the evil . The schools of 1875 aroused more interest , taught more knowledge , and gave more of the rather indefinable thing which we call culture than those of 1800 ever thought of doing . But there is a less bright side to the picture of which something has already been said at the beginning of this article . Our nineteenthcentury courses of study did not always develop the habit and power of independent thinking among their students in the same way that they developed their interest and increased their knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were designed to give the pupil information . The curricula of the colleges and high schools were arranged with the same dominant purpose . Anybody who asked about the disciplinary value of a study was regarded as hopelessly oldfashioned . But the old fashion had a good deal of right on its side . Real thinking is hard work . It is a serious discipline to form the habit ; it requires a disciplined mind to keep it up . If a pupil in a kindergarten has been led to confuse work with play , and told to stop when he begins to get tired , it will not be easy for him ever to acquire that discipline . If a college student is encouraged to elect only the things that interest him , there is great danger that he will find no interest in the hard parts of thinking ? examination of evidence , testing of hypotheses , rigid insistence on logic ? and will choose the easy road to knowledge rather than the hard road to power . During the last forty or fifty years we have begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer make lectures or text-books their chief reliance , but try from the outset to train their pupils in the habits of thought which will equip them for their profession . The most progressive colleges have abandoned the principle of indiscriminate election , and insist on choice of groups of subjects whose study shall fit a man to do something . The proper use of the laboratory as a place of research or of manual training is being separated from its improper use as an advanced kindergarten . The best examiners are no longer satisfied to make their papers tests of knowledge , and are trying to make them tests of power . The type of education which we had inherited from the eighteenth century taught boys and girls what intellectual work meant ; but it gave them so few subjects of human interest to think about that they did not generally acquire the habit of thinking , except on practical matters of business or politics which came immediately before their eyes in after life . The type of education which we developed in the first three quarters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of human interest in great abundance ; but it gave the majority of the pupils no idea of the hard work in the way of intellectual effort and self-control , which was involved in really thinking about them . It made the mistake of assuming that the imparting of knowledge was the main thing that society required of the schools ; that the more knowledge you gave , and the easier you made it for the pupils to get it , the better it was . But if we can bring our minds back to the public purpose of education we shall see that much of this nineteenthcentury effort went wide of the mark . Society is not concerned with what its members know , but with the use they can make of their knowledge . It wants men who can verify information , see what bearing it has on their own conduct , and act accordingly . This is thinking , in the practical sense of the word ; and the habit of thinking in this sense is the thing that it is vitally essential  | to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The acquisition of knowledge is generally a good thing , just as the acquisition of property is generally a good thing . But if a man who has not learned business habits acquires a great deal of property with comparatively little effort on his own part , it seldom does much good , either to him or to society , and often does a good deal of harm ; and the same thing appears to be true of knowledge . But , some one will say , " Where will the people get their knowledge if not in the schools ? " They will get it in the same way that they now get ninetenths of it : through observing what they see , listening to what they hear , and reading what they require in books and periodicals . The thing for the schools to do is to teach them to observe and listen , and above all else to read . Before the art of printing was invented the teacher had to give his pupils the information they needed ; now that we have books and newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it and get it right . He can not train the boy to compete with the encyclopaedia ; he can train him to use the encyclopaedia . If parents and teachers can once recognize that it is the business of the student to get the information and of the teacher to show him how , we shall have laid the foundation for a twentiethcentury school system which shall combine the merits of both of those which have preceded it . For the boy who has formed the habit of reading what interests him with care and attention finds it easy to keep up the habit of thinking about it . If the pupil is expected to read things for himself , we can cut from our high schools and colleges nearly all these courses whose primary object is to give information , and concentrate the teacher 's power in helping his pupils to do their own reading and thinking to the best advantage . We can not well remove all information courses from our primary schools or the grammar schools ; partly because the children in the lower grades have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be expected to get all their information from the printed page , and partly because information courses , in the hands of a good teacher , may be made an effective means in helping to form habits of order and of imagination which are quite as important for the very young pupils as habits of thinking . But if we can reduce them to a minimum in the high schools and take them wholly out of the curriculum in the colleges , we shall cut down the cost of education at a point where it is now very large , both in the aggregate and per capita . We can not put everybody through a single course of study as our grandfathers tried to do ; for there are three or four different types of mind that have to be reached by different methods and developed in different ways . But we can do away with the idea that each student must have a chance to learn the particular subject he is going to use in after life , and substitute the better and more economical plan of training him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he probably will not use . We can train him for the kind of profession for which he is fitted instead of attempting to forestall the professional school or the office in teaching him the details of its practice . But what of the boy who , when he reaches high-school or college age , is too lazy or too uninterested to do his own part in his education , and get the necessary information by reading ? To this question there is but one answer . Take him out of school and set him to work . I am afraid that this suggestion will provoke a good deal of adverse criticism . There is a general feeling that education is so good a thing , and indoor work in shops so undesirable for growing boys and girls , that we ought to try to keep everybody in school , as far as we can , till the age of sixteen or seventeen . If going to school means education in the full and proper sense of the word ,  | as distinct from merely sitting at a desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the student is going to evade doing his part in his own education , then I say that it is better for him to work nine hours in a shop than to shirk five hours , play two hours and loaf two hours ? which is about what he generally does if compelled to go to a school where he does not pull his weight in the boat . And it is not only better for him ; it is infinitely better for the other pupils and for the teachers . By taking away two or three members who are a drag upon the whole body we allow far more education to be given to all the others with far less waste effort . Even if the transfer of a considerable number of young people from the school to the shop should make it necessary to have a somewhat increased force of factory inspectors , it would be far cheaper for society to employ that agency than to make use of the public school system as an asylum for the willfully uninterested . Higher education at public expense should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to be abused . Some progressive nations have gone even farther than this . In all commercial and technical courses in German high schools a small fee has been charged , which was not remitted except as a prize for conspicuously good and faithful work . The Germans did not adopt this practice for the sake of the income which it brings in ? in fact , the sum charged represents less than a quarter of the expense of the instruction ? but because the fact of having to pay a fee prevented a boy from choosing a course for which he had no special fitness , and made sure that both he and his parents would co-operate with the teachers to see that he got his money 's worth . The efficiency of the course was thus trebled or quadrupled . Whether we are prepared to go as far as this or not , it offers us a lesson which is worth considering . For the usefulness of a school or college education depends in the last resort upon the mental attitude of the student , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thus defines education , emphasizes its public purpose , and relieves the teacher from responsibilities which properly belong to the student promises not only to increase the efficiency of our school system but also to solve the salary problem in a way satisfactory to both teacher and taxpayer . For a reduction in the number of subjects taught means fewer teachers and larger average classes . The active co-operation of the pupil and the elimination of the shirker mean that these large classes can be handled with better effect than at present . The benefit of this increased efficiency can be so shared between teachers and taxpayers that we can pay decidedly increased salaries from a somewhat lower aggregate budget . By securing these reforms we could , for the first time in many years , claim to have put our school system on an economic basis ; for we should be employing our teachers under conditions which make for maximum efficiency in their work and maximum value of their product .  |                  @ @ @
