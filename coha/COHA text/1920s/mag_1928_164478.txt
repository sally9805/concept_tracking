Patriots boiled last week over a stricture passed by Captain Charles W. R. Knight , British ornithologist . Captain Knight had been making money in the U. S. with a cinema-and-lecture on eagles . Scrutinizing a U. S. coin he had observed that the bald-headed or American eagle depicted thereon was " just taking off instead of in full flight . " <P> He said : " When the American eagle has gained its ascendancy , as your great country has , its talons are tucked up underneath its body and not stretched out like a duck 's feet . It is the symbol of might and dignity and yet the designer has given the grand old bird the feet of a duck . " <P> Patriots boiled , not at politely perspicacious Ornithologist Knight , but at poetically licentious Hermon MacNeil , designer of the eagle which has been stamped on U. S. quarter-dollars since 1916 . " Feet of a duck ! " patriots muttered . " Designer MacNeil should be shown a flying eagle and made to try again ! "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
