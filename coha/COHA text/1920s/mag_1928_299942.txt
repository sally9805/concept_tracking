As a result , people are more surprised than otherwise when they discover , in Hoover speeches or reports or quoted from personal correspondence , sentences and sentiments which have unmistakably come from the natural man who lives somewhere inside the Beaver Man . <P> Currently published is a book which contains , besides a sketchy but competent Hoover biography , a section of Hoover quotations and excerpts of the unfamiliar sort . They are not abundant . They include , of course , part of the famed Hoover essay , " In Praise of Izaak Walton , " published last year in the Atlantic Monthly ( TIME , June 6 , 1927 ) . There is also the familiar bit about " Main Street Under Water " ( the Mississippi flood ) . <P> But there are also bits of such as the following , from a letter written by Mr. Hoover to a friend to " answer some of the solemn discourses on my private life and crimes " : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful inquiries and I regret that so far I can not find : ( a ) The $10,000,000 I am said to have made in my early youth , or even middle age , or altogether , or any respectable part of it .

The hope to rise from the ranks of labor to the ranks of management will , however , probably not be crushed from the heart of the American boy even by this onslaught .
