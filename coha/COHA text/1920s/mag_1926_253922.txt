A good way to seize the Government of Greece is first to occupy the central telegraph office at Athens with a handful of men . The operators should be forced to announce that the Government has been seized , and to demand expressions of loyalty to the new regime from the provincial authorities . With these pledges of support in his pocket almost any potent Greek can declare himself Dictator . General Theodore Pangalos seized power in exactly this way ( TIME , July 6 , 1925 ) , and held on for 13 months . His successor , General Kondylis , accomplished his coup by methods equally simple and unconstitutional ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) . Therefore sophisticated persons were not surprised to learn that while riots and rebellious outbursts occurred generally throughout Athens last week they were most frequent near the central telegraph office . <P> Those who held the Office successfully throughout the week were adherents of Dictator Kondylis . Early in the week Colonel Zeryas , commander of the Republican Guard which had been supporting General Kondylis , strode into the new Dictator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as their wages for deserting General Pangalos . Dictator Kondylis refused the Colonel 's demand . Colonel Zervas , vexed , grew purple , spat in the General 's face , cried : " I made you Dictator and I can unmake you ! . . . " <P> Within a few hours Colonel Zervas and the Republican Guard were advancing upon Athens with two tanks . Ammunition stored in one of the tanks exploded , killing its crew and several bystanders . A pitched battle in which some 50 persons were killed ensued up and down the Kifissia Boulevard . At last Dictator Kondylis announced from the justly suspected telegraph office : " Athens is quiet , and the situation is well in hand . " A subsequent despatch told of reports that the Royalist leader Colonel Plastiras was marching upon Athens with intent to coup . <P> Meanwhile the only man in Athens who was not greatly flurried by events was old Paul Koundouriotis , recalled to the " Provisional Presidency " of the purely hypothetical " Hellenic Republic " by Dictator Kondylis . Admiral Koundouriotis , 71 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figurehead of Greece since the departure of King George II from Athens ( TIME , Dec. 31 , 1923 ) . For a time the hard-boiled adventurers who are exploiting Greece dubbed the Admiral , " Regent . " Two years ago he was styled " Provisional President , " and during the last few months of the Pangalos regime he was forced to resign and suffered an eclipse which is now styled " illegal . " What manner of man is he ? <P> Born on the Island of Hydra in 1855 , he adopted a naval career in his earliest youth , and rose to the distinction of twice defeating the Turkish fleet during the Balkan War of 1912-13 . An adherent of Diplomat Venizelos , he shared the fortunes of that statesman until the <P> Greek Parliament raised him above common strife by creating him in 1919 , " Grand Admiral for life . " Thus bedizened with a not easily tarnishable prestige the old Admiral continues to serve his country as an official adornment of certified quality .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
