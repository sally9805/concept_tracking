As statistics on business continue to come in , it is apparent that the months of February and March this year marked a " peak " in the most active industries . April has seen a consistent decline in the basic industries , particularly iron and steel , and the assumption now seems to be for a quiet Summer , with a possible rally in the markets in the Fall if the likelihood for Mr. Coolidge 's re-election is strong . <P> Just at present certain industries are very sick-the leather , textile and fertilizer lines are examples . Other industries are not well , and will presumably be worse before they are better ; these include iron and steel , high cost copper properties , automobiles and railroad equipment . Still other industries , like the oils , have been sick and are now getting through their convalescent period . The whole question is whether the present recession in business will broaden and lengthen into a depression , or prove only a slight halt in operations . When things get bluest will be the time to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived .
