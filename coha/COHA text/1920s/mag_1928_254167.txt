About five years ago the weasel-eyed gamblers who interest themselves in boxing , baseball , racing , first turned attention to golf . Last week in the lobbies of the Chicago hotels where the players were staying , and out at the Olympia Fields course the bookmakers were giving odds : Bobby Jones 3 to i to win the National Open championship for the third time ; Walter Hagen , 5 to 1 ; John Farrell , 8 to 1 ; last year 's champion Tommy Armour , 8 to 1 ; Archie Compston , 10 to 1 . All the other players , except Sarazen , were at long odds , for no single golfer taken against the field , against the difficulties of the course , of competition and the tension of his own nerves , has much chance to win the National Open . <P> Only once in ten years an unknown player finishes in front . Few had heard of Sarazen when he won ; no one had heard of Hagen when he came to fame in 1914 . Practically unknown were the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest . Henry Guici was one , a tiny player , dark-haired , quick-tempered . Frank Ball tied Guici with a 70 . No one knew anything about him except that he was a cousin of John Ball , famed Britisher . Either Guici or Ball might win , of course , but the bookmakers did n't think so . And the bookmakers were right , for on the second day Guici and Ball dropped back and the favorites moved in to their expected places : Jones at the top , Hagen near the top and playing brilliantly . <P> Many things had happened in those early rounds . Tommy Armour was out of it ; Boomer and Compston , the Englishmen , were out of it , far down the list ; MacFarlane was barely in the running . Maurice McCarthy , young amateur , paired with Hagen , was taking eights and tens ; Chick Evans , once champion , scored a 90 . Al Watrous , wild as a hawk , hit a spectator in the stomach with a pitch shot ; Sarazen went to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second to Jones and Walter Hagen after a first round of 40 played the last nine in 36 in the rain . <P> It seemed then that the tournament had turned into a private match between Jones and Hagen . People who had hoped Farrell would do something were disappointed . They pointed out that Farrell , always sensitive , had been made self-conscious by being elected the best dressed* professional golfer for the second year in succession . They said that he had been unlucky in being paired with Jones , who was followed by such a big gallery that Farrell was forced at times to beg the marshals to clear a lane for him to swing his club in . When the third round began , Farrell was seven strokes behind . <P> And here once more an unknown golfer became dangerous . Farrell had finished a sensational round that left him in a tie with Jones at 294 and beat Hagen who had 296 , when news came to the clubhouse that one Roland Hancock , 200-pound 22-year-old son of a Wilmington , N. C. , professional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of everybody . Hancock took a five at the tenth , then played par golf until at the seventeenth green he saw the crowd billowing over the turf to meet him and escort him back the new champion . With ten thousand people milling around him he sliced his teeshot into some heavy loam behind a tree , caught the rough with his pitch , put his third over the green , took a six . On the eighteenth he had another six .
