txt New York was thrilled by a blazing spectacle of rare beauty tonight when the highest fire of history raged in the scaffolding at the pinnacle of the new thirty-eight story Sherry-Netherland apartment hotel , Stli avenue and 69th street . The fire finally was stopped after it had burned down to the twenty-third floor . Blazing timbers from the tower showered the streets or fell to the roofs of near-by structures . Firemen were almost helpless against the fire , for they could get little water to it . They played feeble streams from the roofs of adjoining buildings to the lower sections of the great structure , but could get no water to the scaffolding itself . They were compelled to watch the top burn itself out . Rain of Fire on Firemen . The firemen worked In imminent danger as burning beams broke loose from the . side of the building and began their descent 600 feet above the street , erashing.ao the pavement or adjoining roofs . Uncounted thousand s ? probably hundreds of . thousands  --  saw the spectacle . ' Central park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women . Traffic in Fifth avenue , Madison avenue all the nearby streets was blocked and , the streets were thick With spectators . The windows of the Hotel Plaza , diagonally across from the burning tower , were black with people . The tower , blazing like a lofty Roman candle , was visible for miles . Roofs Endangered for Blocks . Burning timbers and embers fell over an area of some six or eight blocks , and every roof within this zone was covered by firemen , who dodged the blazing projectiles , then put out the incipient fires . The storm of firebrands , like the white ashes from an erupting volcano , . fell steadily on the roof of the Metropolitan club . The spired roof of the home of the late Elbrldgo T. Gerry , at Gist street , also was subjected to co. caslonal batterings by burning beams .
