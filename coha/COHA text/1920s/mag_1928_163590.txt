Congressmen do their hardest , most important work off the floor . The real storm centre of Flood Control last week , was in the House Committee room where the irresistible legislative urge was encountering the immovable Coolidge ultimatum ( see p. 8 ) . On the floor of the House , pending the Bill 's actual reading , the debate was general . It became more general when stentorian Mr. Schafer of Wisconsin arose and pointing his large finger at a puffy , untidy figure in one of the back seats , demanded to know what he was doing there . <P> The figure was William Lorimer , once known as " the Blond Boss of Chicago , " whose reception with other Flood lobbyists at the White House last autumn stirred up such an indignant buzz among fastidious citizens ( TIME , Nov. 21 ) . For 12 years ( 1895-1901 ; 1903-1909 ) , Mr. Lorimer was a U. S. Representative . Then for bribery in his election , he was as Mr. Schafer bluntly put it " kicked out of the Senate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political disrepute , should not be privileged to come back and sit in the House during a debate on Flood Control , for the reason that Mr. Lorimer was personally interested in Flood Control . His William Lorimer Lumber Co. owns land in the area where the U. S. was to buy floodways under the terms of the pending Bill . Let Mr. Lorimer get out , roared Mr. Schafer . <P> Mr. Lorimer listened , hand cupped to ear . Members jumped up to remonstrate with Mr. Schafer . Mr. Sproul of Illinois demanded that Mr. Schafer 's words be stricken from the record . Mr. Schafer refused . A knot of members surrounded Mr. Schafer while his remarks were being transcribed by the clerk . Finally " to save time " Mr. Schafer withdrew what he had said . <P> Off the floor of the House , where he could defend himself , the aging blond boss explained that his lumber company owned only 1,000 acres in the proposed floodway ; that flood waters neither harmed nor helped his timber ; that he was not seeking to sell anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he had been interested in flood control work for 30 years .
