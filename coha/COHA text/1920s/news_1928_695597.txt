His vigor , his frankness , his instinctive attitude of regarding nothing alien to him. which is " human were disclosed in their full measure for the first time . And with them he united a boldness in political leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He exemplified time after time what EMERSON said of the ability of a man of native strength to work his will even amid the oldest and moldiest conventions . Consider what the Smith leadership did with the Democratic Party . It lifted from it the incubus of two proscriptions . One was that a Southern man could not be placed on the Presidential ticket . For the first time since the Civil War -- which ended sixty-three years ago ? a political party has dared along with Governor SMITH to nominate a Southerner for Vice President . This knocks flat a barrier which will never be raised again . Even more important was the change in the miserable tradition that a Catholic must not be named for President of the United States . In 1924 that writ ran against Governor SMITH , but by 1928 it was torn up . CHARLES SUMNER once declared indignantly that he was a man before he was a Commissioner .

And he did it by proposing to make protection more universal and equitable . Out of its professed scope the Republicans had left the farmers . Governor SMITH would bring them . within it . Here was another piece of political strategy , like his stand on prohibition , entirely due to his - initiative and daring . The Republicans found soon that they must put forth their . best endeavors if they were to hope to defeat a man of such political skill and personal charm . It was this last , after all , that most strongly marked out Governor SMITH in the Presidential campaign , and made it easy for him , in. touch with the vast multitudes which thronged to see him , to capture their imagination .
