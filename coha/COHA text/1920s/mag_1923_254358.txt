Mrs. Gifford Pinchot , having drawn breath after the whirlwind campaign that made her husband Governor of Pennsylvania , went to Washington with a plan . <P> " Let the women of a state or other unit area take charge of prohibition enforcement , " she urged President Harding . " Let them take charge from top to bottom , as an experiment , and see if women are not more zealous for enforcement than men . " <P> President Harding thinks enough of the proposal to have it referred to the Prohibition Bureau , where it may have effect despite rough-and-ready opposition . <P> Mrs. Pinchot does not claim absolute honesty for all women , but she told the President she believed " there are available 1,000 to 50,000 women who are unbribable . And they are more prejudiced in favor of prohibition than men . "
